            <li>and I am thrilled to say, GET this product!</li>
            <li>It seems, farmers of Scandinavian descent, fair skinned and prone to skin cancers, used a home remedy successfully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results of the bloodroot .</li>
            <li>I would advise to you to keep the area very clean and you will have great results at your own risk of course..</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and it works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>those who get hormonal cystic acne will know how amazing that is.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>it was amazing and worked</li>
            <li>Will wait to see if this changes, but if it doesn&#x27;t, it still is an amazing improvement.</li>
            <li>Plan to grow my own.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more believing it would be a nice addition to my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>absolutely cannot believe that people have rated this stuff good!  </li>
            <li>It removes moles, cysts, and more.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find this product and have in my medicine chest.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply twice, its potent stuff.</li>
            <li>It burns healthy skin, leaving a scar.</li>
            <li>It was a salve that destroyed the cancer without harming any healthy tissue.</li>
            <li>I received this quickly on both orders and have nothing but praises for the salve!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>BUT, He confirmed that I indeed get rid of 98% of my skin cancers</li>
            <li>Still working with it after 3 weeks, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that at the end  both problems will be taken care of.  </li>
            <li>I tried many things from acne creams/scrubs to hot rags and castor oil.</li>
            <li>Yes it really hurt, but I was glad to be rid of it because I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years.</li>
            <li>There were three dents in my skin that looked like a freshly made grave.</li>
            <li>After a while the eggs hatch and after a while they mature and lay more eggs.</li>
            <li>I believe this stuff works good if used carefully.</li>
            <li>After a week the tumor fell completely off not harming any of her healthy skin or tissue.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, the salve arrived far ahead of schedule (in fact, days ahead of another, in-country order</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The lesion fell off leaving good pink tissue underneath.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>FYI: Follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Scab fell off after exactly two weeks.</li>
            <li>When placed on a spot that is cancerous, this product is very aggressive!  </li>
            <li>And it reddened and created a tiny opening in the healthy skin around the wart.  </li>
            <li>An incredible amount of yellowish, fatty substance has been brought to the surface, and I should be done working with it in a few more days.  </li>
            <li>I just used this salve for the first time an</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s fascinating is that each time it carved out a perfectly round circle too.</li>
            <li>When I first applied, it didnt really do anything.  </li>
            <li>During certain times of the month the bump would enlarge to an embarrassing size.</li>
            <li>My friends ask why do I keep applying more bloodroot because my nose looks better without the big black scab.</li>
            <li>Two flat moles were removed easily with this.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I was really worried.  </li>
            <li>Pink, healthy gap underneath.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much of anything</li>
            <li>I checked with a doctor friend of mine who is very involved in alternative medicines.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it and the seller!   </li>
            <li>That why it hurts so much in usage</li>
            <li>so where is this remedy now and why don&#x27;t doctors use it, instead of surgery, radiation, etc.?&amp;#34; He didn&#x27;t really have an answer.  </li>
            <li>(Just wonder if there are any special benefits due to the product being: \\&quot;Hand Blended in a clean house</li>
            <li>I tried many herbal remedies and other potions without any luck.</li>
            <li>and I am 100% grateful for this in removing the skin cancers that developed after my first treatments in September</li>
            <li>I love it,did exactly what it said it would.used on my face right by my left eye,did hurt a little for 2 days made a sore</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like it locally, as the American bloodroot</li>
            <li>Very surprised!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Excellent, was painful</li>
            <li>Normally, it can take up to a week for these things to come to the surface,</li>
            <li>and I was walking normally.</li>
            <li>This should be completely banned, it&#x27;s like acid!</li>
            <li>It only tingled the first day or so.  </li>
            <li>Later I treated a smaller spot just under my Adam&#x27;s apple, a more sensitive area, a stronger burning sensation, but with the same miraculous healing result.</li>
            <li>Follow instructions and expect action.  </li>
            <li>It is completely gone,</li>
            <li>In a week, this old mole will be gone.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Would not use anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li>It got so red and swollen and itched so much that I had to use my dad&#x27;s crutches to walk.</li>
            <li>The hole magically closed up on its own about a week after the dead tissue with the cyst came off of</li>
            <li>About 10 days to remove this tumor seems quite reasonable for such a minor price.  .</li>
            <li>It burned a hole in my skin - so far the mole hasn&#x27;t come back, but it&#x27;s needing a lot of scar repair TLC and cremes and whatnot.</li>
            <li>The marks on my dog go through all the stages as illustrated and then heal with barely a scar.  </li>
            <li>But be aware, the doctor can make a mess of you too.</li>
            <li>painful the whole time, and then there are about three more interminable phases to live through.  </li>
            <li>Turns out he was very familiar with this product and swore by it, promising me it would work miracles on removing diseased cells from the skin.</li>
            <li>Before I tried the second time, I scrubbed them both before hand, and apparently that did the trick.  </li>

            <li> Before I tried the second time, I scrubbed them both before hand, and apparently that did the trick.  </li>
            <li> On the right side was a pencil eraser sized  dark spot and two smaller dark spots had recently appeared.</li>
            <li> After 10 days the area is flat and no longer itchy.</li>
            <li> The area, about 3/4 inch diameter, remained red, raised, dry, flaky, and itchy.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been using it for several months and have not had to have my dog&#x27;s cancer removed surgically as I have in the past.  </li>
            <li> Next I&#x27;m going to try it on a mystery bump that never wants to surface.  </li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I put it on a strange looking mole.</li>
            <li> I am seriously doubting the veracity and validity of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes popping and releasing blood and pus but always downsizing to a small bump only to enlarge later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d placed for a different product -- that one, coming from only a few states away, took another week to arrive!)  </li>
            <li> I left it on a little over 12 horus and it was burning and swollen by that time, so</li>
            <li> but I expected that.</li>
            <li> It only took a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only took a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful using this stuff.</li>
            <li> The area is still pink in comparison to nearby skin.</li>
            <li> drawing salve seems too diluted and not strong enough.</li>
            <li> crazy powerful stuff....CRAZY!</li>
            <li> but now just a small pink spot 3 week&#x27;s later.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the itchy bumps that flare up and hurt sometimes when I&#x27;m extremely stressed out, which is when they bother me the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the included directions, I applied this to an itchy and rough dark spot on my forehead.</li>
            <li> The bloodroot salve worked just as described by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> be very careful in amount</li>
            <li> Can be painful if you get it in an open sore, but for me, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It will cause an angry red spot, a scab, and some swelling, before it starts to clear.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well this product worked and how fast with such a small amount!!!!</li>
            <li> One looked like a small S shaped worm about half inch long.</li>
            <li> The salve created a large painful open wound that took months to heal.  </li>
            <li> My arm was tender and sore and noticeably swollen and red during almost the entire time and sleeping was difficult w/ the pain.  </li>
            <li> I tried another black salve brand, but it didn&#x27;t work like this one does.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This salve did not work like the black salve I used to buy.</li>
            <li> By morning, the deep, painful acne that was brewing had been brought to a painless, tiny kernel of easily-extracted sebum and, an hour or two later, it was like nothing had been there.  </li>
            <li> Not a good idea to order stuff offline to put on your body especially if its coming from another country because you recall</li>
            <li> and in 24 hrs the area was a little swollen and tender</li>
            <li> Little story.  </li>
            <li> Two days later, no more itch, no more swelling, no more crutches</li>
            <li> When it finally healed, the lump was still there, and in addition, there was scarring on the skin, so it now looks worse than before it was treated.</li>
            <li> I just added E oil and changed the bandaged everyday, sometimes washed w/ peroxide.  </li>
            <li> Soon the scab dried out and fell off by itself.  </li>
            <li> Once received I didn&#x27;t waste any time in applying it to my bump.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically to see if it could remove a wart that I&#x27;ve struggled with for three years, and a fatty tumor on my thigh.  </li>
            <li> The jury is still out on the fatty tumor, as I am still working with the product.  </li>
            <li> My husband had a mole on his wrist that he &amp;#34;manually&amp;#34; removed a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It looked &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34;, weeping for a few days.</li>

            <li> Excellent, was painful but I expected that. If you cant take the pain it may not be for you, but what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Had a deep cystic situation in the evening, and put on the bloodroot salve before bed.  By morning, the deep, painful acne that was brewing had been brought to a painless, tiny kernel of easily-extracted sebum and, an hour or two later, it was like nothing had been there.  Quite remarkable--those who get hormonal cystic acne will know how amazing that is.  Normally, it can take up to a week for these things to come to the surface, painful the whole time, and then there are about three more interminable phases to live through.  BUY THIS.  Next I&#x27;m going to try it on a mystery bump that never wants to surface.  I&#x27;m cleaning house!</li>
            <li> I used this on a small (less than a quarter inch) lump om my skin.  The salve created a large painful open wound that took months to heal.  When it finally healed, the lump was still there, and in addition, there was scarring on the skin, so it now looks worse than before it was treated.</li>
            <li> Follow instructions and expect action.  Sebacious cyst became infected, so I had a good-sized boil under a  cyst.  Still working with it after 3 weeks, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that at the end  both problems will be taken care of.  Plan to grow my own.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;AVOID AT ALL COSTS&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely cannot believe that people have rated this stuff good!  This should be completely banned, it&#x27;s like acid! I stupidly used this on myself, my daughters stubborn spot, my partner and even my pet dogs cyst,  we have all been severely burned and my daughter has now been left with a very deep hole in her forehead! I didn&#x27;t think any organic herbal/natural product could do this and I am totally shocked and fuming!&lt;br /&gt;There have been loads of complaints and court reports from people that have been harmed by this corrosive stuff....</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.  It removes moles, cysts, and more.  Can be painful if you get it in an open sore, but for me, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This really works. MY husband had a lump on his face for almost two years. It showed up after gettting bit by something on a hunting trip and just would not go away. We tried all kinds of things and when he would shave it would rip open and then scab and then come back. I put this on his face and it formed a scab that fell off after a week. He now has no trace of the lump at all. It is completely gone,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this stuff works. I tried it on 4 spots, including a scar. Two flat moles were removed easily with this. It worked on everything but the scar, which was my &#x27;control&#x27;. What&#x27;s fascinating is that each time it carved out a perfectly round circle too. This stuff even took out a cyst beneath the skin (pencil eraser size) on my thigh that was itchy. I swear it even had roots! It left a hole about the size of a dime on my thigh. Yes it really hurt, but I was glad to be rid of it because I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years. The hole magically closed up on its own about a week after the dead tissue with the cyst came off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have insurance, so this is a godsend. Doctors don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing nowadays unless they&#x27;re setting a bone. I even had a dermatologist look at a few of these bumps and the idiot told me to use benzoyl peroxide on them, which did nothing but bleach my clothes. This salve got rid of these bumps, which were beneath the skin. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the itchy bumps that flare up and hurt sometimes when I&#x27;m extremely stressed out, which is when they bother me the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of this stuff. I want to stock up before the government finds a way to ban this product and pull it off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this product and have in my medicine chest. Thank you.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IS ACID. Do your research!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely dangerous.  I am seriously doubting the veracity and validity of the positive reviews.  Please, read about it elsewhere. There is an excellent page on Quackwatch:  [...], with pictures of the damage it can do.  This is serious!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and it works exactly as stated. Highly recommend . Came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Product was as it should be.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.  When I first applied, it didnt really do anything.  I had one weird pink flesh colored bump and another mole that was starting to change and become painful (elbow area).  Before I tried the second time, I scrubbed them both before hand, and apparently that did the trick.  It only tingled the first day or so.  I left it on a little over 12 horus and it was burning and swollen by that time, so I was relieved to wash it off.  I was really worried.  They both hurt and oozed for days, despite washing it off.  Lots of aching and pain, especially in the mole.  I just added E oil and changed the bandaged everyday, sometimes washed w/ peroxide.  Well, after 8 days or so, I went to change the bandage and these two ugly divots come out on the bandages.  I mean it was very disgusting.  Pink, healthy gap underneath.  It worked just like they said.  I am really glad I tried it.  I only caution that you think a lot about what you will be doing for the next couple weeks, if you try.  My arm was tender and sore and noticeably swollen and red during almost the entire time and sleeping was difficult w/ the pain.  Just keep that in mind!</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely did something. I put it on a strange looking mole. It didn&#x27;t do much of anything so I put it on again the next night. BIG MISTAKE. FYI: Follow the directions exactly. (Put it on, put a waterproof bandage over it and forget about it for a week or so.) Don&#x27;t apply twice, its potent stuff. It burned a hole in my skin - so far the mole hasn&#x27;t come back, but it&#x27;s needing a lot of scar repair TLC and cremes and whatnot.</li>
            <li> Using the included directions, I applied this to an itchy and rough dark spot on my forehead. Overnight, I could feel it working and in 24 hrs the area was a little swollen and tender, then a week later the scab fell off and the spot gone. No scar and you can&#x27;t even see where that spot had been.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m now removing a mole on my face with this salve. The area has turned to a white looking scab and I can feel it working and has the same swollen affect. In a week, this old mole will be gone.&lt;br /&gt; I tried another black salve brand, but it didn&#x27;t work like this one does.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I found a spot on my shoulder that itched,bled and would not heal. I tried many herbal remedies and other potions without any luck. Then I did some Googlerizing and came up with this Bloodroot Drawing Salve.  I checked with a doctor friend of mine who is very involved in alternative medicines. Turns out he was very familiar with this product and swore by it, promising me it would work miracles on removing diseased cells from the skin. So I bought the product, applied it, felt it working with a not too unpleasant burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;The area I treated was smaller than a centimeter in diameter but after the product went to work a much larger area became inflamed. I could almost feel the drawing effect as the evil octopus cell structure was pulled out and opened up for the white blood cells to attack. Yellow pus developed in the center as a scab formed. Soon the scab dried out and fell off by itself.  The evil thing was gone!  It only took a few days. Later I treated a smaller spot just under my Adam&#x27;s apple, a more sensitive area, a stronger burning sensation, but with the same miraculous healing result. This Bloodroot Drawing Salve works! (Just wonder if there are any special benefits due to the product being: \\&quot;Hand Blended in a clean house that&#x27;s smoke, child and pet free!\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> The stuff worked for me. Note: things get pretty ugly as it is going to work, creating a nasty looking wound. Would not use anywhere near my face. Scab fell off after exactly two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have never used this type of product, and, after reading a number of reports on the Internet, never will.  According to what I read, there have been no clinical trills so,there is no reliable evidence of the effectiveness or safety of blood root salves.  It burns healthy skin, leaving a scar. (see Woodie&#x27;s review)  A number of reports describe horrific results requiring extensive reconstructive surgery  You will be well advised to Google \\&quot;blood root\\&quot; and give close attention to what you find.</li>
            <li> This product is the truth it remove the mole after 3 applications and although it was painful I would use it again...I would advise to you to keep the area very clean and you will have great results at your own risk of course.. I respect the Bloodroot!!!!.</li>
            <li> Do not order thus stuff. I used as directed and it burned my back. I had to go to my dermatologist to get burn cream to heal the burns and scars are diminishing. This stuff is toxic. Not a good idea to order stuff offline to put on your body especially if its coming from another country because you recall dont know what&#x27;s in it. DONT ORDER THIS STUFF UNLESS YOY WANT TO GET BURNED LITERALLY!!!</li>
            <li> Little story.  I was thinking about the quarter sized area on my nose. On the left side were several different colors. On the right side was a pencil eraser sized  dark spot and two smaller dark spots had recently appeared. On the left side the darker colors were getting larger.  I said a prayer and ask for a remedy.  My thinking took me back to the  1960&#x27;s. I was in the military where all laundry was done in a central base laundry. I put on recently laundered socks. and during the day my ankle started to itch very badly. I had to put up with the itch till end of  12 hour shift. Two days later I went on leave. It got so red and swollen and itched so much that I had to use my dad&#x27;s crutches to walk. He sent me to a doctor who said he was concerned that the ankle was swollen and getting very cold because of poor circulation.  He put some drawing salve on it. Two days later, no more itch, no more swelling, no more crutches and I was walking normally. I believe that this led me to go to Amazon to search for drawing salve.      On October 23 I applied a liberal layer of bloodroot salve. I had fever and chills for four days and there was lots of oozing. It oozed for about 21 days. The big nose scab fell off 30 days after it was applied on 11-22-2014. There were three dents in my skin that looked like a freshly made grave. I believe this is because the worms or whatever was removed by the bloodroot salve. I believe that the bloodroot activated my immune system to kill the invaders and that is why I had fever and chills.       Nine days later on 12-2-2014 I applied another liberal layer of bloodroot. Again I had four days of fever and chills and a bunch of oozing. Thirty days later on 1-1-2015 the scab fell off leaving seven dents in the skin. Some dents where larger and some were smaller. One looked like a small S shaped worm about half inch long. On 1-3-2015 I applied another layer of blood root. There was no fever and no chills this time. Oozing stopped ten days later and the scab fell off on day twelve. The skin dents seem to have vanished this time.      My friends ask why do I keep applying more bloodroot because my nose looks better without the big black scab. The reason that I keep applying root is om an article I read about how sometimes these things lay eggs. The eggs are not affected by bloodroot. After a while the eggs hatch and after a while they mature and lay more eggs.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well this product worked and how fast with such a small amount!!!!😁😁😁😁</li>
            <li> When placed on a spot that is cancerous, this product is very aggressive!  Four months later I am still watch the red area fade!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used. Would go to the dermatologist over end over to have the same spot frozen. Cell would keep returning. Only had to use the salve one time and after the cells died it never came back. This is a must use product if you are having problems with skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Knocked out an encapsulated cyst I had growing for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing was helping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use somewhere that you wouldn&#x27;t possibly risk a scar.</li>
            <li> This product works as it is advertised. I only use it on basil cell spots. I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my face at all. It will burn where you apply it and scar and I just wouldn&#x27;t put it on the face. I used it successfully on a spot on my arm. Just be careful using this stuff. It will cause an angry red spot, a scab, and some swelling, before it starts to clear. Then if will scar too. That is part of the deal. But a doctor with a knife will scar too. I&#x27;ve experienced that. I believe this stuff works good if used carefully. If you are afraid, just go to a dermatologist. But be aware, the doctor can make a mess of you too. So don&#x27;t have any false hope or expectations with this or the doctors.</li>
            <li> Such a blessing! Omg this stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve had a bump on my chin for the past 8months or so that I could never get rid of. I tried many things from acne creams/scrubs to hot rags and castor oil. None seemed to work. During certain times of the month the bump would enlarge to an embarrassing size. Sometimes popping and releasing blood and pus but always downsizing to a small bump only to enlarge later. While doing a bit of digging I came across a list of remedies which listed bloodroot salve as an option and got to work on finding some which led me to this gem. Once received I didn&#x27;t waste any time in applying it to my bump. Almost instantly I could feel it attacking the bad cells (I say it&#x27;s detoxing). After 24hrs I removed the bandage as instructed and sported a nasty scab for the remainder of the week but it was with it. Then I thought about my dog that has had tumors (mass celled) growing. So far I had spent over $500 on tumor removal surgery. She had another and I was like why not?. The results were instant. After a week the tumor fell completely off not harming any of her healthy skin or tissue. (I have some medical experience so I knew how to tend to the wound). I&#x27;m happy to spread the news about this tin surgeon and show others the before and after pics. I do recommend following the given instructions being cautious as to where it&#x27;s applied. I plan to purchase more believing it would be a nice addition to my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works. Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> works very well. but be carful</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like it locally, as the American bloodroot drawing salve seems too diluted and not strong enough. I use it for my dog&#x27;s hemangiosarcoma of the skin (skin cancer) and it works just as all the descriptions and videos of bloodroot salve are illustrated as working. The marks on my dog go through all the stages as illustrated and then heal with barely a scar.  So far, I have been using it for several months and have not had to have my dog&#x27;s cancer removed surgically as I have in the past.  The hardest part is keeping the wound covered on my dog until it heals. I received this quickly on both orders and have nothing but praises for the salve!</li>
            <li> it did what it said it would! It was great it helped me extract my epidermal cyst in my face!</li>
            <li> Interestingly, the salve arrived far ahead of schedule (in fact, days ahead of another, in-country order I&#x27;d placed for a different product -- that one, coming from only a few states away, took another week to arrive!)  I bought this specifically to see if it could remove a wart that I&#x27;ve struggled with for three years, and a fatty tumor on my thigh.  (Fatty tumors are collections of fat that are non-malignant; having then removed requires out-patient surgery which is very expensive.)  Multiple OTC products had removed the wart temporarily, but it always comes back.  Well, I have to say, this product didn&#x27;t remove the wart, either, although it did reduce it in size. And it reddened and created a tiny opening in the healthy skin around the wart.  The jury is still out on the fatty tumor, as I am still working with the product.  However, it does seem to be working.  An incredible amount of yellowish, fatty substance has been brought to the surface, and I should be done working with it in a few more days.  About 10 days to remove this tumor seems quite reasonable for such a minor price.  .</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd order from this seller and I am 100% grateful for this in removing the skin cancers that developed after my first treatments in September and I highly recommend it and the seller!   May 1,2015 I went to my dermatologist this week and he had to Google Blooodroot paste. I expected him to tell me I was stupid. BUT, He confirmed that I indeed get rid of 98% of my skin cancers and I am thrilled to say, GET this product! It will burn, but, if you have endured being cut, burned with a laser and scrapped, you can handle this!</li>
            <li> crazy powerful stuff....CRAZY!</li>
            <li> This salve did not work like the black salve I used to buy. I don&#x27;t think it worked at all.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Very surprised!</li>
            <li> Definitely works&lt;br /&gt;I put it on a melanoma and the very next day it had a white ring around it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s how you know it is cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Then 10 days later it falls off&lt;br /&gt;I gave some to a friend that had a mushy spot on the back of her hand and 10 days later it fell off and healed over fine.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful stuff</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> Zinc chloride is a chemical and is the ingredient in this that burns eats away at tissue...it is similar to battery acid..look it up online...this salve has it in it....be very careful in amount yu put on if yu dare. That why it hurts so much in usage</li>
            <li> Put this black ointment on the affected area (in our case it was a raised, discolored spot that came up on my dad&#x27;s face), cover it with a bandaid for 24 hours, and slowly watch the spot fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> bought for my mother who wanted to try it to remove a skin cancer..  it was amazing and worked and she was very happy..</li>
            <li> I just used this salve for the first time an I love it,did exactly what it said it would.used on my face right by my left eye,did hurt a little for 2 days made a sore but now just a small pink spot 3 week&#x27;s later.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results of the bloodroot . Our dog had a growth and this is clearing it up, a miracle we feel. Our vet shared that our dog has gained some extra years of life.</li>
            <li> Several years ago an established dermatologist told me his experience as an intern years before in rural Wisconsin. It seems, farmers of Scandinavian descent, fair skinned and prone to skin cancers, used a home remedy successfully. It was a salve that destroyed the cancer without harming any healthy tissue. The lesion fell off leaving good pink tissue underneath. My question was, ,&amp;#34; so where is this remedy now and why don&#x27;t doctors use it, instead of surgery, radiation, etc.?&amp;#34; He didn&#x27;t really have an answer.  Well...this may be the product or the ingredients at least. My husband had a mole on his wrist that he &amp;#34;manually&amp;#34; removed a few years ago. The area, about 3/4 inch diameter, remained red, raised, dry, flaky, and itchy. The bloodroot salve worked just as described by other reviewers. It looked &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34;, weeping for a few days. Then a scab formed and fell off. After 10 days the area is flat and no longer itchy. The area is still pink in comparison to nearby skin. Will wait to see if this changes, but if it doesn&#x27;t, it still is an amazing improvement. And an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Everyone needs this in medicine cabinet!</li>
