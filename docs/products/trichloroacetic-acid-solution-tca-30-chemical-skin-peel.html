            <li>so my writing skill are not the best,  just follow me on this while i go on detail about this</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>but the greasy antibiotic ointment was awesome.</li>
            <li>Good!</li>
            <li>;  When the peeling is done, though, he always tells me how great I look.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks great and feels smoother.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Make sure you read directions and look up videos on you tube for best results.</li>
            <li>I use it once and gave a good results</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li>Product is good.....</li>
            <li>Also for a seasonal refreshing peel!</li>
            <li>ITS SO MUCH BETTER THAN BEING CUT ON!</li>
            <li>Wash face first!!!!</li>
            <li>even though the idea sound great, YOU WILL SPREAD THE LIQUID.  </li>
            <li>Effective at removing moles.  </li>
            <li>do you need to needle your mole (pinch holes in it)  to be effective?  </li>
            <li>This strength of  TCA is extremely effective in peeling severely sun damaged skin and acne.</li>
            <li>It is very strong ..</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Probably most important for good results.....</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I USE IT TO TAKE OFF TAGS AND MOLES.</li>
            <li>.i used this product as directed over a month ago and still have a mark from where the acid touched the skin…this product works, but most people may want to look for a gentler option if putting on face or neck….</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS ,LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>but I plan to purchase more to get rid of the scarring</li>
            <li>Using tap water has minerals that might cause more burn or irritation.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the color was going to peel off, but it did.  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m gonna be wearing makeup more often that I planned to..</li>
            <li>how many time did i apply it?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i tried many tricks.  </li>
            <li>so it really is potent stuff.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love not having any skin tags, makes me feel much better about myself.</li>
            <li>It burned while it was on but not horribly.</li>
            <li>I was expecting some a bit more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I think I did a pretty good job mixing it</li>
            <li>found a much better solution to be accurate.</li>
            <li>I know from pervious experience 30% can be a strong peel</li>
            <li>I have some to strong and</li>
            <li>Leave it on for 3 to 5 more minutes and neutralize it with a rag full of baking soda and water.</li>
            <li>Use your sunscreen I use spf 70 foam oil free.</li>
            <li>It us super strong.</li>
            <li>Acne spots did get significantly lighter.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this for the scarring I have on my face from cystic acne.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong but removed discolored skin on first try!</li>
            <li>What more can I say really.</li>
            <li>Will show quick results ....</li>
            <li>this product does what it says…but it is super strong….just</li>
            <li>Company delivered quick and product works well.</li>
            <li>mild.</li>
            <li>That makes a difference that is far more significant (and burny) than I would have guessed.</li>
            <li>i rarely review products but if you need a review to judge this product this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s nice and dry, I apply the TCA 30%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I consider myself a pretty good source on the subject.</li>
            <li>I put A LOT of lotion on the first use because of what others said....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly when the rest of them disappeared (probably around 2-3 weeks)</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>and I was able to remove a freckle in the middle of my cheek that had been there for years.  </li>
            <li>At first two days I used was burn like hell but after 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>Btw this is not my first time performing a chemical peel.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and since I was using the product at home for the first time I diluted it in some water.</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t work which i believe it will  go to a higher %.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What this does it that it burn your top later of the skin.  </li>
            <li>i wash my first 3x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve successfully used several types of peels ovet the last yr.</li>
            <li>My first peel was just my forehead</li>
            <li>First, my skin frosted (the skin became whitish), then after rinsing off, it was reddish, then it got darker during the day.</li>
            <li>This created a really good peel on my arms when 20% did not and dried up peel resistant acne in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>it was very hot i live in Florida and a lot of products arrive hot.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Aesthetician/Cosmetologist - please be careful with product it is strong!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and even more.</li>
            <li>I found this TCA acid and decided to try it out VERY CAUTIOUSLY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works REALLY fast, too, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gets to be a bit intense for me - so</li>
            <li>It is the real deal.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>which is the one i use,  Even if 50% is more effective go slow and do several application of 30%.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal and you could burn/scar yourself if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li>You want the real thing.</li>
            <li>It burnt skin around the mole, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t understand how much it would burn.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I applied to my entire face, felt the burn for about a minute then and had light frosting that I immediately neutralized with baking soda and H2O.  </li>
            <li>It is potent so be very careful.</li>
            <li>Reputable company this is not watered down.</li>
            <li>This was fine; I expected as much.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that it is works!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Over the last 6 months, my impression was that some of them had gotten slightly bigger and for sure, I was having new ones appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then rinsed with cool water patted dry.  </li>
            <li>Over the course of two weeks, my skin peeled and the new skin was revealed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although you must use it very very carefully with something precise.</li>
            <li>It works so far!</li>
            <li>At first, it may seem like nothing&#x27;s happening but it definitely works!</li>
            <li>latino (first language spanish)  </li>
            <li>Use aquaphor intense healing ointment in the big jar, Wal-Mart brand has same exact amounts of all ingredients as in name brand.</li>
            <li>I have done it twice so far</li>
            <li>but I just know that when I look at my arm now, ALL of the skin tags are completely gone.</li>
            <li>You will scar if you peel too early because the skin underneath needs to heel.</li>
            <li>I did scar because I peeled it off to early</li>
            <li>well i&#x27;m living proof that it actually works, heal and drys fast,  leav skin without any</li>
            <li>Depending on the skin and how sensitive is it might be longer or shorter time</li>
            <li>The reviews were extremely promising but when I finally got it and tried it</li>
            <li>/&gt;So hit a few skin tags full strength with a q tip to see if it works on them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tough and I put up with burning sensation but it is worthy!!</li>
            <li>Just take it easy when applying to your skin, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I apply it slowly and accurate with the needle and cutton trick i mention before.  </li>
            <li>It does sting when applying (a lot, but doesn&#x27;t last long), but it took away some very stubborn skin tags, and a mole.  </li>
            <li>Will peel surrounding skin if not careful.</li>
            <li>I used the TCA peel on my back to get rid of old hyperpigmentation scars.</li>
            <li>I look so odd, and it&#x27;s not even funny.</li>
            <li>but I will try it little stronger next time just for fun.</li>
            <li>what a mess and left big dark marks in my skin which this formular was able to remove after 2 months.</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned because the skin turned very dark brown</li>
            <li>A lot of people complained about burning which was true</li>
            <li>Now just new, pink skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>It works and is not itchy like other high concentrated acid peels(lactic and glycolic).</li>
            <li>I read the past reviews and followed their advice (clean face with rubbing alcohol and let dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It does sting when applying (a lot, but doesn&#x27;t last long), but it took away some very stubborn skin tags, and a mole.  </li>
            <li> Will peel surrounding skin if not careful.</li>
            <li> I used the TCA peel on my back to get rid of old hyperpigmentation scars.</li>
            <li> I look so odd, and it&#x27;s not even funny.</li>
            <li> but I will try it little stronger next time just for fun.</li>
            <li> what a mess and left big dark marks in my skin which this formular was able to remove after 2 months.</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned because the skin turned very dark brown</li>
            <li> A lot of people complained about burning which was true</li>
            <li> Now just new, pink skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> It works and is not itchy like other high concentrated acid peels(lactic and glycolic).</li>
            <li> I read the past reviews and followed their advice (clean face with rubbing alcohol and let dry.</li>
            <li> The new skin is discolored; it&#x27;s darker than the rest of my back, so now I have splotchy dark patches on my back.</li>
            <li> first, the topmost layers of skin turned white and flaked a little but other than that, nothing seemed to be happening</li>
            <li> ) I WILL work with FLAT OR GROWN MOLES.</li>
            <li> With flat you my get them out in a week, with grown it</li>
            <li> NOPE,  if it flat  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to frost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, I got this for my brown spots and its working so far because half my spots disappeared.</li>
            <li> The next day I was wrinkly and dry and peeling by night fall.  </li>
            <li> , my mole was large and thick.  </li>
            <li> I was dancing and fanning to keep it on as long as I could..</li>
            <li> You must keep your face greasy as much as possible with this strength, because it hurts if you don&#x27;t and dont worry if you have a pink spot (referring to African or dark skin toned people like me) like you got burned and the scan fell off,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a q-tip twice a day and was very careful to only apply the acid to the skin tag itself; I tried to avoid getting it on the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the fastes way to speed the peeling skin to dry up.</li>
            <li> I applied it with a cotton ball starting at my forehead working my way down just like</li>
            <li> Use as little as possible.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful when you use it ....</li>
            <li> Need to used carefully skin can be burned.</li>
            <li> Applied it twice and the third day as i dried myself after a shower</li>
            <li> abd surface beneath is pink, don&#x27;t worry it goes away when you heal.</li>
            <li> you use the application 2x a day until it drys and release the dead skin,  you will see that the deep mole 1/2&amp;#34;  now became a 1/4&amp;#34; moles.  </li>
            <li> the product did it did not burn, there was absolutely no frosting</li>
            <li> The marks on my skin did not improve and the texture improved minimally.</li>
            <li> It removed a skin tag on my leg with only a few applications, but doesn&#x27;t work on some other skin tags under my arm.</li>
            <li> Then I used cold cold washcloth to clean it and leave washcloth on my skin to cool off.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to over due it with this type of skin care but you want to maximize results so look up tips.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews....</li>
            <li> My back doesn&#x27;t look horrible, but it definitely looked better BEFORE I used this TCA peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other knee hasn&#x27;t peeled yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> be very, very careful with this.</li>
            <li> I am dark now.</li>
            <li> cause at first application it looks find but by the 3rd day the spot you applyied becomes DARK and UGLY.  </li>
            <li> (or if it looks dark) then i just keep applying vitamin E until skin comes off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BE CAREFUL!!</li>
            <li> The small benefit of it working on one knee is not worth the price, especially since it made the skin on my back and face worse.</li>
            <li> I used the directions provided in a few of the other reviews</li>
            <li> but the&#x27;re much less noticeable, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have to get rid of the hanging dead skin, cut it off with a very sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> a little on skin will burn in seconds…</li>
            <li> I applied a little of this acid on them each day ...</li>
            <li> however takes a little longer to work than I thought.  </li>
            <li> If you get impatient and peel to early you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind looking like a lizard for few days since no one have to see me).</li>
            <li> Didnt work waste of money</li>
            <li> After I started to frost a few places</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it for a few days and do the process again,  </li>
            <li> DO NOT REMOVE THE DEAD SKIN,  let it fall off by itself.  </li>
            <li> Scrape off the dead skin and apply again.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s because you killed your outer layer of skin and in a couple of days you start to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took a few times for skin tag to come off and</li>
            <li> I had some large ugly skin tags on my neck ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s even listed as a peel.</li>
            <li> like i had you will look ridiculous with all the black spot in your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why or how peeling/exfoliating a layer of skin would cause darkening.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, left it on for a few minutes, then rinsed with cold water.</li>
            <li> It started to go down to thin and small.  </li>
            <li> GO SLOW ON THIS.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT use this if you are not a very experienced peeler.</li>
            <li> This is to create a very small niddle side end tip which you can damp in the formula and accuratly damp your mole with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;[Slightly sad, mostly disappointed that I didn&#x27;t follow my first mind that was telling me to not use this].</li>
            <li> It was horrible burn me up by first application</li>
            <li> At worst, there are some spots of skin that are slightly whiter than the surrounding skin, but definitely nothing</li>
            <li> It is up to you if you can handle well with burning sensation feeling, if you are tough one.  </li>
            <li> This chemical peel did nothing for my skin but made it worse.</li>
            <li> I tried the Murad vitamin C peel and it was very weak.</li>
            <li> Then, wash with baking soda/water mix and cold water after that)</li>
            <li> , I got desperate and started researching a solution online.</li>
            <li> I leave the GA/LA on for about 2 minutes, neutralize and then I rinse my face like a crazy guy who just poured acid on it.  </li>
            <li> Too dangerous for my taste  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get mad since I always buy stuff online.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to keep it from burning the surrounding skin, and I&#x27;ve had a burn mark for two months.</li>
            <li> , I just guessed at what looked like it wouldn&#x27;t burn to badly</li>
            <li> /&gt;i hated all the moles in my face which made me look like a darmathan dog.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works so far! I had this for 3 weeks. I have done it twice so far and I noticed that the brown spots have been fading. I read the past reviews and followed their advice (clean face with rubbing alcohol and let dry. Then apply TCA on skin and let stand for 2-3 minutes. Then, wash with baking soda/water mix and cold water after that)...it actually stung a lot...so I let it stand for 2 minutes rather than 3.  After affect: My face was  red and it felt like a sun burn. I put A LOT of lotion on the first use because of what others said....however, for the 2nd use I found that not putting lotion on let my skin peeled faster, which heeled faster in return. BUT everyone&#x27;s different so its up to you (Im stay at home Mom so I don&#x27;t mind looking like a lizard for few days since no one have to see me). I heard that lotion would prevent the skin to not crack/scar but mines haven&#x27;t w/o lotion. I use this 1 time every 3 weeks. I was told to do this for 3 months. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, I got this for my brown spots and its working so far because half my spots disappeared.</li>
            <li> It is very strong .. It is stronger than glycolic acid ...you have to be careful when you use it .... It is the best peeler I use... Will show quick results .... I use it once and gave a good results</li>
            <li> Good! Need to used carefully skin can be burned.</li>
            <li> I had several things pop up on my forearm and my best guess from doing some Internet research is that they were skin tags. The biggest one had a bit of a cauliflower look to it and got almost a centimeter in diameter. Over the last 6 months, my impression was that some of them had gotten slightly bigger and for sure, I was having new ones appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got desperate and started researching a solution online. I found this TCA acid and decided to try it out VERY CAUTIOUSLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a q-tip twice a day and was very careful to only apply the acid to the skin tag itself; I tried to avoid getting it on the surrounding skin. I did this TWICE a day for three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the topmost layers of skin turned white and flaked a little but other than that, nothing seemed to be happening so I lost interest and stopped the application after 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week, the smallest ones had shrunken to almost nothing. I don&#x27;t know exactly when the rest of them disappeared (probably around 2-3 weeks) but I just know that when I look at my arm now, ALL of the skin tags are completely gone. At worst, there are some spots of skin that are slightly whiter than the surrounding skin, but definitely nothing noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try out this 30% skin peel and start with just a couple of spots to test it out. Be PATIENT. At first, it may seem like nothing&#x27;s happening but it definitely works!</li>
            <li> Love love love! What more can I say really. This peel works GREAT! I could see a big difference in my skin after the allotted recovery time of course. I would definitely buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to get used to the burn, but does the job! A couple of bottles will probably be necessary on a larger tattoo! It&#x27;s a work in progress.</li>
            <li> Effective at removing moles.  Just be careful at placing product directly on growth mole, etc.  Will peel surrounding skin if not careful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Applied it twice and the third day as i dried myself after a shower it just came off!! It is potent so be very careful. Try not to cover the entire skin tag or mole with the q tip cuz u will have burn off around the area. Very very happy w the results. Just need to wait for the reddness to go away</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! 2 time I&#x27;ve ordered product. I used it this time to help remove a tattoo in between laser tattoo removal and it really works! Also for a seasonal refreshing peel! I highly recommend this. I&#x27;m a Aesthetician/Cosmetologist - please be careful with product it is strong!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I USE IT TO TAKE OFF TAGS AND MOLES. I HAVE HAD OVER NIGHT RESULTS WITH SOME, BUT THE BIGGER MOLES TAKE ALITTLE WHILE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, AND WILL PURCHASE AGAIN. ITS SO MUCH BETTER THAN BEING CUT ON!</li>
            <li> Holy jeezus, this stuff burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so... it&#x27;s acid, it&#x27;s going to burn.  It works REALLY fast, too, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a 70% glycolic acid / 88% lactic acid mixture as a pre-peel peel to allow the TCA to reach the darkest depths of my wrinkled face.  I leave the GA/LA on for about 2 minutes, neutralize and then I rinse my face like a crazy guy who just poured acid on it.  After it&#x27;s nice and dry, I apply the TCA 30%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t used to TCA, you need to dilute this... I&#x27;d say 5, 10, 15% max.  TCA should, ideally, be left on about 5 minutes.  I start to frost (turn white) within a minute or two and the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; gets to be a bit intense for me - so I stop it there and neutralize / rinse it off.  It results in a delayed (2-3 days out) but not insignificant peel which my partner tells me makes me look like &amp;#34;a sunburned leprechaun from hell.&amp;#34;  When the peeling is done, though, he always tells me how great I look.  I don&#x27;t peel for him, though, I do it because I cannot stand the pores on my nose.  They&#x27;re still there, of course... but the&#x27;re much less noticeable, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... this stuff works.  It burns like a mo-fo, but it works!</li>
            <li> this product does what it says…but it is super strong….just a little on skin will burn in seconds….i used this product as directed over a month ago and still have a mark from where the acid touched the skin…this product works, but most people may want to look for a gentler option if putting on face or neck….</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ,LOVE IT. have to purchase another bottle</li>
            <li> It was horrible burn me up by first application</li>
            <li> It works and is not itchy like other high concentrated acid peels(lactic and glycolic). This burns like hell but I&#x27;d rather deal with pain than itchy skin. You will scar if you peel too early because the skin underneath needs to heel. I did scar because I peeled it off to early but I plan to purchase more to get rid of the scarring and I wont touch it for two weeks. If you get impatient and peel to early you&#x27;ll be sorry. I did the peel for my chest to remove scarring and a bit on my back. I used up to 8ml but plan to get 1 ounce which should help me do what I intend to get done. Overall it works well, just don&#x27;t touch it.</li>
            <li> Didnt work waste of money</li>
            <li> Company delivered quick and product works well. Make sure you read directions and look up videos on you tube for best results. You don&#x27;t want to over due it with this type of skin care but you want to maximize results so look up tips. Wash face first!!!! Don&#x27;t get in your eyes!!!! Probably most important for good results.....apply well but don&#x27;t apply second coat.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews.... It burns like a heater after 16 seconds. I was dancing and fanning to keep it on as long as I could.. Acne spots did get significantly lighter. Use your sunscreen I use spf 70 foam oil free. Wal mart brand. About 10 days for all skin to fall. Reputable company this is not watered down. It is the real deal. Do your research before using. Dilute only with distilled water. Using tap water has minerals that might cause more burn or irritation. Dont pick or peel. If you have to get rid of the hanging dead skin, cut it off with a very sharp scissors. Use aquaphor intense healing ointment in the big jar, Wal-Mart brand has same exact amounts of all ingredients as in name brand. You must keep your face greasy as much as possible with this strength, because it hurts if you don&#x27;t and dont worry if you have a pink spot (referring to African or dark skin toned people like me) like you got burned and the scan fell off, abd surface beneath is pink, don&#x27;t worry it goes away when you heal. I never got permanent scarring after the peel even if I pick at it. Also, I se off brand cetaphil face wash it&#x27;s the fastes way to speed the peeling skin to dry up. Wash as much as possible. Then aquaphor ointment, also aquaphor won&#x27;t clog your pores, and break you out. I know because my face is oily but I only ise it when I do peels, otherwise below my neck gets it regularly, 1 jar of that will last a lifetime I promise you</li>
            <li> Even at 30% it&#x27;s strong but removed discolored skin on first try! I&#x27;m buying this for my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am still in the phases of testing it on some moles on my face but it seems to be working perfectly.</li>
            <li> This was my third peel with this TCA bottle and I was able to remove a freckle in the middle of my cheek that had been there for years.  At first I was concerned because the skin turned very dark brown and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the color was going to peel off, but it did.  Now just new, pink skin underneath.  Look forward to future peels and clearer skin.</li>
            <li> Too dangerous for my taste  A lot of people complained about burning which was true but I had severe itching.  I think I &#x27;d rather pay a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and even more.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks with nothing happening to my tags. I would pass on this product.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that it is works!  At first two days I used was burn like hell but after 10 mins.  Then I used cold cold washcloth to clean it and leave washcloth on my skin to cool off.  I waited 1 or 2 weeks again I used it again (repeat), my mole was large and thick.  It started to go down to thin and small.  I was very happy.  It is up to you if you can handle well with burning sensation feeling, if you are tough one.  I&#x27;m tough and I put up with burning sensation but it is worthy!!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and I love this stuff!!!!!!! This is my second time using it and I promise it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Boy... Where do I start? This chemical peel did nothing for my skin but made it worse. I am dark now. I look so odd, and it&#x27;s not even funny. I can&#x27;t get mad since I always buy stuff online. Btw this is not my first time performing a chemical peel.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is damaged and I have no idea if the darkness from this peel is reversible. Guess I&#x27;m gonna have to invest in seeing a plastic surgeon to correct my &#x27;mistakes&#x27;. And I followed all steps correctly, and left it on for about 31 seconds. It&#x27;s been about almost two weeks now. I have school within the next week or the following. Guess I&#x27;m gonna be wearing makeup more often that I planned to..&lt;br /&gt;Ps. although it may have not worked for me, it may work for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Slightly sad, mostly disappointed that I didn&#x27;t follow my first mind that was telling me to not use this].</li>
            <li> I have been going to my dermatologist for years to get chemical peels. I consider myself a pretty good source on the subject. I tried the Murad vitamin C peel and it was very weak. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s even listed as a peel. Anyway this acid solution feels and looks like what my dermatologist charges $95.00 for without insurance. I know from pervious experience 30% can be a strong peel and since I was using the product at home for the first time I diluted it in some water. I didn&#x27;t measure, I just guessed at what looked like it wouldn&#x27;t burn to badly haha. I applied it with a cotton ball starting at my forehead working my way down just like the girls do in the doctors office. I stood in front of a fan because that helps with the burn a lot. After I started to frost a few places I neutralized it with baking soda and water using another cotton ball.  I washed with water and added vitamin c cream. That&#x27;s what they do at my dermatologist so I just followed along. If it burns you know its working. I have some to strong and some&lt;br /&gt;to mild. I think I did a pretty good job mixing it but I will try it little stronger next time just for fun. I a&lt;br /&gt;So hit a few skin tags full strength with a q tip to see if it works on them.</li>
            <li> i rarely review products but if you need a review to judge this product this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll go into detail how i have remove 16 mole from my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hated all the moles in my face which made me look like a darmathan dog.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m latino (first language spanish)  so my writing skill are not the best,  just follow me on this while i go on detail about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family my mom, dad, bro have massive mole in all body.  i was unlucky enough to carry  this genes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with give you all my tips that i use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I WILL work with FLAT OR GROWN MOLES. With flat you my get them out in a week, with grown it my takes weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) GO SLOW ON THIS.  Start with 30%  which is the one i use,  Even if 50% is more effective go slow and do several application of 30%.  if it doesn&#x27;t work which i believe it will  go to a higher %.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) DO NOT USE QTIP.  even though the idea sound great, YOU WILL SPREAD THE LIQUID.  found a much better solution to be accurate. below is the detail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  USE A NEEDLE WRAP WITH CUTTON.  This is to create a very small niddle side end tip which you can damp in the formula and accuratly damp your mole with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) do you need to needle your mole (pinch holes in it)  to be effective?  NOPE,  if it flat  just use it has is and u will get result.  What this does it that it burn your top later of the skin.  for DEEP MOLES,  you can pinch it with a needle for faster result but it can cause a mark at the end of process.  i learn that deep mole let say you have a 1/2&amp;#34; mole (just to put a size)  you use the application 2x a day until it drys and release the dead skin,  you will see that the deep mole 1/2&amp;#34;  now became a 1/4&amp;#34; moles.  don&#x27;t use it for a few days and do the process again,  will see the mole end up been 1/8&amp;#34;size and u get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) USE VITAMIN E OIL overnight and 1 hour after application if you can.  I read online from studies  that it doesn&#x27;twork, while users from product says it does.  well i&#x27;m living proof that it actually works, heal and drys fast,  leav skin without any scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7)DON&#x27;T DO IT ALL AT ONCE LIKE I DID.  cause at first application it looks find but by the 3rd day the spot you applyied becomes DARK and UGLY.  if you use it on 1 mole then you can cover it with make up or something while at work. but if you have a zillion moles in the face like i had you will look ridiculous with all the black spot in your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) DO NOT REMOVE THE DEAD SKIN,  let it fall off by itself.  in my experience. if i used it on monday by friday the skin would come off.  Depending on the skin and how sensitive is it might be longer or shorter time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) how many time did i apply it?  I apply it slowly and accurate with the needle and cutton trick i mention before.  once in the morning and once at night.  for 3 or 4 days. (or if it looks dark) then i just keep applying vitamin E until skin comes off.  i wash my first 3x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this help anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried many tricks.  castor oil with baking soda - didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;apple cide vinegar,  what a mess and left big dark marks in my skin which this formular was able to remove after 2 months.</li>
            <li> be very, very careful with this. burns like iron.</li>
            <li> I use this on a plantar&#x27;s wart on my foot.  You put it on one night but it continues to work for days.  Scrape off the dead skin and apply again.  I&#x27;m getting there!</li>
            <li> This works very well.  It does sting when applying (a lot, but doesn&#x27;t last long), but it took away some very stubborn skin tags, and a mole.  Just take it easy when applying to your skin, a little goes a long way.  It might take some time but they will go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve successfully used several types of peels ovet the last yr. This strength of  TCA is extremely effective in peeling severely sun damaged skin and acne. This created a really good peel on my arms when 20% did not and dried up peel resistant acne in a couple of days. DO NOT use this if you are not a very experienced peeler. This is the real deal and you could burn/scar yourself if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. Great product!</li>
            <li> I used the directions provided in a few of the other reviews but I took a conservative approach. I just did my chin area and I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to frost. I still had a lot of peeling and dryness so it really is potent stuff. I was definitely on fire after about 1.5 minutes. And on one side I thought I missed a spot and I rubbed over it again with a second coat. That makes a difference that is far more significant (and burny) than I would have guessed. Even without frosting I would say it took close to 10 days to get over the tightness and peeling. I tried emu oil and it didn&#x27;t really do much but the greasy antibiotic ointment was awesome.</li>
            <li> You want the real thing. You want acid for chemical peel or removal of any type of skin deformity this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you must use it very very carefully with something precise. I tried to remove a mole. It burnt skin around the mole, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t understand how much it would burn. It minimized the mole and I will use it again to finish it off. Use as little as possible. It us super strong.</li>
            <li> I am a lisenced esthetician. I was really excited to try this for the scarring I have on my face from cystic acne. The reviews were extremely promising but when I finally got it and tried it the product did it did not burn, there was absolutely no frosting and I did not peel at all except for a tiny spot on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. My first peel was just my forehead so I could gauge how the product works on my skin. I apply one layer without overlapping, wait 5 min, then apply another layer in the same manner.(You want to see a frost appearance.) Leave it on for 3 to 5 more minutes and neutralize it with a rag full of baking soda and water. Then I use a 5 minute cooling gel with aloe. I wait another 5 - 10 minutes rinse and sometimes depending on how it looks either reapply the cooling gel or use neosporin cream. It is a constant struggle to keep enough moisture on your face after this. But that&#x27;s because you killed your outer layer of skin and in a couple of days you start to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also use Hyaluronic Acid Serum daily when possible. The peel stings like a bee, but I&#x27;m liking the results.</li>
            <li> I had some large ugly skin tags on my neck ... I applied a little of this acid on them each day ... they were gone, just shriveled up and fell off.  I love, love, love not having any skin tags, makes me feel much better about myself.</li>
            <li> I used the TCA peel on my back to get rid of old hyperpigmentation scars. I followed the directions, left it on for a few minutes, then rinsed with cold water. It burned while it was on but not horribly. First, my skin frosted (the skin became whitish), then after rinsing off, it was reddish, then it got darker during the day. This was fine; I expected as much. Over the course of two weeks, my skin peeled and the new skin was revealed. This is where I noticed a problem. The new skin is discolored; it&#x27;s darker than the rest of my back, so now I have splotchy dark patches on my back. I&#x27;m not sure why or how peeling/exfoliating a layer of skin would cause darkening. My back doesn&#x27;t look horrible, but it definitely looked better BEFORE I used this TCA peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the TCA peel on a spot on my face, not my entire face. After the peeling process, some hyperpigmentation did result, but I&#x27;m going to wait a month to see if the skin evens out on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I tried the TCA peel on my knees. It felt like putting water on my skin. I felt no burning, so I thought it wasn&#x27;t working. However, the skin on one knee peeled about a week later, revealing smoother skin. The other knee hasn&#x27;t peeled yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would NOT recommend this product. The small benefit of it working on one knee is not worth the price, especially since it made the skin on my back and face worse.</li>
            <li> Took a few times for skin tag to come off and yes it burns but for the price it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li> I was expecting some a bit more noticeable. The marks on my skin did not improve and the texture improved minimally.</li>
            <li> Product is good.....however takes a little longer to work than I thought.  (but it does work)</li>
            <li> Very difficult to keep it from burning the surrounding skin, and I&#x27;ve had a burn mark for two months. It also only removed two of the ten skin tags I was treating. I&#x27;ve given up and made a Dr&#x27;s appointment.</li>
            <li> It removed a skin tag on my leg with only a few applications, but doesn&#x27;t work on some other skin tags under my arm.</li>
            <li> Was not packed well and leaked so i got burned as soon as i opened the packet and lost a lot of the product the lid was cracked and it was very hot i live in Florida and a lot of products arrive hot.&lt;br /&gt; This should not be sold this way, but what was left worked well.&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL!!</li>
            <li> This product is as directed.  I applied to my entire face, felt the burn for about a minute then and had light frosting that I immediately neutralized with baking soda and H2O.  I then rinsed with cool water patted dry.  I applied TNS Ceramide Treatment cream.  I used Bacitracin throughout the next days also to keep skin hydrated.  The next day I was wrinkly and dry and peeling by night fall.  The 3rd day I peeled a lot and by the end of day 4 peeling is done.  My skin looks great and feels smoother. I am now using a lot of sunscreen and moisturizer.  Will use again in the next month!</li>
            <li> Waiting for someone to help me with it.</li>
