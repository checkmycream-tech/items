    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am giving this 4 stars because shipping was way to expensive and it took awhile. This product is amazing, it&#x27;s very moisturizing so a little goes a long way. I can not wait to make a shea butter whip for my hair. I am glad I can use this or coconut oil on my skin or hair. This product comes in 2 bags which is fine for me I leave it in the bag. It also cleared up the dark blemishes on my face which is amazing. My skin glows wonderfully with this.</li>
            <li> My nice has spot (eczema)  in her hair  scalp so is Amazing product, popular , recommended from people suffering from skin disease.</li>
            <li> I agree with others here.  I orderd a pound of this Shea Butter a year ago and was very disappointed. The Shea Butter ended up in the trash. The issues:    1.) The odor was horribly strong.  I have since obtained REAL Unrefined Shea Butter from several sources and I know what it is supposed to smell like.  Real Shea Butter should have a light nutty scent.  This stuff smelled like it was mixed with Gasoline.    2.) This stuff was horribly packaged in a plastic bag. The Shea stuck to the sides of the bag.    3.) The Shea felt like it had been mixed with something like Vaseline.  It was beyond thick and did not absorb into the skin.  I even tried it over night and it was just as greasy as when I put it on the night before.    Do not waste your money!!! If you want good Shea Butter I would recommend ordering from one of the following online companies who sell quality Shea Butter: Coastal Scents, Butters n Bars, New Directions Aromatics, or Sekaf International.  All of these companies put out a good quality Shea Butter for a very reasonable price.  They sell cream to light colored shea that is very smooth and creamy.  Take it from me...don&#x27;t waste your money on the crap this guy is selling.</li>
            <li> The freshness, aroma and quality smooth feel is what will strike you first. You won&#x27;t go wrong and I will put my seal of approval on the product/packaging and service of Halaleveryday and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Oh my, this Shea butter is the ABSOLUTE best moisturizer that I have ever used! I use it on my face after exfoliating &amp; it is non greasy, it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m ordering 10 more pounds of it.</li>
            <li> Great price and works for my skin and hair. And got it quickly also. Tired it before and discovered I could get on line. fantastic</li>
            <li> I was very excited when this package arrived in the mail. I opened it and was delighted to find the the item was exactly how the seller advertised. The shea butter is very good quality. i will definatly buy this product form them in the future.</li>
            <li> Great Product... its really soft and melts right in yours hands :).I bought it in march and just used it up. Diffidently buying again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product twice. The first order was ok, once mixed with my oils I was very satisfied. I liked it so much I ordered a second time, but b4 is got the delivery of the second batch I noticed white spots appearing on the 1st batch, cut them off and kept it going. I still have a small piece left but I&#x27;m (read that white spots mean old and could be fungus) hesitant to use it. so in comes the second order.&lt;br /&gt;1. Verrrrry Green&lt;br /&gt;2. Looked as if it had melted all over the bag&lt;br /&gt;3. Was not smooth &#x3D; sticky, thick, grainy and again greeeeen!&lt;br /&gt;4. Broken in to little chuncks and little beady like crumbs, eww!&lt;br /&gt;5. Appeared dried out and old - after use my conclusion is that it is DRIED OUT &amp; OLD!&lt;br /&gt;Disregarded all that and mixed up a batch with my expensive oils anyway. Very grainy and unpleasant texture against my skin. super thick and was very hard to breakdown. very poor quality &amp; i&#x27;m no shea expert, but I know that much! I like the convenience of amazon, but I will never order this butter again I will go to an outside site. I now don&#x27;t trust what they would send even if I picked a different brand or seller. Nope I feel duped! I guess finding the right butter for me is going to be trial &amp; error. IT WAS DEFINITELY AN ERROR TO PURCHASE THIS BUTTER! I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANY BUTTER AGAIN FROM AMAZON, PERIOD! THEY ARE NOT THE ONLINE PLACE TO PURCHASE GOOD BUTTER AS FAR AS I&#x27;M CONCERNED!</li>
            <li> good quality shea butter. Until 2013, I have not ordered from him since 2009. This is the better shea butter you can get on the internet.</li>
            <li> This is NOT grade A Shea Butter. What I got in the mail was a rancid &amp; moldy dark yellow butter. The mold was fuzzy white &amp; green, the smell was horrible and the color looked all wrong. Real Shea butter does not mold unless contaminated, I&#x27;m not sure what this company sent me but it was not Grade A Shea butter by any means. I have gotten a refund &amp; I do have to send the product back but this was to be used for Christmas gifts, now I will not receive the Shea butter I ordered from a reputable company on time to finish my gifts. I will never order this from Amazon again. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is the best thing ever yall! I use this as a lotion, chap stick, and hair moisturizer (I recommend this as a moisturizer for my natural and relaxed black girls especially if you have 3 and 4 type hair not so much if you have 1 or 2 type hair). It works amazing. I&#x27;ve noticed that the ivory colored Shea Butter tend to work better for clearing up acne, boils, blemishes, in grown hair etc. Therefore I use the ivory colored Shea Butter on my face and hair and this yellow one for the rest of my body and hair. I read that the color of Shea Butter depends on the nut and if it&#x27;s roasted for a certain amount of time. Not really sure so research that if you want. But from experience the ivory tends to work better for acne. However, whatever color the Shea Butter is doesn&#x27;t really matter because either way Shea Butter works miracles. It&#x27;s truly amazing especially in its raw state,</li>
            <li> I use to get this in the plastic container, so what&#x27;s up with he plastic bag now???? same good product but surprise on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Raw shea butter is a favorite of mine. This product is no exception. They sent the shea butter in a timely matter and it was exactly what they said it would be, raw, unrefined shea butter. This product makes my skin silky smooth and helps lighten scars and stretch marks. I love it!!!! I will be purchasing from halal again!</li>
            <li> This was a repeat buy and this time I bought a bigger batch. The butter arrived on time, in a plastic-bag, well packaged in a box. I&#x27;m using shea butter to make my own cosmetics like whipped body-butters, lotions, hand-cream and for the first time lip-balm. Very moisturizing! And I really enjoy the benefits of the all natural products. I KNOW what is in each and every one of them! And it is fun to make them. Just make sure once you find the right seller that you keep ordering from them [I noticed that sometimes the seller name switches on you when ordering, that&#x27;s why I keep checking my order throughout the check-out process; mine is HalalEveryDay].</li>
            <li> great quality, melts right in your hand and leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Just a backdrop, I ordered this product for the first time on March 7th of this year.  The product quality was great, the shea butter looked authentic, and lasted for a good while.  I was impressed with the results I decided the get another order on October 12th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I am disappointed with the product that was shipped to me this time around.  Look at the photos that I have provided to support my opinion on the overall quality.  A majority of the Shea Butter was white, definitely a lot different from the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know Amazon is not at fault, but the seller, Halaleveryday, did a terrible job of delivering on quality.  I will also be filing a complaint with them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41g8jW36eVL.jpg&lt;br /&gt;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MMlWD7lPL.jpg</li>
            <li> HUGE shipment! Lasted me almost an year!</li>
            <li> I purchase this as a Xmas gift and I know she will enjoy using it as she has in the past.</li>
            <li> Have tried quite a few shea butters and this one was a disappointment. It didn&#x27;t moisturize the way I expected it to. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Super wonderful all natural shea butter, if you are thinking of trying this out for the first time dont hesitate because you wont regret buying this product.
