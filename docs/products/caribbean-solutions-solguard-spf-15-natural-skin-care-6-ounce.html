    <ol>
            <li>AND THIS IS THE BEST EVER.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>If we&#x27;re going to have sunscreen, we&#x27;re just going to have to deal with the zinc or titantium dioxide in products, but this is the best feel on the skin that I&#x27;ve tried --</li>
            <li>Carribbean Solutions SolGuard is great and stops the sunburn!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>However, it smells great!</li>
            <li>It has a perfect toxicity rating from EWG.</li>
            <li>my kids are very fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>SMELLS GREAT.  </li>
            <li>THERE PRODUCTS ARE GREAT.  </li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>The scent and the feel of this sunscreen are both great.</li>
            <li>They are great sunscreens, provided you do not get in the water and do not sweat.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for your face, as it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>It did a GREAT job of allowing us to get a tan and not burn.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t burn which was great, but also I was very happy in using a product that is eco friendly.</li>
            <li>The best part is how easily this lotion is the texture and consistency.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, someone who is not may be OK in a tropical setting.</li>
            <li>I am very fair, and am able to get some color without burning.</li>
            <li>Good for the Caribbean reserve beaches though</li>
            <li>AND HE IS GOOD FOR THE DAY</li>
            <li>Good product and not harmful to sealife.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my sensitive skin, helps my skin maintain moisture, and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely the greatest...</li>
            <li>AND YOU STILL GET A NICE TAN</li>
            <li>It is enviornmentmentally friendly and makes me feel great that I am protecting my skin and the habitat of a variety of sea life.</li>
            <li>I purchased 6 new sunscreens and I liked this one the best by a mile.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy, smell good (coconut scent), protects well, and doesn&#x27;t harm you or the environment.  </li>
            <li>For sensitive areas, for example the nose, the SPF 25 is a perfect combination.</li>
            <li>TRIED MANY LOTIONS ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li>I purchased this product so when I snorkeled I knew I was not damaging the ocean life that I love to view.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>As soon you get into the water you would feel greasy and you can easy remove the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It states that you should reapply every 45 minutes, but I was fine every 1.5 hours, even with activity in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making products that are not harmful to our bodies!!!</li>
            <li>is nature friendly too.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering, and that dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, love the fact that it is full of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a one of those rare people who are allergic to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked the product, but will not use it again in a tropical location.</li>
            <li>As far as non-toxic sunscreens go, this is the most bang-for-our-buck you&#x27;ll find.  </li>
            <li>I already make my own toothpaste, shampoo, and insect repellant, guess I&#x27;ll add sunscreen to the list next summer.</li>
            <li>no seriously!!</li>
            <li>I have since bought SPF 25 - too thick but great, and now SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>You need to apply at least 10 to 20 min prior to going out for best results.  </li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and does much more than over-the -counter products.</li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to apply we have had not burns and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rub in and doesn&#x27;t look white or feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like that is</li>
            <li>We put it on the kids and then get ready and head out.  </li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again</li>
            <li>and it was claimed to be \\&quot;very water resistant\\</li>
            <li>&quot; It worked much better in the water, but it was thicker and much harder to rub in.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased in Florida when on vacation several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I want to do right by the planet, but I didn&#x27;t like this product at all, and went back to using non biodegradable lotion after the first application.</li>
            <li>It has a smoother, less waxy feel than most of the products.  </li>
            <li>If those are not issues for you, then I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>It goes on as smoothly as any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used that has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe its a new formulation</li>
            <li>I have eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to creams and lotions on my face.  </li>
            <li>but it smells a little strange, kind of fishy.</li>
            <li>After reading this year&#x27;s Environmental Working Groups sunscreen report, I decided it was time to get some new all natural sunscreens that met the highest standards in the report.  </li>
            <li>Only word of caution is that it does take a little more effort to put on and get rubbed in all the way.</li>
            <li>you want an alternative to this, I&#x27;d recommend researching red raspberry seed oil, which has a very high SPF, even when diluted.  </li>
            <li>MY 2 YEAR OLD</li>
            <li>all natural and with protection from the uvs.</li>
            <li>The size was a little small for the price and the smell was not as good as it could be, but I wanted a natural or organic sunscreen</li>
            <li>after the initial application with much rubbing, but when entering the ocean, it was like a white, milky film coating reappearing your skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is really thick, and does not apply easily at all.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, it left a white film on my skin - hard to rub in.</li>
            <li>Especially with sensitive coral reefs.</li>
            <li>All sensitive formulas do leave a white residue.</li>

            <li> All sensitive formulas do leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> I mixed a little raspberry seed oil in as it is a natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Very long lasting....</li>
            <li> We only used the product to protect the coral reefs in Mexico as it was thick to try to rub in, which really didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> I love using products that don&#x27;t use harsh chemicals that are not good for you!  </li>
            <li> If you get in the water, you emerge with a milky white film all over where you got wet.</li>
            <li> It lasted that long and even in water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad and is definitely better than a allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than other brands &amp; doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin like other brands, so you need to spread thoroughly but remember it is protecting your skin.</li>
            <li> I buy the other SPF ranges too, depending on the need.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was sent the wrong SPF but Amazon quickly fixed it.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and white, so I can see where it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I reapplied a couple times and still burned after less than 3 hours on the beach.</li>
            <li> It does go on quite thick and will probably last forever because I usually don&#x27;t need biodegradable.</li>
            <li> I use it year &#x27;round on my face and on my legs and arms in the summer (to tan).  </li>
            <li> Was just in Greece for two weeks and had to change products as my usually easy-to-tan skin burned and even got a touch of sun poisoning from this stuff.  </li>
            <li> hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> But I have to say it&#x27;s hard to absorb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the product and frustrating application, but I did burn even after using.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not good for swimming in the ocean.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product during a cruise last April where I was snorkeling or diving at five different islands in the Caribbean. I didn&#x27;t burn which was great, but also I was very happy in using a product that is eco friendly. Especially with sensitive coral reefs.</li>
            <li> hard to rub in. Good for the Caribbean reserve beaches though</li>
            <li> I am a sailor and have used the product for years.  It is absolutely the greatest...especially if you spend lots of time in the sun.  For sensitive areas, for example the nose, the SPF 25 is a perfect combination.</li>
            <li> TRIED MANY LOTIONS ON THE MARKET AND THIS IS THE BEST EVER.  I PUT ON ONCE OR TWICE FOR ALL DAY AND DON&#x27;T BURN AND YOU STILL GET A NICE TAN EVENTUALLY WITHOUT THE BURN.  SMELLS GREAT.  DOES NOT BURN EYES WHEN SWEATING OR WATER. NO CHEMICAL/CARCINOGENS.  ALL THERE PRODUCTS ARE GREAT.  TRY THE KIDS LOTIONS YOU WON&#x27;T WORRY THEY WILL BURN AND HAVE TO REAPPLY SEVERAL TIMES.  ONCE IF NO WATER TWICE IF SWIMMING.  MY 2 YEAR OLD I PUT IT ON HIM IN THE MORNING AND HE IS GOOD FOR THE DAY UNLESS HE&#x27;S IN THE POOL THEN TWICE.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell.  More importantly, it left a white film on my skin - hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  If we&#x27;re going to have sunscreen, we&#x27;re just going to have to deal with the zinc or titantium dioxide in products, but this is the best feel on the skin that I&#x27;ve tried -- no matter what the list of ingredients.  It has a smoother, less waxy feel than most of the products.  The scent is not overpowering, and that dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a one of those rare people who are allergic to sunscreen. This product is great. I really like that is is nature friendly too. Just a heads-up. All sensitive formulas do leave a white residue. It&#x27;s not that bad and is definitely better than a allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Use with my kids that are allergic to sunscreen.  Not only is it easy to apply we have had not burns and my kids are very fair skinned.  You need to apply at least 10 to 20 min prior to going out for best results.  We put it on the kids and then get ready and head out.  Even in the Florida sun no problems to date.  I buy it every year on vacation in Florida just to have for the following year</li>
            <li> love it! all natural and with protection from the uvs. Will absolutely buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a trip to Mexico because you have to use biodegradeable sunscreen at the coral reefs. The scent and the feel of this sunscreen are both great. It&#x27;s easy to rub in and doesn&#x27;t look white or feel greasy. However, it is not good for swimming in the ocean. I reapplied a couple times and still burned after less than 3 hours on the beach. I am very fair skinned, someone who is not may be OK in a tropical setting. It says on the bottle that it is \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot;. I had another bio product with us, Solbar Shield, that was a 40 spf and it was claimed to be \\&quot;very water resistant\\&quot; It worked much better in the water, but it was thicker and much harder to rub in. Overall, I liked the product, but will not use it again in a tropical location.</li>
            <li> I have used SPF 4, 8, and 15 of this line. They are great sunscreens, provided you do not get in the water and do not sweat. If you get in the water, you emerge with a milky white film all over where you got wet. If you sweat, the sweat comes out white. If those are not issues for you, then I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  We needed biodegradable lotion for Xel-ha in Mexico.  It does go on quite thick and will probably last forever because I usually don&#x27;t need biodegradable.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great. It is a topical sunscreen as opposed to a chemical sunscreen. It is enviornmentmentally friendly and makes me feel great that I am protecting my skin and the habitat of a variety of sea life. Only word of caution is that it does take a little more effort to put on and get rubbed in all the way.</li>
            <li> Carribbean Solutions SolGuard is great and stops the sunburn!  It is thicker than other brands &amp; doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin like other brands, so you need to spread thoroughly but remember it is protecting your skin. I love using products that don&#x27;t use harsh chemicals that are not good for you!  I buy the other SPF ranges too, depending on the need.  Thanks for making products that are not harmful to our bodies!!!</li>
            <li> Very long lasting....didn&#x27;t need to keep reapplying it. Applied once a day and not again...no seriously!! It lasted that long and even in water.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fact that the product isn&#x27;t waterproof. As soon you get into the water you would feel greasy and you can easy remove the sunscreen. It won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Initially I was sent the wrong SPF but Amazon quickly fixed it. Maybe its a new formulation but it smells a little strange, kind of fishy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I use it year &#x27;round on my face and on my legs and arms in the summer (to tan).  It&#x27;s great for your face, as it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to creams and lotions on my face.  I can&#x27;t use the brand-name products like Coppertone, L&#x27;oreal, Neutrogena, etc., because they make me break out.  The only drawback with this product is that it leaves a white film on your skin.  However, it smells great!</li>
            <li> My kids burned through this sunscreen. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> It has a perfect toxicity rating from EWG. It goes on thick and white, so I can see where it&#x27;s applied. It feels great on my sensitive skin, helps my skin maintain moisture, and it smells awesome. I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> We only used the product to protect the coral reefs in Mexico as it was thick to try to rub in, which really didn&#x27;t happen.  It looked o.k. after the initial application with much rubbing, but when entering the ocean, it was like a white, milky film coating reappearing your skin.  We did not burn though.  The scent was not an issue.  We stuck to our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sunscreen in the pool,</li>
            <li> This product is really thick, and does not apply easily at all.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the product and frustrating application, but I did burn even after using.  I want to do right by the planet, but I didn&#x27;t like this product at all, and went back to using non biodegradable lotion after the first application.</li>
            <li> After reading this year&#x27;s Environmental Working Groups sunscreen report, I decided it was time to get some new all natural sunscreens that met the highest standards in the report.  I purchased 6 new sunscreens and I liked this one the best by a mile.  i purchased the variety because I&#x27;m rather picky about the texture of the sunscreen.  I can withstand some tackiness in the lotion, but not a lot. The best part is how easily this lotion is the texture and consistency.  It goes on as smoothly as any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used that has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in it.  I&#x27;m going to stock up on this product.</li>
            <li> it is like a paste, your skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it, and when you get in the water you look like painted white. It takes lots of soap to wash off</li>
            <li> As far as non-toxic sunscreens go, this is the most bang-for-our-buck you&#x27;ll find.  The only downside, is of course the film that it applies on your skin, and the discoloration.  It states that you should reapply every 45 minutes, but I was fine every 1.5 hours, even with activity in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an alternative to this, I&#x27;d recommend researching red raspberry seed oil, which has a very high SPF, even when diluted.  I already make my own toothpaste, shampoo, and insect repellant, guess I&#x27;ll add sunscreen to the list next summer.</li>
            <li> It works, but leaves a pasty white residue (zinc oxide). It does not rub in even after 30 minutes. I didn&#x27;t burn and no reefs were harmed while I was using the product.</li>
            <li> Was just in Greece for two weeks and had to change products as my usually easy-to-tan skin burned and even got a touch of sun poisoning from this stuff.  I re-applied after swimming in sea and still burned.  Try something else.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I am very fair, and am able to get some color without burning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product so when I snorkeled I knew I was not damaging the ocean life that I love to view.  I mixed a little raspberry seed oil in as it is a natural sunscreen.  Spread well and evenly.  Reapplied after snorkeling and was protected the entire afternoon.  Good product and not harmful to sealife.</li>
            <li> I bought this products for a dive trip - do not want to pollute the ocean with chemicals. But I have to say it&#x27;s hard to absorb. Friends were constantly pointing out to me white spots all over my face.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased in Florida when on vacation several years ago.  At the time we bought SPF 8.  It did a GREAT job of allowing us to get a tan and not burn.  I have since bought SPF 25 - too thick but great, and now SPF 15.  I am looking forward to the coverage and sun exposure without the UV effects.  Also, love the fact that it is full of natural ingredients.  Lasts a long time and does much more than over-the -counter products.</li>
            <li> Fantastic sunscreen.  Goes on easy, smell good (coconut scent), protects well, and doesn&#x27;t harm you or the environment.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The size was a little small for the price and the smell was not as good as it could be, but I wanted a natural or organic sunscreen</li>
