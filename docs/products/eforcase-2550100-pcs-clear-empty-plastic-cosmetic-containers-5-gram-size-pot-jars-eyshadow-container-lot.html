            <li>They are the perfect size but hard to open after I put my stuff in it.</li>
            <li>It is kind of difficult to judge size just by a picture and description of you have never used these before, but I have to say their tiny size (which was unexpected) was a happy surprise and very useful.</li>
            <li>Not going to make a huge deal and request a tiny replacement lid.</li>
            <li>thinking about collecting different types of soil in the others or something because i think i have about 75 of these containers now and maybe about 10 filled.</li>

            <li>A little smaller than I thought it&#x27;d be, but still a good product.</li>
            <li>and i wanted something to collect dead bugs in that they could look at up close and still preserve the bugs for many viewings.</li>
            <li>foggy and scratched u p, doesnt look new</li>
            <li>I drill four small holes on the top lid  and fill the bottom with cotton plates.</li>
            <li>The typical use would be for loose mineral eyeshadow, but I used them when creating my own lipstick.</li>
            <li>Plus in the near future I&#x60;m sending my grand daughters these containers with beads and other goodies.</li>
            <li>The top has a hard time closing for a sugar scrub buy</li>
            <li>so far we&#x27;ve got some spiders, a wasp, a moth, and a cricket.</li>
            <li>The small size, the cheap price...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>i got these because i&#x27;m a child development major and have a toddler son who likes bugs, and lil guy that i watch, and another boy on the way</li>

            <li> i got these because i&#x27;m a child development major and have a toddler son who likes bugs, and lil guy that i watch, and another boy on the way</li>
            <li> Bought these to house my Swarovski flat backs</li>
            <li> These were tiny - not what I expected.</li>
            <li> A couple came broken but the rest are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have had them loose in my purse, without any accidents.</li>
            <li> I bought the 25 piece pack and have about half of them left.  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and yet was still surprised at how small they are!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately one of them somehow sprung a leak and burning hot lipstick went everywhere.</li>
            <li> Small scratches on the outside of the containers, but they worked as they were intended.</li>
            <li> No ideas for what the other ones will be used for.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quite small, so purchase only for small amounts of product.</li>
            <li> Soak the cotton with what ever fragrance you prefer and screw the lid on tight.</li>
            <li> This picture looks like the thick hard plastic (that have the black lids), but these are the regular plastic containers.</li>
            <li> The only problem I noticed with this product is that one jar came with a broken lid.</li>
            <li> However, I was missing one lid (not a huge deal, but someone wasn&#x27;t paying attention when filling the order).</li>
            <li> 2 broken pieces included and one extra  lid.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to make homemade chap stick for my co workers this past Christmas...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that  the lids are sometimes difficult to close</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with these, but they are tinier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I also keep collectible coins and other nick-nacks in them..</li>

            <li> Just as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> great value, great containers, would buy again for sure :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for samples and homemade makeup.</li>
            <li> Great trial size containers for home made eye creams, lip glosses and more.</li>
            <li> Product is great for my samples.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it&#x27;d be, but still a good product.</li>
            <li> perfect size and just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> These are cute little jars that are a great size for depotting makeup. I was using them to depot lipsticks into. Unfortunately one of them somehow sprung a leak and burning hot lipstick went everywhere. These might be good for other things, but I probably will go with something else for this purpose next time.</li>
            <li> Some of them were cracked!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Small scratches on the outside of the containers, but they worked as they were intended.</li>
            <li> I love these mini sample jars. They hold more product than you think. Wonderful way to sample lip balm, eye cream, lotion and other beauty products. I love them for travel as well</li>
            <li> They  worked perfectly for what I wanted - good quality</li>
            <li> foggy and scratched u p, doesnt look new</li>
            <li> The only problem I noticed with this product is that one jar came with a broken lid. Otherwise, they were just what I needed to keep my makeup stored for later use. They&#x27;re quite small, so purchase only for small amounts of product.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and yet was still surprised at how small they are!  I&#x27;m using them to put seeds in for preschool science.  They&#x27;re an ok size for that but I wish they were just a bit bigger so I could add different kinds of seeds (like nuts).  All the lids had bottoms so that was a good thing.  I bought the 25 piece pack and have about half of them left.  No ideas for what the other ones will be used for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for beauty samples! Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with these, but they are tinier than I expected.  They fit well into a purse, though!</li>
            <li> These worked out perfect for making lip balm with my daughters!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to make homemade chap stick for my co workers this past Christmas... the goal was a cheap yet nice gift, and these containers were perfect. I shopped around a bit before purchasing and I&#x27;m glad I got these. The small size, the cheap price... they worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> It is kind of difficult to judge size just by a picture and description of you have never used these before, but I have to say their tiny size (which was unexpected) was a happy surprise and very useful. However, I was missing one lid (not a huge deal, but someone wasn&#x27;t paying attention when filling the order). Not going to make a huge deal and request a tiny replacement lid. Thus the four stars. Otherwise, amazing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for chapstick and left over makeup at bottom of tubes.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I had to purchase 25 at a time.</li>
            <li> These were tiny - not what I expected. However, they DO meet the product description, so it was buyer error, not vendor error.</li>
            <li> i got these because i&#x27;m a child development major and have a toddler son who likes bugs, and lil guy that i watch, and another boy on the way and i wanted something to collect dead bugs in that they could look at up close and still preserve the bugs for many viewings. so far we&#x27;ve got some spiders, a wasp, a moth, and a cricket. my son is 2.5y and the night that i showed him the spider he refused to let it go and he fell asleep with it. i had to fish it out of bed when he was asleep! so i guess it&#x27;s a win. thinking about collecting different types of soil in the others or something because i think i have about 75 of these containers now and maybe about 10 filled.</li>
            <li> Suites my needs. Came as advertised, tops &amp; bottoms.</li>
            <li> Bought these to house my Swarovski flat backs and I am very happy with them. They all arrived undamaged and are just right for what I need them for!</li>
            <li> These are really great and packaged really nice in a sealed bag. I will buy more, but in a LARGER quantity!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my homemade anti wrinkle serum.</li>
            <li> Great little containers for home made lip balm.</li>
            <li> Great for samples of lotion/body butter. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Good item for cheap pricing. The top has a hard time closing for a sugar scrub buy it should do the trick for a lip balm or something.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> These were the perfect size for lip balms. Thanks for the special gift as well!</li>
            <li> 2 broken pieces included and one extra  lid.  This picture looks like the thick hard plastic (that have the black lids), but these are the regular plastic containers. They are ok so far for make-up.  I have had them loose in my purse, without any accidents.</li>
            <li> These little screw top containers have worked out just great! I drill four small holes on the top lid  and fill the bottom with cotton plates. They are used for car fresheners. Soak the cotton with what ever fragrance you prefer and screw the lid on tight. I also keep collectible coins and other nick-nacks in them.. Plus in the near future I&#x60;m sending my grand daughters these containers with beads and other goodies.The containers can be used for just about anything you can imagine. Good Value!</li>
            <li> I plan on using these for lip gloss. They are the perfect size for lip gloss or eye shadow. The lids fit very well. thank you.</li>
            <li> These are great for my skincare business! I can ship capsules of my serum without worry that they will burst.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size but hard to open after I put my stuff in it. Still serving their purpose though.</li>
