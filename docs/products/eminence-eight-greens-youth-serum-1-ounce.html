            <li>This serum is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It is nice that these aren&#x27;t bulky bottles, I believe it helps keep things fresher for your skin!  </li>
            <li>I received it promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I loved how it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>If I were to keep making these kind of product purchases, I&#x27;d probably stick with companies like Eminence or Origins, which use better and more unobstructed ingredients, but the best thing for me is none of them.</li>
            <li>Love this product, not greasy at all, light serum perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li>I love Eminence skincare!</li>

            <li>amazing product.</li>
            <li>It was nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>but my friend was raving about how amazing it was</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think this works.</li>
            <li>Still it feels and smell really nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent serum product, natural ingredients, recommended to me by my facialist.</li>
            <li>This feels great on my skin and seems to give me a fresh glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>This might tingle with first use, but after, it feels great.</li>
            <li>They have better products to try including the washes and cleansers.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Eminence is top of the line in organic skincare.  </li>
            <li>Really love Eminence products, and I will keep using this product for sure.</li>
            <li>Anyone going through hormonal changes will fall in love.</li>
            <li>It feels firmer and more supple.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many types of cosmetics/products: over the counter, sold in spas, or suggested by dermatologists.  </li>
            <li>I felt I was putting water on my face every day and nothing more.</li>
            <li>Love that it is organic and feeding my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this serum-</li>
            <li>it smells fresh and bright.  </li>
            <li>works on wrinkles and acne, what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell also.</li>
            <li>Eight Greens seems to make my oily/combo skin feel more even and balanced.  </li>
            <li>I thought a serum would be more moisturizing than a cream, but no.</li>
            <li>I used it mostly at nights</li>
            <li>I love this serum,I use it by its self</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel dry,or on top of eight greens moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It feels more like gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up on the advice of my gyno (she has a spa) and was happy to find it really works.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this serum -</li>
            <li>Although none of their products have worked for me, I have increased the stars because I believe the company does use better ingredients than that of store bought products and that they truly want to share healthy skin products with their customers.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Starts off with a pleasant scent but once applied it turns funny..</li>
            <li>great texture and super hydrating, little bit smelly but awesome!</li>
            <li>Very light  and smooth to the skin.</li>
            <li>I an an older woman and try to take good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>It normalizes my skin and leaves it feeling soft and amazing!</li>
            <li>It has a smooth feeling to it even though it may seem as if it won&#x27;t spread so easily.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend this kind of money to purchase again, there are other organic, healthy &amp; CHEAPER options out there that are more effective.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend and love love love!</li>
            <li>This is really good, but my skin is sensitive to it for some reason.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all you ladies and gents trying to find the fountain of youth and clear skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is super light, but quite moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Minor funk aside, this is excellent for your skiing in general, and is also great for treating red marks, which are visibly reduced in the morning after use.  </li>
            <li>so nice that it&#x27;s natural too.  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly fair, sensitive skin that burns if I&#x27;m in direct sun for more than five minutes.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Great alone or combined with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>Items were received quickly and 100% as described.</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with cystic chin breakouts and it has helped tremendously with the healing process.</li>
            <li>but thankfully it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Cant live without it!!!!</li>
            <li>This will be my third bottle, makes my dry skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but just did not see any big difference in skin after use.</li>
            <li>Youthful and fresh looking skin</li>
            <li>It took a month of use for me to notice that my cheeks were firmer and my skin looked more clear.</li>
            <li>Have been using Eight Greens for about two weeks and love the way it makes my early 40ish skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I  am still using it and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Diet, exercise, and diy home concoctions are my answer to healthy, young looking skin.  </li>
            <li>What I did like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t made or sold in large batches, which should help keep freshness!</li>
            <li>Nice for a moment, then dry again.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time 10 years ago and have not gone a day without it since.  </li>
            <li>I was 40 when I first discovered it.  </li>
            <li>and I did not leave a comment since I want to use the product first.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am trying this product or product line.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I have been using many products that are considered a good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just pure and natural,like it should be.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice (not greasy or tight).</li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive reviews and seeing this line of skincare touted at a local spa, I was excited about my purchase.</li>
            <li>I found this serum very tacky.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>I did not notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any real results</li>
            <li>and I think this worked very well in preventing the formations of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>For some this line will be gold, for others like myself, not so much.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily or confined now and is starting regain youthful qualities - or filling in the old wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try the Stone Crop sampler kit that contains several Eminence products.  </li>
            <li>I switch back and forth between several serums and creams to make sure my skin gets the benefits of all of them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great product, but expensive and</li>
            <li>My skin was twice as oily than normal with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s no parabens,sulfates,petrochemicals,or harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It makes it super soft when you wake up the following morning.</li>
            <li>I live this product line.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, that is now mature and needing hydration.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m updating this review to be a little more thorough as I have tried the line a second time.   </li>
            <li>Also it irritated my skin (a burning sensation) to the degree that I got a rush all over my face, though I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have never had problem skin until I turned about 38 years old.  </li>
            <li>Very absorbent and results are instant!</li>
            <li>It does seem to help clear my skin a bit, since I have some hormonal break outs (36yrs old).</li>
            <li>This product surprised me.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty paranoid about the freshness of any beauty product, whether in the store or online, you just don&#x27;t know how long something has been sitting and in what temperature conditions.</li>
            <li>I like to use natural products when I can.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t say any good words on it.</li>
            <li>well I used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin for better or worse.</li>
            <li>I originally got it direct from the site and it was a lot more expensive!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strange green gel, looks a little like swampwater, but it smells herbal and pleasant.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and this caused major breakouts for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried around 30 of their products so far and the Eight Greens Youth Serum is a staple in my daily skincare for a year now.</li>
            <li>I am only 21 years old, but I started using this product to help my combination skin in the summer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the product, my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to any beauty concoctions as well as it does to healthy eating, not touching my skin, regular exercise, and using do-it-yourself natural cleansers and moisturizers at home with minimal ingredients.   </li>
            <li>reviews on beauty products can only take you so far because your skin is not the same as the reviewer&#x27;s.   </li>

            <li> I am so pleased that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily or confined now and is starting regain youthful qualities - or filling in the old wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try the Stone Crop sampler kit that contains several Eminence products.  </li>
            <li> I switch back and forth between several serums and creams to make sure my skin gets the benefits of all of them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, but expensive and</li>
            <li> My skin was twice as oily than normal with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s no parabens,sulfates,petrochemicals,or harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It makes it super soft when you wake up the following morning.</li>
            <li> I live this product line.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, that is now mature and needing hydration.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating this review to be a little more thorough as I have tried the line a second time.   </li>
            <li> Also it irritated my skin (a burning sensation) to the degree that I got a rush all over my face, though I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have never had problem skin until I turned about 38 years old.  </li>
            <li> Very absorbent and results are instant!</li>
            <li> It does seem to help clear my skin a bit, since I have some hormonal break outs (36yrs old).</li>
            <li> This product surprised me.</li>

            <li> I like to use natural products when I can.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t say any good words on it.</li>
            <li> well I used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin for better or worse.</li>
            <li> I originally got it direct from the site and it was a lot more expensive!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange green gel, looks a little like swampwater, but it smells herbal and pleasant.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and this caused major breakouts for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried around 30 of their products so far and the Eight Greens Youth Serum is a staple in my daily skincare for a year now.</li>
            <li> I am only 21 years old, but I started using this product to help my combination skin in the summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the product, my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to any beauty concoctions as well as it does to healthy eating, not touching my skin, regular exercise, and using do-it-yourself natural cleansers and moisturizers at home with minimal ingredients.   </li>
            <li> reviews on beauty products can only take you so far because your skin is not the same as the reviewer&#x27;s.   </li>
            <li> Mild acne has followed me into adulthood, and even worse, I don&#x27;t leave my skin alone all the time like I should.    </li>
            <li> Had a strange odor.</li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin feel so youthful.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face so soft that when I was in a hurry a few times I forgot to apply my day cream before my foundation!</li>
            <li> the price is average but a little goes far</li>
            <li> If your skin is feeling dry, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I started using the serum instead of a regular moisturizer due to all of the chemicals in all of my other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky and my face sometimes feels dry a little while later.  </li>
            <li> I use the Eminence Eight Greens Whip Moisturizer with it three times a week, and use a probiotic cream the other four.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I do correlate it with other products</li>
            <li> Did not like this product or the other eminence treatment serum I tried.</li>
            <li> it is very expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I used it by itself in the past but layer it with other products this winter because the air is so dry.</li>
            <li> Never having had skin breakouts in my teens, I was not thrilled to have breakouts in my mid 40s (t-zone).  </li>
            <li> Just an odd smell</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes have faded a little, and my skin looks brighter when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Nourishing your skin now will pay off down the road!</li>
            <li> That was the reason I also bought the Eight Green Youth serum.</li>
            <li> but this seems like a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use a serum type product instead of heavy cream for night time use.</li>
            <li> but it was too heavy for my combination</li>
            <li> The smell is not good and was hard to put on after several times.</li>
            <li> In addition I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell too, though it was not the main reason to return this product.</li>
            <li> Products through Amazon.com are less expensive than the local day spas.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just that.</li>
            <li> Every one of my purchases I buy at least 4 of these.  </li>
            <li> I use to get this awful breakout around my mouth and laugh line area.  </li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle hoping for some results and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Eminence Eight Greens Youth Serum twice now, and twice it has made my skin react poorly.</li>
            <li> I know that it says it can be used as a moisturizer, but I tried to use it in the morning after cleansing and without moisturizer, and it was difficult to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> but since I use it during the day it&#x27;s annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I religiously been treating my face since I was 16, and I have accumulated a lot of knowledge over the years. Needless to say, I have been using many products that are considered a good quality. That was the reason I became a big fan of Eminence. I have been using their moisturizers and masks. That was the reason I also bought the Eight Green Youth serum. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t say any good words on it. I found this serum very tacky. It took a while till it absorbs into my skin. Also it irritated my skin (a burning sensation) to the degree that I got a rush all over my face, though I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin. Of course I stopped immediately, once I realize it is the serum that caused the rush. In addition I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell too, though it was not the main reason to return this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, but expensive and it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> I like this line-- but this seems like a waste of money.  Don&#x27;t even know if it did anything. They have better products to try including the washes and cleansers.</li>
            <li> ok.  Not bad but nothing awesome.  Smells nice but just did not see any big difference in skin after use.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my skin soft and hydrated! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE!!!!!..  I used this for the first time 10 years ago and have not gone a day without it since.  I was 40 when I first discovered it.  I use to get this awful breakout around my mouth and laugh line area.  I have never had problem skin until I turned about 38 years old.  I went to the dermatologist and was told it was acne....What?  I could count the pimples I have had in my life. It would go away for a couple of weeks and then break out again.  This went on forever!  Finally, I went to get a facial and as soon as the esthetician saw it she said &amp;#34;oh, you get hormonal breakouts&amp;#34;.  OMG!!!..she said I have just the thing for you.  She put this on me after the facial and I have used it every morning and night since that day and have yet to get another breakout!...I would buy it by the gallon if I could.  Every one of my purchases I buy at least 4 of these.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I have never found a line as exquisite as Eminence! This moisturizer leave my oily/combination/aging skin feeling wonderful. Products through Amazon.com are less expensive than the local day spas. Items were received quickly and 100% as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this 6mos ago and I did not leave a comment since I want to use the product first. I have normal/oily skin (used summer time). I used this to complement with skincare routine with Amore Pacific Products (from Sephora). This products made my skin plump and moist all the time. It makes it super soft when you wake up the following morning. I did not get any acne nor rashes. I only gave 4 Stars because I did not see any &amp;#34;youthness&amp;#34; claims of anti-wrinkles etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent serum product, natural ingredients, recommended to me by my facialist. I am a repeat buyer and plan to continue to purchase. I prefer the results from Eight Greens over several high-end products I&#x27;ve used. Sixty-something in years, but not my face!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look 5 years younger and keep the skin up until the next facial.  It also tightens and tones and makes the skin glow. great product.  This might tingle with first use, but after, it feels great.</li>
            <li> A must have in your skin care routine.  Youthful and fresh looking skin - I can see and feel a difference within days.  Eminence is top of the line in organic skincare.  I will use this product always.</li>
            <li> Love this product, not greasy at all, light serum perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li> Very light  and smooth to the skin. Great alone or combined with other moisturizers. Very absorbent and results are instant!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a serum type product instead of heavy cream for night time use. I use this once a day, after cleansing, at night. It is super light, but quite moisturizing. My skin feels great, and it&#x27;s not greasy in the morning. It does seem to help clear my skin a bit, since I have some hormonal break outs (36yrs old). Really love Eminence products, and I will keep using this product for sure. I received it promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I started using the serum instead of a regular moisturizer due to all of the chemicals in all of my other moisturizers.  I am so pleased that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily or confined now and is starting regain youthful qualities - or filling in the old wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li> I notice a big difference in my changing skin. Anyone going through hormonal changes will fall in love. Skin looks great.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am trying this product or product line.  It has been about three weeks and I am happy to notice the improvement of my skin.  It feels firmer and more supple.  I also notice that my face is not as oily as I have combination skin.  I am excited to try the Stone Crop sampler kit that contains several Eminence products.  I have tried many types of cosmetics/products: over the counter, sold in spas, or suggested by dermatologists.  I will be reordering this serum!</li>
            <li> An excellent product. I use this nightly as it does have a bit of a freshly-mowed grass aroma that I prefer not to wear around the office.  Minor funk aside, this is excellent for your skiing in general, and is also great for treating red marks, which are visibly reduced in the morning after use.  I use the Eminence Eight Greens Whip Moisturizer with it three times a week, and use a probiotic cream the other four.  Great stuff - buy some now!</li>
            <li> it is very expensive, but worth it! It makes my skin happy and rejuvenated. If your skin is feeling dry, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I did not notice much of a difference.  The smell is not good and was hard to put on after several times.</li>
            <li> great texture and super hydrating, little bit smelly but awesome!</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle hoping for some results and was disappointed.  I felt I was putting water on my face every day and nothing more. I frankly saw no difference what-so-ever. I would not purchase this again nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence skincare! I&#x27;ve tried around 30 of their products so far and the Eight Greens Youth Serum is a staple in my daily skincare for a year now. I&#x27;m on my third bottle. It took a month of use for me to notice that my cheeks were firmer and my skin looked more clear. I also tried the Eight Greens cream but it was too heavy for my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I gave it 4 stars because it does leave a sticky residue on the skin. This won&#x27;t bother you if you use it at night but since I use it during the day it&#x27;s annoying. It helps to use another mattifying product over this serum to help mask the sticky feeling. I use La Mer&#x27;s gel and it works well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite em product!!!! Cant live without it!!!! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product surprised me. It leaves my face so soft that when I was in a hurry a few times I forgot to apply my day cream before my foundation! Love that it is organic and feeding my skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing!  I have been dealing with cystic chin breakouts and it has helped tremendously with the healing process. I originally got it direct from the site and it was a lot more expensive!  Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Had a strange odor. I&#x27;ve bought this before from a salon and it didn&#x27;t have that funky smell. I think it may have expired.</li>
            <li> Love this serum- it smells fresh and bright.  I use it in the morning before moisturizer.  Nourishing your skin now will pay off down the road!</li>
            <li> Eminence does it every time. This is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> This is really good, but my skin is sensitive to it for some reason.</li>
            <li> amazing product. Helps with clearing up and maintaining my skin healty. use it before your moisturizer for that extra boost.</li>
            <li> works on wrinkles and acne, what more can you ask for. the price is average but a little goes far</li>
            <li> well I used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin for better or worse. I wouldn&#x27;t spend this kind of money to purchase again, there are other organic, healthy &amp; CHEAPER options out there that are more effective.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination acne prone skin and this caused major breakouts for me.  My skin was twice as oily than normal with this product.  I am a fan of eminence products but this just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think this works. I still use it because I paid quite abit of money for it so I will finish it. It did not help with hormonal acne as I was told it would be from the eminence store.</li>
            <li> Best product EVER.  Makes my dry skin feel so youthful.  Will continue to use!  Definitely recommend and love love love!</li>
            <li> It make my skin feel and look glowing. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I do correlate it with other products so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just that.Still it feels and smell really nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any real results</li>
            <li> I love the product. This will be my third bottle, makes my dry skin feel wonderful. I love the smell also.</li>
            <li> Have been using Eight Greens for about two weeks and love the way it makes my early 40ish skin feel.  Used Stone Crop serum before and Eight Greens seems to make my oily/combo skin feel more even and balanced.  Will get again.</li>
            <li> I live this product line.  I switch back and forth between several serums and creams to make sure my skin gets the benefits of all of them.  Eminence products are of the highest quality.</li>
            <li> This product worked great! I loved how it made my skin feel. I used this for added moisturizer under my day moisturizer. It was not oily for my skin at all. I have combo skin with pigmentation and I am at that age where wrinkles are beginning to creep up and I think this worked very well in preventing the formations of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews and seeing this line of skincare touted at a local spa, I was excited about my purchase. But after 3 weeks of using it as directed, I have yet to notice any difference in the way my skin feels or looks. I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> I am only 21 years old, but I started using this product to help my combination skin in the summer. It normalizes my skin and leaves it feeling soft and amazing!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, that is now mature and needing hydration.  This makes my skin look and feel great.  Feels nice (not greasy or tight).</li>
            <li> I thought a serum would be more moisturizing than a cream, but no. Nice for a moment, then dry again. I won&#x27;t reorder. I will keep buying the moisturizer which leaves my skin feeling rehydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product or the other eminence treatment serum I tried. I would suggest saving yourself money and skip this step in their daily routine.</li>
            <li> I  am still using it and so far I love it. I don&#x27;t use it every day but I like how it makes my face feel. I used it mostly at nights and sometimes I use it by itself. It has a smooth feeling to it even though it may seem as if it won&#x27;t spread so easily. I use only four drops on my face total. It is not sticky or greasy and the smell goes away after a minute or so. No complaints so far...</li>
            <li> I love this serum,I use it by its self I don&#x27;t feel dry,or on top of eight greens moisturizer. It&#x27;s very concentrated.  It feels more like gel.  I love that there&#x27;s no parabens,sulfates,petrochemicals,or harsh ingredients.  It&#x27;s just pure and natural,like it should be.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Never having had skin breakouts in my teens, I was not thrilled to have breakouts in my mid 40s (t-zone).  I picked this up on the advice of my gyno (she has a spa) and was happy to find it really works.  It clears up any breakouts.  I think it is the phytoestrogens.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so nice that it&#x27;s natural too.  It&#x27;s a strange green gel, looks a little like swampwater, but it smells herbal and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this for a moisturizer after I shower.  It&#x27;s a little sticky and my face sometimes feels dry a little while later.  It was nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this serum - but my friend was raving about how amazing it was - so I thought that I would try it out.  I&#x27;m so happy that I did!  A little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  I know that it says it can be used as a moisturizer, but I tried to use it in the morning after cleansing and without moisturizer, and it was difficult to apply makeup. I just use it at night now.  The lines around my eyes have faded a little, and my skin looks brighter when I wake up. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating this review to be a little more thorough as I have tried the line a second time.   I have incredibly fair, sensitive skin that burns if I&#x27;m in direct sun for more than five minutes. Mild acne has followed me into adulthood, and even worse, I don&#x27;t leave my skin alone all the time like I should.    I have tried Eminence Eight Greens Youth Serum twice now, and twice it has made my skin react poorly. I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the product, my skin just doesn&#x27;t take to any beauty concoctions as well as it does to healthy eating, not touching my skin, regular exercise, and using do-it-yourself natural cleansers and moisturizers at home with minimal ingredients.   Although none of their products have worked for me, I have increased the stars because I believe the company does use better ingredients than that of store bought products and that they truly want to share healthy skin products with their customers. What I did like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t made or sold in large batches, which should help keep freshness! I&#x27;m pretty paranoid about the freshness of any beauty product, whether in the store or online, you just don&#x27;t know how long something has been sitting and in what temperature conditions. It is nice that these aren&#x27;t bulky bottles, I believe it helps keep things fresher for your skin!  If I were to keep making these kind of product purchases, I&#x27;d probably stick with companies like Eminence or Origins, which use better and more unobstructed ingredients, but the best thing for me is none of them. Diet, exercise, and diy home concoctions are my answer to healthy, young looking skin.  For some this line will be gold, for others like myself, not so much. I say you have to try it for yourself, reviews on beauty products can only take you so far because your skin is not the same as the reviewer&#x27;s.   Good luck to all you ladies and gents trying to find the fountain of youth and clear skin.</li>
            <li> Starts off with a pleasant scent but once applied it turns funny.. Just an odd smell but thankfully it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it before and was happy to find it on line to order again.  I an an older woman and try to take good care of my skin. I like to use natural products when I can.  This feels great on my skin and seems to give me a fresh glow to my skin. I used it by itself in the past but layer it with other products this winter because the air is so dry.</li>
