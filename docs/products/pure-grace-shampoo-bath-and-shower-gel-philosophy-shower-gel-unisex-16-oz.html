            <li>It is very nice and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Amazing Grace but decided to try this scent.  </li>

            <li>skin, nice lather.  </li>
            <li>It is not too much, it is the very very very best scent for me.</li>
            <li>Except I would say it&#x27;s the platonic ideal of soap-and-water smell, in that I have never come across soap and water that smelled so pretty.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, very clean, wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the scent!  </li>
            <li>She loves it - smells good, gets her body and hair clean.</li>
            <li>Nordstrom told me I might not be able to get it, so I was glad to find it online and received it very quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just refreshing.</li>
            <li>No one will ever question whether or not you showered,  that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this purchase and seller.</li>
            <li>Love this product and I will buy more ASAP,</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love mixing this with EVERYTHING.  </li>
            <li>I love all of Philosophy&#x27;s products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love, love  this bath gel.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>And the smell is nice and light.</li>
            <li>I went home and made dinner, and in the course of making dinner, washed my hands many times, and I could still smell the lotion on my hands after that.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this bath gel.</li>
            <li>and I love the way this goes on the skin.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li>It is definitely better to layer.</li>
            <li>I love the way I smell.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>would not be without it, love it.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>this makes me smell so good and my skin is soft too, my grand children always tell me I smell good after I use</li>
            <li>This one is wonderful, clean, soft and no allergy problems.</li>
            <li>, it makes me feel and smell clean, it foams nicely with my shower sponge.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I loved the clean, fresh smell!</li>
            <li>not the original fragrance I remember !</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy &amp; Amazon offers a very nice price.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the Pure Grace I&#x27;ve loved for years.  </li>
            <li>I think most people would enjoy it.</li>
            <li>this product has a creamy and lovely wash of foam and it smells simply fabulous...</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is very clean and light.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance in the Philosophy line because it is light, clean smelling, and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Love how it smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>you felling smooth and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;Ccrisy Hill</li>
            <li>She will enjoy using it after the Holidays.</li>
            <li>Philosophy makes great products, especially in their bath care line.  </li>
            <li>It is clean and scented lightly.  </li>
            <li>kind of an older smell.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Fresh scent!</li>
            <li>First time user of Philosophy products and I am so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>The light, sweet scent and the skin-nourishing benefits of philosophy&#x27;s lotion is well known.</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace fresh, clean smell!  </li>
            <li>Smells clean, not perfumery.</li>
            <li>but I have used it as a shampoo in a pinch and my hair comes out clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>Leaves it totally clean without drying it up .</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Scent of a CLEAN woman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Goes perfectly with the other two Pure Grace products i bought.  </li>
            <li>I can see what that reviewer is getting at though because this has a clean, sweet smell, but I don&#x27;t think it smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li>I have tried many Philosophy products over the years and Pure Grace is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if would be good for me as a daily shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shower gel has a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>A nice lite natural smell.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell, as clean as soap and water, as crisp as your favorite white T-shirt, as refreshing as a breath of fresh air on a snowy winter night.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh.</li>
            <li>The new formulation of both Pure Grace and Amazing Grace is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better as a shower gel than as a shampoo, but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If your wondering what Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace is like, it is a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell, like a mild soap that doesn&#x27;t compete with the fragrance I choose later.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, but not worth the price really....unless you love amazing grace.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much staying power the shower gel has, but when I was thinking of getting the gel and lotion for my daughter for Christmas, I wanted to first make sure I could stand to be around her when she was wearing it.</li>
            <li>love the fragrance and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>i like the idea of shampoo and body wash in one bottle.i also like good clean smell with no perfumes or harsh dies that could be harmful to us.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and so does everyone I know,they always compliment me on it and it seems to last and last, even better when you use the bath and shower scent too!</li>
            <li>I can only describe it as a refreshing fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Likely I would have enjoyed this one as well had it ever arrived.</li>
            <li>This was okay, but not enough to spend $30 for again.</li>
            <li>I think when people wear the same fragrance all the time, they stop being able to smell it</li>
            <li>This fragrance is definitely appropriate for a teen, but even I would wear it, if I were in to that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Turns out I used amazing grace not pure grace.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean and soft!</li>
            <li>I use the Pure Grace myself but actually purchased the latest one for a gift.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and smells light and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>less linen and more like white rose.</li>
            <li>it smells clean and makes your skin so soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li>The convenience of fast shipping is nice as I&#x27;d had surgery and ran out of my other.</li>
            <li>Smells like watered down amazing grace.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>If your a pure grace gal like me, this is a must have.</li>
            <li>I have used Philosophy Pure Grace Body &amp; Shower Gel for years.</li>
            <li>the Pure Grace brand.</li>
            <li>Looking for Pure Grace cologne.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and using it in the shower</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>Gentle on you</li>
            <li>Its much cheaper here than the beauty stores.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel so ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping this was an alternative to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s gentle shampoo scent.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Our whole family loves this.  </li>
            <li>I would never spend this much on a product that has not proven to be so great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most other Philosophy bath products include shampoo as a use.</li>
            <li>other than I love it, and how can you beat, that it does everything you need it to do.....</li>
            <li>Sad that Philosophy decided to skimp on ingredients and ruin a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>my skin isnt really noticeably soft rand</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light not overwhelming but fresh</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean fragrance and is not overwhelmingly perfume-y.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s suppose to just smell clean but this had absolutely no scent...</li>
            <li>Does not dry skin, I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>the smell doesnt seem to linger that long ( hard to smeel even just after air drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that smelled more fresh and lasted longer, something that hydrated my skin like &amp;#34;skin</li>
            <li>Not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li>Make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 11 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>I mistakenly picked the wrong scent of Philosophy Grace shower gel; this wasn&#x27;t quite the scent I wanted but was still good.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a philosophy fanatic so coming from her, it must mean its good quality!</li>
            <li>I have received other products from the Philosophy line in the past and have enjoyed the quality and the packaging.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a more expensive shampoo but use Philosophy for the first wash and the more expensive one for the second to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>The fragrance itself is not nearly as clean and it doesn&#x27;t last on your skin for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Thought my hair and skin would smell fresh and clean, unfortunately can&#x27;t smell anything!</li>
            <li>It really lathers up well, you only need a little bit on a poof.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> this makes me smell so good and my skin is soft too, my grand children always tell me I smell good after I use</li>
            <li> This one is wonderful, clean, soft and no allergy problems.</li>
            <li> , it makes me feel and smell clean, it foams nicely with my shower sponge.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I loved the clean, fresh smell!</li>
            <li> not the original fragrance I remember !</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy &amp; Amazon offers a very nice price.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the Pure Grace I&#x27;ve loved for years.  </li>
            <li> I think most people would enjoy it.</li>
            <li> this product has a creamy and lovely wash of foam and it smells simply fabulous...</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is very clean and light.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance in the Philosophy line because it is light, clean smelling, and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Love how it smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> you felling smooth and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;Ccrisy Hill</li>
            <li> She will enjoy using it after the Holidays.</li>
            <li> Philosophy makes great products, especially in their bath care line.  </li>
            <li> It is clean and scented lightly.  </li>
            <li> kind of an older smell.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Fresh scent!</li>
            <li> First time user of Philosophy products and I am so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> The light, sweet scent and the skin-nourishing benefits of philosophy&#x27;s lotion is well known.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace fresh, clean smell!  </li>
            <li> Smells clean, not perfumery.</li>
            <li> but I have used it as a shampoo in a pinch and my hair comes out clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Leaves it totally clean without drying it up .</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Scent of a CLEAN woman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Goes perfectly with the other two Pure Grace products i bought.  </li>
            <li> I can see what that reviewer is getting at though because this has a clean, sweet smell, but I don&#x27;t think it smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li> I have tried many Philosophy products over the years and Pure Grace is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if would be good for me as a daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shower gel has a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> A nice lite natural smell.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell, as clean as soap and water, as crisp as your favorite white T-shirt, as refreshing as a breath of fresh air on a snowy winter night.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh.</li>
            <li> The new formulation of both Pure Grace and Amazing Grace is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better as a shower gel than as a shampoo, but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If your wondering what Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace is like, it is a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell, like a mild soap that doesn&#x27;t compete with the fragrance I choose later.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, but not worth the price really....unless you love amazing grace.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much staying power the shower gel has, but when I was thinking of getting the gel and lotion for my daughter for Christmas, I wanted to first make sure I could stand to be around her when she was wearing it.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> i like the idea of shampoo and body wash in one bottle.i also like good clean smell with no perfumes or harsh dies that could be harmful to us.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and so does everyone I know,they always compliment me on it and it seems to last and last, even better when you use the bath and shower scent too!</li>
            <li> I can only describe it as a refreshing fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Likely I would have enjoyed this one as well had it ever arrived.</li>
            <li> This was okay, but not enough to spend $30 for again.</li>
            <li> I think when people wear the same fragrance all the time, they stop being able to smell it</li>
            <li> This fragrance is definitely appropriate for a teen, but even I would wear it, if I were in to that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Turns out I used amazing grace not pure grace.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean and soft!</li>
            <li> I use the Pure Grace myself but actually purchased the latest one for a gift.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and smells light and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> less linen and more like white rose.</li>
            <li> it smells clean and makes your skin so soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li> The convenience of fast shipping is nice as I&#x27;d had surgery and ran out of my other.</li>
            <li> Smells like watered down amazing grace.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> If your a pure grace gal like me, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> I have used Philosophy Pure Grace Body &amp; Shower Gel for years.</li>
            <li> the Pure Grace brand.</li>
            <li> Looking for Pure Grace cologne.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and using it in the shower</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Gentle on you</li>
            <li> Its much cheaper here than the beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this product.  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel so ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping this was an alternative to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s gentle shampoo scent.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Our whole family loves this.  </li>
            <li> I would never spend this much on a product that has not proven to be so great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most other Philosophy bath products include shampoo as a use.</li>
            <li> other than I love it, and how can you beat, that it does everything you need it to do.....</li>
            <li> Sad that Philosophy decided to skimp on ingredients and ruin a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> my skin isnt really noticeably soft rand</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light not overwhelming but fresh</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean fragrance and is not overwhelmingly perfume-y.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s suppose to just smell clean but this had absolutely no scent...</li>
            <li> Does not dry skin, I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> the smell doesnt seem to linger that long ( hard to smeel even just after air drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that smelled more fresh and lasted longer, something that hydrated my skin like &amp;#34;skin</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and not too light.</li>
            <li> Make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 11 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> I mistakenly picked the wrong scent of Philosophy Grace shower gel; this wasn&#x27;t quite the scent I wanted but was still good.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a philosophy fanatic so coming from her, it must mean its good quality!</li>
            <li> I have received other products from the Philosophy line in the past and have enjoyed the quality and the packaging.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a more expensive shampoo but use Philosophy for the first wash and the more expensive one for the second to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> The fragrance itself is not nearly as clean and it doesn&#x27;t last on your skin for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Thought my hair and skin would smell fresh and clean, unfortunately can&#x27;t smell anything!</li>
            <li> It really lathers up well, you only need a little bit on a poof.  </li>
            <li> this is infused with vitamin E, aloe, and other natural extracts, the antioxidant-rich formula moisturizes and soothes skin, leaving it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last a very long time even with 3 adults using it.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This 3-in1 product leaves my hair too soft, limp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, not even my legs</li>
            <li> Too expensive and nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, which is why I usually avoid anything scented, but this stuff didn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not worth the extra money difference from their other shampoo/bath products.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion it does everything it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would like is if the fragrance lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I think I will be buying another bottle of this after it&#x27;s finally gone.</li>
            <li> I came in when expected and</li>
            <li> I have even used it as shampoo, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it layers well with other scents, or all on</li>
            <li> My hair is tends to be a little dry</li>
            <li> Pure grace has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my face with an all-over slight itch soon after use.</li>
            <li> I use this with the lotion, spray oil and a few squirts of the perfume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy perfume smell, which I like.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few Philosophy products I buy.</li>
            <li> not like the other pure grace I have purchased elsewhere:(</li>
            <li> Did not have the smell or sudsy consistency that I had noticed in the past must have changed the formula.</li>
            <li> the only body wash Ill be using for some time to come</li>
            <li> Very thick and produces a lot of suds.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies and am unable to use almost all scents.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong getting this product as well as the lotion and the body</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like some weird smell almost how bleach fumes burn my sinuses.</li>
            <li> Sorry Philosophy</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Too bad philosophy changed this product.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this fragance, buy some, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Usually I hate them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If your a pure grace gal like me, this is a must have. Gives you a great shower experience. Leaves skin clean and soft! Don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get great lather!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and love it!!!! recommend it to anyone who asks! Love how it smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It is as good as its name implies - Grace. The fragrence is light and it makes my skin feel wonderful. Worth every penny! Great product.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best scent I&#x27;ve ever bought in a shower gel. And, believe me, I buy A LOT of fragranced shower gels and body lotions. It&#x27;s just refreshing. Not too heavy and not too light. I can only describe it as a refreshing fresh scent. No one will ever question whether or not you showered,  that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Too bad philosophy changed this product. No longer on their website.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this purchase and seller. Mailed and packed in a timely fashion, product&lt;br /&gt;was as described. Would buy from this seller again.  If your wondering what Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace is like, it is a light, clean scent. I have even used it as shampoo, a little goes a long way. If you want a \\&quot;perfumed\\&quot; smell, this is not for you, it layers well with other scents, or all on it&#x27;s own.  The lotion makes your skin smell and feel good.</li>
            <li> Smells like watered down amazing grace.  Lathers well, but not worth the price really....unless you love amazing grace.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I will buy more ASAP, Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks!  Good service!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and soft.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the scent!  I have allergies and am unable to use almost all scents.  This one is wonderful, clean, soft and no allergy problems.</li>
            <li> Love this product. In my opinion it does everything it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would like is if the fragrance lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on December 10 via Amazon Prime, with intent to provide it as a Christmas gift on December 21. A tracking number was never provided, and every time I logged on to check on status it said &amp;#34;shipped.&amp;#34; I was never notified of a back order or unavailability status. After some effort I did contact the seller and found that the product had been on back order for an indeterminate amount of time. Had I know this at the time of purchase, I would have used a different supplier. I have received other products from the Philosophy line in the past and have enjoyed the quality and the packaging. Likely I would have enjoyed this one as well had it ever arrived. Still waiting.</li>
            <li> This was okay, but not enough to spend $30 for again.</li>
            <li> Did not have the smell or sudsy consistency that I had noticed in the past must have changed the formula. Would not spend the money again.</li>
            <li> Very good body wash leaves you felling smooth and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;Ccrisy Hill</li>
            <li> I mistakenly picked the wrong scent of Philosophy Grace shower gel; this wasn&#x27;t quite the scent I wanted but was still good.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance and leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> This is my mom&#x27;s fav scent &amp; she needed bath soap so I got her this for her birthday &amp; she told me she loves it! She&#x27;s a philosophy fanatic so coming from her, it must mean its good quality! XD</li>
            <li> I love this product! Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and smells light and clean.</li>
            <li> not the original fragrance I remember !</li>
            <li> smells awesome and i hear it can make your hair grow back, for guys!</li>
            <li> This was a gift. I have tried many Philosophy products over the years and Pure Grace is one of my favorites. It has a fresh, clean fragrance and is not overwhelmingly perfume-y.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not worth the extra money difference from their other shampoo/bath products.  It does not last.  All of their scents seem to last just while you are using them.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair and body feel look and smell so clean best product ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love mixing this with EVERYTHING.  It makes your body feel like it just came out of the drier after soaking in fabric softener for a day or so.  You gotta try it to get it.</li>
            <li> !Smells good and the suds are incredible. Great for a bubblebath</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love all of Philosophy&#x27;s products and this one is no exception. It really does a good job with cleaning and it also smells wonderful. Great company with lots of great products!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the Pure Grace I&#x27;ve loved for years.  The new formulation of both Pure Grace and Amazing Grace is nothing like the original. The fragrance itself is not nearly as clean and it doesn&#x27;t last on your skin for more than a few minutes.  Sad that Philosophy decided to skimp on ingredients and ruin a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best bath / shower gel ever! I will never use another product. I am a Philosphy girl for life. Smells great.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift and then changed my mind and kept it for myself.  I really like the smell and using it in the shower keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s suppose to just smell clean but this had absolutely no scent...not like the other pure grace I have purchased elsewhere:(</li>
            <li> I have used Philosophy Pure Grace Body &amp; Shower Gel for years. Most other Philosophy bath products include shampoo as a use. I was very happy to find they now make shampoo. I only use this for shampoo and have my separate body wash. Sometimes I use a more expensive shampoo but use Philosophy for the first wash and the more expensive one for the second to make it last longer. Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma with lots of lather. Smells clean, not perfumery. Had used this years ago and decided to go back. The convenience of fast shipping is nice as I&#x27;d had surgery and ran out of my other.</li>
            <li> I have always used Amazing Grace but decided to try this scent.  I love it.  It is clean and scented lightly.  Great for summertime.</li>
            <li> this makes me smell so good and my skin is soft too, my grand children always tell me I smell good after I use this even several hours later they say so too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it as a shower gel rather than a shampoo but I have used it as a shampoo in a pinch and my hair comes out clean and shiny. My hair is tends to be a little dry so I don&#x27;t know if would be good for me as a daily shampoo. It has a nice clean smell, like a mild soap that doesn&#x27;t compete with the fragrance I choose later. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, not even my legs and I also use it as shaving product, it makes me feel and smell clean, it foams nicely with my shower sponge. I&#x27;ve been using it for about four years and I don&#x27;t like to be without it!</li>
            <li> Love, love  this bath gel. Fresh scent! Very moisturizing. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I thought this was unscented when I bought it, but that&#x27;s my fault for not looking closely enough at the description.  That being said, I still really liked this shower gel. I have sensitive skin, which is why I usually avoid anything scented, but this stuff didn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin at all. And the smell is nice and light. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I think I will be buying another bottle of this after it&#x27;s finally gone.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace fresh, clean smell!  You can&#x27;t go wrong getting this product as well as the lotion and the body spritz as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this again! This shower gel has a light, fresh scent. It is perfect for all our mid-western seasons</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this fragance, buy some, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It has a nice clean scent.  You will get many complements!</li>
            <li> Loved this product! First time user of Philosophy products and I am so glad I tried it. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and she liked it! Will order it again.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this product....other than I love it, and how can you beat, that it does everything you need it to do.....Great, great  product.......</li>
            <li> Nice scent.  Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> My favorite shower item!</li>
            <li> Third time I have purchased for my daughter.  She loves this product.</li>
            <li> My Daughter enjoys using Philosophy Products, esp. the Pure Grace brand. I buy it for a gift each Christmas. She will enjoy using it after the Holidays.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I used it on vacation...well I thought I did. Turns out I used amazing grace not pure grace. Pure grace has a weird smell. When I take a shower with it it&#x27;s like some weird smell almost how bleach fumes burn my sinuses. However amazing grace was great. A nice lite natural smell.</li>
            <li> People describe this as a soap-and-water smell, and I would agree with that. Except I would say it&#x27;s the platonic ideal of soap-and-water smell, in that I have never come across soap and water that smelled so pretty. I don&#x27;t even like fragrances. Usually I hate them. Someone said it smells like baby powder, and that worried me because I can&#x27;t stand the smell of baby powder and I wouldn&#x27;t want to have my daughter around me smelling like that. I might have a flashback and think she needed her dydies changed. (JK, I never put baby powder on my babies.) I can see what that reviewer is getting at though because this has a clean, sweet smell, but I don&#x27;t think it smells like baby powder. I don&#x27;t know how much staying power the shower gel has, but when I was thinking of getting the gel and lotion for my daughter for Christmas, I wanted to first make sure I could stand to be around her when she was wearing it. So I went by the store after work and sampled the lotion. I went home and made dinner, and in the course of making dinner, washed my hands many times, and I could still smell the lotion on my hands after that. I think when people wear the same fragrance all the time, they stop being able to smell it **and that&#x27;s when they put on a ton and torture the rest of us  ;-P  This fragrance is definitely appropriate for a teen, but even I would wear it, if I were in to that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this bath gel.</li>
            <li> Smaller bottle than they sell at bed bath &amp; beyond or wherever, idk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Light scent, perfect for everyone!  Gentle on you skin, nice lather.  Last a very long time even with 3 adults using it.</li>
            <li> Goes perfectly with the other two Pure Grace products i bought.  Very thick and produces a lot of suds.  Make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> i like the idea of shampoo and body wash in one bottle.i also like good clean smell with no perfumes or harsh dies that could be harmful to us. i would recommend this product to my friends and family.and also arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Sorry Philosophy but I am not a fan of this product!  It does not work as a shampoo - it leaves my hair feeling gross and course and I don&#x27;t like the smell of it for a body wash.</li>
            <li> bought for a friend&#x27;s birthday...she loved it!</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing . Its much cheaper here than the beauty stores. The fragrance is light not overwhelming but fresh and I love the way this goes on the skin. Leaves it totally clean without drying it up . Absolutely amazing! the only body wash Ill be using for some time to come</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this product.  It is very nice and not too strong.  I think most people would enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and scent. It was cheaper per oz than the larger size.</li>
            <li> Same product you buy at the store at a cheaper price. I came in when expected and packaging was good.</li>
            <li> kind of an older smell. less linen and more like white rose. my skin isnt really noticeably soft rand the smell doesnt seem to linger that long ( hard to smeel even just after air drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that smelled more fresh and lasted longer, something that hydrated my skin like &amp;#34;skin so soft&amp;#34; from Avon.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this. It is definitely better to layer. I use this with the lotion, spray oil and a few squirts of the perfume. I love the way I smell. Highly recommend, very clean, wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I loved the clean, fresh smell! Does not dry skin, I will certainly buy again. I use Grace body butter after I shower with this body wash.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like smell and would not recommend it to anyone else. Was expecting a lot after reading reviews for this product</li>
            <li> It really lathers up well, you only need a little bit on a poof.  Love the scent. I have not used this on my hair yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 11 year old granddaughter.  She loves it - smells good, gets her body and hair clean.</li>
            <li> this philosophy 3 in 1 pure grace product is so wonderful.  it smells clean and makes your skin so soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li> would not be without it, love it. Hope to use it for ever. Looking for Pure Grace cologne.</li>
            <li> Use for every shower.  Clean, fresh. Makes me feel so ready for the day.  &amp;#34;Scent of a CLEAN woman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Thought my hair and skin would smell fresh and clean, unfortunately can&#x27;t smell anything! Was hoping this was an alternative to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s gentle shampoo scent. Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful - but....This 3-in1 product leaves my hair too soft, limp. And it leaves my face with an all-over slight itch soon after use.</li>
            <li> This has an awesome clean smell!  It works very well.  Our whole family loves this.  It&#x27;s better as a shower gel than as a shampoo, but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for guy&#x27;s &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; skin. Great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just alright. Too expensive and nothing special.</li>
            <li> The smell is very clean and light. It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy perfume smell, which I like. I tried using it on my hair but I don&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel so I&#x27;ll stick with using it on my body. It makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few Philosophy products I buy. I love the fresh smell, as clean as soap and water, as crisp as your favorite white T-shirt, as refreshing as a breath of fresh air on a snowy winter night. The light, sweet scent and the skin-nourishing benefits of philosophy&#x27;s lotion is well known. this is infused with vitamin E, aloe, and other natural extracts, the antioxidant-rich formula moisturizes and soothes skin, leaving it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This my very favorite lotion product of all time! I love the scent and so does everyone I know,they always compliment me on it and it seems to last and last, even better when you use the bath and shower scent too! I would never spend this much on a product that has not proven to be so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 03-25-13</li>
            <li> Got this as part of a gift.  Was very glad to find it here!  Nordstrom told me I might not be able to get it, so I was glad to find it online and received it very quickly!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent. I wish the perfume lasted longer so to that end, I bought the soap and lotion. It is not too much, it is the very very very best scent for me. Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> this product has a creamy and lovely wash of foam and it smells simply fabulous...i would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy and this didn&#x27;t disappoint!  I will purchase this again in the future. Great product and fast shipping, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Heavenly sent. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy &amp; Amazon offers a very nice price. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance in the Philosophy line because it is light, clean smelling, and not overbearing.  Philosophy makes great products, especially in their bath care line.  I use the Pure Grace myself but actually purchased the latest one for a gift.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend Philosophy to anyone.  It is a quality product.</li>
