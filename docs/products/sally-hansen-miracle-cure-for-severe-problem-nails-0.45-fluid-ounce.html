            <li>great for stops nails from peeling.</li>
            <li>Best not to buy this kind of product for splitting nails.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>It specifically says it is great to stop peeling nails.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and am going to use it for now on!!</li>
            <li>I really love this product, and Amazon is awesome as always!!!  </li>
            <li>Had a lot of hope after reading good reviews.</li>
            <li>The polish is good for adding strength to them.  </li>
            <li>so it works great as a top coat, but if you&#x27;re looking for help with your nails, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Seemed to be okay (and does make nails shiny!)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Users would be really satisfied with purchasing this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy to have them now! ;)</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>This product honestly did not do anything at all and peeled off along with my nail.</li>
            <li>I was always catching it on something....</li>
            <li>I now have nice nails.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t effective anymore.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this because in my youth I had used Sally&#x27;s &amp;#34;Hard as Nails&amp;#34;  with great results</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Miracle cure for severe problem nails is absolutely the best, and I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
            <li>This was ok, wasn&#x27;t really that impressed with it because I did not see a change in my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since decided that the best cure for problem nails would be to forgo all chemical applications ( so called &amp;#34;healing formulas&amp;#34; included)and just go au natural.</li>
            <li>Its strong stuff!</li>
            <li>And it must have the right stuff because my nails are in great condition, strong, and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After over a year of peeling nails, my only and best solution: Eat Jello for a month or two!</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t repurchase, But do love SH.</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I love all of sally hansen&#x27;s nail products, this &amp; miracle growth</li>
            <li>more than others)</li>
            <li>lovely</li>
            <li>so they are more pliable..  </li>
            <li>every since using it, my nails have been peeling a lot more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff  this one &amp; the Gold</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really help with damaged nails but makes your nails look great.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to inform you that this is truly a miracle polish.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to go to the salon every two weeks any more.</li>
            <li>I will be doing this for the next 4 to 5 weeks to make sure I get the best benefit.  </li>
            <li>As one reviewer said, it does seem to soak in as well as sit on top.  </li>
            <li>After the first application of this formula I was very impressed by what looked like a protective coating shielding my much healthier looking nails;however,with each successive day(I followed the directions on the box explicitly)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is fine for many people.</li>
            <li>My best friend owns many nail polish products, including this one and many other SH problem nail polishes</li>
            <li>they started shedding the top layer of nail, but the Miracle Cure soothed the nails and they are now good as new!</li>
            <li>BUT most importantly this &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; does not have toluene and formaldehyde  </li>
            <li>The original formulation of Miracle Cure did work but it contained substances that caused injury to many users.</li>
            <li>As a result, my nails tend to peel or break easily.</li>
            <li>I stopped biting them, yet they weren&#x27;t growing &amp; would tear easy.</li>
            <li>My nails have ridges in them and they easily split.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still loving this product for the protection it gives my nails but be aware that it will not change your nails permanently.  </li>
            <li>If used properly it works great in helping the strengthening of your nails.</li>
            <li>The really are amazing if your trying to grow your nails &amp; have issues with them.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, does what it says &amp; that is the important part.&lt;br /&gt;Jenni</li>
            <li>Now I have length and super strong nails again.</li>
            <li>Original Review</li>
            <li>Certainly worth trying!</li>
            <li>I have now been using it for 2 months and for the first time in my life I have been able to grow out my nails.</li>
            <li>Waiting to give the entire bottle a good try.</li>
            <li>their guarantee is bogus - they only give you a coupon good for another product, and they recommend one 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging and the bottle is very devine</li>
            <li>This has improved my nails tremendously in three weeks.  </li>
            <li>After using this product I am able to grow out long, strong nails!</li>
            <li>It really works, in less than a month my nail was strong and beautiful</li>
            <li>This has proven more effective than expected!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and dries really fast</li>
            <li>Nailtiques will forever be my holy grail problem nail solver--it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I stopped getting gel nails for the first time in many years and this was the first thing that really seemed to make a difference in strengthening my nails.</li>
            <li>“Kind of freaky, it soaks into the nail at the same time sits on tops of the nail strengthen it</li>
            <li>that right</li>
            <li>Or you could just use nail polish remover that will dry out your nails even more!</li>
            <li>It still peels off, just like my super cheap clear polish.  </li>
            <li>Although as a man I do not ordinarily like nail polish this works fine in protecting them.</li>
            <li>Nails are not so soft and easy to break.  </li>
            <li>not my first time using this</li>
            <li>The current formula is better than using nothing</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Sally Hansen Nails!</li>
            <li>First time in my life I have had pretty nails.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that this product does contain two forms of Acetate and Tosylamide/Formaldehyde Resin . . .</li>
            <li>This is more likely a product to be used on a continual basis or whatever problems the product is helping</li>
            <li>(Finally got better with DermaNail the dermatologist recommended.)</li>
            <li>This is the first Sally Hansen product I have tried, but I will not try any longer.</li>
            <li>This product is good because if you put it on under your nail polish it strengthens your nails and when your nails are strong they are less likely to bend, which chips paint.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time my nails actually look healthy and whole.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back to using my good old OPI.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the other reviews I see that there are many people that this product has worked well for.</li>
            <li>If you wash and dry your hand before appling you should have no problem with it (never apply any nail product before washing and drying your hands first it sets in better).  </li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased and happy that I purchased this, as it was very expensive.</li>
            <li>as with any skin/nail care products, be sure to check the ingredients and do a single nail &#x27;patch test.&#x27;</li>
            <li>But Amazon sent me a new bottle immediately with no fuss and this bottle is just right.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is a pretty high maintenacy product--</li>
            <li>just no more vertical ridges, just vanish,  very strong product, has proteins and powerful Anti-Oxidants  </li>
            <li>however I think it really helps a lot  growing the nail bed</li>
            <li>Applied second coat this morning (12/15) as instructed and I haven&#x27;t been at my keyboard more than 2 hours and the tips of my nails are most definitely peeling and chipping only this time</li>
            <li>After using too much nail polish which ruined my nails, I tried Sally Hansen Miracle Cure for Severe Problem Nails -</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>I really would not recommend this.</li>
            <li>Yes, it shines up your nails really well and seals any peeling</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my nails.</li>
            <li>really makes my nails stronger</li>
            <li>” Seems like she really likes it.</li>
            <li>I have very brittle nails, and put it on every day.</li>
            <li>It really made a difference.</li>
            <li>It really has made my nails stronger.  </li>
            <li>I had really hoped this would work.  </li>
            <li>This stuff worked very well for me...</li>
            <li>It dries fast and stays shiny too.  </li>
            <li>They also have vertical ridges and one of them has started to split vertically even though I don&#x27;t see much of a ridge in the area.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m very much into holistic living and natural cures I&#x27;ve decided to clean up my act nutritionally and to use essential oils to improve the condition of my nails.</li>
            <li>my nails became even more brittle and started peeling in spots where I hadn&#x27;t previously had problems.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item to ladies</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I paid around 8 dollars for this product with high hopes this would end my chipping, bending and cracked nails.</li>
            <li>After only a week or so, they&#x27;re already better that they&#x27;ve been for a long time</li>
            <li>bottle both work pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>My nails are not hard but they are flexible.  </li>
            <li>But the clear polish used to have a nice pink tinge to it, now it is clear and yellow.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 6 months for damaged cells to be replaced by new nails so be patient.  </li>
            <li>The bottle came in a new box, but when I opened it, the bottle had leaked and &amp;#34;cemented&amp;#34; itself to the packing.</li>
            <li>This polish is a new experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the box even says that it is free of the big three so don&#x27;t be scared to try it simply because it used to contain formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li>After about five days of using Sally Hansen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Miracle Cure&amp;#34;, it became very obvious that my first review was written prematurely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that this product is nothing special, and certainly is no cure for problem nails.</li>
            <li>I have been following the above for about 2.5 months now, and am already seeing significant improvement in my nails.  </li>
            <li>which has the most reviews and is a bit expensive too but might be worth it!</li>
            <li>The first use i could feel and see a major different</li>
            <li>for all I know the bottle is used and refilled with clear polish.</li>
            <li>I was using clear nail polish before but saw this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure so decided I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Be careful cutting nails - some cutters put stress on the nail by flattening it - best to cut nails just after a shower or bath</li>
            <li>It looks like clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>It tells you to apply a coat every two days, but this is just clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>clear polish.</li>
            <li>I bought this in the hope that it would work on my soft, bendable, tearing nails.</li>
            <li>I had bit my nails since a young child &amp; they never had a chance to grow.</li>
            <li>as far as nail products go.</li>
            <li>My nails are soft and there does not seem to be any product that will work as well as I want it to.  </li>
            <li>So far, it is working well.</li>
            <li>will revert to their old ways.  </li>
            <li>now, though, I&#x27;m loving this stuff and thankful that there is a way of protecting my poor, abused nails while the damage grows</li>
            <li>In fact, if I don&#x27;t put it right back on after removing my old polish, the next time they are expose to water for more than a simple hand washing, the trouble starts.</li>
            <li>I love this and would highly recommend this to anyone with peeling, weak nails.</li>
            <li>On top of that, when I attempted to return the item, I am not able to!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other nail repair products in the past and they never seemed to be much better than plain old nail polish.</li>
            <li>This process is particularly at work since the advent of online customer review forums such as Amazon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Only proper, consistent care can do that.</li>
            <li>It would go on clear and then turn yellowish, and was drying out the bare nail surface, etc.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails harder and very shiny!</li>
            <li>This really seems to be making a difference in my nails which have been distressed for a long time!</li>
            <li>Then after a few weeks of what looks like a great response, the nails will begin to peel even worse.  </li>
            <li>so I decided it was time to take off &amp; use my regular clear coat.</li>
            <li>I had to trim all nails &amp; start over using my regular clear coats &amp; oils.</li>
            <li>My thunb nail split right down the middle and never would heal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products from Ope, Nail-tek and other, more expensive items and this is the first one that&#x27;s worked on my nails.</li>
            <li>If your nails are mild, with slight bending or slight cracking but overall healthy, you can surely use this as a base coat.</li>
            <li>My nails have always been strong but I wash my hands constantly and my nails have started to get weak.</li>
            <li>Apparently my nails can&#x27;t handle ANYTHING on them, good, bad or otherwise.</li>
            <li>My nails are thin and break easily, so I thought I&#x27;d try this product.</li>
            <li>you have wet hands a lot (for instance, repeatedly immerse your hands in hot soapy water, or other chemicals for a prolonged time), the shingles can become damaged - the cells absorb water, expand and can curl up (sometimes also contributing to &amp;#34;dished&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A little is good, but be wary.</li>

            <li> As a result, my nails tend to peel or break easily.</li>
            <li> I stopped biting them, yet they weren&#x27;t growing &amp; would tear easy.</li>
            <li> My nails have ridges in them and they easily split.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still loving this product for the protection it gives my nails but be aware that it will not change your nails permanently.  </li>
            <li> If used properly it works great in helping the strengthening of your nails.</li>
            <li> The really are amazing if your trying to grow your nails &amp; have issues with them.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, does what it says &amp; that is the important part.&lt;br /&gt;Jenni</li>
            <li> Now I have length and super strong nails again.</li>
            <li> Original Review</li>
            <li> Certainly worth trying!</li>
            <li> I have now been using it for 2 months and for the first time in my life I have been able to grow out my nails.</li>
            <li> Waiting to give the entire bottle a good try.</li>
            <li> their guarantee is bogus - they only give you a coupon good for another product, and they recommend one 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging and the bottle is very devine</li>
            <li> This has improved my nails tremendously in three weeks.  </li>
            <li> After using this product I am able to grow out long, strong nails!</li>
            <li> It really works, in less than a month my nail was strong and beautiful</li>
            <li> This has proven more effective than expected!</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and dries really fast</li>
            <li> Nailtiques will forever be my holy grail problem nail solver--it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I stopped getting gel nails for the first time in many years and this was the first thing that really seemed to make a difference in strengthening my nails.</li>
            <li> “Kind of freaky, it soaks into the nail at the same time sits on tops of the nail strengthen it</li>
            <li> that right</li>
            <li> Or you could just use nail polish remover that will dry out your nails even more!</li>
            <li> It still peels off, just like my super cheap clear polish.  </li>
            <li> Although as a man I do not ordinarily like nail polish this works fine in protecting them.</li>
            <li> Nails are not so soft and easy to break.  </li>
            <li> not my first time using this</li>
            <li> The current formula is better than using nothing</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Sally Hansen Nails!</li>
            <li> First time in my life I have had pretty nails.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that this product does contain two forms of Acetate and Tosylamide/Formaldehyde Resin . . .</li>
            <li> This is more likely a product to be used on a continual basis or whatever problems the product is helping</li>
            <li> (Finally got better with DermaNail the dermatologist recommended.)</li>
            <li> This is the first Sally Hansen product I have tried, but I will not try any longer.</li>
            <li> This product is good because if you put it on under your nail polish it strengthens your nails and when your nails are strong they are less likely to bend, which chips paint.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time my nails actually look healthy and whole.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to using my good old OPI.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the other reviews I see that there are many people that this product has worked well for.</li>
            <li> If you wash and dry your hand before appling you should have no problem with it (never apply any nail product before washing and drying your hands first it sets in better).  </li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased and happy that I purchased this, as it was very expensive.</li>
            <li> as with any skin/nail care products, be sure to check the ingredients and do a single nail &#x27;patch test.&#x27;</li>
            <li> But Amazon sent me a new bottle immediately with no fuss and this bottle is just right.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is a pretty high maintenacy product--</li>
            <li> just no more vertical ridges, just vanish,  very strong product, has proteins and powerful Anti-Oxidants  </li>
            <li> however I think it really helps a lot  growing the nail bed</li>
            <li> Applied second coat this morning (12/15) as instructed and I haven&#x27;t been at my keyboard more than 2 hours and the tips of my nails are most definitely peeling and chipping only this time</li>
            <li> After using too much nail polish which ruined my nails, I tried Sally Hansen Miracle Cure for Severe Problem Nails -</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> I really would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Yes, it shines up your nails really well and seals any peeling</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my nails.</li>
            <li> really makes my nails stronger</li>
            <li> ” Seems like she really likes it.</li>
            <li> I have very brittle nails, and put it on every day.</li>
            <li> It really made a difference.</li>
            <li> It really has made my nails stronger.  </li>
            <li> I had really hoped this would work.  </li>
            <li> This stuff worked very well for me...</li>
            <li> It dries fast and stays shiny too.  </li>
            <li> They also have vertical ridges and one of them has started to split vertically even though I don&#x27;t see much of a ridge in the area.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m very much into holistic living and natural cures I&#x27;ve decided to clean up my act nutritionally and to use essential oils to improve the condition of my nails.</li>
            <li> my nails became even more brittle and started peeling in spots where I hadn&#x27;t previously had problems.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item to ladies</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I paid around 8 dollars for this product with high hopes this would end my chipping, bending and cracked nails.</li>
            <li> After only a week or so, they&#x27;re already better that they&#x27;ve been for a long time</li>
            <li> bottle both work pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> My nails are not hard but they are flexible.  </li>
            <li> But the clear polish used to have a nice pink tinge to it, now it is clear and yellow.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 6 months for damaged cells to be replaced by new nails so be patient.  </li>
            <li> The bottle came in a new box, but when I opened it, the bottle had leaked and &amp;#34;cemented&amp;#34; itself to the packing.</li>
            <li> This polish is a new experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the box even says that it is free of the big three so don&#x27;t be scared to try it simply because it used to contain formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li> After about five days of using Sally Hansen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Miracle Cure&amp;#34;, it became very obvious that my first review was written prematurely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that this product is nothing special, and certainly is no cure for problem nails.</li>
            <li> I have been following the above for about 2.5 months now, and am already seeing significant improvement in my nails.  </li>
            <li> which has the most reviews and is a bit expensive too but might be worth it!</li>
            <li> The first use i could feel and see a major different</li>
            <li> for all I know the bottle is used and refilled with clear polish.</li>
            <li> I was using clear nail polish before but saw this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure so decided I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Be careful cutting nails - some cutters put stress on the nail by flattening it - best to cut nails just after a shower or bath</li>
            <li> It looks like clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> It tells you to apply a coat every two days, but this is just clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> clear polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hope that it would work on my soft, bendable, tearing nails.</li>
            <li> I had bit my nails since a young child &amp; they never had a chance to grow.</li>
            <li> as far as nail products go.</li>
            <li> My nails are soft and there does not seem to be any product that will work as well as I want it to.  </li>
            <li> So far, it is working well.</li>
            <li> will revert to their old ways.  </li>
            <li> now, though, I&#x27;m loving this stuff and thankful that there is a way of protecting my poor, abused nails while the damage grows</li>
            <li> In fact, if I don&#x27;t put it right back on after removing my old polish, the next time they are expose to water for more than a simple hand washing, the trouble starts.</li>
            <li> I love this and would highly recommend this to anyone with peeling, weak nails.</li>
            <li> On top of that, when I attempted to return the item, I am not able to!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other nail repair products in the past and they never seemed to be much better than plain old nail polish.</li>
            <li> This process is particularly at work since the advent of online customer review forums such as Amazon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Only proper, consistent care can do that.</li>
            <li> It would go on clear and then turn yellowish, and was drying out the bare nail surface, etc.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails harder and very shiny!</li>
            <li> This really seems to be making a difference in my nails which have been distressed for a long time!</li>
            <li> Then after a few weeks of what looks like a great response, the nails will begin to peel even worse.  </li>
            <li> so I decided it was time to take off &amp; use my regular clear coat.</li>
            <li> I had to trim all nails &amp; start over using my regular clear coats &amp; oils.</li>
            <li> My thunb nail split right down the middle and never would heal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products from Ope, Nail-tek and other, more expensive items and this is the first one that&#x27;s worked on my nails.</li>
            <li> If your nails are mild, with slight bending or slight cracking but overall healthy, you can surely use this as a base coat.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been strong but I wash my hands constantly and my nails have started to get weak.</li>
            <li> Apparently my nails can&#x27;t handle ANYTHING on them, good, bad or otherwise.</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and break easily, so I thought I&#x27;d try this product.</li>
            <li> you have wet hands a lot (for instance, repeatedly immerse your hands in hot soapy water, or other chemicals for a prolonged time), the shingles can become damaged - the cells absorb water, expand and can curl up (sometimes also contributing to &amp;#34;dished&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A little is good, but be wary.</li>
            <li> My nails have been peeling on the ends constantly due to having to frequently wash my hands.  </li>
            <li> And any other old nail polish can be used for stopping stocking runs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails between gardening and washing my hands a gazillion times a day.</li>
            <li> Also, with this clear polish as a barrier, red and black nail polishes come off easier without staining the nailbed and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I had finally gotten my nail beautifully long.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail polish products for a long time, and recently, the &amp;#34;Maximum Growth&amp;#34; line.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few days, but so far it has been great, time will tell if my nails will finally grow out,I had artificial nails for way over 25 years, finally got tired of the trip for fills and have been working on growing out my nails</li>
            <li> It dries quick and as long as you put it on kinda thin</li>
            <li> The single coat stays on long, doesn&#x27;t yellow, chip.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a little over a week, but so far, no miracle.  </li>
            <li> my nails got as long as I thought I wanted, I did stop using it.  </li>
            <li> I guess what it boils down to is that everybody has different nails, and personal body chemistry that probably affect how well this product will work.</li>
            <li> Prior to this review I had given this product five stars( I had only used it for a day and a half ).</li>
            <li> I have only one split left (started with 7) and the &amp;#34;dishing&amp;#34; is also less.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both dry and ridged and I could never let them grow.  </li>
            <li> Did nothing for my nails that seem dry and have ridges.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t alcohol dry them out?</li>
            <li> I remove it with nourshing nail polish remove, than I wash and dry my hands and than I apply the the Miracle Cure.  </li>
            <li> but they are dry with areas of sometimes severe peeling.  </li>
            <li> but I can still see the dry, peeling areas after application.  </li>
            <li> that this will permanently heal the dry, peeling areas.  </li>
            <li> If you have EXTREMELY dry, cracked, bendable nails</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a very strong chemical smell (made me cough too) and the chemicals may be bad for the environment.</li>
            <li> many reapplications needed, takes a while to dry, and unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I took this down to my nail place because the house brand wore off in two days with my constant swimming.  </li>
            <li> My short, brittle &amp; splitting nails grew &amp; got thicker in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Nails are very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> and they are much less likely to break even when cleaning or treating them roughly.</li>
            <li> Even without the abuse I just put them through, my nails are somewhere between hard and soft</li>
            <li> And my nails were SHORT, like down to the cuticles !</li>
            <li> Not sure If i have used it often or long enough to tell-</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
            <li> The problem is, when using harsh removers, the nails can be damaged further.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Nails are dead once they see daylight so repair has got to take place before the nail actually forms.  </li>
            <li> I spent months correcting for over use.</li>
            <li> Also nails need heavy moisturizing at least twice a day, even more for thin, peeling nails.</li>
            <li> So, I have been charged for an empty bottle of nail polish!</li>
            <li> not pretty.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products, no difference.</li>
            <li> so I tried other products but still hung onto it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that are supposed to be moisturizing</li>
            <li> Formaldehyde works by binding the nail keratin fibers of the nail, but over-use leads to extreme drying of the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when your hand slips, and you put too much, the polish dries hard and thick.</li>
            <li> Two thin coats will last an entire week.  </li>
            <li> I could feel it and when it dried, I saw no sign of the dry, peeling areas</li>
            <li> Acetone does tend to dry them out, which is why I try to use something less harsh unless I&#x27;m taking off glitter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see just how long they&#x27;ll grow using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s far WORSE because the &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; is taking some additional bits of nail with it as it falls off.</li>
            <li> Ater two week of use, my nails began  crack and split a quarter of an inch down the nail.</li>
            <li> Also got extremely goopy after less than a month!</li>
            <li> I would rate as a half of a star if I could.  </li>
            <li> : \\&quot;This is the first time I have been so unhappy with an item purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what else I can say, empty says it all!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> Which is fine for me because I always use two coats of base coat anyway</li>
            <li> Purchased at a Big Box Store Saturday evening (12/13) and applied a thin coat as instructed.</li>
            <li> In a few days you see the improvement.</li>
            <li> There are chronic medical conditions that can cause thin, brittle fingernails that have those vertical ridges.</li>
            <li> so I bought this product and used it a few days.</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle and immediately was struck with a heavy alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this as a base coat, but it ended up peeling the nail polish off.</li>
            <li> No more harsh chemicals for me.....</li>
            <li> Their efficacy becomes known and they develop a loyal and widespread customer base.</li>
            <li> I hated that strong smell</li>
            <li> I put raw shea butter on my nails usually about three times per day - the skin on my hands is improved</li>
            <li> I usually wear two coats of this polish and it stays on close to a week.</li>
            <li> Later that night I noticed my poor nails were cracking &amp; chipping!</li>
            <li> no more breaks or splits</li>
            <li> I use no more than once every eight weeks.</li>
            <li> I have severe problem nails, and really, I am not satisfied with this</li>
            <li> My nails got very thin several years ago and I tried everything.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions explicitly; apply thin coat every other day.  </li>
            <li> My first bottle was empty and I was so disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Its HARD to take off with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I noticed too late that it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> even that expensive Pink Gel.</li>
            <li> negative 5.</li>
            <li> At least, it did at the beginning.</li>
            <li> But in a week your going to have to chisel off the polish because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> After a few days my nails were a lot stronger!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to NOT read reviews on anything anymore because it&#x27;s pointless!</li>
            <li> No more snagging my clothes with broken nails.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails feel hard instead of thin</li>
            <li> For people with very thin, peeling nails you can wind up with a worse problem after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I suffer from cracked, peeling, weak nails and have been using the Sally Hansen Miracle, Cure for Severe Problem nails and</li>
            <li> Instructions say just use one coat on bare nails, or use as a base coat.  </li>
            <li> I tired it a couple of times</li>
            <li> So now my nails are is worse thane than I started.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> waste of money, and destructive.  </li>
            <li> My Nails are not all Cracked, chipped and broken.</li>
            <li> but I put two because my nails are so thin and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret buying this, I still use it sometimes as a basecoat, but I dont brush \\&quot; a thin layer\\&quot; as directed, I have to use 2 coats.</li>
            <li> so I just make this one the first base coat then put my sticky base coat on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had very weak nails after my son was born and if I tried to grow them out</li>
            <li> Works as well as the expensive products and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> I knew I was doing wrong but</li>
            <li> My nails had deteriorated, badly.</li>
            <li> Before trying this I read reviews on it and seen nothing but bad comments....</li>
            <li> I have had acrylic nails on for over 25 years and my nail where badly damaged as you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I gave it another try, and again was disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s doubtful</li>
            <li> I continued using this as a base coat</li>
            <li> My nails needed help BAD!</li>
            <li> Terrible product for the price</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Was using this to help grow my nails for my wedding, and worked great.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the expensive products and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Miracle cure for severe problem nails is absolutely the best, and I&#x27;ve tried most of them. I&#x27;ve used products from Ope, Nail-tek and other, more expensive items and this is the first one that&#x27;s worked on my nails. They&#x27;re both dry and ridged and I could never let them grow.  After only a week or so, they&#x27;re already better that they&#x27;ve been for a long time</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product. there is a big difference in this compared to the over the counter strengtheners. I think this will be the best.&lt;br /&gt;DK</li>
            <li> not my first time using this however I think it really helps a lot  growing the nail bed</li>
            <li> Not the &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; as advertised. Purchased at a Big Box Store Saturday evening (12/13) and applied a thin coat as instructed. Seemed to be okay (and does make nails shiny!) but then Sunday afternoon began noticing what looked like the start of peeling again. Applied second coat this morning (12/15) as instructed and I haven&#x27;t been at my keyboard more than 2 hours and the tips of my nails are most definitely peeling and chipping only this time it&#x27;s far WORSE because the &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; is taking some additional bits of nail with it as it falls off. Thus the reason why I&#x27;m on Amazon this morning hoping to find another product that will actually be my miracle cure.</li>
            <li> After using too much nail polish which ruined my nails, I tried Sally Hansen Miracle Cure for Severe Problem Nails - they started shedding the top layer of nail, but the Miracle Cure soothed the nails and they are now good as new!</li>
            <li> Did not make my nails stop peeling, even though I applied it faithfully. Also, it is a pretty high maintenacy product-- many reapplications needed, takes a while to dry, and unpleasant smell. After over a year of peeling nails, my only and best solution: Eat Jello for a month or two! My nails look great now!!!</li>
            <li> This really seems to be making a difference in my nails which have been distressed for a long time!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has actually truly made my nails grow and become stronger.</li>
            <li> Prior to this review I had given this product five stars( I had only used it for a day and a half ). After about five days of using Sally Hansen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Miracle Cure&amp;#34;, it became very obvious that my first review was written prematurely.After the first application of this formula I was very impressed by what looked like a protective coating shielding my much healthier looking nails;however,with each successive day(I followed the directions on the box explicitly) my nails became even more brittle and started peeling in spots where I hadn&#x27;t previously had problems.I originally purchased this because in my youth I had used Sally&#x27;s &amp;#34;Hard as Nails&amp;#34;  with great results and I assumed that SH was a quality product. I&#x27;ve since decided that the best cure for problem nails would be to forgo all chemical applications ( so called &amp;#34;healing formulas&amp;#34; included)and just go au natural.Since I&#x27;m very much into holistic living and natural cures I&#x27;ve decided to clean up my act nutritionally and to use essential oils to improve the condition of my nails.No more harsh chemicals for me.....lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few days, but so far it has been great, time will tell if my nails will finally grow out,I had artificial nails for way over 25 years, finally got tired of the trip for fills and have been working on growing out my nails I only have 3 or 4 nails still give me problems after having them off for 1 year.  I would buy again</li>
            <li> Damaged nothing in the bottle</li>
            <li> I am disturbed that the Sally Hansen box arrived  in open shrinkwrap. for all I know the bottle is used and refilled with clear polish.</li>
            <li> I have severe peeling and splitting nails. This product honestly did not do anything at all and peeled off along with my nail. Won&#x27;t repurchase, But do love SH. Also got extremely goopy after less than a month!</li>
            <li> Does not work as a cure to brittle nails. It goes on easy and dries really fast so it works great as a top coat, but if you&#x27;re looking for help with your nails, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;product is just what my brittle nails need especially after removing acrylic nails. The first use i could feel and see a major different</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. I noticed too late that it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  Had I realized this I would not have purchased it.  I have been buying cosmetics since Hector was a pup and products that work are NOT discontinued. Their efficacy becomes known and they develop a loyal and widespread customer base. This process is particularly at work since the advent of online customer review forums such as Amazon&#x27;s. The original formulation of Miracle Cure did work but it contained substances that caused injury to many users. The current formula is better than using nothing but it is no miracle cure. By the way, Amazon is the only site I know of that informs prospective purchasers that a product is discontinued.</li>
            <li> this did nothing for my nails...waste of money I tired it a couple of times and I didn&#x27;t see any difference..</li>
            <li> I would rate as a half of a star if I could.  My nails are thin and break easily, so I thought I&#x27;d try this product. Ater two week of use, my nails began  crack and split a quarter of an inch down the nail. So now my nails are is worse thane than I started.&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This was ok, wasn&#x27;t really that impressed with it because I did not see a change in my nails. I really would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> My nails have been peeling on the ends constantly due to having to frequently wash my hands.  I was using clear nail polish before but saw this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure so decided I&#x27;d give it a try.  I followed the directions explicitly; apply thin coat every other day.  It still peels off, just like my super cheap clear polish.  Yes, it shines up your nails really well and seals any peeling but it definitely does still peel. I&#x27;ll keep using it just because...  whatever; I&#x27;ll use something.  It&#x27;s just that this product is nothing special, and certainly is no cure for problem nails.</li>
            <li> My thunb nail split right down the middle and never would heal. I was always catching it on something....This stuff has really helped!</li>
            <li> I like Sally Hansen products. have only had the chance to use it once so my fingers are still crossed!</li>
            <li> Didnt help my peeling, splitting nails. But maybe my problem was iron deficiency, as now my nails are growing stronger since i increased my iron supplements</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hope that it would work on my soft, bendable, tearing nails. Used it for 3 weeks. No result whatsoever. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Been fighting split, peeling, cracked nails for a couple of months now.  This product is the answer.  It not only works over time, it starts stabilizing what you start with, immediately.  Thanks, Sally Hansen Nails!</li>
            <li> My nails are always peeling and breaking. I&#x27;ve used this polish for 2 weeks. My nails have quit peeling. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> this item lives up to its reputation I just love it it works well for me my nails have not bent and fell off chipped since I put it on. I highly recommend this item to ladies</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Did absolutely nothing for my nails. Nailtiques will forever be my holy grail problem nail solver--it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This products works great! I had originally purchased this as a base coat, but it ended up peeling the nail polish off. If used properly it works great in helping the strengthening of your nails. Users would be really satisfied with purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I stopped getting gel nails for the first time in many years and this was the first thing that really seemed to make a difference in strengthening my nails.</li>
            <li> I love all of sally hansen&#x27;s nail products, this &amp; miracle growth</li>
            <li> My first bottle was empty and I was so disappointed!  But Amazon sent me a new bottle immediately with no fuss and this bottle is just right.  I really love this product, and Amazon is awesome as always!!!  Original Review: \\&quot;This is the first time I have been so unhappy with an item purchased from Amazon.  I opened the bottle and it&#x27;s empty.  There is no product inside!  On top of that, when I attempted to return the item, I am not able to!  So, I have been charged for an empty bottle of nail polish! Not sure what else I can say, empty says it all!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Showed up on time but after two weeks my nails are still cracking.  I&#x27;m going to keep trying it though.</li>
            <li> I had very weak nails after my son was born and if I tried to grow them out they curled....not pretty.  After using this product I am able to grow out long, strong nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a nail product before, but I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and it&#x27;s the only product of this type that has ever made a difference in my nails. I&#x27;ve tried so many other nail repair products in the past and they never seemed to be much better than plain old nail polish. This one has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails between gardening and washing my hands a gazillion times a day. As a result, my nails tend to peel or break easily. I needed something to protect them. I usually wear two coats of this polish and it stays on close to a week. That in itself is a miracle for me! It makes my nails feel hard instead of thin and they are much less likely to break even when cleaning or treating them roughly. I sometimes put a layer or two of colored polish over it which works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on this product and will continue to buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for weeks but I have no seen improvement in my peeling nails.</li>
            <li> The product truly strengthened my nails.</li>
            <li> I find that my polish is always chipping but with this product it last.&lt;br /&gt;I am a mother and I am always washing my hands (more than others) so I needed something that would outlast all my hand washing and I finally found it in this!</li>
            <li> My nails had deteriorated, badly. I tried everything...even that expensive Pink Gel. I was about to give up when I read an article that this Sally Hansen product worked for peeling nails. I gave it shot, and three days later I noticed a difference. Now I have length and super strong nails again. I love this and would highly recommend this to anyone with peeling, weak nails.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my nails</li>
            <li> lovely and it takes time to see result .</li>
            <li> My manicurist was impressed how the product stayed on my nails. Waiting to give the entire bottle a good try.</li>
            <li> great for stops nails from peeling. I just used it twice and my nails are now stronger.</li>
            <li> Best not to buy this kind of product for splitting nails.  The problem is, when using harsh removers, the nails can be damaged further.  Nails cells are like shingles. Picking the product off the nails can cause damage by picking off the cells as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have wet hands a lot (for instance, repeatedly immerse your hands in hot soapy water, or other chemicals for a prolonged time), the shingles can become damaged - the cells absorb water, expand and can curl up (sometimes also contributing to &amp;#34;dished&amp;#34; nails - ones that curve up).  Wear rubber gloves when cleaning, wear garden gloves when gardening to avoid trauma to the nails.  Use moisturizer like shea butter, or coconut oil after bathing and washing your hands to help prevent the cells from drying out.  Be careful cutting nails - some cutters put stress on the nail by flattening it - best to cut nails just after a shower or bath so they are more pliable..  Keep nails short.  I have read that biotin may help strengthen nails.  It takes about 6 months for damaged cells to be replaced by new nails so be patient.  I have been following the above for about 2.5 months now, and am already seeing significant improvement in my nails.  I have only one split left (started with 7) and the &amp;#34;dishing&amp;#34; is also less.  I put raw shea butter on my nails usually about three times per day - the skin on my hands is improved too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a very strong chemical smell (made me cough too) and the chemicals may be bad for the environment.</li>
            <li> Read a review that it worked overnight. Not true. Not working 2 weeks later.</li>
            <li> negative 5. every since using it, my nails have been peeling a lot more. waste of money, and destructive.  their guarantee is bogus - they only give you a coupon good for another product, and they recommend one 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!! My short, brittle &amp; splitting nails grew &amp; got thicker in less than 2 weeks. I love this stuff  this one &amp; the Gold bottle both work pretty much the same. The really are amazing if your trying to grow your nails &amp; have issues with them. My nails now, since I started using this, are longer than I&#x27;ve ever had them in my life! And my nails were SHORT, like down to the cuticles ! I had bit my nails since a young child &amp; they never had a chance to grow. I stopped biting them, yet they weren&#x27;t growing &amp; would tear easy. I tried other products, no difference. This is my Holy Grail for my nails. People I haven&#x27;t seen in years can&#x27;t believe my nails. I&#x27;m just happy to have them now! ;)&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, does what it says &amp; that is the important part.&lt;br /&gt;Jenni</li>
            <li> Not sure If i have used it often or long enough to tell- but it hasn&#x27;t hurt my nails! They look stronger!</li>
            <li> really makes my nails stronger</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I put on a coat before and after paining my nails with a color. Makes my nails harder and very shiny!</li>
            <li> Apparently my nails can&#x27;t handle ANYTHING on them, good, bad or otherwise. They split, crack, peel...yuck. Nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li> “Kind of freaky, it soaks into the nail at the same time sits on tops of the nail strengthen it” Seems like she really likes it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really help with damaged nails but makes your nails look great.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a product that strengthens my nails to any degree.  This product is o.k. as far as nail products go. My nails are soft and there does not seem to be any product that will work as well as I want it to.  I&#x27;m sure this product is fine for many people.</li>
            <li> I suffer from cracked, peeling, weak nails and have been using the Sally Hansen Miracle, Cure for Severe Problem nails and it looks like it works!  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks but my nails are not peeling and they are actually starting to grow! I will continue to use this prodcut and will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well. I have very brittle nails, and put it on every day. It really made a difference. It looks like clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> It really has made my nails stronger.  So far, it is working well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I now have nice nails. My Nails are not all Cracked, chipped and broken. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how this works. My nails were splitting on fingers that had been damaged through wear and tear of 80+ years. In a few days you see the improvement. No more snagging my clothes with broken nails. Makes a wonderful polish, stays on even if you do not get to change it often. Nails are not so soft and easy to break.  First time in my life I have had pretty nails. Meets every expectation.</li>
            <li> Tried for 2 weeks. Did nothing for my nails that seem dry and have ridges. Had a lot of hope after reading good reviews. I have ordered OPIs Envy next which has the most reviews and is a bit expensive too but might be worth it!</li>
            <li> This has proven more effective than expected! There are chronic medical conditions that can cause thin, brittle fingernails that have those vertical ridges. For those who have damage from acrylic/artificial nails, this might be a simple answer. Certainly worth trying! Please be aware that this product does contain two forms of Acetate and Tosylamide/Formaldehyde Resin . . . as with any skin/nail care products, be sure to check the ingredients and do a single nail &#x27;patch test.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Nails seem to grow faster and stronger.</li>
            <li> Before trying this I read reviews on it and seen nothing but bad comments.... so I tried other products but still hung onto it. Well, nothing worked!! My nails needed help BAD! Then I remembered I had this and decided to use it thinking it wasn&#x27;t going to help like everything else! It has worked WONDERS!! After a few days my nails were a lot stronger!! It dries quick and as long as you put it on kinda thin it doesn&#x27;t chip! Its strong stuff! I LOVE it and am going to use it for now on!! I&#x27;ve learned to NOT read reviews on anything anymore because it&#x27;s pointless! Just try stuff yourself and see what YOU think of it! Everybody&#x27;s different and has different opinions! All I know is this product worked great for me!! TRY IT!!</li>
            <li> I had finally gotten my nail beautifully long. I noticed I had once stubborn nail that peeled so I bought this product and used it a few days. I hated that strong smell so I decided it was time to take off &amp; use my regular clear coat. Later that night I noticed my poor nails were cracking &amp; chipping! I had to trim all nails &amp; start over using my regular clear coats &amp; oils. Never again! This pthing cost me all my nails &amp; hardwork growing em</li>
            <li> Cures severe problem nails by slathering them in nail polish! I opened the bottle and immediately was struck with a heavy alcohol smell. Doesn&#x27;t alcohol dry them out? It tells you to apply a coat every two days, but this is just clear nail polish. Yes it will harden them. But in a week your going to have to chisel off the polish because it&#x27;s so thick. Or you could just use nail polish remover that will dry out your nails even more!</li>
            <li> The bottle came in a new box, but when I opened it, the bottle had leaked and &amp;#34;cemented&amp;#34; itself to the packing. I couldn&#x27;t cut away or dissolve (with nail polish remover) the amount that leaked so I could open the bottle, so I just threw it away. However, the price is one-third what the drug store charged.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product. I am pleased to inform you that this is truly a miracle polish. My nails are stronger in only 4 days. no more breaks or splits</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and constantly wash my hand.  Nails are very dry and brittle.  Thought this product would be an answer to a prayer but it peels off easier than my nails!  No staying power.</li>
            <li> I have had acrylic nails on for over 25 years and my nail where badly damaged as you can imagine.  I am almost 50 and I don&#x27;t want to go to the salon every two weeks any more. I have tried everything to fix my nails.  I decided to try this one and I have been using it for three weeks now.  It says to apply one coat but I put two because my nails are so thin and damaged.  I apply it every two days.  I remove it with nourshing nail polish remove, than I wash and dry my hands and than I apply the the Miracle Cure.  This has improved my nails tremendously in three weeks.  I will be doing this for the next 4 to 5 weeks to make sure I get the best benefit.  I have read a review that said something about bubbling up.  If you wash and dry your hand before appling you should have no problem with it (never apply any nail product before washing and drying your hands first it sets in better).  If you are committed to fixing your nails than give this product a chance but you have to take the time and do what the instructions try you or it will not benefit you.  I hope you all like this product because it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> My nails have ridges in them and they easily split.  The polish is good for adding strength to them.  Although as a man I do not ordinarily like nail polish this works fine in protecting them.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a little over a week, but so far, no miracle.  I&#x27;ll continue using it, but I&#x27;m beginning to think that no product can do what this one claims.</li>
            <li> It works for me, and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed. It specifically says it is great to stop peeling nails. NOT FOR ME!!  I am taking a cancer pill that is causing my nails to be brittle and peel.  I had really hoped this would work.  I have gone back to using my good old OPI.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the other reviews I see that there are many people that this product has worked well for. I guess what it boils down to is that everybody has different nails, and personal body chemistry that probably affect how well this product will work. I gave it another try, and again was disappointed. I felt as if the second day of having the polish on it would peel, and also my nails still peeled.</li>
            <li> this product does what it promised!&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, my nails don&#x27;t break or tear apart anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Glad I purchased this product~!</li>
            <li> This product is good because if you put it on under your nail polish it strengthens your nails and when your nails are strong they are less likely to bend, which chips paint.  Also, with this clear polish as a barrier, red and black nail polishes come off easier without staining the nailbed and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I had low expectations for this, but I have to say I was blown away. In just two weeks my nails were 10 times stronger. I have now been using it for 2 months and for the first time in my life I have been able to grow out my nails. I am so happy and in love with this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff worked very well for me...I never polished my nails in my life but I don&#x27;t know how I got brittle nails, vertical nail ridges, I used this product for 1 week and ...just no more vertical ridges, just vanish,  very strong product, has proteins and powerful Anti-Oxidants  that penetrate the nail to help strengthen nails from within. Highly recommended. Thank you Sally!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0046MI3SO Sally Hansen Miracle, Cure for Severe Problem Nails, 0.45 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Yep, after years of biting my nails I am getting metrosexual to stop.  I also don&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s butt about what people think.  I took this down to my nail place because the house brand wore off in two days with my constant swimming.  This holds up in the pool and is quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and used as directed and my nails peeled the next day. Terrible product for the price</li>
            <li> I have been using Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail polish products for a long time, and recently, the &amp;#34;Maximum Growth&amp;#34; line. But the clear polish used to have a nice pink tinge to it, now it is clear and yellow.  It would go on clear and then turn yellowish, and was drying out the bare nail surface, etc. So I decided to try the &amp;#34;Miracle Cure for Severe Problem Nails&amp;#34; clear polish. Instructions say just use one coat on bare nails, or use as a base coat.  The single coat stays on long, doesn&#x27;t yellow, chip. Two thin coats will last an entire week.  It dries fast and stays shiny too.  BUT most importantly this &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; does not have toluene and formaldehyde  that dries out the nails and causes peeling and chipping. And it must have the right stuff because my nails are in great condition, strong, and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now getting it sent monthly as an add-on item with the automatic shipping plan (15% discount!). And any other old nail polish can be used for stopping stocking runs.</li>
            <li> This polish is a new experience.  As one reviewer said, it does seem to soak in as well as sit on top.  I could feel it and when it dried, I saw no sign of the dry, peeling areas I know my nails currently have.  I bought this at a local drugstore as an emergency treatment for having committed the unpardonable sin of peeling off my nail polish.  Took quite a bit of nail plate with it.  I knew I was doing wrong but just couldn&#x27;t seem to stop myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the box even says that it is free of the big three so don&#x27;t be scared to try it simply because it used to contain formaldehyde.  But keep in mind, this is a strengthener, not a hardener.  My nails are not hard but they are flexible.  Even without the abuse I just put them through, my nails are somewhere between hard and soft but they are dry with areas of sometimes severe peeling.  They also have vertical ridges and one of them has started to split vertically even though I don&#x27;t see much of a ridge in the area.  Acetone does tend to dry them out, which is why I try to use something less harsh unless I&#x27;m taking off glitter.  I&#x27;ve used other products that are supposed to be moisturizing but I can still see the dry, peeling areas after application.  This is the first time my nails actually look healthy and whole.  I&#x27;m anxious to see just how long they&#x27;ll grow using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s doubtful that this will permanently heal the dry, peeling areas.  Nails are dead once they see daylight so repair has got to take place before the nail actually forms.  This is more likely a product to be used on a continual basis or whatever problems the product is helping will likely return if it&#x27;s no longer being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, though, I&#x27;m loving this stuff and thankful that there is a way of protecting my poor, abused nails while the damage grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 04/16/13 - I can now say that this product works just like it says it does but there is one catch - you have to continue using it or your nails will revert to their old ways.  Which is fine for me because I always use two coats of base coat anyway so I just make this one the first base coat then put my sticky base coat on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my nails got as long as I thought I wanted, I did stop using it.  As soon as I did that, they started peeling and breaking again.  In fact, if I don&#x27;t put it right back on after removing my old polish, the next time they are expose to water for more than a simple hand washing, the trouble starts. Sometimes even after the simple hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does tend to thicken up as you use it but polish thinner fixes that right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still loving this product for the protection it gives my nails but be aware that it will not change your nails permanently.  Only proper, consistent care can do that.</li>
            <li> All formaldehyde nail products work if not over used. For people with very thin, peeling nails you can wind up with a worse problem after a few weeks. Best to do a one week on, three weeks off program.  I use no more than once every eight weeks. Formaldehyde works by binding the nail keratin fibers of the nail, but over-use leads to extreme drying of the nail bed. Then after a few weeks of what looks like a great response, the nails will begin to peel even worse.  I spent months correcting for over use. (Finally got better with DermaNail the dermatologist recommended.) A little is good, but be wary. Also nails need heavy moisturizing at least twice a day, even more for thin, peeling nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 months and not only did this product not help my brittle nails, my nails actually broke and shattered.</li>
            <li> I have used this since it came on the market.  My nails got very thin several years ago and I tried everything.  This is the only thing that protects my nails enough that they don&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> It really works, in less than a month my nail was strong and beautiful</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this on Amazon. I paid around 8 dollars for this product with high hopes this would end my chipping, bending and cracked nails. It doesnt work. At least, it did at the beginning. My nails have always been strong but I wash my hands constantly and my nails have started to get weak. I love the packaging and the bottle is very devine but it is no miracle. I used it as directed and on day 1 my nails wouldn&#x27;t bend or break anymore! I was extremely pleased and happy that I purchased this, as it was very expensive. The next day, my nails started to bend again. I continued using this as a base coat and it wasn&#x27;t effective anymore. If you have EXTREMELY dry, cracked, bendable nails I recommend you do NOT use this product. This is the first Sally Hansen product I have tried, but I will not try any longer. My best friend owns many nail polish products, including this one and many other SH problem nail polishes and she says they do not work. If your nails are mild, with slight bending or slight cracking but overall healthy, you can surely use this as a base coat. It also contains formaldehyde so you may want to consider another product. I don&#x27;t regret buying this, I still use it sometimes as a basecoat, but I dont brush \\&quot; a thin layer\\&quot; as directed, I have to use 2 coats. Sometimes when your hand slips, and you put too much, the polish dries hard and thick. Its HARD to take off with nail polish remover. It says to buy a SH nailpolish remover just made for this nail \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;. I have severe problem nails, and really, I am not satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
