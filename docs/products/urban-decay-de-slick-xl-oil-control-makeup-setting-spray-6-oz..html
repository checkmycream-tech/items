            <li>So glad I found this XL</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After putting on my make-up, I spray 5 or 6 times on top of my make-up with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many.</li>
            <li>This stuff now staves off oil for about 4 hours or more.</li>
            <li>Its help control oil all day long very good.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of helping my make up to last as well.</li>
            <li>The De Slick Makeup setting spray works great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning De-Slick and sticking with the Original.</li>
            <li>and I love the original kind, but this does not work at all like the regular one.</li>
            <li>but i was really expecting more.</li>
            <li>This spray is a life saver for those of us with super oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I used 4 sprays right before foundation (I use MAC studio fix) then apply the rest of my face and spray another 4 then mascara.  </li>
            <li>I spray this on right after a shower and before my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I cannot describe my bliss using this product, Absolutely weightless, and I was a skeptic boy was it ever worth the money.</li>
            <li>It lasts so long and is most definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and while this isn&#x27;t a cure-all it certainly makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I do have to use quite a bit as I produce as much oil as a refinery does.</li>
            <li>and I really think it worked really well</li>
            <li>so i was really looking forward to trying this product.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is a miracle.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>Take a popular formula, add a new fragrance and a few non-active ingredients and mark up the price</li>
            <li>But the fact that this is an extra large bottle 6oz (around $27 including tax) at the prize of a 4oz bottle ($28.00) it was completely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I changed my review rating due to this seller being a class act and refunding my unrecieved shipment and gave me additional $10 credit for my inconvenience , so I&#x27;m giving them a nice rating &amp; while give them another shot next time ( it was a postal problem not the sellers fault from my understanding !)</li>
            <li>Skindinavia\\&quot; on the new boxes.  </li>
            <li>At least Urban Decay has the good business practice to note \\&quot;by</li>
            <li>Buy the regular kind if you want a lasting setting spray, it&#x27;s more expensive</li>
            <li>I purchased this to wear specifically in the summer months when my skin is more oily and i only saw a slight difference.</li>
            <li>I am 30+ years old and have been battling my oily, acne prone, sensitive skin for nearly two decades.</li>
            <li>It completely sets in your makeup all day and you look like you just did it at the end of your day.</li>
            <li>but I only do it after to save it, but now that there is an XL bottle that might not be much of an issue.</li>
            <li>I am actually considering scooping up a few more at this price just to be stocked up.</li>
            <li>Love the Urban Decay De Slick</li>
            <li>It is a major part of my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I bought my first few bottles on the Urban Decay website, but they changed packaging and they don&#x27;t sell this XL bottle anymore.</li>

            <li> I bought my first few bottles on the Urban Decay website, but they changed packaging and they don&#x27;t sell this XL bottle anymore.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t notice drastic change in my makeup lasting or being less oily enuf to make me say i cant live without this product.</li>
            <li> I have used UD Setting Spray for the past year or so, started out because I have really oily skin and acne proned.</li>
            <li> My face would always get super-greasy about an hour after putting on makeup and it was always really frustrating because putting on more powder would make my face feel heavy and caked.</li>
            <li> All in all, a consumer can get virtually the same product for much less (generally priced at $26 for 4oz here on Amazon and Beauty.com.)  </li>
            <li> I use it every single day before applying my makeup and after in conjunction with the de-slick setting powder.</li>
            <li> Other than that, when I spray it after putting everything on around 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning....</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, all it did was make my skin look greasier and clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> Now on the down side it did take about 2 weeks for this to arrive, partially the sellers fault because a week after the order it still hadn&#x27;t shipped.</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin all my life and have trouble keeping my makeup from slipping off from all of the oil.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it does help my face look less oily after a few hours of wearing my makeup</li>
            <li> and I have to do touchups within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I used primer and oil-control lotion and my foundation is not cheap</li>
            <li> Like I said I use this product EVERYDAY before and after makeup application.</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size of De Slick a week ago and purchased the XL size yesterday.  </li>
            <li> It holds my makeup in place for hours without a sticky or heavy feeling!  </li>
            <li> No More</li>
            <li> This product helps to control all the crazy oil throughout the day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and have tried so many products. This product is amazing and by far the best out of all the products I have tried!</li>
            <li> I cannot describe my bliss using this product, Absolutely weightless, and I was a skeptic boy was it ever worth the money. I do have to use quite a bit as I produce as much oil as a refinery does. Great product It is a major part of my makeup routine. Would indefinitly purchase again. It works. My make up feels great and not heavy, love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I am 30+ years old and have been battling my oily, acne prone, sensitive skin for nearly two decades. I work 10-14 hour shifts and do not have time to regularly touch up my make-up.  I have tried numerous products to find something that would stay on my greasy face.  Primers, oil control potions blotting never seemed to help enough. I have tried many brands of foundations, concealers and eyeliners but I always end up having to reapply if I want to look \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and eyeliner, no matter what formula (waterproof, smudge-proof, 24hr etc) always ended up running and collecting under my eyes and transferring to the crease of my eyelid.  NOT ANYMORE! I bought the travel size of De Slick a week ago and purchased the XL size yesterday.  This stuff does what it says. I used 4 sprays right before foundation (I use MAC studio fix) then apply the rest of my face and spray another 4 then mascara.  My face looks much better at the end of the day. I still blot one time in the middle of the day but all of my makeup stays. I still get a bit of shine but all of my makeup is still where I put it.  I have tried it with and without primer and it works the same so it may end up saving a step.  Anyway, all of that to say try this out! Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was cheaper for a larger bottle and I love the original kind, but this does not work at all like the regular one. My makeup does not stay in place at all with this product, I&#x27;ve tried using it both before and after putting on makeup and it just does not work for me. My skin is not even all that oily and I have to do touchups within a few hours. Buy the regular kind if you want a lasting setting spray, it&#x27;s more expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used UD Setting Spray for the past year or so, started out because I have really oily skin and acne proned. This product helps to control all the crazy oil throughout the day. So glad I found this XL size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was great! Product was delivered on time and meet my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its help control oil all day long very good. Therefore, it helps my makeup hold perfectly too!</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin all my life and have trouble keeping my makeup from slipping off from all of the oil.  After putting on my make-up, I spray 5 or 6 times on top of my make-up with this product.  It holds back and absorbs the oil for hours.  I highly recommend this to anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> love this product!  easy to use, works great, no problem if you get it in your eyes, feels good going on, LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> The De Slick Makeup setting spray works great!  It holds my makeup in place for hours without a sticky or heavy feeling!  Would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Not that impress with the result of tris product, i dont know if is something to do with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of time and I really think it worked really well when I sprayed it after putting on foundation then I sprayed it again after applying matte powder.  Other than that, when I spray it after putting everything on around 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning.... my makeup starts coming off about 2 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon.  I used primer and oil-control lotion and my foundation is not cheap so I guess you have to spray it in layers...????</li>
            <li> This spray is a life saver for those of us with super oily skin.  I spray this on right after a shower and before my makeup.  It keeps the acne at bay!</li>
            <li> I changed my review rating due to this seller being a class act and refunding my unrecieved shipment and gave me additional $10 credit for my inconvenience , so I&#x27;m giving them a nice rating &amp; while give them another shot next time ( it was a postal problem not the sellers fault from my understanding !)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and my t- zone area can sometimes look like i poured baby oil on it so i was really looking forward to trying this product. I can say that it does help my face look less oily after a few hours of wearing my makeup but i didn&#x27;t notice drastic change in my makeup lasting or being less oily enuf to make me say i cant live without this product. It helped yes but i was really expecting more. I purchased this to wear specifically in the summer months when my skin is more oily and i only saw a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and this definitely helps a lot! I bought my first few bottles on the Urban Decay website, but they changed packaging and they don&#x27;t sell this XL bottle anymore. Here I pay the regular bottle price for the XL bottle. It lasts so long and is most definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I Have tried Urban Decay all nighter and decided to give this a try considering it was for oil control. However the staying power i find is not as good as the all nighter.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product from my friend who is a makeup artist. It works great! I recommend it to all women who use liquid foundation. It completely sets in your makeup all day and you look like you just did it at the end of your day.</li>
            <li> This product does not control oil.  I have extremely oily skin, all it did was make my skin look greasier and clog my pores.  Do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes the product works, but its basically just a private label issue of Skindinavia&#x27;s No More Shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Take a popular formula, add a new fragrance and a few non-active ingredients and mark up the price and you have Urban Decay&#x27;s De-Slick.  At least Urban Decay has the good business practice to note \\&quot;by Skindinavia\\&quot; on the new boxes.  All in all, a consumer can get virtually the same product for much less (generally priced at $26 for 4oz here on Amazon and Beauty.com.)  I&#x27;m returning De-Slick and sticking with the Original.</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin. This product keeps my foundation matte and flawless for hours and hours. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This De-Slick setting spray is the end all to end alls for eliminating a shiny T-zone. I use it every single day before applying my makeup and after in conjunction with the de-slick setting powder. No shiny T-zone for me!!! I have been looking for this solution for 15 YEARS!!!! Thank you Urban Decay. Now on the down side it did take about 2 weeks for this to arrive, partially the sellers fault because a week after the order it still hadn&#x27;t shipped. But I also did an address change after that. But the fact that this is an extra large bottle 6oz (around $27 including tax) at the prize of a 4oz bottle ($28.00) it was completely worth the wait.I am actually considering scooping up a few more at this price just to be stocked up. Like I said I use this product EVERYDAY before and after makeup application.</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; the best setting spray that I have used. I have tried many.Love the Urban Decay De Slick</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and while this isn&#x27;t a cure-all it certainly makes a difference. It does a great job of helping my make up to last as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is a miracle. My face would always get super-greasy about an hour after putting on makeup and it was always really frustrating because putting on more powder would make my face feel heavy and caked. This stuff now staves off oil for about 4 hours or more. It recommends that you spray on before and after makeup but I only do it after to save it, but now that there is an XL bottle that might not be much of an issue. If I sprayed before and after it might work longer.</li>
