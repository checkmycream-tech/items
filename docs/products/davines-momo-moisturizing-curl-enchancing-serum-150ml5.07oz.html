            <li>I just ordered him his own bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this product 3-4 times now and am a happy, loyal consumer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve chosen this rating because this hair products are the best, I tried it at the beauty salon and got hooked on it, it enhances my curls and leave them soft and shiny...</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, fine, shoulder length hair and this product is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I got turned onto it by an awesome salon stylist and I&#x27;m only using this from now on</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have medium thickness hair that has more of a frizzy type of wavy curl.</li>
            <li>For the price, some drugstore products have worked better for me.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Davines Love Shampoo, the one for wavy and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is definitely more manageable.</li>
            <li>and she uses it, but she doesn&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product from my hairstylist and love it for the curls, however, I have ordered it also through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many but this one satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li>I just love the way my curls look and without to use a lot of the product.</li>
            <li>It is sorta slimy feeling on your hands, but it washes off easily unlike some of the oils I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should stick around with the products that really work for me, and that one is Milk Hair The Original Curl Definer from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, all Carol&#x27;s Daughter products are so good</li>
            <li>If I just let it dry on its own, it&#x27;s not so good.</li>
            <li>I do not like a heavy gel or mousse and this is just perfect.</li>
            <li>I have tried others, but the are far from as effective.  </li>
            <li>This company charged me full price for a product I&#x27;ve been using for year.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, I have thin curly hair and this is by far the most wonderful moisturizer out there.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sending it to my sister in Japan for a birthday gift, only because I love her so. :)</li>
            <li>This is a fun product.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost, IMO.</li>
            <li>I love this serum for my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I liked Davines Momo Moisturizing Curl Enhancing Serum, I don&#x27;t know if it necessarily enhanced my curls</li>
            <li>I love it and how it feels natural not like gel in your hair.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a very hard lesson that I have to learn, is better to stay with something that I know well than try something new that I don&#x27;t know at all, just because is good for many people</li>
            <li>and I received the right product.</li>
            <li>It really gives me dramatic, beautiful curls, and I just wish I could afford to buy many bottles of it</li>
            <li>the best way to use it was on wet hair after shower, and then dry with a blow drier.</li>
            <li>What a big mistake was buying this product just because I read so many good reviews doesn&#x27;t mean is good for me, definitely NOT FOR ME!!!</li>
            <li>lightweight, really promotes curls in my wavy hair!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I use this mostly on the ends of my coarse, curly hair and it keeps them from flying away.</li>
            <li>I was getting the same results or better with Dove leave-in conditioner and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>The first order came to me in a timely manner</li>
            <li>Go buy it elsewhere you will love the product line of Davines especially for curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krabusin</li>
            <li>I thought my hair was so frizzy because was the first time and probably the weather was not favorable for my hair, but</li>
            <li>I am able to blow dry, using a diffuser, without frizziness.  </li>
            <li>Love this for after shampooing my hair, which I do once a week since my hair is so dry and curly.</li>
            <li>My husband, who has REALLY curly hair, loves this product and often &#x27;borrows&#x27; mine because he likes it so much.  </li>
            <li>lightweight but very defining</li>
            <li>I have been looking all over for a product for my fairly curly, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean is good for me.</li>
            <li>With natural curly hair it is just right.</li>
            <li>I think it is at its best when used by people with naturally curly hair (just a little curly), it won&#x27;t work on totally straight hair as well as on slightly curly.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and this really helps to define the curl in a pretty way, without feeling crunchy or sticky or looking unnatural.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have tired (and I have tried many), that effectively reduces friziness.  </li>
            <li>Will keep using this older one instead.</li>
            <li>A decent find</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The combination really does wonders for my hair -- leaving it soft, silky and curly.</li>
            <li>The only hitch is in the directions: &amp;#34;apply the right amount of product&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>Use just a little on a little bit curly hair - and you&#x27;ll have great</li>
            <li>second purchase of this, first bottle lasted a year.</li>
            <li>This tames my wild mane!</li>
            <li>just not sure it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>, one single hair of mine is like 2 times thicker than an average person&#x27;s hair, my hair is naturally curly, and get frizzy very easy.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, very curly hair which I wear naturally.  </li>
            <li>This serum really helps the natural curl that is left in my are now as I am aging.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would let me wear it natural without blow drying it during the summer that would give me a frizz-less beach look.</li>
            <li>The product is a must have for natural (untreated) curly hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and holds a curl.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t work wonders on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and dry and nothing has worked for me</li>
            <li>My hair did not curl as well as it does with other products, and in some spots - I guess where I put more of it that others - it would be stiff.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and the curls stay for several days with minimum upkeep.  </li>
            <li>is like my hair comes back to life, shiny, soft</li>
            <li>I apply it to wet hair, let it dry a little bit, and then blow dry while it has a good amount of moisture left in the hair.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and have been searching for 40 years for a product to take away the frizz in my dry, curly hair.</li>

            <li> I am 65 years old and have been searching for 40 years for a product to take away the frizz in my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and every time I wash and blow dry, the first product I put on is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> In fact, it made my coarse and curly hair dry and frizzy; just the opposite of its claim.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it with a curling wand, and it makes my curls feel really soft and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the thinner, finer side with just a little natural wave.</li>
            <li> the weather is dryer and my hair is looking like a cheap dish wash sponge-scrub, super frizzy, out of control, stiff, ugly...</li>
            <li> When I use this serum, I actually have curls that require little to no further styling.</li>
            <li> I put it on after I towel dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look or feel dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried Davines new curl enhancer and hate the strong smell.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my hair when it&#x27;s wet, and it somehow keeps my waves from loosening and frizzing up while they dry.  </li>
            <li> I put some in my palms and work it into my towel-dried hair after I wash it, being careful not to disturb the form of my curls while doing so (or, voila!-they frizz out).  </li>
            <li> It was less frizzy, but the curl was just not how I expected it.</li>
            <li> I am really frustrated because there&#x27;s no many products on the market that would perform a good job on my hair, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my hair is too thick</li>
            <li> Totally sounds like a joke, but for my hair, with shoulder length thin stands, a bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong, and you shouldn&#x27;t use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t purchase this product anywhere on the ground for less.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is add a little of the Curl Enhancing Serum in the morning and scrunch up my curls.  </li>
            <li> - I won&#x27;t use anything else - apply to towel dried hair and I&#x27;m out the door.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my curly, very slightly frizzy, hair.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper online but not worth the headache of returning &amp; in my case twice to be only sent  the wrong product once again.</li>
            <li> Gets your curls so tight and bouncny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, and a small bottle, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I extend it by adding it to a small spray bottle of water.</li>
            <li> to Curl and this product does just that!&lt;br /&gt;i have used it for  quite few years by now: try it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, though, if it&#x27;s still sold under this name by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The last time I ordered it I received the wrong product</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed, I had to go through the whole process of reordering the one I wanted.</li>
            <li> The product in this bottle was fake -- not real.  </li>
            <li> with this product gets even frizzier, it&#x27;s awful, cannot control it at all, the very first time I used this serum</li>
            <li> It weighed my hair down and felt sticky and dirty.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Davines.</li>
            <li> I reordered it through Amazon again and received the wrong product once again.</li>

            <li> lightweight, really promotes curls in my wavy hair! non-greasy, smells nice. second purchase of this, first bottle lasted a year.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the above product. I received another Davines product that was purple and ret&#x27;d it as instructed. However, I was disappointed, I had to go through the whole process of reordering the one I wanted. I haven&#x27;t done so yet as I have been away.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I got turned onto it by an awesome salon stylist and I&#x27;m only using this from now on and I&#x27;m sending it to my sister in Japan for a birthday gift, only because I love her so. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Davines!!!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, very curly hair which I wear naturally.  This is the only product I have tired (and I have tried many), that effectively reduces friziness.  Perfect texture and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is a fun product. With natural curly hair it is just right. I do not like a heavy gel or mousse and this is just perfect. Adds a bounce to my curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have thick, naturally curly hair and every time I wash and blow dry, the first product I put on is [[ASIN:B000V193RE Davines Momo Moisturizing Curl Enhancing Serum 5.07 fl oz (150 ml)]].  I often mix it 50-50 with Aquage Defining Gel for the perfect combination.  It leaves my hair soft and the curls stay for several days with minimum upkeep.  All I have to do is add a little of the Curl Enhancing Serum in the morning and scrunch up my curls.  My hair looks like it was just styled.  My husband, who has REALLY curly hair, loves this product and often &#x27;borrows&#x27; mine because he likes it so much.  I just ordered him his own bottle.</li>
            <li> I have medium thickness hair that has more of a frizzy type of wavy curl. I wanted something that would let me wear it natural without blow drying it during the summer that would give me a frizz-less beach look. My hair did not curl as well as it does with other products, and in some spots - I guess where I put more of it that others - it would be stiff. It was less frizzy, but the curl was just not how I expected it. For the price, some drugstore products have worked better for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Davines products for several years.  I have tried others, but the are far from as effective.  This serum really helps the natural curl that is left in my are now as I am aging.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and dry and nothing has worked for me but I finally found this product and it does the trick for me.  It&#x27;s defines my curls and kicks frizz out! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I use this with the Davines Love Shampoo, the one for wavy and curly hair.  The combination really does wonders for my hair -- leaving it soft, silky and curly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, fine, shoulder length hair and this product is perfect.  I put it on after I towel dry and it does not weigh my hair down.  I am able to blow dry, using a diffuser, without frizziness.  My hair is definitely more manageable.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on the ends of my coarse, curly hair and it keeps them from flying away.</li>
            <li> lightweight but very defining</li>
            <li> This was supposed to enhance the curl and provide moisture. It didn&#x27;t. In fact, it made my coarse and curly hair dry and frizzy; just the opposite of its claim.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t purchase this product anywhere on the ground for less. The product is a must have for natural (untreated) curly hair I extend it by adding it to a small spray bottle of water. An the sales people are so helpful too.LOL</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and holds a curl.</li>
            <li> This company charged me full price for a product I&#x27;ve been using for year.  The product in this bottle was fake -- not real.  I want my money back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chosen this rating because this hair products are the best, I tried it at the beauty salon and got hooked on it, it enhances my curls and leave them soft and shiny...</li>
            <li> to Curl and this product does just that!&lt;br /&gt;i have used it for  quite few years by now: try it!  SV</li>
            <li> My hair is on the thinner, finer side with just a little natural wave. When I use this serum, I actually have curls that require little to no further styling. Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and have been searching for 40 years for a product to take away the frizz in my dry, curly hair. I finally found it!  This product is awesome!</li>
            <li> The best curl cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I have naturally curly hair, and this really helps to define the curl in a pretty way, without feeling crunchy or sticky or looking unnatural. I sometimes use it with a curling wand, and it makes my curls feel really soft and keeps the frizz down. It&#x27;s expensive, and a small bottle, but a little goes a long way. Totally worth the cost, IMO.</li>
            <li> This works great.  The waves stay in my hair and look really good.  If I spray my hair with water the next day, it revives the effect.  I&#x27;m not sure, though, if it&#x27;s still sold under this name by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> didnt do for me what it did for others</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I put it on my hair when it&#x27;s wet, and it somehow keeps my waves from loosening and frizzing up while they dry.  I put some in my palms and work it into my towel-dried hair after I wash it, being careful not to disturb the form of my curls while doing so (or, voila!-they frizz out).  It is sorta slimy feeling on your hands, but it washes off easily unlike some of the oils I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this product 3-4 times now and am a happy, loyal consumer.</li>
            <li> Great hair product to add volume. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my curly, very slightly frizzy, hair. It weighed my hair down and felt sticky and dirty. I wanted to wash my hair immediately after using it. The reason it got two stars is because I passed it onto a friend and she uses it, but she doesn&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> Love this for after shampooing my hair, which I do once a week since my hair is so dry and curly. It really gives me dramatic, beautiful curls, and I just wish I could afford to buy many bottles of it so I could use it all the time!</li>
            <li> This tames my wild mane! I apply it to wet hair, let it dry a little bit, and then blow dry while it has a good amount of moisture left in the hair. Tames those locks into a manageable look and feel.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work wonders on my naturally curly hair. I was getting the same results or better with Dove leave-in conditioner and at a fraction of the cost. I gave it away to a colleague. If I&#x27;m going to splurge - I prefer Deva-curl.</li>
            <li> Curly perfect hair with volume. Totally sounds like a joke, but for my hair, with shoulder length thin stands, a bit goes a long way. Love love love.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Davines.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from my hairstylist and love it for the curls, however, I have ordered it also through Amazon. The first order came to me in a timely manner and I received the right product. The last time I ordered it I received the wrong product so I had to mail it back. I reordered it through Amazon again and received the wrong product once again. So I gave up and went back to purchasing it through my hairstylist. It is cheaper online but not worth the headache of returning &amp; in my case twice to be only sent  the wrong product once again. Go buy it elsewhere you will love the product line of Davines especially for curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krabusin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year or so.  So I knew what I was ordering.  My hair is curly and needs moisturizing and some control.  Good product.</li>
            <li> What a big mistake was buying this product just because I read so many good reviews doesn&#x27;t mean is good for me, definitely NOT FOR ME!!! I am really frustrated because there&#x27;s no many products on the market that would perform a good job on my hair, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my hair is too thick, one single hair of mine is like 2 times thicker than an average person&#x27;s hair, my hair is naturally curly, and get frizzy very easy. with this product gets even frizzier, it&#x27;s awful, cannot control it at all, the very first time I used this serum I thought my hair was so frizzy because was the first time and probably the weather was not favorable for my hair, but today oh gosh!!! the weather is dryer and my hair is looking like a cheap dish wash sponge-scrub, super frizzy, out of control, stiff, ugly...I should stick around with the products that really work for me, and that one is Milk Hair The Original Curl Definer from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, all Carol&#x27;s Daughter products are so good is like my hair comes back to life, shiny, soft, my curls are so well define even a humid day isn&#x27;t a problem when I am using those products. that&#x27;s a very hard lesson that I have to learn, is better to stay with something that I know well than try something new that I don&#x27;t know at all, just because is good for many people doesn&#x27;t mean is good for me. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again, they&#x27;re expensive too!. I won&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone of my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this serum for my natural curly hair. It keeps the friz away and helps to define my curl - I won&#x27;t use anything else - apply to towel dried hair and I&#x27;m out the door.  Good price offered on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many but this one satisfied my needs. I think it is at its best when used by people with naturally curly hair (just a little curly), it won&#x27;t work on totally straight hair as well as on slightly curly. It&#x27;s not very strong, and you shouldn&#x27;t use a lot of it. I think it&#x27;s not for a disco, it&#x27;s for daily use. Use just a little on a little bit curly hair - and you&#x27;ll have great locks.&lt;br /&gt;For me the best way to use it was on wet hair after shower, and then dry with a blow drier. If I just let it dry on its own, it&#x27;s not so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Its an excellent curl enhancer, light weight and thankfully does not have a strong perfume odor.  I tried Davines new curl enhancer and hate the strong smell.  Will keep using this older one instead.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and she loves it!!  I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my curly hair too.</li>
            <li> I liked Davines Momo Moisturizing Curl Enhancing Serum, I don&#x27;t know if it necessarily enhanced my curls, maybe it made it easier to style my hair.  A decent find just not sure it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me some product to try. I was very impressed.  My hair held the curl and felt good.  It didn&#x27;t look or feel dry.  The product has a pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the product, I have thin curly hair and this is by far the most wonderful moisturizer out there. I just love the way my curls look and without to use a lot of the product.</li>
            <li> freaking awesome! just use a bit, as this stuff spreads well. Gets your curls so tight and bouncny! I love it and how it feels natural not like gel in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over for a product for my fairly curly, thick hair.  A dollop or two of this helps the curls, cuts the frizz, and keeps all in place.  The only hitch is in the directions: &amp;#34;apply the right amount of product&amp;#34;...no idea what that is, so used abt. a quarter-sized amount...maybe then a bit more, and all was well!</li>
