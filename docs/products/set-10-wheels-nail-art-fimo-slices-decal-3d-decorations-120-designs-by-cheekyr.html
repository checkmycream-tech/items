            <li>The colors are bold, and the images are easily identified.  </li>
            <li>So many different designs and all are really cute!</li>
            <li>Shipping took about a month but definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li>and I used &#x27;big bondini brush-on nail glue&#x27; to put them on, with a regular top coat over, and it worked great!</li>
            <li>Other than that, there are a lot of really cute designs for me to choose from and with them coming in their own cases that is a  huge plus, it took a while for it to arrive but was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I used so much :)</li>
            <li>only one thing I noticed was that there was 2 of the same kind, but I&#x27;m still happy with my choice..</li>
            <li>they really are cute looking on your fingers or toes...</li>
            <li>Pretty cool!</li>
            <li>they arrived really quick..</li>
            <li>have fun...</li>
            <li>still plenty of fun designs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been fun to use and play with.</li>
            <li>These are a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>the price was awesome, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have done terrible slicing my own.</li>
            <li>and it got here very fast</li>
            <li>Came exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>My kids love this product and they had a nail day and this actually stays on all day without coming off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using fimo slices</li>
            <li>my clients love the extra sparkle that these give to their nail designs.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping, and they arrived all still sorted into each individual bin.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised on how quick this arrived.  </li>
            <li>I use these basically like confetti or large glitter for toddler crafts.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re packaged nicely and everything stay organized in their little compartments.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the selection of different decals.</li>
            <li>Better them I expected.</li>
            <li>So much variety and so much that can be done with all that was sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you can tell without having to really look so while doing someone&#x27;s nails it won&#x27;t affect your ability to get what you want.</li>
            <li>the seller seems that they didn&#x27;t care much because they said the  item was not send by them</li>
            <li>but they annoy me because they stick off your nails too much</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this assortment!</li>
            <li>This clay was sliced so thin, I am able to stick it on with some nail polish and apply a top coat.</li>
            <li>Arrived much faster than expected, super deal!</li>
            <li>I would have preferred less flowers, more animals/other things.</li>
            <li>You can zoom in to see a close representation of what you will get, and the slices can be stuck with nail glue, covered with top coat (&amp;#34;Gelous&amp;#34; brand base coat is a clear way to smooth out lumpy glitter or slices of Fimo, then use quick-dry top coat of your choice), gel, or clear acrylic to encapsulate.</li>
            <li>Only one fell off during the night but it didn&#x27;t stick well in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, neatly packaged, received same pieces as pictured good quality thin slices.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying individually.  </li>
            <li>I chose these because it seemed like a lot for the value even though I&#x27;m not really a fan of two of the wheels, but it was still worth it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ever get them as nice and thin as these ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing nails at a senior center and they just love these little flowers.  </li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t really sit right on the nails too thick</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased sticks, and attempted to slice them with Xacto knives, but nothing was consistent.  </li>
            <li>The individual wheels allow you to see the designs clearly and access each pattern individually.</li>
            <li>, they did get to me before the actual delivery date, it just took a while in general.</li>
            <li>I keep my nails long but natural.</li>

            <li> they wont be flat might recommed this</li>
            <li> Quality is not the best one, because when I trying to cut it as thin as possible, they can fall apart:(  and I think the quantity is not the same like on pics.</li>
            <li> These did take a long time to get to me, about a month.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected Received something different than the picture.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order from you again, as the slices were very uniform and thin.  </li>
            <li> These little decorations are perfect - they&#x27;re fairly thin, a little 3D, but they don&#x27;t stick off of your nails annoyingly; they&#x27;re practical.</li>
            <li> This set has lots of slices portraying flowers, fruit, animals, symbols, and other things with colours and textures I want to use in manicures soon on myself and those on whom I do nail art.</li>
            <li> They look just like the Pictures above and are sliced thin enough to use on nails.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for another few days...</li>
            <li> They must be separated and cutted, but i got in two small plastic bag</li>
            <li> the only reason I gave a 4 was some of the things were messed up designs in wrong slots</li>
            <li> at least I knew with these.)</li>
            <li> No panda bears, teddy bears, or yellow smiley faces :(</li>
            <li> (plus the fimo sticks on amazon are usually picked at random</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive for fimo that I got.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I enjoy the selection of different decals. My only issues with this product was the inconsistency of the amounts of each decal and I had several decal pieces that were only parts of a decal. Other than that, there are a lot of really cute designs for me to choose from and with them coming in their own cases that is a  huge plus, it took a while for it to arrive but was worth the wait! I would purchase this in the future if there was specific themed packs, (holidays, plants, animals, brands, nature, celestial, etc.)</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the nail art slices I received from you.  I had previously purchased sticks, and attempted to slice them with Xacto knives, but nothing was consistent.  When I saw your product, I ordered it to try it out.  I will definitely order from you again, as the slices were very uniform and thin.  The packaging was excellent, too, keeping all the pieces orderly and easy to get to.</li>
            <li> I got these and they are super cute, no complains... I get a lot of compliments...  different variety- I will re order again, I am almost out I used so much :)</li>
            <li> Once again its me and I purchased 10 set wheel 3d nail art sets and they are so incredible rite when ya think you&#x27;ve seen it all they go further to inpress people also would recommend to all/...</li>
            <li> they work out well thank</li>
            <li> I do not use these for nails which is what they are designed for. they came very quick way before the time frame. They look just like the Pictures above and are sliced thin enough to use on nails.  I loved the bright vibrant colors on these they did not change from the Pictures to the order.</li>
            <li> shared them,  gave away 4 of the wheels. Everyone was very happy. And I will be buying again from this dealer.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping, and they arrived all still sorted into each individual bin. Amazing variety of designs, good quality materials.</li>
            <li> Good price for a decent amount. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use these basically like confetti or large glitter for toddler crafts. The individual wheels allow you to see the designs clearly and access each pattern individually. Pretty cool! I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t use for under age 3 and definitely not for kids that still put toys in their mouths.</li>
            <li> The Nail Art was great and fun to use. My Granddaughter loved them and the designs were really cute. Great Deal!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! So many different designs and all are really cute! The colors are really vibrant and look awesome! Shipping took about a month but definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Came exactly as shown. These little decorations are perfect - they&#x27;re fairly thin, a little 3D, but they don&#x27;t stick off of your nails annoyingly; they&#x27;re practical. Very satisfied! Would re-order! :)</li>
            <li> I am so overly satisfied with this purchase! The seller sent amazing decoration wheels and packaging was great. I would and will order cheeky products again.</li>
            <li> The set of 10 nail art Fimo sliced decals are really cute!..they arrived really quick..I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for another few days...only one thing I noticed was that there was 2 of the same kind, but I&#x27;m still happy with my choice..they really are cute looking on your fingers or toes...have fun...I am!</li>
            <li> Product came as described. My kids love this product and they had a nail day and this actually stays on all day without coming off.</li>
            <li> They are so cute I love them and it got here very fast</li>
            <li> They are so cute! Better them I expected.</li>
            <li> My wheels arrived WAY ahead of schedule, which is fantastic!  They came just as pictured.  I had no duplicates.  The colors are bold, and the images are easily identified.  (No mystery fruits or anything like that.)  These are a wonderful addition to anyone that likes to use fimo in their nail art.  I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Such a great concept here! I was really happy that I didnt get any repeat designs although I did receive more flower concepts than I would have liked, but thats okay. They&#x27;re packaged nicely and everything stay organized in their little compartments. Cant wait to play around with all the designs!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, neatly packaged, received same pieces as pictured good quality thin slices. There are some pieces that I did not like or recognize probably totalling one wheel . No panda bears, teddy bears, or yellow smiley faces :( still plenty of fun designs.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product and do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was a good buy and very inexpensive. It&#x27;s been fun to use and play with. I would reccomend to everyone.</li>
            <li> These did take a long time to get to me, about a month. I didn&#x27;t look at the delivery date before ordering, so that&#x27;s my fault, they did get to me before the actual delivery date, it just took a while in general. The wheels are a bit smaller than I expected but the slices are perfectly thin, everything pictured, and there&#x27;s about 10 slices, usually more, of each design. I chose these because it seemed like a lot for the value even though I&#x27;m not really a fan of two of the wheels, but it was still worth it. the price was awesome, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have done terrible slicing my own. (plus the fimo sticks on amazon are usually picked at random so I&#x27;d probably not get what I wanted anyway! at least I knew with these.) I couldn&#x27;t ever get them as nice and thin as these ones. I think I would order these again, I&#x27;ll just do it about a month before I think I&#x27;ll need them . It&#x27;s my first time using fimo slices and I used &#x27;big bondini brush-on nail glue&#x27; to put them on, with a regular top coat over, and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Amazing amount of nail art for the price. I have enough nail art to last a lifetime. Anyone need their nails done?????</li>
            <li> This set has lots of slices portraying flowers, fruit, animals, symbols, and other things with colours and textures I want to use in manicures soon on myself and those on whom I do nail art. You can zoom in to see a close representation of what you will get, and the slices can be stuck with nail glue, covered with top coat (&amp;#34;Gelous&amp;#34; brand base coat is a clear way to smooth out lumpy glitter or slices of Fimo, then use quick-dry top coat of your choice), gel, or clear acrylic to encapsulate.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred less flowers, more animals/other things.</li>
            <li> This is a Good product. I enjoy doing nail at and these give me a better variety to do more.</li>
            <li> I keep my nails long but natural. This clay was sliced so thin, I am able to stick it on with some nail polish and apply a top coat. It looks so cute! There are A LOT of flowers in this set, but they have great variety in style and color. Packaging and organization of the designs is awesome. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fimo came on time, but in different way then it&#x27;s on pics. They must be separated and cutted, but i got in two small plastic bag and now i have to cut it every time I want to use them. Quality is not the best one, because when I trying to cut it as thin as possible, they can fall apart:(  and I think the quantity is not the same like on pics. So what I got does&#x27;t cost 14,99$. It&#x27;s too expensive for fimo that I got.</li>
            <li> Great! They are as posted and my clients love the extra sparkle that these give to their nail designs. Thank you for the product.</li>
            <li> My wife and my kid likes it.</li>
            <li> These are a lot of fun.  I&#x27;m doing nails at a senior center and they just love these little flowers.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I would give this 100 stars if I could! LOVE this. Such a great deal.</li>
            <li> It came today and the date they gave me was the 24 of october the only reason I gave a 4 was some of the things were messed up designs in wrong slots</li>
            <li> So much variety and so much that can be done with all that was sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the items were in the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; slot but it was easy to fix and honestly, you can tell without having to really look so while doing someone&#x27;s nails it won&#x27;t affect your ability to get what you want.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying individually.  So many designs in the package. I also like that it comes in the case.</li>
            <li> Love these cute nail art. Works with gel nail polish great!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected Received something different than the picture. Contact the seller seems that they didn&#x27;t care much because they said the  item was not send by them</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t really sit right on the nails too thick</li>
            <li> Arrived much faster than expected, super deal!</li>
            <li> these are ok i love the shapes but they annoy me because they stick off your nails too much they wont be flat might recommed this</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised on how quick this arrived.  Product was as advertised.  Had to try it out and I really like it.  Best to use an epoxy versus clear nail polish to adhere.  Only one fell off during the night but it didn&#x27;t stick well in the first place.  (my error)  Looks like you are able to remove these 3 D off your nails and reuse if you wish.  Have not tried that yet</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this assortment! It is a wonderful value.</li>
