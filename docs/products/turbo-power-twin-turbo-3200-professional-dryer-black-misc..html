            <li>Excellent product really does the job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Turbo Power dryer at hair salon and wanted one of my own.</li>
            <li>The dryer gives you a great blow out quickly.</li>
            <li>This wonderfully replaced my old dryer and was recommended by my stylist because it&#x27;s the one she uses.  </li>
            <li>It also gives a lot of lift to her baby fine hair!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There are many dryers with the words &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;twin&amp;#34; in their moniker.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was impressed.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love my hair dryer, the product it¬¥s</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy.</li>
            <li>I like 2800 a lot better.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>My hair dries in no time and it looks better than ever - no frizz and lots of shine.  </li>
            <li>I love itüëç</li>
            <li>She is able to maintain the styles she desires.</li>
            <li>Powerful fast  hair drying best one for the price!</li>
            <li>and I thought that buying something at this price range means that I would be getting a pretty good quality product.</li>
            <li>naturally, she was very appreciative.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>I must say that the quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is it if you&#x27;re looking for the blow dryer that gives you the heat  to smooth out those roots.</li>
            <li>The heat/cool settings were also ideal rather than extreme.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, not too light, not too heavy, great design!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It dries her hair quickly and leaves her styled hair silky smooth and shiny in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>Miss my cool button.</li>
            <li>It was very smooth and much more quiet than any blow dryer I have ever used or owned.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>with enough heat to flat iron my hair on the highest temp its awesome...</li>
            <li>My conair blow dryer blew out after many years and it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely impressed with this dryer and only wish I had bought it long ago.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for my thick hair!</li>
            <li>Lightweight, powerful And remisible.</li>
            <li>This one, however, is the one that most professional hairdressers use.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and efficient.  </li>
            <li>It was worth it to my.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a hairdresser and suggested this dryer for my own personal use.</li>
            <li>Works great love it for thick or course hair drys fast</li>
            <li>worth the money..</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because I have a full head of fine hair that dries easily</li>
            <li>, so my old Remington&#x27;s did the same great job</li>
            <li>Powerful blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>I find with hair tools, the investment is usually worth it.  </li>
            <li>Great blow dryer but very heavy.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>first one she purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist recommended this model as it has better drying power and last longer.</li>
            <li>So glad to finally have one!</li>
            <li>Love the long cord.</li>
            <li>The cold and hot setttingggg awesome...</li>
            <li>That being said, I much prefer it over all others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I was looking for one like the professionals use and picked it because of price, didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li>this is the real deal Blow Dryer.</li>
            <li>Everything we expected an more.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Also, it is very light and comes with two nozzles for short or long hair.</li>
            <li>Great for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it, but had a poor set-up/hook or something.</li>
            <li>I work in a salon in New York City and needed a new blower because my old one broke.</li>
            <li>I always have worries about ordering blow driers online but knowing that is what they use in the professional salons in New York City</li>
            <li>The removable flow director nozzle can fall off if not attached firmly and gets quite hot, so you can&#x27;t really alter flow direction after the dryer has been on for more than a few moments.  </li>
            <li>My mother is a professional stylist.</li>
            <li>I bought this for her as a surprise (after she had added it to my Amazon cart), and conveniently shipped directly to her</li>
            <li>As a Professional Hairstylist...</li>
            <li>I hope it does last as I will not be using it as much as she uses her salon Twin Turbo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m complete</li>
            <li>Professional quality and styling at your fingertips.</li>
            <li>It is quiet also and is built very well.</li>
            <li>When I plugged this into the outlet a loud &amp;#34;lawn mower&amp;#34; like noise came out of the square plug.</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as I expected it to be, but it does its job.</li>
            <li>The motor a lot more quiet than other standard hair dryers.</li>
            <li>My CHI straightener is over 10 years old, and my last dryer was even older.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, light-weight, is made of non-slippery material, extra long cord!!!</li>
            <li>It is super heavy duty</li>

            <li> It is powerful, light-weight, is made of non-slippery material, extra long cord, and costs much less than previous ones I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> This is a good thing for Turbo Power since they could deny customer service and try to get me to buy another one of their pricey products, but a bad thing for me because now I am out a blow dryer and my money spent on this junk.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair 90% faster then the 1875 dryer, I am buying another one to keep at the gym.</li>
            <li> - not sure what I expected differently from a more expensive dryer.</li>
            <li> Anyhoo, hopefully it will last at least 5 yrs</li>
            <li> let me down in 20 yrs</li>
            <li> It has a heavy duty cord.</li>
            <li> wasted my money.</li>
            <li> no more Dominican beauty salons for me..</li>
            <li> I MEAN</li>
            <li> Horrible first experience!</li>
            <li> This product was such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> My wife hated drying her hair, but she LOVES drying it now with the Turbo Twin 3200 Professional Dryer!</li>
            <li> I turned it on and it made an immediate burning smell and the motor sounded broken.</li>
            <li> Was a fake.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the less then one year use I got out of it.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong!</li>
            <li> When I unplugged the product from the outlet fearing that it might catch on fire, there was this terrible burning smell that followed after.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a dud or was unlucky, but this was one of the worst blow dryers I ever purchased.</li>

            <li> I work in a salon in New York City and needed a new blower because my old one broke. I always have worries about ordering blow driers online but knowing that is what they use in the professional salons in New York City I figured I would give it a go. I must say that the quality is fantastic. It is super heavy duty and they have a great policy if it breaks. I tell people who are looking for a blower to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Was a fake. Had to return.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, powerful And remisible. I have no complaints. I love it. Great brand, I have been using this line 20 years!!</li>
            <li> There are many dryers with the words &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;twin&amp;#34; in their moniker.  This one, however, is the one that most professional hairdressers use.  Powerful and efficient.  Great for long, thick hair. The removable flow director nozzle can fall off if not attached firmly and gets quite hot, so you can&#x27;t really alter flow direction after the dryer has been on for more than a few moments.  It&#x27;s also not the lightest dryer out there.  That being said, I much prefer it over all others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love this blower!... It&#x27;s the same blower my salon uses and it&#x27;s perfect for my thick hair!</li>
            <li> My mother is a professional stylist. This is the second &amp;#34;Turbo Power Twin 3200...&amp;#34; she has owned. I bought this for her as a surprise (after she had added it to my Amazon cart), and conveniently shipped directly to her house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one she purchased elsewhere. She absolutely loved it, but had a poor set-up/hook or something. It kept dropping, and ended up kaput in a fairly short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this for her, naturally, she was very appreciative. Furthermore, she said it was a really great price on Amazon! So, FYI...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer, though, I did test this one out for just a moment. It was very smooth and much more quiet than any blow dryer I have ever used or owned. The heat/cool settings were also ideal rather than extreme. Overall, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> This was the best hair dryer I have ever owned. The dryer gives you a great blow out quickly. I was looking for one like the professionals use and picked it because of price, didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. It was worth it to my.</li>

            <li> I bought this just to touch up my ends. My hairstylist recommended this model as it has better drying power and last longer. I hope it does last as I will not be using it as much as she uses her salon Twin Turbo. Also, it is very light and comes with two nozzles for short or long hair. The motor a lot more quiet than other standard hair dryers. Overall, very happy.</li>

            <li> My wife hated drying her hair, but she LOVES drying it now with the Turbo Twin 3200 Professional Dryer! She said it&#x27;s best purchase we ever made on Amazon!  It dries her hair quickly and leaves her styled hair silky smooth and shiny in a matter of minutes. It also gives a lot of lift to her baby fine hair!  She recommends the Turbo Twin 3200 to anybody looking for the best hair dryer they&#x27;&#x27;ll ever own!</li>
            <li> Excellent product really does the job</li>
            <li> stopped working after I used it twice. I like 2800 a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love it! Leaves my hair nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> My conair blow dryer blew out after many years and it was time for a new one.  I asked my friends with great hair what they were using and they all told me to check out the twin turbo on amazon.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  My hair dries in no time and it looks better than ever - no frizz and lots of shine.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Everything we expected an more. Professional quality and styling at your fingertips. Saves time and money as you can do if yourself like the salon.</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer. Love the long cord. Miss my cool button. Only 4 stars because I have a full head of fine hair that dries easily, so my old Remington&#x27;s did the same great job - not sure what I expected differently from a more expensive dryer. Anyhoo, hopefully it will last at least 5 yrs and I will be happy!</li>
            <li> Powerful blow dryer.  Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Opened blow dryer and there were plastic parts coming out of it and it was rattling inside the hair dryer. I turned it on and it made an immediate burning smell and the motor sounded broken. Horrible first experience!</li>
            <li> Excellent service! Excellent productüåüüëç I love itüëç</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer but very heavy.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer by far.never let me down in 20 yrs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Turbo Power dryer at hair salon and wanted one of my own. So glad to finally have one!</li>
            <li> This is it if you&#x27;re looking for the blow dryer that gives you the heat  to smooth out those roots. I purchased this for my college daughter and she absolutely loves it. She is able to maintain the styles she desires.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. Dries my hair quickly.  It is quiet also and is built very well. It has a heavy duty cord.</li>
            <li> Powerful fast  hair drying best one for the price!</li>
            <li> This product was such a disappointment! When I purchased this, I did my research, read the reviews, saw some videos to and also liked the simplicity of the buttons to change the speed as well as the intensity of the cold or heat you get. The longest I ever had my at home blow dryer was close to 10 years and I thought that buying something at this price range means that I would be getting a pretty good quality product. I was so wrong! This blow dryer didn&#x27;t even last a year! It lasted up to the cut off line of the warranty. This is a good thing for Turbo Power since they could deny customer service and try to get me to buy another one of their pricey products, but a bad thing for me because now I am out a blow dryer and my money spent on this junk. When I plugged this into the outlet a loud &amp;#34;lawn mower&amp;#34; like noise came out of the square plug. It was a deafening and pulsating noise. When I unplugged the product from the outlet fearing that it might catch on fire, there was this terrible burning smell that followed after. Maybe I got a dud or was unlucky, but this was one of the worst blow dryers I ever purchased. Very disappointed in the less then one year use I got out of it. wasted my money. Never again will I be buying this brand or recommending this to any of my family or friends.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the attachments.  My hair is fine but I have a lot of it. so drying my roots is a process.  This wonderfully replaced my old dryer and was recommended by my stylist because it&#x27;s the one she uses.  I find with hair tools, the investment is usually worth it.  My CHI straightener is over 10 years old, and my last dryer was even older.</li>
            <li> I received it in great condition. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair 90% faster then the 1875 dryer, I am buying another one to keep at the gym.</li>
