            <li> This is a life saver for my husband.  He has had a stroke and gets very painful spasms and cramps in  his weak leg.  I pop the body wrap in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes and lay it down his leg.  It is  without a doubt the best relief we have been able to find for him.  The lavender aroma is also very soothing.</li>
            <li> i read prior reviews and decided to try it...this body wrap works great and use  it mainly for neck pain.....i also ordered the spa blanket from Dreamtime but havent used it as yet....Dreamtime has great products ....thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things in life!  I use it for aches and pains everywhere as well as a relaxing heat source on chilly nights.  The smell is instantly comforting and the heat is wonderful. It also makes a wonderful gift; everyone seems to like it!! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have owned this body wrap for 3 yrs.  I use it several times a day for my fibromyalgia, neck pain (after auto accident) &amp; even for my cold feet!  You can use it anywhere on your body. The scent is mild. I zap it in the microwave for 1 min. 38 sec. Even though it cools down gradually, there is still some some residual heat left for my feet even after an hour.  In the evening I warm it up and start at my neck, then move it around to other parts of my body.  It just makes me feel good and relaxes me before bed.  I also use it to relax my muscles before doing exercises to a certain difficult painful spot.  I take it with me wherever I visit as I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> This wrap is so calming while providing soothing heat to tense muscles. I will probably try the eye mask next.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time - have several of them.  Incredibly soothing moist heat.  Can be used on neck and shoulders or belly - wherever you need it.  Wonderful for pain relief and relaxation.</li>
            <li> The Dreamtime Body Wrap is great.  Zap it, then wrap it around your neck and shoulders. . . . very relaxing.</li>
            <li> The product does the job and helps to relieve my muscle pain. I am not a fan of the fragrant so I have to heat it several times and let the fragrant goes away before use it. I prefer to have a smell-less product.</li>
            <li> This is just as represented in the picture! The aroma is wonderful and it wraps wonderfully around the neck and shoulders ! Very comfortable! You&#x27;ll love it for aches and warmth!</li>
            <li> whether I&#x27;m working at my desk, sitting reading or have one of those days!  This is the rescue squad I reach for every time and feels like I&#x27;m telling myself &amp;#34; I LOVE YOU &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my sore back or neck as needed. I like the smell. Just make sure to wipe out the microwave before and after or the food smells in the microwave will make the wrap smell and vice versa...the aromatherapy smells will get in your food.</li>
            <li> Warm it in the microwave and it soothes my arthritic shoulder joint, and smells lovely. It stays warm about half an hour, longer if you cover it with a blanket. I am thinking of giving them out as gifts.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these that we have purchased. It smells great and holds heat well. It is beautifully made and very soft. The first one we have had for several years and it shows no wear at all.</li>
            <li> This body wrap has been a most excellent product; I purchased two, one for me and one for a gift. It is so soothing and really covers all the stress spots</li>
            <li> Omg best heating wrap EVER!!!! been looking for one this big forever.  I&#x27;m super allergic to scents so was nervous about aromatherapy but nothinh bothers me and its relaxing.  Finally relief for my neck and shoulders!</li>
            <li> I bought the pictured body wrap for my wife as a Christmas gift. Followed the microwave heating instructions to the letter, but the interior package (with the heated filler material) melts and creates holes. I have sewed it up numerous times. In the process of contacting Dreamtime with hopes of some resolution.</li>
            <li> Microwave for 2 minutes and you have a wonderful sweet smelling heating pad.  I have neck problems and this is a great comfort.  Sometimes I use it just because I need some warmth in a chilly room.  This is a great product and also a great gift for friends.</li>
            <li> My wife has heated this up and used it on her shoulder.  Says it helps.  Happy wife--happy life!</li>
            <li> This does the job and it&#x27;s pretty easy to use. Put in microwave for a few minutes, then use for relief of aches and pains. I&#x27;m always cold and have many sore muscles and knots - this feels very good on my shoulders or on my back, especially after a long night at work. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Warm it up and it is wonderful! Love the smell and the size use it almost everyday. I leave it in my bed during the day and the pillow smell of lavender when I go to bed</li>
