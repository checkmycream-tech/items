            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many oils over the years, and this remains my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>Ok peeps.</li>
            <li>Closer inspection of my body showed a more even tone etc.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this product as a skin care item</li>
            <li>I thought I could use this oil on my hair, but it is thicker than most.</li>
            <li>I use a little on my hair after using the Taliah Waajid herbal conditioner and protective mistakes bodifier and it is simply wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have had locs for nine years and the hardest thing is maintaining a fresh healthy look and scent.  </li>
            <li>The consultant was amazing and the fact that he took that much time to teach me about the product had me sold.</li>
            <li>I read about her products and there were many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and more manageable when I use this oil.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>So I started using it on my entire body with amazing results.</li>
            <li>I found this in a box store near me and started using it on 60+ dry skin , it is amazing!</li>
            <li>My third purchase, need I say more?</li>
            <li>I started using the product and it really has been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a month a relative asked me what I was using on my face because it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>I investigated the ingredients and suspect its the kukui nut oil which is responsible for this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am of negro decent and my hair is now natural.</li>
            <li>If you have natural hair or locs, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>I then took a closer look at my face and noticed my open pores  and wrinkles on my neck weren&#x27;t as prominent (over 40skin) and the dark discoloration had faded .</li>
            <li>Light, not too heavy, and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li>Do not use this directly on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry hair and have tried several different products on the market with varying levels of success.</li>
            <li>I use a little after I clean my face and get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li>Better price than my retailer.&lt;br /&gt;The healing oil worked unbelievably well as a deep conditioner with my heating cap.  </li>
            <li>scalp and hair were pretty dry and this has really helped to add essential oils back in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My coarse, thick hair was baby soft and was uncharacteristically  easy to comb out.</li>

            <li> However I spent a week in London I early January and used this product on my face and body to protect them from the extreme cold.</li>

            <li> This stuff is awesome. It was on clearance in Walmart for $5 so I figured why not. I bought it heading to the gym. Used it all over my body and face after showering and it stayed with me for the whole day!!!!! Typically at work the hard soaps dry my hands during the day, not the case once I used this in the am. It smells great. I use it to also moisturize my hair 3c, 4a when it is wet.</li>
            <li> My third purchase, need I say more?</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gets rid of dryness without weighing down my locs and adds shine. The best part is it does not require a lot.</li>
            <li> The product itself is good. However, when I received my box the oil was all over the box and on the two bottle. It was a mess.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I use a little on my hair after using the Taliah Waajid herbal conditioner and protective mistakes bodifier and it is simply wonderful. I also use on my skin, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Light, not too heavy, and my hair loves it. Also smells really nice.</li>
            <li> i use it for my locs and also fo rmy skin and both have beneffited immensely</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.  Better price than my retailer.&lt;br /&gt;The healing oil worked unbelievably well as a deep conditioner with my heating cap.  My coarse, thick hair was baby soft and was uncharacteristically  easy to comb out.</li>
            <li> I love it for the hair &amp; body...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years in my hair and on my skin. The retailer where I used to purchase it stopped carrying it. I was very happy that Amazon is an outlet where I can continue to buy it at affordable prices.</li>
            <li> Great, Fantastic product.  I am of negro decent and my hair is now natural. I use this product and it works amazingly well for me; nice sheen without being oily, pleasant but not lingering smell. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I have had locs for nine years and the hardest thing is maintaining a fresh healthy look and scent.  This oil does the trick!  It coats my hair perfectly leaving it with a lovely shine.  The oil absorbs well into my hair and does not leave greasy traces on my clothing or face.  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t need the heat of a blow-dryer in order for you to reap its benefits.  My hair is so much softer and more manageable when I use this oil.  I have tried many oils over the years, and this remains my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was received just one day after the order was placed.  Great job, Amazon!</li>
            <li> its doing the job it suppose to. for the cost it last a long time. you can use it hair and body.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I found a cheaper price at Target.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: Do not use this directly on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a hot-oil treatment but I was in a hurry and decided to keep it in to condition my hair and scalp...big mistake! It caused some build-up and itching! This is best just for hot-oil treatment before you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Ok peeps. If you have natural hair or locs, this is the product for you! I have pretty dry hair and have tried several different products on the market with varying levels of success. I was doing some research and came across Taliah Waajid. I read about her products and there were many positive reviews. I then called the company and spoke to one of her consultants who told me how to use the product. The consultant was amazing and the fact that he took that much time to teach me about the product had me sold. I started using the product and it really has been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp and hair were pretty dry and this has really helped to add essential oils back in my hair.  It smells great and makes my scalp feel wonderful!  My hair is stronger and fuller looking now as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this product initially to use on my hair and scalp ( i have locs) but I didn&#x27;t like it. However I spent a week in London I early January and used this product on my face and body to protect them from the extreme cold. I continued to use it after I returned to my warm climate and didn&#x27;t have any issues with breakouts etc even though I have extremely oily skin. After a month a relative asked me what I was using on my face because it looked fantastic. I then took a closer look at my face and noticed my open pores  and wrinkles on my neck weren&#x27;t as prominent (over 40skin) and the dark discoloration had faded . Closer inspection of my body showed a more even tone etc. I investigated the ingredients and suspect its the kukui nut oil which is responsible for this.  I am in LOVE with this product as a skin care item and I&#x27;m planning to stock up.</li>
            <li> I found this in a box store near me and started using it on 60+ dry skin , it is amazing! I use a little after I clean my face and get compliments all the time. So I started using it on my entire body with amazing results. I was making my own lotion until I found this, the petroleum products are so bad for your body .
