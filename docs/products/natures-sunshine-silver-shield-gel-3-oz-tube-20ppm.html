            <li> I could not tell that it did as promised.  I thought it was supposed to lighten dark spots.  It didn&#x27;t do so noticeably.</li>
            <li> So many uses! Will always be in my life. Thank you silver shield!</li>
            <li> Used for self liked results.</li>

            <li> Works so quickly couldn&#x27;t of had anything better&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera wasn&#x27;t enough for my burns. No itching or pain it rocks!!</li>
            <li> Good for what ails you topically.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Perfect product and great price.</li>

            <li> Awesome stuff! I use it for so many different things! Bruises, cuts, sores and so much more! A GREAT PRODUCT,</li>
            <li> Used for years. Great for  speed healing scratches, cuts, bug bites. Used it on poison ivy. Soothes by healing.</li>
            <li> The Arnicare is almost as effective as aspirin with no side effects.  And Silver Shield Gel is a new wonder gel to me!  Good for what ails you and your pets!</li>
            <li> This Silver Shield is amazing when appyling it to skin fungus and open wounds. It has been the only product that heals. I was using the liquid Silver Shield and spraying it on the areas, but I felt I lost a lot as it dripped off. The Gel was a good answer to the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Silver Shield to anyone who is having reacurring skin problems that nothing else seems to heal.</li>
            <li> great for acne and mouth sores</li>
            <li> Silver Shield cleared up dry crater-like skin patches in two days.  My skin is smooth and soft now. I&#x27;d been trying other products with either little to no success for 7+ years.  Finally these issues are almost gone and in only 2 days.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.  I&#x27;d buy it by the case if I could.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years and it world on pretty much everything.  I started using it for baby acne on my newborn son.  Went away over night.  Then I used it on my skin condition on my hands.  I use it on any cut my kids get and as a weekly/daily cleanser treatment of sorts on my face (keeps it clear).  Forget spending tons of money on acne treatments.  This is all you need. This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Definitely helped for applications as described.  Slightly more irritating on damaged skin than I&#x27;d hoped.  Hard to keep applying as needed when burning or itching occurred when applied.</li>
            <li> Been using for two years now on my face under makeup, feels great.</li>
            <li> This product I have already rated but will do it again. I was not happy they tried to improve it by taking some of the sliver out and doesn&#x27;t work as well . Will not get it again.</li>
            <li> I was totally satisfied with my purchase. I am diabetic and plagued with off and on sores that just show up for no reason. And of course I have to act with haste, not only keeping things as clean and dry as possible but treating any sore or infection the minute it shows up before it gets bad. I hoped and found it true that the silver mixtures were the answer and this product cleared some sores up much quicker than anything else had. My only question at this juncture is will the products with the higher ppm (parts per million) work quicker and even better. I am trying one now that is much higher and I will be reviewing it and letting you know when it&#x27;s gone. All in all, I am a happy camper for finding the help I need in a product I didn&#x27;t know about until recently. And I believe that those of us who suffer with diabetic skin conditions can use all the help we can get. :-)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My Dr. recommended this to me, and it really does what it is supposed to do. I have a mystery allergy that causes itching anf rashes. Even though I try to keep from scratching, I still have managed to get infections. This stuff works to cure the infection as well as prevent them in the first place. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I keep this on hand for first aid. I put it on most every cut my kids get. I also use it as a remedy for yeast infections and bad diaper rash..</li>
            <li> IT did not help my problem, as my friend told me it would . Needed to try it.</li>
