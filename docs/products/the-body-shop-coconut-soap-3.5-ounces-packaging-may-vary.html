            <li>Thanks!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich.</li>
            <li>There is a mild coconut scent which turns to cheap soap smell in water.  </li>
            <li>I love coconut so much I have been called the Coconut Queen.  </li>
            <li>my skin was more mosturized and so much softer.</li>
            <li>Good price; solid product.</li>
            <li>but this bar was nothing but a regular soap bar, and it didn&#x27;t even smell good.</li>
            <li>Lasts a good long while too.</li>
            <li>Definitely stocking up on more!</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I will use.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers are right about the nice light smell.</li>
            <li>It not only smells great, it lathers up like luxury soaps and it does not dry the skin.</li>
            <li>I tried the Dial Nutriskin White Peach and Shea Butter Soap which is far superior for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>skin is just smooth and softly scented.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that was really the only reason I bought this, and this soap definitely smells really great, very fragrant.</li>
            <li>I experienced such a lovely soft touch from the soap and a slight foaming action.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Body Shop other coconut things like the creams and lip balms, this smelled nothing like it, NOTHING!</li>
            <li>and it cleans very well</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut.</li>
            <li>i had no idea my regualr soap was drying out my skin so much.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this soap to others!</li>
            <li>The soap&#x27;s description claims \\&quot;it&#x27;s gentle and made of organic ingredients.\\</li>
            <li>Additionally, they are a socially responsible company.</li>
            <li>I really did</li>
            <li>It is nice and creamy but does not last long.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Remember, The Body Shop&#x27;s products are all ethically made and naturally sourced.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time or money, just grab a Dove bar, that smells better.</li>
            <li>soap was a new product to me.  </li>
            <li>I expected a deep coconut scent which would develop even more in water.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive sense of smell and cannot use a lot of perfumed products.  </li>
            <li>While the coconut smell is pretty, it&#x27;s the actually creaminess of this bar soap that gets me everytime.</li>
            <li>&quot; The odor was so strong it would knock down a horse, not to mention stink-up a room!</li>
            <li>make skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>I thought it would--very soft and supple and smelling all coconutty but it lathers</li>
            <li>This soap is also very creamy, lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like drugstore brands do.  </li>
            <li>If they are using organic ingredients with a fragrance so noxious it could easily trigger an asthma attack in some people, I would say the Body Shop is engaging in some very questionable marketing</li>
            <li>It has a mild delicate scent and is so creamy.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, because I loved it.</li>

            <li> Outside of The Body Shop&#x27;s coconut scented products, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find anything that smells this much like coconut</li>
            <li> My hands are cracked, chipped, red, irritated , have dry skin build up, etc.</li>
            <li> I live in an area that has *extremely* hard water, so we have a commercial water softener that helps immensely, but can sometimes leave me feeling as though I have residual soap on my skin after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> THis will help keep my skin moist during the long winter months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not shopped at the Body Shop in a long time, so</li>
            <li> The only other soap I like is Shea butter soap.  </li>
            <li> and that isn&#x27;t mixed with lime or other</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin</li>
            <li> The soap was certainly not gentle!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers extremely well.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product, especially during the long cold winter months when the skin is so dried out.</li>
            <li> Bar was very small and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bar was</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed and it doesn&#x27;t smell that much.  </li>
            <li> Hard bar.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, whenever I use this soap, my skin feels very dry and sticky.  </li>
            <li> scent is out of this world but, of course, I&#x27;m completely obsessed with coconut.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, this soap is disappointing.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this soap because I like The Body Shop Coconut Milk Body Lotion. Sadly, this soap is disappointing. While it does smell coconutty and it lathers well, it leaves a film that dries out my skin. I think I&#x27;ll stick to Dove.</li>
            <li> I expected a deep coconut scent which would develop even more in water.  There is a mild coconut scent which turns to cheap soap smell in water.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell- and it cleans very well w/out leaving any film.  A great every day shower soap.  Definitely stocking up on more!</li>
            <li> Love the scent! What can I say? Sometimes we just need to splurge on ourselves! This was an affordable splurge!</li>
            <li> I like it but will not buy it again because I think it is over priced. It is nice and creamy but does not last long.</li>
            <li> The perfect face soap, gentle and cleansing.  French milled.  A bar lasts forever.</li>
            <li> OMG!  This is the best smelling soap with the fluffiest lather and leaves you feeling squeaky clean without drying your skin! Lasts a good long while too. Hard bar. Pleasant shape</li>
            <li> make skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful, but my body didn&#x27;t like it(broke out in a rash), so I have to stop using it. Too bad, because I loved it.</li>
            <li> It has a mild delicate scent and is so creamy.  It lathers extremely well.  It is my favorite soap from the body shop.  The only other soap I like is Shea butter soap.  I am not a fan of fruit scented soaps, although I have nothing against them.  The do smell scrumptious, especially, sweet lemon and satsuma.</li>
            <li> I love coconut so much I have been called the Coconut Queen.  This doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i like the smell of coconut but when i started using it a noticed a big difference in my skin. my skin was more mosturized and so much softer. i had no idea my regualr soap was drying out my skin so much. i highly recommend this product, especially during the long cold winter months when the skin is so dried out.</li>
            <li> I used The Body Shop Coconut Soap and [[ASIN:B001PSGEJM The Body Shop Shea Soap, 3.5 Ounce]], and loved them both!  I live in an area that has *extremely* hard water, so we have a commercial water softener that helps immensely, but can sometimes leave me feeling as though I have residual soap on my skin after rinsing.  The Body Shop soaps do not feel that way, at all!  They have a wonderful lather, scent and rinse completely, leaving my skin feeling soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap to others!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive sense of smell and cannot use a lot of perfumed products.  I love the smell of this soap and the way it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s the best combination of moisturizing soap with a light coconut fragrance. Haven&#x27;t found anything better (... and I&#x27;ve searched).</li>
            <li> Great nourishing soap but the best part is that it actually smells like coconut - smells beachy and fresh. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this coconut soap and how your skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is one of the soaps i will splurge on now and than,This has a nice coconut scent that reminds me of Summer,The Soap lasted me a while i was able to get many uses out of this and cant go wrong with Body Shop Soaps ,Their Awesome!</li>
            <li> No, I&#x27;m not kidding. The soap&#x27;s description claims \\&quot;it&#x27;s gentle and made of organic ingredients.\\&quot; The odor was so strong it would knock down a horse, not to mention stink-up a room! The soap was certainly not gentle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was definitely synthetic, like what is used in some suntan lotions. If they are using organic ingredients with a fragrance so noxious it could easily trigger an asthma attack in some people, I would say the Body Shop is engaging in some very questionable marketing practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would send this bar of soap to lab to find out what&#x27;s in it. There&#x27;s ZERO ingredients listed on the packaging!</li>
            <li> I have been researching out the toxins in our daily products especially hand soap.  I am a nurse and am required to wash my hands constantly.  My hands are cracked, chipped, red, irritated , have dry skin build up, etc. Need I could go on?  I found coconut oil and have been using it both as a lotion and to eat, then started looking for replacement soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened the package, and the lovely hint of coconut reached my nose.  I turn on the tab and washed my hands.  I experienced such a lovely soft touch from the soap and a slight foaming action.  I have never felt my hands to be this clean.&lt;br /&gt;I am certainly keeping this soap,for the next thing I did was take a wonderful shower.</li>
            <li> This is really good soap, the best I have ever used.  It feels like you are washing with coconut cream and not a bar of soap.  THis will help keep my skin moist during the long winter months.  Thanks!!!  You will not be disappointed and it doesn&#x27;t smell that much.  Maybe some people don&#x27;t like coconut smell?</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Bar was very small and not worth the money. It did not moisturize as promise. I tried the Dial Nutriskin White Peach and Shea Butter Soap which is far superior for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> For me this is a great alternative to body wash. Other reviewers are right about the nice light smell. Good price; solid product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the soap and it makes me want to eat coconut. Unfortunately, whenever I use this soap, my skin feels very dry and sticky.  I would not recommend it to anyone unless they just want to use it for the smell.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; soap and I don&#x27;t like body wash - Love coconut so I ordered this on a whim. It not only smells great, it lathers up like luxury soaps and it does not dry the skin. I&#x27;d like to get larger size bars!</li>
            <li> My daughter told me to try Coconut Soap.  This is the only kind I will use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel quite like I thought it would--very soft and supple and smelling all coconutty but it lathers&lt;br /&gt;well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not shopped at the Body Shop in a long time, so I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bar was but it still has a great scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, go-to bar soap.  I was very pleased to see that it is available as part of Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.  In fact, it&#x27;s the reason I signed up for the program!  Outside of The Body Shop&#x27;s coconut scented products, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find anything that smells this much like coconut and that isn&#x27;t mixed with lime or other citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is out of this world but, of course, I&#x27;m completely obsessed with coconut.  This soap is also very creamy, lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like drugstore brands do.  Remember, The Body Shop&#x27;s products are all ethically made and naturally sourced.

            <li> I tried to like it I really did but this bar was nothing but a regular soap bar, and it didn&#x27;t even smell good. I have used hotel soaps that are just as good as this. I liked the Body Shop other coconut things like the creams and lip balms, this smelled nothing like it, NOTHING! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money, just grab a Dove bar, that smells better.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin and I use Extra Virgin Coconut oil as a moisturizer (get a second jar for cooking) anyway,&lt;br /&gt;this soap was a new product to me.  Now I have something to wash with.  I love it! smells amazing, super gentle&lt;br /&gt;on my skin.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of coconut and that was really the only reason I bought this, and this soap definitely smells really great, very fragrant.</li>
            <li> While the coconut smell is pretty, it&#x27;s the actually creaminess of this bar soap that gets me everytime. It&#x27;s rich. It&#x27;s creamy. It does not leave a residue or film.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is just smooth and softly scented.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m nuts for this coconut!</li>
            <li> My favorite  soap in the ever!</li>
            <li> Great price, great lather, awesome smell. you will like it.</li>
