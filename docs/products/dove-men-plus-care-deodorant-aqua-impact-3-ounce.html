    <ol>
            <li>Still looking for the perfect deodorant.</li>
            <li>it keeps me smelling like awesome all day.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Great smell</li>
            <li>Great price for this top of the line product!</li>
            <li>I will be contacting Amazon and GOOD BUY NY Storefront to hopefully get the correct product.</li>
            <li>But as for now I will NOT be buying from GOOD BUY NY Storefront again.</li>
            <li>liked that it lasted but rather not irritate skin, so now using speedstik gear.</li>
            <li>All-in-all a good clean fragrance and product.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan and my husband loves it!</li>
            <li>I can say for sure it doesn&#x27;t do 48 hours protection.</li>
            <li>My favorite deoderant....  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite deodorant now.</li>
            <li>What more can I say about this deodorant, but that it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Dove soap for men which is pretty good, cleans well without an overpowering scent, so I figured I would try this product as well.</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to find it on Amazon and priced reasonably</li>
            <li>I smell fine</li>
            <li>Great smelling deodorant that last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>smells like cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the first time in like 10 years that he&#x27;s been able to use deodorant without experiencing a rash.  </li>
            <li>Very good size and quality and price, I recomend it very much , please check other brans if you need them</li>
            <li>and it always smells clean and fresh...</li>
            <li>The order arrived at my house fairly quickly</li>
            <li>We bought these for my boyfriend who has very sensitive skin: he gets a rash from most deodorant.  </li>
            <li>but probably wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>but it was defiantly worth it</li>
            <li>If your experimenting to find the right deodorant, give it a try, but don&#x27;t hold your breath on the claims.</li>
            <li>He loves this product very much as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s pretty damn manly.</li>
            <li>It seems to last fine for a day.</li>
            <li>I really do.  </li>
            <li>I had to write a review after reading a review from someone who actually wants 48 hours of protection out of his deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I spend most of my time in front of a screen, so I&#x27;m not even that active.</li>
            <li>I think I would need 2 applications per day if I had a more active lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Fragrance was too strong and it did not keep him dry.</li>
            <li>if you expect to smell good for 48 hours after one application of deodorant you have some serious hygiene problems...take a shower.  </li>
            <li>its the only product I have used that will still be working after a full day no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>and then I take a shower like a normal person.  </li>
            <li>:( Smells good initially..wears out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok and it seems to leave a lot of residue from just a small 1 or 2 swipes of the pit.</li>
            <li>lasts forever, but a little too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Not so with the Dove: goes on smooth, works all day (even somewhat after a sweaty workout) and the smell is subtle and fresh, without being perfumy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clear so there are no stains onto your shirts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes and dyes, and would occasionally get irritated with Degree when it would mix with my sweat.</li>
            <li>but you can smear this on every day without getting too goopy or irritated and it smells so good you finally notice how bad your boots stink.  </li>

            <li> Doesnt stay long enough..</li>
            <li> It seems to be on the same level as the soap, low scent but works as expected.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say this comes 2nd place to a hot (or even cold) shower</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended if you experience skin rashes from other deodorants as you won&#x27;t have that problem with this.</li>
            <li> With some other deo&#x27;s I would have stop using them after awhile because they made me itch</li>
            <li> I was having a rash from other deodorants, but this one does not do that.</li>
            <li> but unlike certain brands, such as Geriatric Spice, it doesn&#x27;t use itching powder as the base ingredient which seems to cut down on pit rash.  </li>
            <li> maybe few hours..</li>
            <li> I am getting a little redness under my arm which is the reason i wanted a delicate deodorant.</li>
            <li> My husband was not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> It was the completely wrong scent.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!</li>

            <li> was my go to for a while.  lasts forever, but a little too strong for me.  irritates skin.  liked that it lasted but rather not irritate skin, so now using speedstik gear.</li>
            <li> My husband was not happy with this product.  Fragrance was too strong and it did not keep him dry.</li>
            <li> The order arrived at my house fairly quickly but when I opened the package up I found out that the company had not sent me the product I ordered. It was the completely wrong scent. I will be contacting Amazon and GOOD BUY NY Storefront to hopefully get the correct product. But as for now I will NOT be buying from GOOD BUY NY Storefront again.</li>
            <li> We bought these for my boyfriend who has very sensitive skin: he gets a rash from most deodorant.  This Dove Men+ Care does not cause any irritation or rash for him.  It&#x27;s probably the first time in like 10 years that he&#x27;s been able to use deodorant without experiencing a rash.  He loves this product very much as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you experience skin rashes from other deodorants as you won&#x27;t have that problem with this.</li>
            <li> For men, will buy it again. Seriously, it&#x27;s pretty damn manly. Can&#x27;t think of anything else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Great smelling deodorant that last throughout the day. Doesn&#x27;t stain the shirt like the antiperspirant does. It was also cheaper for me to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Aqua impact version of this is way to stinky. smells like cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> Doesnt stay long enough..maybe few hours.. :( Smells good initially..wears out pretty quickly. I got it for the pack of 2..but probably wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I really do.  I have used it for a year or so and it always smells clean and fresh...NOT per-fumy,  No irritation, for me.  With some other deo&#x27;s I would have stop using them after awhile because they made me itch but not so with this product.  I use it every day after my shower.  Also, it does not seem to do anything to my T-shirts.  Some products leave a residue that is definitely noticeable after laundering. All-in-all a good clean fragrance and product.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say this comes 2nd place to a hot (or even cold) shower but unlike certain brands, such as Geriatric Spice, it doesn&#x27;t use itching powder as the base ingredient which seems to cut down on pit rash.  I didn&#x27;t try to join the 7-months 7-showers club over the last visit to Sunny, Sandy beach is 1,500 miles that way-a-Stan but you can smear this on every day without getting too goopy or irritated and it smells so good you finally notice how bad your boots stink.  Word O Wisdom: eat when can, sleep when you can and even if you&#x27;re standing on a pallet in mud and air drying before putting on last months clothing take a SHOWER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Dove soap for men which is pretty good, cleans well without an overpowering scent, so I figured I would try this product as well. It seems to be on the same level as the soap, low scent but works as expected. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant and it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores, let alone in a 2-pack.  It was nice to be able to find it on Amazon and priced reasonably so I could have it shipped to me instead of having to search for it here in town.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review after reading a review from someone who actually wants 48 hours of protection out of his deodorant.  I don&#x27;t care what the package says...if you expect to smell good for 48 hours after one application of deodorant you have some serious hygiene problems...take a shower.  I put this on in the morning, work a 9 hour day, and then hit the gym.  I smell fine and then I take a shower like a normal person.  This stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> Very good size and quality and price, I recomend it very much , please check other brans if you need them</li>
            <li> I was having a rash from other deodorants, but this one does not do that. It seems to last fine for a day.</li>
            <li> Great price for this top of the line product! I am a huge fan and my husband loves it! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the deodorant for about 2 weeks now. I can say for sure it doesn&#x27;t do 48 hours protection. It struggles to deliver even 24 hour protection. I spend most of my time in front of a screen, so I&#x27;m not even that active. I think I would need 2 applications per day if I had a more active lifestyle. The smell is ok and it seems to leave a lot of residue from just a small 1 or 2 swipes of the pit. If your experimenting to find the right deodorant, give it a try, but don&#x27;t hold your breath on the claims.</li>
            <li> I am getting a little redness under my arm which is the reason i wanted a delicate deodorant. Still looking for the perfect deodorant.</li>
            <li> I thought it was wierd ordering deodorant off the Internet but it was defiantly worth it it keeps me smelling like awesome all day.</li>
            <li> My favorite deoderant....  its the only product I have used that will still be working after a full day no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell. I love this. This is definitely my favorite deodorant now. Great smell and it&#x27;s clear so there are no stains onto your shirts.</li>
            <li> What more can I say about this deodorant, but that it works. I switched from degree because it stopped working halfway through my day, and I would have to reapply or re-shower. I&#x27;ve seen some mixed reviews here, but I guess it&#x27;s a personal matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes and dyes, and would occasionally get irritated with Degree when it would mix with my sweat. Not so with the Dove: goes on smooth, works all day (even somewhat after a sweaty workout) and the smell is subtle and fresh, without being perfumy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it.</li>
