            <li>Authentic Bath and Body Works product.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion from bath and body works.  </li>
            <li>My husband also loves this lotion on me the most.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Smells good Ships fast.</li>
            <li>Smells cheap and fruity</li>
            <li>So fast !!!</li>
            <li>when this item arrived it was not in the original packaging, it had scotch tape that sealed the lid.</li>
            <li>But this scent is light, fresh, very summery.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing , and lasts for quite long time .</li>

            <li>Was open in box and leaked all over but it smells ok</li>
            <li>It will leave your skin super smooth and the smell will last all day.</li>
            <li>Beach Coconut and Kauai Lei Flower are also yummy and lovely, but smell quite similar to this, although this profile is much sweeter, IMO.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself was really greasey</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The scents are very aromatic and you can apply these with body oils that match the floral scents to each bottle.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after the shower and it leaves your skin feeling soft and refresh all day long.</li>

            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> It is not a very strong scent</li>
            <li> Leaked a little in transit in spite of being taped shut.  </li>
            <li> and I get compliments everyday</li>
            <li> At least they made a valid effort to prevent leakage.  </li>
            <li> I suspect they all have the same base.</li>

            <li> Pineapple, yes. Coconut? Not really. But this scent is light, fresh, very summery. Waikiki Beach Coconut and Kauai Lei Flower are also yummy and lovely, but smell quite similar to this, although this profile is much sweeter, IMO. I suspect they all have the same base. Four stars for not enough coconut. Still looking for that &amp;#34;Hawaiian Tropic&amp;#34; smell from my teenaged years. This is not quite it.</li>
            <li> Tied for my number one with two other scents, the shower gel is even better than this lotion! You will be in a better mood once you use it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL!!!! I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS</li>

            <li> The smell is amazing , and lasts for quite long time . Love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This lotion smells just like an Hawaiian paradise. It will leave your skin super smooth and the smell will last all day.</li>
            <li> Was open in box and leaked all over but it smells ok</li>

            <li> Great Summer scent.  Reasonably priced.</li>

            <li> Smells floral with a hint of coconut. Authentic Bath and Body Works product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of bath and body works. when this item arrived it was not in the original packaging, it had scotch tape that sealed the lid. The lotion itself was really greasey</li>

            <li> I purchased this set for my trip to the hawaiian islands in july. The scents are very aromatic and you can apply these with body oils that match the floral scents to each bottle.</li>
