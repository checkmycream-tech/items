    <ol>
            <li>; color looks best on me.  </li>
            <li>so works perfectly with my skin</li>
            <li>The powder goes on flawlessly, and has the staying power of a cream blush.</li>
            <li>The Rosy is perfect for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It would work best on lighter skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that I have always had very good luck with Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena is a great brand for skin products and this blush is just another example of the companies excellent product line.</li>
            <li>Great blush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, as much as I liked the two shades and would have been happy to keep using them, this product did not agree with my skin at all!</li>
            <li>The Bronzed is also great to use as a blush, but I believe it&#x27;s intended to be a bronzer.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena products can be trusted, and they work great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this blush!!</li>
            <li>This blush is the perfect color for someone with very light colored skin.  </li>
            <li>I especially liked the bronzed blush as it gave my face a more deeper color.</li>
            <li>This blush in 10 Rosy is very nice on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>The bronzer has a nice look on its own, but the illuminating powder looked best over the rosy blush.</li>
            <li>However, if I dust it lightly on my cheeks, it is the perfect shade for me!  </li>
            <li>This is a good bronzer; it&#x27;s not sparkly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Luminous&amp;#34;/#50 is an illuminating powder; a good one without sparkles.  </li>
            <li>They all have a wonderful, smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Another good color cosmetic from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>The number one thing I have to say about this product is that I loved the feel of it when applying -</li>
            <li>– this is the perfect hint of coverage with light reflecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products since I received them and have been very pleased with the way they look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mother loves the Neutrogena Healthy Blush!</li>
            <li>it was beautifully, silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The light rosy color is best suited to fair to light skin tone.</li>
            <li>The Luminous color made a great highlighter, and paired well with the rosy color for a light, feminine look if used as eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I do like my blush to be the 8 hour kind</li>
            <li>I thought it applied nicely even on</li>
            <li>You need your own brushes to apply this product.  </li>
            <li>light skinned gals, this set is very nice.</li>
            <li>It applied equally smoothly with fingers or a brush, and felt very nice going onto the skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to go from blush to clown, so</li>
            <li>a light hand is a good idea.</li>
            <li>This is good for a very fair skin tone and a younger woman.</li>
            <li>The Luminous is a very light illuminating powder.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin and have been loving the &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely color</li>
            <li>More of a darker neutral blush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is a highly respectable brand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In reality, this shade would be perfect for a light-skinned blonde.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to give this another try when my face hits midwinter paleness because it is a lovely color.  </li>
            <li>, it is probably a better shade for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Bronzed&amp;#34;/#40 color is more of a bronzer than a blush</li>
            <li>So I was able to try all three colors.  </li>
            <li>I was always able to trust these products on my skin.  </li>
            <li>reference, I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li>It blends right into the skin and smooth and comfortable and looks great.</li>
            <li>However, the blush is a lovely consistency and brushes on easily.</li>
            <li>In person, I don&#x27;t think this blush is quite as pink as the picture, but it is a lovely color and has a wonderful iridescence to it.</li>
            <li>is a very pretty shade that turned out nicely for me.</li>
            <li>so if you have a darker complexion or a good tan, these may not make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>were it the right color for me, would look nice on my skin.  </li>
            <li>All three are easy to apply and blend...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It applies well, and dusts easily with a blush brush.  </li>
            <li>I have fair/medium skin (tan easily) with brunette hair, brown eyes.  </li>
            <li>I really could not tell I was wearing blush, but had a nice healthy rosy look, which is what you want in a blush.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend also.</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin and looks pretty, is easy to blend, and stays put adequately for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a very fair skin tone, and my skin is dry too.</li>
            <li>For my mother it looked fine but even on her</li>
            <li>Though, I have to say this bronzer is better than many I&#x27;ve tried, and if I were to learn how to apply properly, and if I were a &amp;#34;bronzer kind of woman,&amp;#34; it&#x27;d make a nice addition to my make-up &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; (my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; is I rarely wear make-up).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Application was easy using a good professional brush and the powder blended well with my make-up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, just have your own blusher brush at the ready as this doesn&#x27;t come with one.  </li>
            <li>so smooth.</li>
            <li>I use a BB cream with light bronzer over it</li>
            <li>; shade looks nice on the cheekbones, but since I already use bronzer, that and the &amp;#34;Luminous&amp;#34; shade don&#x27;t really do a whole lot for me.</li>
            <li>If you are light skinned like me, give this a try.  </li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Blush is available in 5 colors—3 blush tones, a bronzer, and an illuminating powder.</li>
            <li>There is a peachy-pink, a light bronzer, and a &amp;#34;shimmer.&amp;#34; The directions read to pull your make-up brush through the three colors and sweep over cheeks.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and blends very well.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I give it a light tap to shake the excess off and once applied</li>
            <li>I DO, however, really enjoy the Rosy shade and would acquire it again.</li>
            <li>Too light a powder</li>
            <li>or maybe it is just my perception of what blush color should look like in the package, but I completely ignored the fact that this is the lightest color blush in the collection and decided it looked like a good color for me.  </li>
            <li>For my pale skin I did like the Rosy the best.  </li>
            <li>So, the Rosy blush was an excellent choice – a reasonably pale peachy/rosy neutral color.</li>
            <li>so they are easily accessible?</li>
            <li>This line has a lot of colors on offer and is worth a try!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also silky smooth and looks beautiful as just something to smooth out your skin some and leave a slight shine to your skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, it feels super light on your face; like your skin can still</li>
            <li>rosy color is a soft, subtle tone, perfect for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I tried using them as eyeshadows and again, nothing too special.</li>
            <li>This is a great daytime color for when you just want a touch of pink on your cheeks and a bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li>It also seems to have a good staying power as I don&#x27;t find myself needing to &#x27;touch-up&#x27; in the middle of the</li>
            <li>All three of these have good staying power and last all day without needing a touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a lovely color, but it doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin much at all.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased at how soft and silky the powder is, and even better, the color was very natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luminous: definitely NOT a blush, but does make a nice light all over foundation.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something bold, keep looking.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality blush that leaves a healthy, mild glow on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors in their pans.</li>
            <li>Apply lightly wherever light hits your skin; cheekbones, temples, forehead, middle of chin &amp; maybe the top of your nose.  </li>
            <li>This is officially my new favorite blush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to blend and lasts the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After applying a light foundation (right now I&#x27;m using Bobbie Brown), I used an angled blusher brush and first applied the peach-pink onto the apples of my cheeks -</li>
            <li>This is a lovely, natural looking rosy color blush.</li>
            <li>like the blush and the way it looks and feels; however, I&#x27;m not crazy about the plastic case it is packaged in.</li>
            <li>but it looks good blended with the rosy &amp; gives a deeper tawny color if the rosy is too pink for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products because they never irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The color is more natural than the picture would indicate.</li>
            <li>The rosy shade could have been good as a blush, but it was just a bit too pink for me.</li>
            <li>They all go  on easily and light and give the skin a glow with faint color to create a naturally beautiful look that doesn&#x27;t seem overdone.  </li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day on my skin - longer than most other blush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply too much because it is a soft product.</li>
            <li>, I was also sent two other blushes that were equally of good quality.</li>
            <li>At 60 years old, this is true even more than when I was young, and a subtle touch is just perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>It went on lightly and easily wiht my sable brush, and didn&#x27;t need wiping to blend into my skin properly.</li>
            <li>you are a purist when it comes to natural and non-toxic, this is probably safe enough for most people, but the ingredient list has a lot of unpronounceable ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I love the light pink blushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy and natural to apply.</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena Blush is light, natural and fresh looking and that is why I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bronzed bronzer is my least favorite of the three products – probably my own fault for never mastering the use of bronzers.</li>
            <li>It is very light, but just enough to give you some color.</li>
            <li>The highlighter is so subtle it&#x27;s nearly invisible on, but gives just a nice hint of light to the top of the cheekbone.</li>
            <li>First, they all feel cushiony to the touch -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these blushes!!</li>
            <li>Though the luminous shade used when wet was nice.</li>
            <li>The powder just slides on, it&#x27;s a lovely powder physically,</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;d be ok with it if it actually showed up on my cheeks to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you have oily skin, you  may want to avoid this step because it will only make your skin more shiny.  </li>
            <li>Having three different containers isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but since I, and perhaps many others, will use these together, and they come together, why not put them all in one</li>
            <li>I dont have to worry if it will break, and the pretty color can also be used on my eyes in a pinch.</li>
            <li>-wise they are all a bit similar, but behave differently.</li>
            <li>The bronzer tones down the color, and the illuminator gives it a nice glow.</li>
            <li>When I run my brush over it, it seems a little too powdery but nonetheless, it goes on the cheeks easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not come with a brush which is fine with me because I never use those tiny brushes anyway.  </li>
            <li>I next swept a bit of the shimmer on the tops of my cheeks (over the cheekbones) and a little more on different areas of my face - what I loved about this &amp;#34;luminescence&amp;#34; is that it didn&#x27;t give me a sparkly shimmer, but</li>
            <li>With practice, though, I&#x27;ve found all three products work very well together.</li>
            <li>Very relieved that this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes quality products at a reasonably price and this blush is no exception.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t much of a bronzing shade.</li>
            <li>But then, I do like a much brighter highlight, like Mary Louminzer and a Becca highlight.</li>
            <li>For my much lighter skinned mother it did look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also lasts all day, and adds a very flattering color to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It feels very silky and,</li>
            <li>I really like this blush &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34;/#10.  </li>
            <li>This is a blush that is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it stays on very well.  </li>
            <li>While they could all be used as blushes on different skin tone, it was basically a contouring set for me: blush (Rosy), light gold bronzer (Bronzed) and highlighter (Luminous).</li>
            <li>This blush is a versatile peachy pink that will work for many skin tones.</li>
            <li>It has a substantial amount of pigment so you don&#x27;t need to use much to get color</li>
            <li>so I probably won&#x27;t get much use out of it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light enough for them to use for dress</li>
            <li>But if your skin tone is already a little more olive or tan, both of those shades would look great for just a little extra glow!</li>
            <li>, I just have a natural glow ;)</li>
            <li>The container is quite small as it has neither a blush brush nor a mirror, so you&#x27;ll have to provide your own.</li>
            <li>I usually just wear Leven Rose Jojoba Oil on my face, eyeliner, blush and lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I have porcelain skin, and I find that a little bit of this blush (Rosy) goes a long way - more so than some other brands available at the drug store because of being more highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer is a little more intense color-wise.</li>
            <li>So those of us who really, REALLY want to be ABSOLUTELY NATURAL, might want to look further to get exactly the right product.  </li>
            <li>The color lasts longer than many less pigmented drugstore blushes.</li>
            <li>instead a very natural &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d use this luminescence powder even by itself - very  nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend,.</li>
            <li>Just a little &amp;#34;sun kissed&amp;#34; and nothing more.  </li>
            <li>blush seems gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t cause an irritation.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34; is a light pink with a hint of tawny/peachy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fairly sensitive skin my whole life, breakouts were a part of my everyday for many years.  </li>
            <li>In the pictures, the two darker colors (Vibrant and Flushed) seemed as though they&#x27;d be clownishly dark even for someone like me who is a brunette with skin that tans easily and a lot of color in my face even in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually use Bare Minerals and was pleasantly surprised that Neutrogena had a product out that was just as good.</li>
            <li>If you just want something that looks nice and isn&#x27;t irritating, this might be exactly the thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would normally select.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just right for an &amp;#34;Earth Mother&amp;#34; but probably not enough drama for a &amp;#34;Beauty Queen&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I might consider purchasing the Rosy in the future if the price were right.</li>
            <li>AND I find myself only needing to apply lightly once in the morning and that gets me through the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a nice blush for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause any issues with my very sensitive skin, and the coloring lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It is not as pigmented as some more expensive brands such as Nars, but I am OK with that.  </li>
            <li>I am left with a soft, pretty glow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because this is a soft powder, it brushes up easily when I sweep my brush across it, similar to a loose powder.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply and has a faint luster to the powder.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly dustier quality, as a few strokes of my brush in the container results in a fair amount of product on my brush.</li>
            <li>blush I particularly like to take with me because the container is secure and small.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very dark, but still too dark to use as an all over finish and too light to use as a blush.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised to get an envelope with three products in it from the manufacturer as well as a sheet explaining what each product was.</li>
            <li>Bronze shade was completely lost on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I applied the powder using a soft brush, and one or two passes is all I need for a natural look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you are fond of a refined look that seems natural and not made up, you should like this.  </li>
            <li>but it is also not heavy looking.</li>
            <li>As far as staying power, I may have to reapply once in the afternoon</li>
            <li>This is makeup how makeup was intended - meant to enhance your natural color rather than bring in color that doesn&#x27;t exist in the wild.</li>
            <li>I am fair complected with rosacea so finding a blush that suits my coloring is difficult.  </li>
            <li>Overall, though, these are high quality blushes, and for that they get five stars.</li>
            <li>I usually have to buy the lightest foundation shade available for any brand that I use.  </li>
            <li>All three are exactly the color I expected.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way &amp; it blends in easily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to have overly sensitive skin, but by lunchtime I could feel my face starting to itch and burn where the makeup had been applied.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, look no further for your make up and skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, which is why I usually spend a little more on make up.</li>
            <li>However, my mother is much, much lighter than me and for her they turned out extremely pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosy</li>
            <li>However, the three shades I have run a little pale (even Bronzed is more medium sunbaked gold than anything else)</li>
            <li>I have light skin tone and the blush looks quite subtle on my skin.</li>
            <li>The shades are subtle and worked to enhance my features instead of  coming on too strong and being obvious.</li>
            <li>Both of those were extremely sheer and could barely be seen.</li>
            <li>I actually much prefer this blush to some other way more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have to say, though subtle, it has buildable color, but is very pink, so I used it just enough to give a lightly healthy glow.</li>

            <li> It would work best on lighter skin tones.  </li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I have always had very good luck with Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a great brand for skin products and this blush is just another example of the companies excellent product line.</li>
            <li> Great blush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, as much as I liked the two shades and would have been happy to keep using them, this product did not agree with my skin at all!</li>
            <li> The Bronzed is also great to use as a blush, but I believe it&#x27;s intended to be a bronzer.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena products can be trusted, and they work great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this blush!!</li>
            <li> This blush is the perfect color for someone with very light colored skin.  </li>
            <li> I especially liked the bronzed blush as it gave my face a more deeper color.</li>
            <li> This blush in 10 Rosy is very nice on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> The bronzer has a nice look on its own, but the illuminating powder looked best over the rosy blush.</li>
            <li> However, if I dust it lightly on my cheeks, it is the perfect shade for me!  </li>
            <li> This is a good bronzer; it&#x27;s not sparkly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Luminous&amp;#34;/#50 is an illuminating powder; a good one without sparkles.  </li>
            <li> They all have a wonderful, smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> Another good color cosmetic from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> The number one thing I have to say about this product is that I loved the feel of it when applying -</li>
            <li> – this is the perfect hint of coverage with light reflecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products since I received them and have been very pleased with the way they look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mother loves the Neutrogena Healthy Blush!</li>
            <li> it was beautifully, silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The light rosy color is best suited to fair to light skin tone.</li>
            <li> The Luminous color made a great highlighter, and paired well with the rosy color for a light, feminine look if used as eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I do like my blush to be the 8 hour kind</li>
            <li> I thought it applied nicely even on</li>
            <li> You need your own brushes to apply this product.  </li>
            <li> light skinned gals, this set is very nice.</li>
            <li> It applied equally smoothly with fingers or a brush, and felt very nice going onto the skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to go from blush to clown, so</li>
            <li> a light hand is a good idea.</li>
            <li> This is good for a very fair skin tone and a younger woman.</li>
            <li> The Luminous is a very light illuminating powder.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin and have been loving the &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely color</li>
            <li> More of a darker neutral blush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a highly respectable brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In reality, this shade would be perfect for a light-skinned blonde.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give this another try when my face hits midwinter paleness because it is a lovely color.  </li>
            <li> , it is probably a better shade for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Bronzed&amp;#34;/#40 color is more of a bronzer than a blush</li>
            <li> So I was able to try all three colors.  </li>
            <li> I was always able to trust these products on my skin.  </li>
            <li> reference, I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li> It blends right into the skin and smooth and comfortable and looks great.</li>
            <li> However, the blush is a lovely consistency and brushes on easily.</li>
            <li> In person, I don&#x27;t think this blush is quite as pink as the picture, but it is a lovely color and has a wonderful iridescence to it.</li>
            <li> is a very pretty shade that turned out nicely for me.</li>
            <li> so if you have a darker complexion or a good tan, these may not make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> were it the right color for me, would look nice on my skin.  </li>
            <li> All three are easy to apply and blend...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It applies well, and dusts easily with a blush brush.  </li>
            <li> I have fair/medium skin (tan easily) with brunette hair, brown eyes.  </li>
            <li> I really could not tell I was wearing blush, but had a nice healthy rosy look, which is what you want in a blush.</li>
            <li> Easy to blend also.</li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin and looks pretty, is easy to blend, and stays put adequately for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very fair skin tone, and my skin is dry too.</li>
            <li> For my mother it looked fine but even on her</li>
            <li> Though, I have to say this bronzer is better than many I&#x27;ve tried, and if I were to learn how to apply properly, and if I were a &amp;#34;bronzer kind of woman,&amp;#34; it&#x27;d make a nice addition to my make-up &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; (my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; is I rarely wear make-up).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Application was easy using a good professional brush and the powder blended well with my make-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, just have your own blusher brush at the ready as this doesn&#x27;t come with one.  </li>
            <li> so smooth.</li>
            <li> I use a BB cream with light bronzer over it</li>
            <li> ; shade looks nice on the cheekbones, but since I already use bronzer, that and the &amp;#34;Luminous&amp;#34; shade don&#x27;t really do a whole lot for me.</li>
            <li> If you are light skinned like me, give this a try.  </li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Blush is available in 5 colors—3 blush tones, a bronzer, and an illuminating powder.</li>
            <li> There is a peachy-pink, a light bronzer, and a &amp;#34;shimmer.&amp;#34; The directions read to pull your make-up brush through the three colors and sweep over cheeks.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and blends very well.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I give it a light tap to shake the excess off and once applied</li>
            <li> I DO, however, really enjoy the Rosy shade and would acquire it again.</li>
            <li> Too light a powder</li>
            <li> or maybe it is just my perception of what blush color should look like in the package, but I completely ignored the fact that this is the lightest color blush in the collection and decided it looked like a good color for me.  </li>
            <li> For my pale skin I did like the Rosy the best.  </li>
            <li> So, the Rosy blush was an excellent choice – a reasonably pale peachy/rosy neutral color.</li>
            <li> so they are easily accessible?</li>
            <li> This line has a lot of colors on offer and is worth a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also silky smooth and looks beautiful as just something to smooth out your skin some and leave a slight shine to your skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, it feels super light on your face; like your skin can still</li>
            <li> rosy color is a soft, subtle tone, perfect for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I tried using them as eyeshadows and again, nothing too special.</li>
            <li> This is a great daytime color for when you just want a touch of pink on your cheeks and a bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> It also seems to have a good staying power as I don&#x27;t find myself needing to &#x27;touch-up&#x27; in the middle of the</li>
            <li> All three of these have good staying power and last all day without needing a touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a lovely color, but it doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin much at all.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased at how soft and silky the powder is, and even better, the color was very natural on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luminous: definitely NOT a blush, but does make a nice light all over foundation.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something bold, keep looking.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality blush that leaves a healthy, mild glow on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors in their pans.</li>
            <li> Apply lightly wherever light hits your skin; cheekbones, temples, forehead, middle of chin &amp; maybe the top of your nose.  </li>
            <li> This is officially my new favorite blush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to blend and lasts the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After applying a light foundation (right now I&#x27;m using Bobbie Brown), I used an angled blusher brush and first applied the peach-pink onto the apples of my cheeks -</li>
            <li> This is a lovely, natural looking rosy color blush.</li>
            <li> like the blush and the way it looks and feels; however, I&#x27;m not crazy about the plastic case it is packaged in.</li>
            <li> but it looks good blended with the rosy &amp; gives a deeper tawny color if the rosy is too pink for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products because they never irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The color is more natural than the picture would indicate.</li>
            <li> The rosy shade could have been good as a blush, but it was just a bit too pink for me.</li>
            <li> They all go  on easily and light and give the skin a glow with faint color to create a naturally beautiful look that doesn&#x27;t seem overdone.  </li>
            <li> It lasts most of the day on my skin - longer than most other blush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply too much because it is a soft product.</li>
            <li> , I was also sent two other blushes that were equally of good quality.</li>
            <li> At 60 years old, this is true even more than when I was young, and a subtle touch is just perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> It went on lightly and easily wiht my sable brush, and didn&#x27;t need wiping to blend into my skin properly.</li>
            <li> you are a purist when it comes to natural and non-toxic, this is probably safe enough for most people, but the ingredient list has a lot of unpronounceable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I love the light pink blushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy and natural to apply.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena Blush is light, natural and fresh looking and that is why I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bronzed bronzer is my least favorite of the three products – probably my own fault for never mastering the use of bronzers.</li>
            <li> It is very light, but just enough to give you some color.</li>
            <li> The highlighter is so subtle it&#x27;s nearly invisible on, but gives just a nice hint of light to the top of the cheekbone.</li>
            <li> First, they all feel cushiony to the touch -</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these blushes!!</li>
            <li> Though the luminous shade used when wet was nice.</li>
            <li> The powder just slides on, it&#x27;s a lovely powder physically,</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;d be ok with it if it actually showed up on my cheeks to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you have oily skin, you  may want to avoid this step because it will only make your skin more shiny.  </li>
            <li> Having three different containers isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but since I, and perhaps many others, will use these together, and they come together, why not put them all in one</li>
            <li> I dont have to worry if it will break, and the pretty color can also be used on my eyes in a pinch.</li>
            <li> -wise they are all a bit similar, but behave differently.</li>
            <li> The bronzer tones down the color, and the illuminator gives it a nice glow.</li>
            <li> When I run my brush over it, it seems a little too powdery but nonetheless, it goes on the cheeks easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not come with a brush which is fine with me because I never use those tiny brushes anyway.  </li>
            <li> I next swept a bit of the shimmer on the tops of my cheeks (over the cheekbones) and a little more on different areas of my face - what I loved about this &amp;#34;luminescence&amp;#34; is that it didn&#x27;t give me a sparkly shimmer, but</li>
            <li> With practice, though, I&#x27;ve found all three products work very well together.</li>
            <li> Very relieved that this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes quality products at a reasonably price and this blush is no exception.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t much of a bronzing shade.</li>
            <li> But then, I do like a much brighter highlight, like Mary Louminzer and a Becca highlight.</li>
            <li> For my much lighter skinned mother it did look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also lasts all day, and adds a very flattering color to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> It feels very silky and,</li>
            <li> I really like this blush &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34;/#10.  </li>
            <li> This is a blush that is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it stays on very well.  </li>
            <li> While they could all be used as blushes on different skin tone, it was basically a contouring set for me: blush (Rosy), light gold bronzer (Bronzed) and highlighter (Luminous).</li>
            <li> This blush is a versatile peachy pink that will work for many skin tones.</li>
            <li> It has a substantial amount of pigment so you don&#x27;t need to use much to get color</li>
            <li> so I probably won&#x27;t get much use out of it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s light enough for them to use for dress</li>
            <li> But if your skin tone is already a little more olive or tan, both of those shades would look great for just a little extra glow!</li>
            <li> , I just have a natural glow ;)</li>
            <li> The container is quite small as it has neither a blush brush nor a mirror, so you&#x27;ll have to provide your own.</li>
            <li> I usually just wear Leven Rose Jojoba Oil on my face, eyeliner, blush and lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I have porcelain skin, and I find that a little bit of this blush (Rosy) goes a long way - more so than some other brands available at the drug store because of being more highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer is a little more intense color-wise.</li>
            <li> So those of us who really, REALLY want to be ABSOLUTELY NATURAL, might want to look further to get exactly the right product.  </li>
            <li> The color lasts longer than many less pigmented drugstore blushes.</li>
            <li> instead a very natural &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d use this luminescence powder even by itself - very  nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend,.</li>
            <li> Just a little &amp;#34;sun kissed&amp;#34; and nothing more.  </li>
            <li> blush seems gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t cause an irritation.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34; is a light pink with a hint of tawny/peachy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fairly sensitive skin my whole life, breakouts were a part of my everyday for many years.  </li>
            <li> In the pictures, the two darker colors (Vibrant and Flushed) seemed as though they&#x27;d be clownishly dark even for someone like me who is a brunette with skin that tans easily and a lot of color in my face even in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use Bare Minerals and was pleasantly surprised that Neutrogena had a product out that was just as good.</li>
            <li> If you just want something that looks nice and isn&#x27;t irritating, this might be exactly the thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would normally select.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just right for an &amp;#34;Earth Mother&amp;#34; but probably not enough drama for a &amp;#34;Beauty Queen&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I might consider purchasing the Rosy in the future if the price were right.</li>
            <li> AND I find myself only needing to apply lightly once in the morning and that gets me through the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a nice blush for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause any issues with my very sensitive skin, and the coloring lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It is not as pigmented as some more expensive brands such as Nars, but I am OK with that.  </li>
            <li> I am left with a soft, pretty glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because this is a soft powder, it brushes up easily when I sweep my brush across it, similar to a loose powder.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply and has a faint luster to the powder.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly dustier quality, as a few strokes of my brush in the container results in a fair amount of product on my brush.</li>
            <li> blush I particularly like to take with me because the container is secure and small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very dark, but still too dark to use as an all over finish and too light to use as a blush.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to get an envelope with three products in it from the manufacturer as well as a sheet explaining what each product was.</li>
            <li> Bronze shade was completely lost on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I applied the powder using a soft brush, and one or two passes is all I need for a natural look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you are fond of a refined look that seems natural and not made up, you should like this.  </li>
            <li> but it is also not heavy looking.</li>
            <li> As far as staying power, I may have to reapply once in the afternoon</li>
            <li> This is makeup how makeup was intended - meant to enhance your natural color rather than bring in color that doesn&#x27;t exist in the wild.</li>
            <li> I am fair complected with rosacea so finding a blush that suits my coloring is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Overall, though, these are high quality blushes, and for that they get five stars.</li>
            <li> I usually have to buy the lightest foundation shade available for any brand that I use.  </li>
            <li> All three are exactly the color I expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way &amp; it blends in easily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have overly sensitive skin, but by lunchtime I could feel my face starting to itch and burn where the makeup had been applied.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, look no further for your make up and skin care products.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, which is why I usually spend a little more on make up.</li>
            <li> However, my mother is much, much lighter than me and for her they turned out extremely pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosy</li>
            <li> However, the three shades I have run a little pale (even Bronzed is more medium sunbaked gold than anything else)</li>
            <li> I have light skin tone and the blush looks quite subtle on my skin.</li>
            <li> The shades are subtle and worked to enhance my features instead of  coming on too strong and being obvious.</li>
            <li> Both of those were extremely sheer and could barely be seen.</li>
            <li> I actually much prefer this blush to some other way more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have to say, though subtle, it has buildable color, but is very pink, so I used it just enough to give a lightly healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Bronzed is too dark for my skin tone, and Luminous doesn&#x27;t really do enough to be worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> Something was off, and it just looked more dirty than properly bronzed on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives my cheeks a light pinkish touch without the thick and heavy feel.</li>
            <li> On my pale skin with red blotches, it smooths out the colors and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> (Trying the makeup had been the only thing I&#x27;d done differently in terms of lifestyle or products over the previous several days, so</li>
            <li> This blush is actually a little bit too dark if I apply too much.  </li>
            <li> To use as bronzer apply it before blush to apple of your cheek, forehead, nose &amp; chin - go light or it will look fake &amp; tacky.  </li>
            <li> Avoid sparkly  - they make you look cheap &amp; fake.  </li>
            <li> I felt it lasted for a long while.</li>
            <li> I also used it with a thin professional eyebrow brush in the creases of my lid to give a more dusty look.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;d definitely purchase this when I run out.</li>
            <li> neutrogena didn&#x27;t look cakey or dry, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive than the previous blush I had been using, and it is so much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> - I usually wear the second or third lightest foundation in any given line.</li>
            <li> If you are used to a dramatic look, then you might not care for this particular product because it goes on light and the color is faint and almost undetectable.  </li>
            <li> Because it is so pink</li>
            <li> My skin is light/medium in tone and for me a little goes a long way – I avoid clown-face.</li>
            <li> It might be a tad dark in the deep pale of winter for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain except to say that it was very soft and had a nearly imperceptible give to it when swatched with finger tips.</li>
            <li> It barely shows up on my pale pale skin.</li>
            <li> The other colors that came to test out were Luminous and Bronzed.</li>
            <li> I expect a color called rosy to be very pink and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - the Rosy is not rosy enough when applied, the compact is a little difficult to open, I have to slide my fingernail in between the lid and bottom at the corner to open it without fighting it.</li>
            <li> and I used it on areas around my eyes that can are in shadow and look dark – for example the areas on either side of the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> As scary dark as Vibrant looks in the pictures</li>
            <li> Anything in either extreme -- too matte or too glittery – can look harsh and unnatural.</li>

            <li> (not for covering heavy imperfections)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The containers it came in were small and sturdy, and well shaped - it didn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;d have any trouble using it all the way down to the end,</li>
            <li> SInce Neutrogena is less expensive than Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy, but I prefer the softer look it creates over that of a hard pressed powder.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to get an envelope with three products in it from the manufacturer as well as a sheet explaining what each product was. First, they all feel cushiony to the touch - it&#x27;s hard to explain except to say that it was very soft and had a nearly imperceptible give to it when swatched with finger tips. I&#x27;ve been using these products since I received them and have been very pleased with the way they look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tone-wise they are all a bit similar, but behave differently. The highlighter is so subtle it&#x27;s nearly invisible on, but gives just a nice hint of light to the top of the cheekbone. I used the blush on the apples of my cheeks  - I have to say, though subtle, it has buildable color, but is very pink, so I used it just enough to give a lightly healthy glow. The bronzer is a little more intense color-wise. It&#x27;s very easy to apply too much because it is a soft product. My hard panned powder bronzers are a little easier to control;. With practice, though, I&#x27;ve found all three products work very well together.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this blush!! This is officially my new favorite blush. It is much less expensive than the previous blush I had been using, and it is so much better in my opinion. So I have the rosy, bronze, and luminous. All three are exactly the color I expected. All three are easy to apply and blend... so smooth. I have a very fair skin tone, and my skin is dry too. Sometimes I find that blush makes me look like a clown and I can&#x27;t get it to blend in well. No issues here. Doesn&#x27;t even look like I applied blush, I just have a natural glow ;) AND I find myself only needing to apply lightly once in the morning and that gets me through the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No irritation- I have sensitive skin, which is why I usually spend a little more on make up. Very relieved that this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. Highly recommend these blushes!!</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin and have been loving the &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34; shade. I use a BB cream with light bronzer over it and then I apply this to my cheekbones.It definitely helps accentuate them without being too obvious (I think obvious-looking blush looks so bad). I actually much prefer this blush to some other way more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used. Plus, it feels super light on your face; like your skin can still breathe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the &amp;#34;Bronzed&amp;#34; shade looks nice on the cheekbones, but since I already use bronzer, that and the &amp;#34;Luminous&amp;#34; shade don&#x27;t really do a whole lot for me. But if your skin tone is already a little more olive or tan, both of those shades would look great for just a little extra glow!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely, natural looking rosy color blush. It doesn&#x27;t appear as pinky as what the product image shows. The container is quite small as it has neither a blush brush nor a mirror, so you&#x27;ll have to provide your own. When I run my brush over it, it seems a little too powdery but nonetheless, it goes on the cheeks easily and smoothly. I have light skin tone and the blush looks quite subtle on my skin. It gives my cheeks a light pinkish touch without the thick and heavy feel. It also seems to have a good staying power as I don&#x27;t find myself needing to &#x27;touch-up&#x27; in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blush seems gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t cause an irritation. The light rosy color is best suited to fair to light skin tone. It&#x27;s a lovely color and I like the look and feel of it on my cheeks. Neutrogena makes quality products at a reasonably price and this blush is no exception. Overall, it is a nice blush for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors in their pans. But on a medium NC 35 the colors got a little lost on me. However, my mother is much, much lighter than me and for her they turned out extremely pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosy is a very pretty shade that turned out nicely for me. Pigmented and not powdery. I felt it lasted for a long while. I had my It Cosmetics CC cream on underneath and the color lasted for at least 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bronze shade was completely lost on my skin tone. It didn&#x27;t even show up. For my mother it looked fine but even on her it wasn&#x27;t much of a bronzing shade. More of a darker neutral blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The luminous shade did nothing for me. It did add some shine but nothing to write home about. But then, I do like a much brighter highlight, like Mary Louminzer and a Becca highlight. For my much lighter skinned mother it did look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For light skinned gals, this set is very nice. For me.... eh. I tried using them as eyeshadows and again, nothing too special. Though the luminous shade used when wet was nice.</li>
            <li> This came as three compacts, one of the Rosy blush#10, one of the nude-like powder Luminous #50 and one darker brick-like shade called Bronzed #40 They are all labeled as &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; on the front of the compact, but they are not all blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosy: The Rosy is not rosy enough. It barely shows up on my pale pale skin. It looks rosy in the compact but it doesn&#x27;t go on that deep on your cheeks. The powder just slides on, it&#x27;s a lovely powder physically, it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply and has a faint luster to the powder. I would be tempted to get the the blush in a deeper shade like &amp;#34;Flushed&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t come with a brush, so if you&#x27;re going to take it with you to reapply, you&#x27;ll have to carry a brush with it. I do like my blush to be the 8 hour kind, This isn&#x27;t but I think I&#x27;d be ok with it if it actually showed up on my cheeks to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luminous: definitely NOT a blush, but does make a nice light all over foundation. That&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve been using it. As someone else mentioned you can use it on  your eyelids, as well. It&#x27;s also silky smooth and looks beautiful as just something to smooth out your skin some and leave a slight shine to your skin. (not for covering heavy imperfections)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronzed: I&#x27;ve used it on my eyelids. It&#x27;s not very dark, but still too dark to use as an all over finish and too light to use as a blush. I don&#x27;t contour my face, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s efficacy for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - the Rosy is not rosy enough when applied, the compact is a little difficult to open, I have to slide my fingernail in between the lid and bottom at the corner to open it without fighting it. No brush means you can&#x27;t just toss it in your purse. I think I&#x27;ll try the Flushed, stay tuned for my review of that.</li>
            <li> This blush is the perfect color for someone with very light colored skin.  I usually have to buy the lightest foundation shade available for any brand that I use.  This blush is actually a little bit too dark if I apply too much.  However, if I dust it lightly on my cheeks, it is the perfect shade for me!  I love the light pink blushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies well, and dusts easily with a blush brush.  It also lasts all day, and adds a very flattering color to my cheeks.  If you are light skinned like me, give this a try.  Neutrogena is a highly respectable brand.  I will be buying some of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Blush is available in 5 colors—3 blush tones, a bronzer, and an illuminating powder. I am using the rosy blush, the bronzer, and illuminator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosy color is a soft, subtle tone, perfect for my fair skin. I applied the powder using a soft brush, and one or two passes is all I need for a natural look. The color will deepen with an additional application.  The bronzer and the illuminating powder both blend well with this color. The bronzer tones down the color, and the illuminator gives it a nice glow. The bronzer has a nice look on its own, but the illuminating powder looked best over the rosy blush. All three of these have good staying power and last all day without needing a touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is a soft powder, it brushes up easily when I sweep my brush across it, similar to a loose powder. It can be a little messy, but I prefer the softer look it creates over that of a hard pressed powder. Plus it&#x27;s easier to blend a softer product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the blush and the way it looks and feels; however, I&#x27;m not crazy about the plastic case it is packaged in. The cases are very difficult to open, and while this is a plus when carrying them in a purse or make-up bag, it&#x27;s frustrating to fight with them when I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the color setting on my computer&#x27;s monitor or maybe it is just my perception of what blush color should look like in the package, but I completely ignored the fact that this is the lightest color blush in the collection and decided it looked like a good color for me.  In the pictures, the two darker colors (Vibrant and Flushed) seemed as though they&#x27;d be clownishly dark even for someone like me who is a brunette with skin that tans easily and a lot of color in my face even in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, this shade would be perfect for a light-skinned blonde.  It is a lovely color, but it doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin much at all.  It feels very silky and, were it the right color for me, would look nice on my skin.  There appears to be a slight sheen to it when it is on but I wouldn&#x27;t call it shiny.  I thought it applied nicely even on middle-aged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give this another try when my face hits midwinter paleness because it is a lovely color.  As scary dark as Vibrant looks in the pictures, it is probably a better shade for me.</li>
            <li> The shades are subtle and worked to enhance my features instead of  coming on too strong and being obvious. It went on lightly and easily wiht my sable brush, and didn&#x27;t need wiping to blend into my skin properly.</li>
            <li> I expect a color called rosy to be very pink and this is no exception. However, the blush is a lovely consistency and brushes on easily. It&#x27;s easy to blend and lasts the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutrogena didn&#x27;t look cakey or dry, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. This is good for a very fair skin tone and a younger woman. Because it is so pink it&#x27;s very easy to go from blush to clown, so a light hand is a good idea.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34;/#10.  I have fair/medium skin (tan easily) with brunette hair, brown eyes.  Blush with a bit of &amp;#34;tawny&amp;#34; color looks best on me.  This &amp;#34;Rosy&amp;#34; is a light pink with a hint of tawny/peachy so works perfectly with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not come with a brush which is fine with me because I never use those tiny brushes anyway.  A little goes a long way &amp; it blends in easily.  It lasts most of the day on my skin - longer than most other blush.  I had no skin irritation &amp; there is no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Bronzed&amp;#34;/#40 color is more of a bronzer than a blush but it looks good blended with the rosy &amp; gives a deeper tawny color if the rosy is too pink for your skin.  To use as bronzer apply it before blush to apple of your cheek, forehead, nose &amp; chin - go light or it will look fake &amp; tacky.  This is a good bronzer; it&#x27;s not sparkly.  Don&#x27;t go more than 2 shades darker than your skin or you will look really fake.  This one #40 is a medium tone IMO.  It might be a tad dark in the deep pale of winter for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Luminous&amp;#34;/#50 is an illuminating powder; a good one without sparkles.  Avoid sparkly  - they make you look cheap &amp; fake.  You put this on after makeup &amp; blush to illuminate your skin.  Apply lightly wherever light hits your skin; cheekbones, temples, forehead, middle of chin &amp; maybe the top of your nose.  But if you have oily skin, you  may want to avoid this step because it will only make your skin more shiny.  Or use only on areas that are not oily.  I have an oily t-zone so I only apply this to my cheekbones and temples.</li>
            <li> I usually use Bare Minerals and was pleasantly surprised that Neutrogena had a product out that was just as good. Application was easy using a good professional brush and the powder blended well with my make-up. SInce Neutrogena is less expensive than Bare Minerals I will probably use  this brand, I was also sent two other blushes that were equally of good quality. I especially liked the bronzed blush as it gave my face a more deeper color. I also used it with a thin professional eyebrow brush in the creases of my lid to give a more dusty look. Highly recommend,.</li>
            <li> skin type: sensitive&lt;br /&gt;age: 50s&lt;br /&gt;skin tone: slightly fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blush comes in three containers - not just one. There is a peachy-pink, a light bronzer, and a &amp;#34;shimmer.&amp;#34; The directions read to pull your make-up brush through the three colors and sweep over cheeks. After applying a light foundation (right now I&#x27;m using Bobbie Brown), I used an angled blusher brush and first applied the peach-pink onto the apples of my cheeks - I was very pleased at how soft and silky the powder is, and even better, the color was very natural on my skin. This is as they say: between a powder and a cream that&#x27;s easy and natural to apply. I really could not tell I was wearing blush, but had a nice healthy rosy look, which is what you want in a blush. I next swept a bit of the shimmer on the tops of my cheeks (over the cheekbones) and a little more on different areas of my face - what I loved about this &amp;#34;luminescence&amp;#34; is that it didn&#x27;t give me a sparkly shimmer, but instead a very natural &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d use this luminescence powder even by itself - very  nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer I am not as fond of - but that&#x27;s simply because I am not a fan of bronzers. If not applied correctly, they can cast a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; look or look unnatural. Though, I have to say this bronzer is better than many I&#x27;ve tried, and if I were to learn how to apply properly, and if I were a &amp;#34;bronzer kind of woman,&amp;#34; it&#x27;d make a nice addition to my make-up &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; (my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; is I rarely wear make-up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I have is that I wish the colors had come in one package together. Even if there was a way to connect them or something. Having three different containers isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but since I, and perhaps many others, will use these together, and they come together, why not put them all in one so they are easily accessible? Other than that, I&#x27;d definitely purchase this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am fair complected with rosacea so finding a blush that suits my coloring is difficult.  I also need one that isn&#x27;t going to irritate my skin and cause a break out.  I use Neutrogena soaps and foundation so it made sense to try this blush.  In the package I received the blush Rosy plus the bronzer and the luminous powder.  All can be used as a blusher but I used Rosy for blush, the bronzer to highlight areas to get a sunkist look and the luminous powder all over.  You need your own brushes to apply this product.  It goes on nicely and blends very well.  On my pale skin with red blotches, it smooths out the colors and looks natural.  If you are looking for something bold, keep looking.  This is a blush that is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, when I remove my makeup with a facial cleansing wipe, there is plenty of color so it stays on very well.  It&#x27;s just very subtle.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality blush that leaves a healthy, mild glow on my skin. I received three shades: Rosy, Bronzed, and Luminous. While they could all be used as blushes on different skin tone, it was basically a contouring set for me: blush (Rosy), light gold bronzer (Bronzed) and highlighter (Luminous). They all have a wonderful, smooth consistency. The powder goes on flawlessly, and has the staying power of a cream blush. It doesn&#x27;t cause any issues with my very sensitive skin, and the coloring lasts all day. However, the three shades I have run a little pale (even Bronzed is more medium sunbaked gold than anything else) so if you have a darker complexion or a good tan, these may not make much of a difference. Overall, though, these are high quality blushes, and for that they get five stars.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products because they never irritate my sensitive skin.  This product performed the same.  I tried the Rosy 10,and also Bronzed  40, as well as Luminous 50.  For my pale skin I did like the Rosy the best.  It complements my skin tone and hair quite well.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, just have your own blusher brush at the ready as this doesn&#x27;t come with one.  It has lasted all day and even stayed on throughout a 9 hour work day followed by 3 hours of rock climbing.  It has staying power.  It is not as pigmented as some more expensive brands such as Nars, but I am OK with that.  The price difference makes up for that.  I can buy 6 packs of this blush for 1 Nars blush and have it cost the same (and if I don&#x27;t like the color, I&#x27;m not out all of that cash.)</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who thinks &amp;#34;Less is More&amp;#34; when it comes to cosmetics.  At 60 years old, this is true even more than when I was young, and a subtle touch is just perfect for me.  This Neutrogena Blush is light, natural and fresh looking and that is why I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Rosy color and when the package came, there was also the Bronzed and Luminous included.  So I was able to try all three colors.  They all go  on easily and light and give the skin a glow with faint color to create a naturally beautiful look that doesn&#x27;t seem overdone.  Just a little &amp;#34;sun kissed&amp;#34; and nothing more.  I think it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a purist when it comes to natural and non-toxic, this is probably safe enough for most people, but the ingredient list has a lot of unpronounceable ingredients.  So those of us who really, REALLY want to be ABSOLUTELY NATURAL, might want to look further to get exactly the right product.  If you just want something that looks nice and isn&#x27;t irritating, this might be exactly the thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are fond of a refined look that seems natural and not made up, you should like this.  If you are used to a dramatic look, then you might not care for this particular product because it goes on light and the color is faint and almost undetectable.  Just right for an &amp;#34;Earth Mother&amp;#34; but probably not enough drama for a &amp;#34;Beauty Queen&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This blush is a versatile peachy pink that will work for many skin tones. It has a substantial amount of pigment so you don&#x27;t need to use much to get color but it is also not heavy looking. Easy to blend also. The color lasts longer than many less pigmented drugstore blushes. Another good color cosmetic from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> This blush in 10 Rosy is very nice on my fair skin. It has a slightly dustier quality, as a few strokes of my brush in the container results in a fair amount of product on my brush. That being said, I give it a light tap to shake the excess off and once applied I am left with a soft, pretty glow. It has very little shimmer, which I like. As far as staying power, I may have to reapply once in the afternoon but thats about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blush I particularly like to take with me because the container is secure and small. I dont have to worry if it will break, and the pretty color can also be used on my eyes in a pinch. This line has a lot of colors on offer and is worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have porcelain skin, and I find that a little bit of this blush (Rosy) goes a long way - more so than some other brands available at the drug store because of being more highly pigmented.  It feels good on the skin and looks pretty, is easy to blend, and stays put adequately for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luminous and Bronzed shades also came with the Rosy, but I don&#x27;t find that I use them.  Bronzed is too dark for my skin tone, and Luminous doesn&#x27;t really do enough to be worth the trouble.  I DO, however, really enjoy the Rosy shade and would acquire it again.</li>
            <li> In person, I don&#x27;t think this blush is quite as pink as the picture, but it is a lovely color and has a wonderful iridescence to it. The color is more natural than the picture would indicate. This is a great daytime color for when you just want a touch of pink on your cheeks and a bit of shimmer. This is makeup how makeup was intended - meant to enhance your natural color rather than bring in color that doesn&#x27;t exist in the wild. Great blush.</li>
            <li> My mother loves the Neutrogena Healthy Blush! It blends right into the skin and smooth and comfortable and looks great. Neutrogena is a great brand for skin products and this blush is just another example of the companies excellent product line.</li>
            <li> The number one thing I have to say about this product is that I loved the feel of it when applying - it was beautifully, silky smooth. It applied equally smoothly with fingers or a brush, and felt very nice going onto the skin. The containers it came in were small and sturdy, and well shaped - it didn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;d have any trouble using it all the way down to the end, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have pretty fair skin - I usually wear the second or third lightest foundation in any given line. The Luminous color made a great highlighter, and paired well with the rosy color for a light, feminine look if used as eyeshadow. The rosy shade could have been good as a blush, but it was just a bit too pink for me. Unfortunately, the bronzer shade didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Something was off, and it just looked more dirty than properly bronzed on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as much as I liked the two shades and would have been happy to keep using them, this product did not agree with my skin at all! I don&#x27;t consider myself to have overly sensitive skin, but by lunchtime I could feel my face starting to itch and burn where the makeup had been applied. I scrubbed it all off, and the sensation went away, but the next day I had a terrible breakout! (Trying the makeup had been the only thing I&#x27;d done differently in terms of lifestyle or products over the previous several days, so I know it was the cause.) Sadly, despite the lovely colors, I will not be using this again.</li>
            <li> I tried three different products -- Rosy blush, Bronzed bronzer and Luminous illuminating powder. My skin is light/medium in tone and for me a little goes a long way – I avoid clown-face. So, the Rosy blush was an excellent choice – a reasonably pale peachy/rosy neutral color. For application I used a big blush brush. It picked up the almost matte powder well and distributed it evenly. I had no caking or clumping or loss of an unreasonable amount of powder. No unnatural glitter– just a little color and subtle glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luminous illuminating powder is also very subtle – again it fits my preference. Anything in either extreme -- too matte or too glittery – can look harsh and unnatural. But this powder has the barest hint of a glow and I used it on areas around my eyes that can are in shadow and look dark – for example the areas on either side of the bridge of my nose. Too light a powder and you get raccoon eyes – this is the perfect hint of coverage with light reflecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bronzed bronzer is my least favorite of the three products – probably my own fault for never mastering the use of bronzers. I did try it on my eye lids as an eye shadow substitute and although it worked somewhat well, it is not a shade I would normally select.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand’s creams and skin care products are always in the sample basket at my dermatologist’s office. She has recommended specific products from the line, and although not cosmetics it does offer some reassurance to me of the basic quality.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I have always had very good luck with Neutrogena products.  I&#x27;ve had fairly sensitive skin my whole life, breakouts were a part of my everyday for many years.  I was always able to trust these products on my skin.  I&#x27;ve never had a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received three colors, Rosy, Bronzed and Luminous.  The Rosy is perfect for my skin tone.  It would work best on lighter skin tones.  The Bronzed is also great to use as a blush, but I believe it&#x27;s intended to be a bronzer.  The Luminous is a very light illuminating powder.  It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve ever used so I probably won&#x27;t get much use out of it.  I will probably give that to the girls to play with as I won&#x27;t use it and it&#x27;s light enough for them to use for dress up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, look no further for your make up and skin care products.  Neutrogena products can be trusted, and they work great.</li>
            <li> Review by my daughter: I like the Rosy color. It is very light, but just enough to give you some color. It isn&#x27;t overly sparkly either. I usually just wear Leven Rose Jojoba Oil on my face, eyeliner, blush and lip gloss. The other colors that came to test out were Luminous and Bronzed. Both of those were extremely sheer and could barely be seen. I might consider purchasing the Rosy in the future if the price were right.</li>
