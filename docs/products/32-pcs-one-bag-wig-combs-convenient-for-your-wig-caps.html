            <li> PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEEDED THEM FOR</li>
            <li> I like these for my wigs...they are not too long and dont snag in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SOO happy that I found these because I was still buying the wired wig combs that came as a whole, and I had to cut individual pieces with wire cutters. With cutting each piece the end piece that would be cut always ended up hurting and started snagging at my real hair. The affordable price for so many pre cut, and plus they slide in and out so easily with no pain definitely makes me happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Combs received in great condition.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like it the little fabric on these combs aren&#x27;t very secure and the sharp edges stick out and hurt. But they are bendy and flexible and that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and as described.</li>

            <li> These combs are awesome!!! !! !! Omg I love them. I just switched out my wig clips I had on my wig. The wig clips I had hurt and seem to pull my hair.  However,  I just installed these wig combs they are lightweight,  comfortable,  a great price and I especially love the satin lining.  They kept my wig extremely flat. I would definitely recommend them to others.  As long as you keep selling I&#x27;ll keep buying.  Awesome product! Oh and the shipping was amazing.  It was very fast and the sellers communication was superb</li>
            <li> I like it.it work very comfortable</li>

            <li> Yes I&#x27;m totally satisfied and I will reorder them&lt;br /&gt;again and again yes I love them</li>
            <li> Comfortable. Easy to sew on to wig cap . I don&#x27;t need to sew wig Down it is super secure. I even went jumping on trampoline, very secure.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THISE CLIPS THE BEST OUT OF ALL THE WIG CLIPS OR MY HAT AS I CALL IT THE COLOR WAS PERFECT AND THEY WORKED REALLY WELL WITH MY LITTLE FISHNET CAP THAT I  PUT ON FIRST WHEN I AM GOING SOMEWHERE IN DISGUISE. THAT IS HOW I FEEL WHEN I WEAR MY WIGS. I LOVE NOT HAVING TO WASH AND STYLE MY HAIR ALL THE TIME. WHAT A RELIEF! EVERYONE SHOULD WEAR WIGS OR HATS AS I CALL THEM.</li>
            <li> They hold my wig up well</li>
            <li> Good price for functional pieces. I sewed them into the lining of the wig, and have held up well and comfortably under &amp;#34;test wears&amp;#34;. Will update if they don&#x27;t fare well for 8 hours at the con! They are very flexible, I can&#x27;t imagine using them in any other way but sewn in.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took quite a while from China, which is to be expected, but be aware, it&#x27;s marked as delivered when it arrives at your local PO for delivery. Not when it arrives at your door! It took an extra 3 days to arrive after it was showing delivered.</li>
            <li> They do what they should</li>
            <li> It will serve its purpose. I was expecting different lengths, they&#x27;re all the same. I&#x27;ll use them that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> These were great I sewed them into my hair piece and they are soft and do not budge. I love their service. They shipped quickly</li>
            <li> wonderful. shipping was fast and the quality of the bombs are great they don&#x27;t scratch my scalp when i apply my wig and they dont pull my hair when i remove my wig. i would give 10 stars if i could</li>
            <li> Wig combs are nice have satin wrapped base. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of wigs arriving without combs or set in the wrong places for you, these are the solution! I can push them through between wefts from the outside of the wig and hide them (better than bobby pins!!) or sew them to the i side of your wig cap. These hold really great. I&#x27;m very happy I tried them.</li>
