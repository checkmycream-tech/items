            <li>I love these ponytail holders!</li>
            <li>Nice colors.</li>
            <li>love these things for my daughter who is now 4.</li>
            <li>These are adorable.  </li>
            <li>It would probably work better on an infant or toddler.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>These are easy in and easy out, and they don&#x27;t hurt her head!</li>
            <li>they stretch easily and are easy on her hair.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for my two year old and can even be used on the four year old!!</li>
            <li>So for that they work fine.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, easy to use on and off.  </li>
            <li>I will say, they don&#x27;t hold my daughters fine, curly hair as well as the rubber bands.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous.</li>
            <li>Which makes  them perfect for hairstyles with lots of small ponytails.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Sooo much better than those pesky rubber bands that promise you they will be gentle on your kids hair but are bound to leave your child with a horse shoe hair pattern.</li>
            <li>Cute colors and very versatile.</li>
            <li>Great fit for my 3 years old daughters tiny hair.</li>
            <li>They stay in my thin hair perfectly!</li>
            <li>and he flies right after them.  </li>
            <li>Great for our 1 year old who has long hair.</li>
            <li>Small but great</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li>quality is good and they can be reused a few times.</li>
            <li>but they are cheap enough reordering them</li>
            <li>She is 14 months and doesn&#x27;t have much hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a daughter with very nappy hair.</li>
            <li>Great size for my toddler who has straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>These are great, don&#x27;t break my hair and small enough to wrap twice and be done with it.  </li>
            <li>They work well enough, though, for a 3 year old who is going to easily lose them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to save these until she&#x27;s older.</li>
            <li>I buy these to wrap around my machine embroidery thread spools and bobbins to secure loose ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these if you want to style your child&#x27;s hair without her having to lose any of it.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to replace a bunch that were lost and they&#x27;re slightly thicker than the ones we were replacing but also more comfortable (as my daughter is complaining about her ponytails less)!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t snag her hair, and seem to retain their elasticity so far, so again they work for what I need.</li>
            <li>We lose hair ties every time we use them on our 2 year old.</li>
            <li>However, not very high quality, since even on first use several of them are fraying.  </li>
            <li>I love these because they do not damage my already thin and fragile hair.</li>

            <li> She has long hair</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use after washing my daughter&#x27;s kinky/curly hair, to put into long ponytails to stretch out her hair as it dries overnight.  </li>
            <li> Though, it&#x27;s worth not feeling like a terrible mom for yanking out her baby fine hair when I finally muster up the guts to undo it.</li>
            <li> These are much smaller than the typical children&#x27;s ponytailer.  </li>
            <li> These are fluffy enough to be a chocking hazard.</li>
            <li> only thing is they are small</li>
            <li> These are small enough to compliment her ponytails.</li>
            <li> They come in an assortment of colors, they&#x27;re easy to use, they take some time to stretch out and they truly aren&#x27;t painful for my daughter when I take them out.</li>
            <li> But I have a wild, tough girl.</li>
            <li> The elasticity is not super durable...  </li>
            <li> I bought these to try instead of the black rubber bands to hold my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> By ends day, they do slide a little out of place.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll probably be useful for years to come but, unfortunately, they&#x27;re not great quality and start to snag and run after a number of uses.</li>
            <li> They are small and get lost often and do stretch out eventually</li>
            <li> if you need small.  </li>
            <li> These are small - It wraps around 3 times even on my 10 MO hair, however thats not the reason I give it 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> As some reviewer mentioned they are small.</li>
            <li> I have very thin brittle hair.</li>
            <li> afraid she&#x27;d put pull one out of her hair and it in her mouth.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> love these things for my daughter who is now 4. She has long hair and it&#x27;s curly so we need to put it up to keep it untangled. She loves picking which color we&#x27;ll use for the day. They are small and get lost often and do stretch out eventually but they are cheap enough reordering them every 6 months won&#x27;t break the bank</li>
            <li> I have very thin brittle hair. These are great, don&#x27;t break my hair and small enough to wrap twice and be done with it.  Nothing fancy, but perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love these ponytail holders! Great selection of colors! They stay in my thin hair perfectly! I highly recommend them!!</li>

I ordered these to replace a bunch that were lost and they&#x27;re slightly thicker than the ones we were replacing but also more comfortable (as my daughter is complaining about her ponytails less)! Definitely recommend these- they&#x27;re a great price!</li>
            <li> the best find for my lo. finally something i can use to give her pigtails as her hair grows. they stretch easily and are easy on her hair. only thing is they are small so i don&#x27;t keep them in her hair while driving alone with her in the carseat. afraid she&#x27;d put pull one out of her hair and it in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Great colors.  Great size for my toddler who has straight, thin hair.  The elasticity is not super durable...  They work well enough, though, for a 3 year old who is going to easily lose them.</li>
            <li> These are adorable.  Small but great if you need small.  We also use them to entertain our hyperactive Abyssinian cat.  We ping them thru the air and he flies right after them.  Good entertainment for us all, and he loves them!  :o)</li>
            <li> does not pull daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Just a simple well-working product.</li>

            <li> These are small - It wraps around 3 times even on my 10 MO hair, however thats not the reason I give it 3 stars.  She promptly took pulled it out and in her mouth! These are fluffy enough to be a chocking hazard. I&#x27;ll have to save these until she&#x27;s older.</li>
            <li> Great fit for my 3 years old daughters tiny hair.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy to use on and off.  Nice colors.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with very nappy hair. Rubber bands were breaking several times a day. These are easy in and easy out, and they don&#x27;t hurt her head! She&#x27;s two, so that&#x27;s very important! I recommend.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I love these because they do not damage my already thin and fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I buy these to wrap around my machine embroidery thread spools and bobbins to secure loose ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for bobbins&lt;br /&gt;Stretches enough to go around a 1100 mm cone of thread&lt;br /&gt;Colorful&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None as of this review</li>
            <li> As some reviewer mentioned they are small. Which makes  them perfect for hairstyles with lots of small ponytails.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good and they can be reused a few times.</li>
            <li> Sooo much better than those pesky rubber bands that promise you they will be gentle on your kids hair but are bound to leave your child with a horse shoe hair pattern. Those liars. These are fabulous. They come in an assortment of colors, they&#x27;re easy to use, they take some time to stretch out and they truly aren&#x27;t painful for my daughter when I take them out. I will say, they don&#x27;t hold my daughters fine, curly hair as well as the rubber bands.

            <li> I keep buying these over and over again! Love them. They are perfect for my two year old and can even be used on the four year old!! Cute colors and very versatile.</li>
