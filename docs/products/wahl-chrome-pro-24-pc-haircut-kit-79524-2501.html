            <li>The weight of the Wahl threw me off at first, but after using them it felt perfect.</li>
            <li>way better than the Con-air thing I was using!</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, the value is outstanding!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Anyway, excellent purchase which paid for itself after the first cut.</li>
            <li>With the help of my wife, I just did my first cut myself and I am very happy with this unit.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Awesome, does exactly as described</li>
            <li>Without the guide I was able to trim up around my ears and side burns, and then I was done!</li>
            <li>I love these clippers!</li>
            <li>Cuts well and included more attachments then I will ever use!  </li>
            <li>They will more than pay for themselves in just two haircuts and there was no waiting for a hair cut in my bathroom!</li>
            <li>It is impressive how much of a higher quality cut this unit provides.</li>
            <li>i didn know it came with clippers and blade oil and everything, you cant find anything better than that for the price!</li>
            <li>and I would recommend to my barber if I had one any more!</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Wahl clippers over 25 years ago and they are still working flawlessly (though I had to add some electrical tape to the cord after years of overflexing).  </li>
            <li>This one is even better!</li>
            <li>I love these clippers!</li>
            <li>Have used it for beard trimming and hair cuts and it couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>I have had these clippers for 4 years now and they still work amazingly.</li>
            <li>would an amazing product if the plastic guards kept their shape.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>I got nothing to say except that it is amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>

            <li>I would recommend this product anybody looking for cheap clippers with great quality.</li>
            <li>everything about this Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit is amazing.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>These are an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>Amazing at home hair-cutting set.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; plastic finish on the handle of these clippers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like the starter kit for guys&#x27; hair grooming needs.</li>
            <li>As for the cape, it is nice to have one so that you won&#x27;t get hair all over you.</li>
            <li>Comes with a comb and a scissor which is handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice kit and it cuts hair nicely, but it just doesn&#x27;t get around the edges well.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>After my roommate banned me from using his Remmington, I had to get my own</li>
            <li>So the shortest guard at 3mm kind of melted away.</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for my daughter, and she was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for two years to do all my own hair cuts.  </li>
            <li>I learned to cut my own hair with this thing.</li>
            <li>It is really handy, even u have no experince, u can do it as well as a barber does.   </li>
            <li>Cuts really well and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t move on its own.</li>
            <li>The price was nice and they are made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>Nice set of clippers.</li>
            <li>nice balance, lots of accessories come with it.  </li>
            <li>My grandson admired the smoothness of the unit and desired one of his own.</li>
            <li>Which is nice, but doesn&#x27;t solve my problem.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my own fault, but this product doesn&#x27;t work in EU.</li>
            <li>Nice and quite.  </li>
            <li>I use it to trim my beard and it cut cleanly nice blade.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s nice to know that I have all these extras just in case...</li>
            <li>Works nicely.</li>
            <li>On to YouTube I went and searched how to cut your own hair using a clipper.</li>
            <li>While I was away in college, I couldn&#x27;t find a nice barbershop in any form around me.</li>
            <li>I am expecting many years of good use.</li>
            <li>so I bought this set of clippers to cut my own hair</li>
            <li>kit is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an Andis Deluxe set I have had for years.  </li>
            <li>I asked him how he liked it</li>
            <li>I just cut my own hair a couple of days ago.</li>
            <li>the clippers them selfs are really nice</li>
            <li>I was searching for hair clippers because I wanted to learn to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was NERVOUS because I&#x27;d never cut my own hair before.</li>
            <li>I bought these because a couple of friends in college liked the Wahl brand.</li>
            <li>have to be honest, however.</li>
            <li>Cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>And keep your hair cut and beard and eye brows done nice.</li>
            <li>The selection of guards that comes with this is nice.</li>
            <li>I use them once a week to cut my own hair</li>
            <li>Yeah, just a nice piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is this trimmer has a power adjustment screw which allows you to increase the power in the situation that your home outlets supply lower voltage than they should.</li>
            <li>Also liked the amount of accessories that came with it.</li>
            <li>If you cut your own hair like I do you are already saying yourself 15-20 dollars on each haircut.</li>
            <li>All of it comes in its own storage case which is durable and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nicely it&#x27;s everything in one product.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, has good weight, not like a cheap plastic crappy thing!</li>
            <li>These clippers have already paid for themselves after using them to cut my own hair a couple times.  </li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone who does hair trimming at home and needs a handy kit to help with the project.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice product does what it says, would buy again.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of cheaper plastic and doesn&#x27;t have a nice weight.</li>
            <li>These clippers allow me to cut my own hair and of any family and friends I might decide to do it for.</li>
            <li>They come with a nice variety of guides, scissors and a case.  </li>
            <li>I did manage to come up with one of my own.</li>
            <li>I do not claim to be a hair stylist, I am just a guy that cuts his own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose my son liked it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m rating that as a good thing as it probably means they are mostly metal and not plastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s built nicely</li>
            <li>and I just works nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s astounding.</li>
            <li>So he suggested to watch some video&#x27;s on youtube on how to cut your own hair.  </li>
            <li>NEVER EVER CUT YOUR OWN HAIR.</li>
            <li>Excellent product&#x60;s, thats very complet and sale price.</li>

            <li>I wound up watching some youtube videos and using them to give myself my own haircut (fade on sides, buzzed on top).</li>
            <li>This thing looks good and it is precise.</li>
            <li>My husband was very happy to get these professional clippers for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I am actually able to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>So far, these have been excellent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying clippers since the 80&#x27;s, and this by far is the best set I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is good for what it is.. a cheap trimmer.</li>
            <li>Maybe more if you go somewhere really nice.</li>
            <li>It works better than my dying pair and it looks nice, BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK</li>
            <li>Did a great job even though she was a nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof, but I still have both my ears and a nice haircut.</li>
            <li>Very fine hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Also, with all of the accessories, i could easily find the guard for my type/length of hair!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>, you gotta get a wahl, works easy and no hassle!</li>
            <li>Still going strong!</li>
            <li>Ok well this definatly is a good easy to use trimmer,  very smooth to cut woth and has all the guards u could think of.</li>
            <li>I love the new clipper and attachments, and I am confident it will be give me excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li>If you are able to cut your hair near a wall outlet (which I don&#x27;t see why you shouldn&#x27;t) than this is your best bet.  </li>
            <li>Although, I do recommend going to a professional every now and then to make sure you&#x27;re looking your best.</li>
            <li>It gave me a good clean cut and wasn&#x27;t, in my opinion, too noisy.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE, I like the attachments and it is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Great haircutting set with many useful attachments.  </li>
            <li>All the parts appear to be of good quality, buzzer works great so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a brilliant deal for the price and the quality you get, so i highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>Great buy for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are easy to use and come with many attachments as pictures!</li>
            <li>It says you cna use these for your pets my puppy is a Morkie and it is a nice clean cut!</li>
            <li>Great product that does exactly what you would want it</li>
            <li>They got the job done perfectly and neatly, I feel like an actual barber being able to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>This worked great for a buzz cut and paid for itself with the first cut at home instead of a salon.</li>
            <li>I will be happy giving myself free clean cuts with this.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, glides through the hair, gives a quick and great cut.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are very comfortable to hold and it feels well built.</li>
            <li>They are quite and clip very smooth.</li>
            <li>It cut hair very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Now he is very comfortable in getting hair cut from me....</li>
            <li>Very cheap looking</li>
            <li>They cut very smoothly.</li>
            <li>They were very smooth, and all the attachments worked nicely and easily.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing how easy it was to accomplish.</li>
            <li>The accessories are nice and the box makes it easy to keep everything together.</li>
            <li>If I knew it would be this easy to cut my own hair, I would&#x27;ve bought this sooner.  </li>
            <li>The blade guides click easily into place and are effective.  </li>
            <li>Cuts hair, doesn&#x27;t get too warm, and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>Using the Wahl clipper is so easy that with my kind of cut, I can do it all myself.</li>
            <li>It is easy to cut my own hair and others</li>
            <li>It was all put in a nice box that makes it easy to store.  </li>
            <li>Getting warm very quick.</li>
            <li>This clipper makes it so easy to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>Nicely balanced and easy to use.</li>
            <li>also it has a nice weight and it is easy to operate.</li>
            <li>My wife cut my hair and did a very nice job for her first hair cut.  </li>
            <li>Remember to oil it though, or better, just read the instructions and you will be fine!</li>
            <li>Nice and powerful clipper, lots of combs, pretty fair instructions, good case.</li>
            <li>The included apron is marginally effective, I have fine hair</li>
            <li>The different-sized blade guards work just fine, and I liked how it it comes with a manual showing how to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular but works fine.</li>
            <li>and it is just as good as the first haircut I did months ago!</li>
            <li>It done a wonderful job on my dog,, very quiet and easy to use and easy to clean, great storage box..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very straight forward and comes with nice directions to get you started (although I suggest you watch lots of YouTube videos!).  </li>
            <li>However, since I cut my own hair, I have a problem with the chrome finish reflecting too much light.</li>
            <li>So I bought these clippers for him, pointed him to a youtube video - and he is more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Pro has many clipper heads, all numbered</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for more than 6 months</li>
            <li>This is a good product: useful and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I cut most of my hair, then girlfriend helped trim around the ears/back of neck.    </li>
            <li>These cut much better.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Buy it and stop paying top dollar for a haircut.</li>
            <li>A great haircutting tool at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It can cut ok, but the noise is unbeareble</li>
            <li>but i wish I would have ordered one with more attachements so that i can have more options for hair lengths .</li>
            <li>that was a lovely clipper.  </li>
            <li>but This WAHL clipper is so much better.</li>
            <li>but they will also probably cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>We have not been pleased until now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>It is great, very convenient to use .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking to buy one more set at 220V for my parents.</li>
            <li>Combined with a YouTube instructional video I found, I am saving us money every month that has more than paid for this kit.</li>
            <li>The Wahl cutter is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Most males do not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any more noisy than the ones they use in the hair salons.</li>
            <li>One more cut and it will have paid for itself.     </li>
            <li>For the price there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve saved A LOT of cash since I quit going to the barber.  :-)</li>
            <li>thing about this Whal is that I find myself wanting to cut my hair more often.</li>
            <li>We used safety scissors in 1st grade that cut my hair better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was satisfied but not blown away.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be a pro!  :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting better every time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you had some skill you could shave a jesus piece in your hair.</li>
            <li>Not the top of the line in the clipper world</li>
            <li>I use this mostly on my beard.  </li>
            <li>It also cuts better than a cordless.    </li>
            <li>I was able to readjust with a screwdriver, but no problems since.</li>
            <li>, it works better but still</li>
            <li>Seller needs better QC.</li>
            <li>Has many attachments some of which you may never used</li>
            <li>I might be able to tighten the adjustment switch</li>
            <li>And had that for about 2 years and the bottom blade wasn&#x27;t touching the top blade anymore when set at the closes setting.</li>
            <li>I used it many times on myself</li>
            <li>but I have no idea if it would be any better.</li>
            <li>These clippers are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I have used Wahl clippers for 12 years to shave my head and have always been pleased with them...until this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once to date, but they behaved beautifully!</li>
            <li>Bottom line is it&#x27;s perfect for beard trims and haircuts, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a daily close-shave razor.</li>
            <li>I like all of the attachments that it came with even though I probably won&#x27;t use most of them.  </li>
            <li>One of the best cost-cutting measures I&#x27;ve taken next to a rice cooker.</li>
            <li>It comes with more attachments then I&#x27;ll ever use and it seems to be built well</li>
            <li>Hair cutters plugged into a wall are SO MUCH BETTER than the wireless ones.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m the one who uses them to cut his hair, we both love them.</li>
            <li>The many attachments are plentiful and gives you options.</li>
            <li>I love this kit</li>
            <li>I love this product and so does my son, the person I bought it for.</li>
            <li>and I am now with short hair and it looks GREAT!</li>
            <li>The Wahl is sturdy and really cuts GREAT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also cut many of my friends&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>:) There are gentler ones for beard trimming and for that I recommend a ConAir model.</li>
            <li>It comes with more attachments than you know what to do with.</li>
            <li>The buzzers are great and they work very well  </li>
            <li>Top of the line performance once you get used to the difference.</li>
            <li>Have given 30+ buzz cuts over the last year and still doing great!</li>
            <li>Be sure to oil as directed.  </li>
            <li>More attachments with it than I think anyone would ever need.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>These clippers cut much more efficiently</li>
            <li>- I think I may get more &#x27;customers&#x27; when family comes to town.</li>
            <li>Nicely constructed ,doesn&#x27;t feel cheap .</li>
            <li>You may also adjust the adjustment lever for more tension.</li>
            <li>This clipper set did an fantastic job!</li>
            <li>If you do, you won&#x27;t be satisfied with this product (unless you&#x27;re just that skilled).</li>
            <li>I would say I&#x27;ve given myself 25 haircuts pronanly more.</li>
            <li>Love it always go with a wahl</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Comes with more attachments than I need, but glad to know I am covered.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well they would work for anything fancier, but for a buzz cut, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>This comes with absolutely everything that you will need to give some great haircuts.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend and we both love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be on the safe side</li>
            <li>Quality is fantastic for the price!</li>
            <li>- so many pirces</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>I am sure I won&#x27;t be buying another pair for 10 more years.</li>
            <li>Great clippers, they are really durable and you can feel the quality in them while using them.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>sure how they&#x27;ll stand up to time, but based on everyone&#x27;s reviewing it&#x27;s looking like it.</li>
            <li>Maybe they cleaned it well :)</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>those who said this thing jams up all the time, you must have hair made of steel because I&#x27;m fairly sure the motor in this thing could start my diesel truck.</li>
            <li>The kit has just about everything you could imagine; however, the trimmer itself is just okay.</li>
            <li>When this started to give out, we decided to invest some more for a better unit.  </li>
            <li>Maybe too many attachments.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding kit.</li>
            <li>Be sure to &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; the cutter each time BEFORE use.</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t able to keep their shape and spread apart.</li>
            <li>You get many attachments</li>
            <li>Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have to spend $100 for some pro ones that cuts way better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much time to use this kit, but I believe it is a great value.  </li>
            <li>and it was ok, then I moved and did not take it with me</li>
            <li>As I said in the title the trimmer itself is ok.</li>
            <li>and I really love it</li>
            <li>quality of this clipper set is top notch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li>after many uses it still cuts like day one.</li>
            <li>than that, the product is worth its price and feels really good to use.</li>
            <li>Im glad I got this</li>
            <li>, I am satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>and it is listed as the top of the list of hair clippers.</li>
            <li>I worked in a beauty shop, and I know how they are supposed to run, and today most don&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li>Like I said, its ok, it will do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving a four star for these Wahl hair clippers, I love Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li>And I love the weight, grip and ease of these trimmers.</li>
            <li>More attachments, so I can keep on giving myself haircuts.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Specifically chose the corded as we didn&#x27;t want one more charger cluttering up the counter.  </li>
            <li>After 2 haircuts it&#x27;s already more than paid for itself.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this clipper kit for a Christmas gift on Oct 26.&lt;br /&gt;It looked great, several attachments, good product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t LOVE haircutters.  </li>
            <li>to, what more can I ask for?  </li>
            <li>Has saved me more money</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I had the somewhat cheaper Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro clippers before and was quite pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats the price at the stores.</li>
            <li>Most clippers will buzz, get over it.</li>
            <li>they probably do a better job, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>If u do buy id suggest getting better made guides.</li>
            <li>For the price I don&#x27;t think you can do any better.  </li>
            <li>The attachments gave no problems and there are many of them.</li>
            <li>I have a short haircut and this does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping really great price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the clippers on the top of my head, I used the scissors provided.  </li>
            <li>To blend in the sides with the top, I just switched the lever on the clippers from up(closest cut) to down(longer cut).  </li>
            <li>I am a barber and i am satisfied with the clipper.</li>
            <li>I recommend the clipper since it cuts smoothly and evenly!</li>
            <li>Wish the had more sizes for shorter trimming.</li>
            <li>sure it comes with lots of attachments</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>love it love</li>
            <li>it love it</li>
            <li>The product worked perfectly well and meets all my domestic purposes.</li>
            <li>this!i didn&#x27;t able to use it..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Many accessories comes with the kit.</li>
            <li>The clippers worked well, felt nice and sturdy, and held the guide securely.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and they love it.</li>
            <li>These more then pay for themselves.  </li>
            <li>Look forward to using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Could be better.</li>
            <li>I wish it cut better then again</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t paid top dollar for these clippers.</li>
            <li>A lot better than the ones i get from walmart or tj maxx.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions in the booklet and went with a 1 at lower part of head, then a 2 to blend it, then a 3 on the top.</li>
            <li>Lovely product use it for everything to trimming my beard to touching up between hair cuts</li>
            <li>100% satisfied and had 0 problems.  </li>
            <li>ok soooo.</li>
            <li>i love this thing</li>
            <li>and im glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>but when the kids trot off to University you need more.  </li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with</li>
            <li>Good job Wahl on another great product at a low price!</li>
            <li>I have used Wahl clippers for many years.</li>
            <li>I love my Wahl Haircut kit.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>The idea of a conplete kit makes it even better..</li>
            <li>So this 24 piece somes with way more than I need</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>More on that in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You use the arch or rocking technique as you move the clipper up the side of the head, pulling the clipper away from the top as you finish your move.</li>
            <li>The Chrome Pro has a taper lever on the side and this adds a greater degree of adjustment as you cut.</li>
            <li>HA :)</li>
            <li>Side lever that adjusts length moves the top part around at an angle.</li>
            <li>Plan on spending more like 3x this price, as this cutter just can&#x27;t do it well.  </li>
            <li>A better blade</li>
            <li>I love these for the price.  </li>
            <li>it had more attachments for shorter hair though</li>
            <li>love the clippers &amp; all the accessories.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But again what you are paying for here is a really good hair clipper which would be well worth the price without all the extras.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li>But once you get the hang of it people won&#x27;t be able to tell if you did it yourself or paid for it.</li>
            <li>And the accessories, soooo many accessories.</li>
            <li>You should spend your money on a better quality clipper.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used yet but really seems like a great deal</li>
            <li>I really love these clippers for doing men hair.</li>
            <li>Its already paid for itself of course and my wife is actually getting real good at using it!</li>
            <li>:) There are gentler ones for beard trimming and for that I recommend a ConAir model.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought them.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better buy.</li>
            <li>more than paid for this clipper.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this product for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>Good machine and worth it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S make sure you buy this from the seller that I bought it from, they will take care of you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll end up purchasing a better set of shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Included accessories appropriate</li>
            <li>Love the product and it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we got it.</li>
            <li>We love this and are already saving money by&lt;br /</li>
            <li>If the weight of the clippers were more evenly disbursed, they would be easier to handle for at-home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One more time Thank you and see you</li>
            <li>I love this clippers</li>
            <li>but I love my girlfriend the most.lol..</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I did the math and after owning these clippers for two years now, I have been able to save $960 not including what I tip out to the barbers.</li>
            <li>I use it all and my kids love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed that a set of clippers that is frankly quite inexpensive was actually serviceable.  </li>
            <li>After getting this I was able stop going to the barbershop, and save  that 10 bucks or so month..  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Made in USA...even better.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, it&#x27;s really about an 18 piece set...</li>
            <li>Check here for more videos and photos that I have posted http://goo.gl/xuUikP .  </li>
            <li>She is pleased with them</li>
            <li>and so I am pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>Way more attachments than I will ever need.</li>
            <li>They both have very different hair types, it this cut their hair great!  </li>
            <li>Comes with more attachments than I will ever use.  </li>
            <li>I have been buzzing my husband&#x27;s hair for many years.  </li>
            <li>My husband attempted to adjust it (each time getting one more swipe in before it died), and then to disassemble and repair it, without luck.  </li>
            <li>because it was mostly instructing on how to cut hair.  </li>
            <li>The chrome addition came so many extras.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I&#x27;ll get more skills with time.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Make sure to oil the blades before each use to lengthen the blade&#x27;s life for sure.</li>
            <li>This should cost more than it does at the moment!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>im done just to make sure...</li>
            <li>(Heart of Illinois on the Rock River) Works Fantastic!</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s getting better and understanding how to approach it better.  </li>
            <li>It need more comb number</li>
            <li>but I love the guards and case</li>
            <li>Well made and much better</li>
            <li>love buying stuff on amazon since i m prime member</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It builds up so much static electricity that it literally attracts the hair to you ON BOTH SIDES and covers you with the clippings.</li>
            <li>I bought a pair that were cordless, much better.</li>
            <li>It is great thank you sooo much</li>
            <li>love it, love it.</li>
            <li>but, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving money and getting a better cut than I was often getting at the budget hair salons.</li>
            <li>It came with a storage case and many accessories.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li>I cut my hair using the &amp;#34;6 on the side, and #7 on top.</li>
            <li>It came out better than I thought.</li>
            <li>Havent paid for a haircut since i got this, one of my better amazon investments.</li>
            <li>but i wish the box was more organized to hold them</li>
            <li>Excellent quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>I love the case.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and he has been more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but i just love how this one is so much cheaper and great quality...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love his hair at 1/8 and this does the job.</li>
            <li>Brought this almost 5 months back, works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This haircut kit has paid for itself more than 20 times.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li>and they work outstanding.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than my pair of conair trimmers.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to take a chance and try it.  </li>
            <li>great razor and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>More pieces than what I need.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the purchase and package</li>
            <li>yet the reviewer said these were better.</li>
            <li>The trimmer missed many areas.  </li>
            <li>Wahl makes it better.  </li>
            <li>and I am fairly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thank you outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I love this machine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Better than my cordless Conair.  </li>
            <li>It cuts faster and more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Works very well, from a great and reliable brand.  </li>
            <li>Better off to leave out of kit than create the feel of junk.  </li>
            <li>These are one of the best purchases I have made recently.</li>
            <li>but for the price, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I had been eyeing this model so when Amazon had one of their awesome daily deals on Wahl</li>
            <li>said he enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>good quality, under $30, and for the clippers to not hurt if I&#x27;m trying to cut my own hair fast.</li>
            <li>The absolute best price was right here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good product, works well, all the right attachments.</li>
            <li>Looking for a replacement, I found this gem and chose it because it got good reviews and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Very nice product and very well made.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, runs clean and produces great results.</li>
            <li>very powerful!</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>I used a #1 comb and raised it, and it came out pretty good; a nice and smooth looking cut.</li>
            <li>It came with a full set of attachments and the kit was reasonably priced; so it qualifies as a very good deal.</li>
            <li>Clean nice cut,</li>
            <li>Pros: complete set, strong built, good price, good for home use, reliable    </li>

            <li>These work perfect for pretty much any use.</li>
            <li>I received in decent time and to no surprise it works great.</li>

            <li>It works great and seems to be high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The great product and high recommendation</li>
            <li>Ship very fast, packing good.</li>
            <li>The hair is short and fine and so not so challenging for it, but it is working flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>It was an amazing price, it shipped quickly and has helped me keep the boys in my house looking as handsome as ever without a lot of time and money.  </li>
            <li>Still running strong, feels great in hand, very sturdy build</li>
            <li>Quick delivery clipper works great well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good set.</li>
            <li>This kit is perfect to maintain my &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; haircut and save money in the long run.  </li>
            <li>We knew the first time we used them that they were good.</li>
            <li>a good clipper avid this one.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>It works pretty good,  but what do I know I&#x27;m just using it as a tattoo gun.</li>
            <li>Nice set; full accessories can do just about anything.</li>
            <li>cut my hair pretty good</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I did pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am not a hair stylest, but with this product I can give my husband a pretty good looking hair cut.</li>
            <li>Come with a nice case full of blade covers and accessories like scissors and hair clips and even a cape</li>
            <li>Works exactly as intended, good price, and has lasted a number of years now with no sign of wearing out.</li>
            <li>(ra-ma-da-ma-dama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved using these clippers so much that I couldn&#x27;t stop!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten to a point where people ask me where I get my haircuts because I do a pretty good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This haircut kit was one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>Loved it from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I gave myself my own hair cut using the various clips and did a very nice fade that friends were very complimentary about, never cut my own hair before</li>
            <li>I use these once a week at least and they work great very good design can cut all lengths of hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>Great improvement with the new attachments which are stronger and not flimsy.</li>
            <li>Great clippers even came with the new .5 guard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it does what it says and it comes at a great price, though I can&#x27;t say I wouldn&#x27;t prefer a new Conair if I had to make the purchase over again.</li>
            <li>my son hates having his hair cut and thought if I could do it quickly with clippers it would be nice for both of us.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is more compact, runs quieter and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>i really love the case, fits everything and easy to store once not in use</li>
            <li>On my end, it was a reasonable price for a good product :)</li>
            <li>This model is probably as good as or better than the clippers you get at a barber, and it really zips through my rapidly fading hair.</li>
            <li>So far I have cut my better halfs hair my grandson&#x27;s my brother in law&#x27;s couple times each and still running great</li>
            <li>Out of the box the clippers look nice and feel light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The system makes it very easy to use and detailed instructions make the process easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>but that is because I am very special about my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great set of clippers thus far!</li>
            <li>These clippers have worked great for me so far!</li>
            <li>(If you want it perfectly even, use the buzzer with a guide) I&#x27;ve found that the slightly uneven look is much more attractive than just using a buzz guide and doing the whole thing that way.</li>
            <li>what a clean job!</li>
            <li>This thing is very user friendly and great for beginners.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most powerful one and it comes with a very Nice case and comes with everything I need to do my own hair at home.</li>
            <li>Super easy to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>The motor is nice and smooth, the clippers cut cleanly, and all the attachments you could ask for are included.</li>
            <li>Very good american product.</li>
            <li>I have only used it one time as of now and I can say its very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this once, or to be more accurate, my wife has used it one me once.</li>
            <li>Great value, and no problem after nearly 2 years....</li>
            <li>It has worked great so far.</li>
            <li>So far it works great.</li>
            <li>Plus tax free:)</li>
            <li>I got this to use as a beard trimmer and it works great so far.</li>
            <li>Great replacement for old Conair model</li>
            <li>It came with a cheap plastic smock that I just use to cover my sink and counter top to catch the hair.</li>
            <li>So smooth and with many attachments.</li>
            <li>Paying $25 a cut twice a month was becoming OBNOXIOUS.</li>
            <li>I had the Ultra adjustable by Andis , which was great, so now I will dispose of this one and try to find a blade for the old one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the power converter, I&#x27;ve used two different ones, from 220 to 110, but the clipper was making an incredible noise and it was shaking way too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The side clips are great and give a professional look.</li>
            <li>Whats nice about is, its got alot of clips and comes with a comb, and the small scissors that comes with kit works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now, and with minimal maintenance, it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>We are on our 5th free hair cut, and many to come.  </li>
            <li>Sheers work great (and not at all too loud).  </li>
            <li>For the $30 I am so far happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes it great for retired and hairy old man keep unsightly hair under control.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great machine, not too loud.</li>
            <li>but it works great so far.</li>
            <li>better than the light plastic models.</li>
            <li>I will enjoy using them for many years, as they seem to be quality made.  </li>
            <li>I have used it 4 times, and is working great so far.</li>
            <li>our cheap one from walmart works a lot better and is cordless.</li>
            <li>Old lady was happy.</li>
            <li>The cape isn&#x27;t terrific but that can be dealt with; the scissors work nicely and the finished haircut is quite nice!</li>
            <li>, i settled on this set and have been quite happy with the performance so far.</li>
            <li>Great product, looks like it will hold up to frequent use.  </li>
            <li>So far it is a great  trimmer and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>As I said, the accessories and the shaver looks cheap but works OK, has a lot of accessories.</li>
            <li>But then, what isn&#x27;t more cheaply built nowadays?</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Delivered was fast and good product.</li>
            <li>The motor itself is quite powerful and nice</li>
            <li>but I am just doing to get rid of this all together and invest in a good quality set with a real guide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is just very noisy, but otherwise works really good.</li>
            <li>When I received this, I loved it so much that I purchased a spare.</li>
            <li>It looks good but doesn&#x27;t feel really durable..</li>
            <li>Very powerful, not noisy, and love all the attachments/accessories it comes with.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend didn&#x27;t have anything for his hair, and this set has really helped him get everything all at once at a super great price.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic hair shaving toolkit, it has every thing I needed and saved me a lot of money, it is easy to use and I was able to shave my hair by my self with it, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>A cordless clipper gives one more flexibility and mobility, but a corded unit like the Wahl 79524-2501 has an adequately lengthed cord, more power than a cordless, and no waiting time for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair was still long on one side, so I wanted to even it out, but now I just cut my own hair every month!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this kit comes with an awesome selection of different attachments, and the clipper itself cuts smoothly and cleanly without snagging on any hair.</li>
            <li>, this is an excellent clipper that cuts clean and smooth, and the kit comes with such a variety of length attachments</li>
            <li>The scissors aren&#x27;t great, but they are decent enough for a kit like this.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, what you get is great for the price.</li>
            <li>It is very accurate and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great price that will save you a ton of money when considering how much even cheap places like great clips charges.  </li>
            <li>Great product- use it for my regular free haircut (by my wife); does a good job and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Has weight to it and is a very nice clipper, replacing a 15 year old one by Remmington.</li>
            <li>Very effective and not too loud.</li>
            <li>Other than that.. AWESOME</li>
            <li>Due to my wonderful girlfriend botching my haircut</li>
            <li>The blade is still sharp and still gives a flawless cut.  </li>
            <li>After a little online research I found that most people said Wahl makes the best clippers.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of a hair trimmer (such a good price too)!</li>
            <li>Easy to use lots of options for clipper lengths.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use and a TON of attachments..  </li>
            <li>I love that it is easy to store and clean.</li>
            <li>They cut easily without any pulling.  </li>
            <li>This did everything I needed it to and it easily paid for itself in 2 home haircuts.</li>
            <li>Switching guides on the clipper is a breeze as they snap on and off easily - but not too easily.    </li>
            <li>Overall, Wahl&#x27;s product isn&#x27;t jaw-droppingly amazing, but it&#x27;s good deal for 27 dollars.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to take apart for oiling/cleaning.</li>
            <li>The plastic guides are easy to snap on and off and the instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and it cuts well.</li>
            <li>It came with easy directions and also I visited the website for instructional video clips.</li>
            <li>We give ourselves Burr haircuts so it is easy to use on yourself.</li>
            <li>All the accessories are well made and easy to install and use.</li>
            <li>Never a snag or pull of the hair, &amp; easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>This works OK but probably wouldn&#x27;t be useful to anyone doing much more than wanting to go bald every week.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comes with a manual that makes it idiot-proof.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Wahl makes it easy to do it myself.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Could easily shave someone&#x27;s head while they sleep...</li>

            <li>/&gt;Update May 10, 2014:  I&#x27;ve been using these clippers once weekly since I purchased the kit, and they&#x27;re still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I strongly doubt that.  </li>
            <li>The only thing you need besides good scissors is a nice brush for the neck.</li>
            <li>Not too noisy, but strong vibration during operation;</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND BUYING THE CHROME-PRO VERSION THAT COMES WITH A TRIMMER IF YOU ARE DOING HOME BARBERING.</li>
            <li>The vibration was too strong my head shakes while I run it across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had this over a year still going strong.</li>
            <li>A good realistic price purchase.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I would like,</li>
            <li>going strong just change blade</li>
            <li>it is strong.</li>
            <li>Point is it shows how strong Wahl cutters are.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>The price is also decent, so in all this is a good product, I like it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, every week I used this machine and I feel good, hapy and the short hair and never long</li>
            <li>The attachments, which for me are very important, were cheap, cheap ,cheap.</li>
            <li>The included scissors, comb and cape are not as high a quality as the clippers, but I already had good scissors.</li>
            <li>Spend more money and get a better one that does what it&#x27;s made to do, this one went right in the trash can where it belongs.</li>
            <li>From one handsome man to another - this thing will help keep you that way while keeping your shekels right where they belong: riding safely on your hip.</li>
            <li>I just use it at it&#x27;s lowest setting to shave my head works great easy to clean I like it and an epic price tag for everything you get.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cheap walmart clippers for years.</li>

            <li>It was fantastic just what I needed to get the job done</li>
            <li>two gripes about the product are the clipper attachment feel cheap like i&#x27;m going to break them when i snap them on to the sheers.</li>
            <li>And the price will also fit any budgit. ....</li>

            <li>downside of this item is that the case is really cheap and doesn&#x27;t have dedicated slots for any of the attachments - so you just shove everything into the box when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>The motor sound did not &amp;#34;bog down&amp;#34; even in the thickest parts of his scalp.</li>
            <li>The important part is that these clippers work.  </li>

            <li>After reading the reviews about this product, I was worried when I read that the pieces were really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I did put a drop of light oil on the blade which helped lube it.  </li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s great and has a lot of adapters if you needed to use different settings!  </li>

            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheaply made.  </li>

            <li>Overall i had a great experience.</li>
            <li>The set comes with a ton of accessory pieces that are nice to have but we probably won&#x27;t get much use out of since my guys prefer the &#x27;shaved to the scalp&#x27; look.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work and clean.  </li>
            <li>lol it&#x27;s a white garbage</li>

            <li>This replaced it, same great quality for a cheaper prices clipper.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had two Wahl clipper prior to this one, both worked great.</li>
            <li>However, no blades could be found and I didn&#x27;t want to buy something if I didn&#x27;t know it would fit.</li>
            <li>These had replacement blades available</li>
            <li>The light that reflects off the clippers (which can be seen in my mirror&#x27;s reflection) can kind of make lines appear on my hair that aren&#x27;t really there.</li>
            <li>This haircutting kit is quite good and professionally designed for this price range.    </li>
            <li>Super easy to use, easy to understand directions and numbering</li>
            <li>My old Wahl Chrome Pro lasted me a good 5 years.</li>
            <li>Had my first cut and it turned out pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>Good clippers, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>

            <li>These seem to have tons of power and just cut right through both the top of my head and my beard.</li>
            <li>After doing lots of research, reading many of the reviews here at Amazon, and looking for the right price point and combination of features, etc.</li>
            <li>I highly advise getting a pair of shearing scissors to give your hair cut a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; finish!</li>
            <li>After I finished using it, I use FastBlast, that air in the can that&#x27;s used to clean keyboard to remove the fine hair pieces from the blade and guards.</li>

            <li>Perfect for cutting your own hair!</li>
            <li>I use it to cut my hair myself and it does that quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>On arrival, the product was nicely packed but the main Clipper Body had some scratch marks.</li>

            <li>They offered to refund me 20% of the original purchase price.</li>
            <li>After shopping around on Amazon, I decided to give these a try because I am familiar with the brand name and it was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a nice carrying case, that I was also able to fit the extra bottle of blade lube that I purchased from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured this was a fluke since I&#x27;m normally very pleased with items shipped directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional hair cutter - just needed some quality clippers and I got them for a great price.  </li>
            <li>user friendly.</li>
            <li>powerful!</li>

            <li>They are okay, they cut pretty</li>
            <li>I love that it has many different sizes of clips, but on top of that its original metal clip can be adjusted as well.</li>

            <li>figured out that my outlet blew the GFI breaker and the original clippers still work</li>

            <li>This is my second time buying this trimmer, works as good as before.</li>
            <li>My last pair of wahl clippers lasted 12 years and were not as good as these.</li>
            <li>Such a good investment.</li>
            <li>I will say they look very sleek and stylish and came with all the accessories needed for a well-groomed man.  </li>
            <li>I will have to see if their claim to these clippers are self sharpening is true.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far with them, and the unit itself is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>He loved the cut and decided he wanted his hair to be that short.  </li>

            <li>It cuts hair really godd and had no troble with it:)</li>
            <li>this is true -- because the outer case was all plastic (lightweight plastic at that).  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for my boyfriend good overall, however one of the components was melted.</li>

            <li>forget the noise, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good one made by a military guy who shows men how to cut their own hair with the clippers (something most of us military guys have had to do more than once).</li>

            <li>Enter this kit - it&#x27;s pretty easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li>its lovely with a low noise and clean cut ability,its for sure a product i will always recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Good home set - more guards than I needed for my &#x27;crew&#x27; but they snap tight and work well.  </li>
            <li>I wish they did, as it takes too many passes to complete my own haircut, ESPECIALLY when using the 3/4 guard on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Luckily the kit is pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Its very quite and cuts very clean.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day to shave my head and it works great.</li>
            <li>It works great and has a wide array of attachments!</li>
            <li>For just a little more than one hair cut would cost you, you can buy this and save a good amount of money.</li>
            <li>Between the excellent directions and a little practice, it really yields a super looking haircut.</li>
            <li>It is great for a buzz with the light green  (</li>
            <li>Powerful and cuts clean in one pass without pulling.</li>
            <li>It was packaged well, and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>just make sure you have a steady hand</li>
            <li>Returned them and I then got the Wahl Chrome model and made a quick pass, expecting some resistance.  </li>
            <li>actually purchased a second set to groom my dog since they work so great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s larger and heavier than most cordless beard trimmers; but it&#x27;s designed for more rigorous use.    </li>
            <li>overall, for its function, this clipper works perfectly besides problem i had above.</li>
            <li>Hair grows quickly so that helps while you are learning your technique.</li>
            <li>However, when I actually received the product, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Perfect cutting and nice accessories.</li>
            <li>Pays for itself quickly.</li>
            <li>I did not buy it for the apron though, so that is the only reason my rating is one star short of perfect.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, hair grows again.</li>
            <li>I have not used most of the stuff that comes in the haircut kit as I just use the main cutter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did go through it quickly</li>
            <li>but I had to do it quickly</li>
            <li>Quick buzz and hop in the shower</li>
            <li>The kit also has a lot of good accessories - more than you need most likely - which is better than having too few.</li>
            <li>it gives quick and efficient buzz cuts with no snagging.</li>
            <li>This seemed like the best trimmer I could find at any local store so it is what I purchased, however I am finally fed up with it.</li>
            <li>This Chrome Pro kit is excellent (the parts are sturdy and the shaving abilities have upped a notch with the extra shaving parts and solid chrome body.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that the eyebrow trimming tool would cut too short, but it really does a great job.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick service.</li>
            <li>Even better than expected (which is nice).  </li>
            <li>Cuts through quickly ...strong design... use it for my head and face</li>
            <li>that while making what really counts here in the USA is why you can buy it at such a great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>these are a great buy and will not only pay for themselves but also help you start saving money real</li>
            <li>Love the versatility with all the different size guards and love the fact that they include a sheet to cover yourself in so that hair doesn&#x27;t get on you.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t scare my dog, and everything works well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Kit comes with many different attachments and gives many options.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the older version</li>
            <li>This product worked seamlessly with my first haircut, at this point I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love how it came with so many accessories and different sized clips.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair, so being light and maneuverable is a big plus.</li>
            <li>quick math 10</li>
            <li>Also, even though the clippers look nice and feel comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t carry over into the actual job they are meant to do.</li>
            <li>the clippers started getting warm and weren&#x27;t really doing much</li>
            <li>Excelente maquina con todos sus accesorios y llego super rapido</li>
            <li>Lots of good attachments and the instructions are very well written and concise, with pictures and diagrams.</li>
            <li>I am sure but just to be sure I returned it and bought one at local store that I could verify</li>
            <li>I can now cut my husband&#x27;s hair quickly and easier than ever before.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very nice to work with and the motor part is heavy which is nice as it doesnt feel like the normal plastic as others do.</li>
            <li>We use the set at home but it gives a very professional haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like my hair is going to be long any time soon, more due to genetics than these clippers, but this set is perfect for keeping groomed.</li>
            <li>I got mine very fast, but I&#x27;m dissapointed because it vibrates a lot and make a lot of sound.</li>
            <li>Better materials and high quality.</li>
            <li>No complaints to date, very good quality, and the price was unbelievable....</li>
            <li>She liked these even better than her nice salon set that had broken.  </li>
            <li>Actually the barber did me a great favor, because I realized that the tool she was using to cut my hair was most likely a Wahl, or Wahl like tool.  </li>
            <li>After I get my money&#x27;s worth many times over for thesei will likely invest in Wahl brand top end clippers for lifetime use.</li>
            <li>though, for the price, this was exactly I needed and Wahl didn&#x27;t cheap out on their design of the shaver itself</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and works really well!</li>
            <li>I own other machines that have lasted me for years and have a slightly better clip design.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li>We were excited to get these clippers but they were nothing what we expected based on the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried them, they had a couple of minor issues but after two or three uses they they smoothed out and work near perfect.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, I expect this product to last quite a while (and I cut my hair about twice a week using no attachments at</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean and all of the accessories are very helpful and useful.</li>
            <li>I think the 24 piece is great for simple male haircuts, I don&#x27;t see why you would need anything more.</li>
            <li>This item paid for itself the very first day I had it.</li>
            <li>The accessories are all as advertised and easy to use and the haircuts, whilst not at the level of the barbershop due to user error, they are getting there and it is really great to have so much control over what the cut will look like.....and the clippers paid for themselves on the first cut!</li>
            <li>You really need to clean it well after each use and oil it after to keep it running smooth.  </li>
            <li>The cord has a nice range and so far the haircut has been consistent and quick.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it for anyone that wants to cut their own hair and save money.</li>
            <li>You pretty much just throw them all in the case in a jumbled mess and hope for the best!</li>
            <li>I needed a new haircut kit and this product more than meets my needs.</li>
            <li>Glad to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>The black sizing combs that you attach to the razor look like they came out of a McDonald&#x27;s happy meal.  </li>
            <li>dig the scissors, probably will never use the cheap feeling apron, don&#x27;t have much of a need for more than 3 of the guides, and feel that the combs are decent quality.  </li>
            <li>great but a co worker found this set for even less at bed bath beyond</li>
            <li>two cuts, I&#x27;ve pretty much got my favorite cut figured out, and the kit has already paid for itself.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, makes easy cuts without pulling or getting caught.  </li>
            <li>It cuts great though, and it didn&#x27;t take long to get his whole head</li>
            <li>Included is an instruction manual that I really should have paid more attention to, but I was pretty eager to see results immediately, so</li>
            <li>but it was still too strong and vibrating too much.</li>
            <li>It was easy painless and fast.</li>
            <li>It comes with pretty much everything you need to be able to groom yourself, your pets, etc.</li>
            <li>it has a small mirror, it would really deserve the best.</li>
            <li>Very well built and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Clippering around my daughter&#x27;s ears was challenging, the taper guides, I think assume that you want it pretty much buzzed around the ears.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, cut hair fast.  </li>
            <li>It works easily and fast.</li>
            <li>Operation is pleasant, with nicely-fitting blade guards and minimal shaking.</li>
            <li>It is heavier than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I was able to move along more quickly because it cut more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Quite good through it seems not really new</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to save money going to the barber, or just wants to look good when your hair starts getting a bit shaggy, in between visits.</li>
            <li>Some cheaper ones don&#x27;t cut right through the hair right away and take many, many attempts to finally get your desired style.</li>
            <li>it on the exact day they said he would!</li>
            <li>It was like a hot knife through butter, and poof!</li>
            <li>You get so many things for such a small price tag, I feel very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Really like these clippers!!</li>
            <li>Such a better quality, compared to the ones I bought at Target years ago!</li>
            <li>I broke the first one after dropping it on a ceramic floor, so no  fault of the product!</li>
            <li>Thanks Wahl !!</li>
            <li>For about $5 more, this trimmer IS PROFESSIONAL QUALITY!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Originally we had bought a higher end Con-Air brand.</li>
            <li>The cat is happy with his new short hair and enjoys the attention when I clip him!</li>
            <li>The body of the clipped was designed to be held easily and fit the curve of my hand, there are more than enough attachments to chose from and the instructions were clear and easy to understand.     </li>
            <li>The comb sizes on this machine are made of the type of plastic that is kind of flexible, much more durable than the ones from my previous rechargeable ones.</li>
            <li>This kit comes with very detailed instructions about how to cut hair and all the pieces of the kit are clearly marked with what it is for.</li>
            <li>But the machine itself looks very professional and very powerful!</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t stop to clean it out, the cut would not be consistent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people say that the guides were really brittle and any pressure will break it because they seem fine to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with that as my hair grows rather fast.  </li>
            <li>Work just fine, and look really sleek.</li>
            <li>Compared to another trimmer I owned earlier, this one barely creates any sound and is very effective in help trimming.</li>
            <li>I guess short short hair is becoming very popular.  </li>
            <li>Great price, cuts well, but the unit itself feels a little ...</li>
            <li>The build, however feels solid and is rather ergonomic (in a good way, its a smart design)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super solidly built, has a sleek look due to the chrome finish, and it&#x27;s way more powerful and awesome than any clippers I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li>Plus it costs about as much as one hair cut at a cheap salon and was about $14 cheaper than the comparable model at Target</li>
            <li>Everything works very well and the parts do not look cheap to me.</li>
            <li>The guide combs are cheap and don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  </li>
            <li>Even considered offering free haircuts for the whole of the JRROTC at one point for charity....</li>
            <li>It seems to be made of a light weight plastic and the guides are very flimsy compared to the connaire&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>primary use for this devise is shaving hair from chest of patient who is about to have an electrocardiogram, This machine functions  very well as a shaver.</li>
            <li>The sheet to help keep hair off of you is really think and cheap, almost like a crappy trash bag.</li>
            <li>Cheap and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping via Prime &amp; packaged securely.</li>
            <li>thing comes packaged nicely, even with a cape, but was most useful was a pamphlet for her to read through that described techniques and a few example haircuts.  </li>
            <li>These clippers feel heavy and work great.  </li>
            <li>It poses a distraction when trying to achieve an even fade with a more natural blend.</li>
            <li>If you cut your own hair, I would advise against the chrome body and go for a solid colored plastic model.</li>
            <li>Love the product so far.</li>
            <li>One of the most solid products available.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you know what your doing (its a haircut, not rocket science), then these clippers will pay for themselves after a couple uses and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>unit definitely worth the money (the boys give it a thumbs up).</li>
            <li>This Wahl clipper is a breath of fresh air.  </li>
            <li>they start getting hot, I oil the blade,  then switch over to scissors for a while so it can cool</li>
            <li>WOW, what a great clipper for $25.00 I had a Conair clipper set that I used for years which I paid about the same price, it worked well for years</li>
            <li>The chrome hair clipper is powerful and that&#x27;s why I prefer the power supply clipper compared to the cordless one.</li>
            <li>I knew that in about 2 or 3 weeks if cut evenly will grow back uniformly which it is doing nicely.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, but this on is much louder that the last one.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, efficient, powerful and well constructed.  </li>
            <li>Annoyingly loud; the kit should include a free set of earplugs for the user and anyone else in the house  -VIBRATION!</li>
            <li>Not only did they provide a really nice \\&quot;How</li>
            <li>It does have some metal fregments which means this blade has been freshly made.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just oil it after every dozen or so uses and be sure to clear out the teeth with a brush after each use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit louder than most Barber-shop, professional clippers.    </li>
            <li>If your wanting a nice cut for a low price these are the clippers to have.</li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for the last 9 years.</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>article back, don&#x27;t work good, so much vibration</li>
            <li>Its nice enough for a home haircut.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised on how many attachments that are with this machine , and</li>
            <li>I think it is very much worth the price..</li>
            <li>Well worth it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to cut someone else&#x27;s hair than your own because there&#x27;s a lot of mirror action involved.</li>
            <li>Works great so far, have only had for a couple of months but does the trick.</li>
            <li>It was powerful and seemed to work well.  </li>
            <li>They worked great, never had any problems with them until last week when they just completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it, it has paid for itself in barber savings.</li>
            <li>If anyone has doubts on purchasing this set, please take the time to read my review - It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>Worth it for just the clippers alone.</li>
            <li>the one next to it off, but they continue to work without incident, the nice part is the part that broke is replaceable so these will be around for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper body seems nice and solid.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; has been a &amp;#34;STANDARD&amp;#34; in the hair-cutting and electric razor business for longer than most of you reading this have been alive.</li>
            <li>for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that most of the reviewers have not had this problem with these.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about professional clippers, but I can&#x27;t imagine how they would be much better than this.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this Wahl Haircut kit, I expected a good home hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>this is well worth it  </li>
            <li>The case is smaller than the cloth case I had with the Color Pro clippers which is handy since I put the clippers under the already crowded sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>if you want a budget professional trimmer, it has many accessories in its kit.</li>
            <li>, lots of extras, the clipper runs quiet which is nice too.</li>
            <li>I decided recently to try and cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>The case it came in is useful.  </li>
            <li>After that it was extremely loud, although it still worked for six more months.</li>
            <li>I found out one of my brother in laws cuts his own hair, same boat as me</li>
            <li>Love the fact that Wahl replaced the cheap plastic attachments which accompanied my earlier kit.</li>
            <li>I also like the accessories  clipper blade guides, blade cleaning brush, scissors, body-drape to capture shaved hair with clip fasteners, and clipper-blade oil lubricant  that comes with the kit to make it complete to get that freshly groom appearance that most women like on a man.</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare deals where I felt like I was ripping off the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The different types of clips are handy.</li>
            <li>It does the job and is an extremely powerful buzzer.</li>
            <li>I had $9.36 worth of points saved up already</li>
            <li>I had $9.36 worth of points saved up already</li>
            <li>They are more professional than just home clippers.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Kit comes complete with many items in a convenient carry case for storage and travelling.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>The combs are nice as there are a lot of different lengths to pick from.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely had a barber or hair stylist cut my hair</li>
            <li>If you know someone who needs/wants their hair cut frequently, this kit will save you many trips to the barber.</li>
            <li>Useful for haircuts and beards.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I waited until my mid 40s to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just the razor in its own packaging, which was not enough to protect it well, banging around when I picked up the box.</li>
            <li>The device itself is solid and weighted nicely.</li>
            <li>Pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>-The price -Some useful attachments</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet, cuts like a pro.</li>
            <li>well worth every cent.</li>
            <li>These clippers feel very solid and obliterate hair, meaning they perform their designated function, which I can honestly say the Norelco stuggled with sometimes.</li>
            <li>These are much better than my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>It is not battery powered so having to leave it plugged in while using acan be a bit of a restriction, however it is powerful.</li>
            <li>For this price, it is so worth getting.</li>
            <li>Replaced his 10+yr old Wahl trimmer and he was in love with everything you get in the package.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my own hair several times, so it&#x27;s paid for itself already.</li>
            <li>My old Oster works much better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Wahl so this was rare</li>
            <li>It has everything anyone could possibly need to cut hair on their own EXCEPT an instructional video.  </li>
            <li>machine is so effective, where it comes, no hair left there.</li>
            <li>Wielded by confident hands, this capable piece of machinery is equally adept should you decide to point it north or due south.</li>
            <li>Worked well when it was working but broke down way too quickly, I take good care of things I owe</li>
            <li>Blades have stayed sharp over many many cuts now.</li>
            <li>First one broke quick</li>
            <li>When I ordered this it came to me SUPER FAST!</li>
            <li>Received it quickly and it was exactly what it promised to be.</li>
            <li>Ok, I was a little nervous at first, since I&#x27;ve never cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>of the unique and, perhaps, more helpful accessories are the Left and Right side taper combs (I don&#x27;t think my wife&#x27;s ever even looked at those yet--</li>
            <li>Very nice, heavy duty, lots of attachments.  </li>
            <li>They are so easy to use, and so far, don&#x27;t get too hot to hold onto, like so many of the older ones did.  </li>
            <li>A decent pair of hair stylist scissors would cost many times the cost of this whole set!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The instructions are very helpful and it come with many length attachments as well as scissors which are decent.</li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t cut as good as my older pair, which are the same model.</li>
            <li>Comes with decent packaging and a good assortment of accessories and has solid construction.</li>
            <li>The new one is fine for the most part, but it runs noticeably louder than my old one, even after adjusting the power screw.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this kit comes with far more accessories than I will ever need, as I mostly use the 1/16\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot; guides or the bare blade.  </li>
            <li>Other than that a really good set of clippers.</li>
            <li>Other Wahl broke and this seems to be a good replacement.</li>
            <li>Just right for the novice.  </li>
            <li>I noticed right away that when I turned this on, it vibrated in a way that didn&#x27;t seem right to me.  </li>
            <li>They cut right through hair.</li>
            <li>This was right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Plugs right into the wall.</li>
            <li>right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The cord is just the right length.  </li>
            <li>and they sent it right out.</li>
            <li>The quality is there and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li>Clippers glide right through the hair.  </li>
            <li>Comes with everything you need to get started and is priced right.</li>
            <li>It comes with a variety of trimming clips to adjust the right length you are seeking.</li>
            <li>These clippers powered right through course, curly hair without a problem.</li>
            <li>it buzz&#x27;s right through that stuff.</li>
            <li>Seems to work all right.  </li>
            <li>This is about all there is to say right now...</li>
            <li>No charging to hassle with and the price is right.</li>
            <li>And I was right.  </li>
            <li>Plus the 25 bucks for the haircut every week goes right to the savings account.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Just a quick review: - good cutting hair clippers that can give you a haircut just as good as at the barbershop if done by the right</li>
            <li>For the first few weeks, these clippers were great.</li>
            <li>Have patience, understand your first might not be a success, but just laugh and keep it up.  </li>
            <li>The set includes a ton of pieces even though I only use the guard and the case is pretty nice.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Oster, Wahl, Vidal Sassoon hair clippers in the past (one of each since 1999) and by far Wahl is the best in terms of product life and functionality.</li>
            <li>I do how ever cut my own hair and keep it pretty short</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than my old one conair,that one was too hot when it worked for a while,but wahl isn&#x27;t,good quality.</li>
            <li>I think this helps him feel more secure as well, as it isn&#x27;t a completely strange</li>
            <li>very noisy and dose not give a clean cut  rigid .</li>
            <li>This trimmer never snags, cuts cleanly, and is fast.</li>
            <li>Simple to use quick, easy and clean.</li>
            <li>The first thing you learn is that Wahl&#x27;s professional line of clippers in the top used brand of clippers by pros in the world.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they clean the clippers very well and don&#x27;t want him exposed to ring worm,</li>
            <li>For a young male looking to cut his his own hair, these do just that!</li>
            <li>My dad has the exact same one which made me want to get my own.</li>
            <li>My wife used to be a professional hair dresser and has cut my hair since we were married (many years ago).  </li>
            <li>It comes with instructions and makes it easy to cut your own little boys hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is very easy to use and now this mom is a pro.</li>
            <li>It is very easy and I was finished with both sides and the back in a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this set does exactly what I.  Clean cut, reliable and more than enough settings.  </li>
            <li>I should probably knock off half a star because this awesome device showed me my future...</li>
            <li>really does the job easy and fast.</li>
            <li>Strong, doesnt vibrate out of your hand, easy to clean, blades stay sharp.</li>
            <li>In the past, I have bought Conair clippers and they have all been great.</li>
            <li>This kit provides more combs than I actually use, but it&#x27;s nice to have them just the same.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it performs since it&#x27;s for the fella, but I can tell you that it reached me promptly and the packaging looks great.</li>
            <li>They sound and feel like normal barber clippers to me.  </li>
            <li>Great product for an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li>and they now sound like normal</li>
            <li>BUT the actual clippers, the most important part, works really well.</li>
            <li>do nicely for a vwry long time.</li>
            <li>I liked it as long as it worked, Then it stopped working after I cleaned it.</li>
            <li>Give a nice even cut and they are not loud at all which some reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li>As for the rest of the kit, it is not hard to tell that the accessories are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>After having a cheap remington vacuum clipper set for several years, I decided to find a good sturdy clipper set.</li>
            <li>The large variety of comb sizes is wonderful but the blade really isn&#x27;t sharp enough.</li>
            <li>my first clipper had some problems with scissors part and noise, but after complaining amazon sent me the new one with one day free shipping&lt;br /&gt;It seems, clipper is powerful, but this five star is for customer service,-</li>
            <li>Then at the time of my purchase, there was a Special Offer attached to this product (always look for Amazon&#x27;s Special Offers).</li>
            <li>Then at the time of my purchase, there was a Special Offer attached to this product (always look for Amazon&#x27;s Special Offers).</li>
            <li>It takes some practice and a little more time, but looks much better (IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The motor does not overheat easily like so many other clippers I&#x27;ve had tends to do.  </li>
            <li>broke(cracked right by the first screw).</li>
            <li>I gave this a 4 because I thought the clipper would be more heavy duty, but on the positive side it is lightweight and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Received quickly, and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I cant find any that are half as good</li>
            <li>I was able to cut around my four year old son&#x27;s ears without having to worry if I was going to accidentally nip his ear because he doesn&#x27;t hold still very well.</li>
            <li>After years of shelling out way too much for a simple #2 buzz cut I wanted to take matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li>Unit has a professional feel to it ----- heavier than another brand that I have, but easy to use -----</li>
            <li>I consider these a great investment because I&#x27;ve already saved over $300 by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have all the different accessories and also all the different sizes.</li>
            <li>None the less, good purchase.</li>
            <li>They cut very even and the chrome looks pretty cool</li>
            <li>This is great for cutting my own hair and my friends hair as well.</li>
            <li>Based on the good previous reviews of these Wahl clippers, I decided to try them</li>
            <li>I have purchased three of these sets in the last year after the my Son dropped, and broke the still perfectly good 40 year old Wahl trimmer I had all those years.</li>
            <li>but I am excited that I got my purchase in as I don&#x27;t feel they are quite worth the new higher price.</li>
            <li>Aside this, the trimmer is elegantly constructed of fine materials giving it that sharp look.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and sleek, this clipper set can handle the shaggiest mop top in no time with absolutely no snagging.</li>
            <li>Money well spent for sure!</li>
            <li>the Wahl Clippers arrived exactly on the day I ordered  the $3.99 same day shipping is great for those who need stuff in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>never an ounce of resistance, always a very crisp and very even cut.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped this item completely loose in a box, with no padding or air cushioning of any kind.  </li>
            <li>Arrived super fast and is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The device itself is strong and is kept in a nice small carrying case.</li>
            <li>know the Wahl name and when I saw this set and the very reasonable price, I just ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Very very very noisy clipper</li>
            <li>The motor moves the blades very fast and so it does not pull hair at all.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very very bed quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut about 4-5 heads of hair so far with this clippers and they seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Seems to not cut fine soft hair as well.</li>
            <li>There are other better quality combs available</li>
            <li>This one is lighter and cuts just fine, but it does not cut like the old one we had.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a fine product that has held up well with frequent use.</li>
            <li>The old one still works fine.</li>
            <li>There are so many options available in terms of the clipper sizes and other accessories provided with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never tried the other set, but with what I&#x27;ve got, this is the sturdiest, strongest, and most accurate set I&#x27;ve got for $25.</li>
            <li>Works well, a little noisy, but a good buy.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine for the first 30 seconds and then started to vibrate erratically - so loud that I cannot use it because my neighbors begin to bang on the walls.</li>
            <li>it is very smooth and comfortable, absolutely a good tool, now I find that cutting hair is an art.</li>
            <li>power is good for long or short hair, the grip is very nice, and the scissors that come with it are very sharp, to my surprise.</li>
            <li>I actually bought these for my Pomeranian&#x27;s hair, not for a human&#x27;s hair, and these clippers are amazing!  </li>
            <li>Save so much money doing haircuts at home!</li>
            <li>Gave the first haircut yesterday, and with the instructions they give you, it worked out quite well.  </li>
            <li>Only used twice so far but very pleased.</li>
            <li>I do use mineral oil occasionally to keep it in tip top condition.</li>
            <li>I forgot to oil it before i used it for the first time</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer but for a several more dollars you could buy a Wahl set that has one.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The blade is smooth and not choppy.</li>
            <li>Cut my hair in 5 min, with no difficult.</li>
            <li>I am overseas so, the first one I burne it with 220 volts.</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this kit to anyone, and would instead recommend spending another $25 and getting a higher quality model...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sorry I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but I&#x27;m guessing it will only take a couple of more times</li>
            <li>My first pair</li>
            <li>Return policy is about 30 days be aware.</li>
            <li>As I opened my Haircut kit, the first thing I took a look was the blade on cutter.  </li>
            <li>This thing pulled on my beard hair when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>It comes with more than enough guides and extensions.</li>
            <li>exactly what you&#x27;d expect for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably advise you to get a higher end model</li>
            <li>The first was for my home use.  </li>
            <li>- Does exactly what you&#x27;d want.</li>
            <li>First of all for that price, and manufactured in the US, and all those pieces included, does its job, pays off in one or two haircuts, it is</li>
            <li>sure to oil them regularly.</li>
            <li>Actually, it turned out much better than it had using scissors, and it was so much faster, too!  </li>
            <li>start out with the longest attachment first....</li>
            <li>Saves me $15 a cut, so it paid for itself after the first two cuts.  </li>
            <li>It works well when you need a haircut but can&#x27;t get to the barber and your wife is willing to cut it....</li>
            <li>This is a much better clipper set than my last one, and that one lasted about 7 years.</li>
            <li>The cape that comes with it feels pretty flimsy, so I like to just drape a towel around his shoulders.  </li>
            <li>It almost has too many accessories for my personal needs, but I&#x27;m glad it came with all the clipper guards and scissors for my initial &#x27;taming of the mane&#x27;.</li>
            <li>When I turn on the clipper, it was so loud and didn&#x27;t sound like a clipper at all.</li>
            <li>As for the Clippers themselves they function exactly as one would expect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with all the clippers from 1 to 8, and then several more extras.  </li>
            <li>Used them the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>Comes with many different level heads.</li>
            <li>At the barber all i do is ask for different sizes on the top and sides.  </li>
            <li>I had combs from an old one that fit on it</li>
            <li>The first time I used this clipper, I put on the 1/16th adjuster and had no issues.  </li>
            <li>; - )</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x60;It gets hot after 30 minutes of usage, but I think that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this product instead, which is the exact clipper, but in a plastic shell:</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>I love the extra guards that come with it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I did have to adjust the blades when I first got them.</li>
            <li>Not a difficult haircut to keep.</li>
            <li>My wife just gave me my first haircut with the Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Trimmer.</li>
            <li>Looking forward for more of such deals.</li>
            <li>This thing is sturdy and does the job MUCH better than the garbage CONAIR, I recently purchased.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like this machine from the first time I push ON.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they have so many models at different prices.</li>
            <li>know exactly what pull sensation I am talking about,</li>
            <li>It works like hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many clipper sets over the years and they always fall short.</li>
            <li>These have held up pretty well for the price point.</li>
            <li>This sucker works great.</li>
            <li>I have two sets of this trimmer, The first one I bought I had for quite a while</li>
            <li>Has lots of extra parts that most individuals will never use.</li>
            <li>And you get all this for just a smidge more than what I was paying for an fairly low price haircut!</li>
            <li>really like it!</li>
            <li>We just stick to a higher grade around the ears now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder to cut your own hair than it looks</li>
            <li>- it makes haircuts go so fast!</li>
            <li>Bought this to keep my 3 boys looking crisp, and used for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I almost never use a guide over a #2, but for close cuts, it does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>In fact, it looked pretty funny.</li>
            <li>Not difficult because I cut it to 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li>and it should last for many years.</li>
            <li>case could use some more organization or a different layout, as I feel everything is cluttered in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>sure enough i now am a pro!  </li>
            <li>suggest buying better clips to hold back your hair though.</li>
            <li>works pretty well&lt;</li>
            <li>I learned from ear number one to trim it first.  </li>
            <li>My husband finally decided to go with a buzz cut and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Over all, it really was worth the price.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, this clipper did not overheat...</li>
            <li>I use this for my son&#x27;s hair, and they are better then the last set of clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently begun clipping my own hair, and my first pair of clippers were fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever cut anybody&#x27;s hair, besides my dog&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Now my top of my head has only 1/2 inch of hair.</li>
            <li>It was my first time</li>
            <li>had this exact model in our home</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>Motor stopped working during first use.</li>
            <li>It was pretty chintzy and I just pitched it in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I have just finished my first cut with the Wahl Chrome Pro.</li>
            <li>(all of the many accessories are listed above)</li>
            <li>I finished the top of my head from the back, moving from all directions over the swirl to ensure an even cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this every week and my hair will stay looking great without growing long and then getting cut short again.</li>
            <li>I had spotted this same clipper at Sam&#x27;s Club for more money than Amazon.</li>
            <li>I had spotted this same clipper at Sam&#x27;s Club for more money than Amazon.</li>
            <li>With Amazon&#x27;s return policy, you can&#x27;t really lose!</li>
            <li>The Shaver is very well made!</li>
            <li>Some of the extras that come with the clippers are pretty junkie.  </li>
            <li>I thought he was going to take his head off when I first heard it.</li>
            <li>I like the product overall, glad I brought it.</li>
            <li>Very well made!</li>
            <li>the slower I went the better results, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same spot 10 times like my cheaper model.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Cut through like a hot knife on butter.</li>
            <li>I did that and the first haircut</li>
            <li>This cutter is like a hot knife going through butter.</li>
            <li>you can buy with your eyes closed, the model is nice, came in the allotted time, I have no problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he will get several years of use out of it.</li>
            <li>They get way too hot to even hold.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, and every time he uses it he tells me how much he loves it!</li>
            <li>A real money saver too!  </li>
            <li>So much better than last Wahl we bought.</li>
            <li>The sound isn&#x27;t loud or bothersome.</li>
            <li>Use it for college and works great comes with all the clipping lengths just sucks</li>
            <li>Worked the first time &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Ever since I bought this, I have given my husband haircuts instead of sending him to the barber and saved so much!</li>
            <li>It was a great and long lasting product</li>
            <li>Thanks to this set, I didn&#x27;t butcher my haircut!  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice on first my dad, then my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>Has numerous attachments, cape to put on your shoulders, is very quiet to operate; couldn&#x27;t be more pleased &amp; was a bargain at this price.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>First use with 2 boys went well.  </li>
            <li>Had my first one for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I just had my first haircut with it and the difference between the 79524-2501 and the 79300-400 is NIGHT AND DAY.</li>
            <li>clippers themselves are durable from metal and work very well!</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the buy</li>
            <li>/&gt;People from Europe - be aware that if you buy this hair cutter from US, you will have issue with the electrical characteristics - this one is designed for 110 volt and 60 hertz electricity.</li>
            <li>I asked him if the sound is too loud</li>
            <li>sure if they will last though?</li>
            <li>Has yet to catch my hair and cuts really well!</li>
            <li>The guards are cheap-ish plastic, but I only use guards 2 and lower and have had no problem whatsoever, even after changing them out many times.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I have to constantly oil and brush my razors so they don&#x27;t lock and pull my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is my first clipper</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a larger attachment if you don&#x27;t want to shave off your kid&#x27;s side burn!</li>
            <li>It cuts as smooth as a hot knife through soft butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So take precautions while using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Read the manual first.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of clippers</li>
            <li>But I can tell this is a durable and consistent set.</li>
            <li>Kit box could be a bit larger or better designed</li>
            <li>They have a cord so be aware they are not cordless..</li>
            <li>The case is hollow and everything is just kind of thrown in there...</li>
            <li>It has all ready paid for itself by doing two h/c!</li>
            <li>Now, I just really need to practice!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the comb set is all plastic so after a while I may need to replace the combs I use the most.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what was described.  </li>
            <li>Delivered product was exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Better than my last pair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a smooth trimmer, easly quietest trimmers that I have owned!</li>
            <li>and I immediately used the machine for the first time to cut my hair and it started to overheat and started to smell.  </li>
            <li>The product is exactly which describes the provider.</li>
            <li>I had the first one for years.</li>
            <li>has all the necessary hair clips for any type of stylish cuts.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay for occasional trims and cuts.</li>
            <li>Very well made and a bargain at twice the cost!</li>
            <li>its price can do exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The last one I purchased several years ago, worked wonderfully, and recently died.</li>
            <li>So many different guards give you lots of choices as well.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty quality, good product.</li>
            <li>Good,  just used a few time got it paid for already</li>
            <li>It is a little noise it , I cut my hair Flat Top style and this machine does a verry good job.</li>
            <li>(again, took me an hour), but I&#x27;m sure that time will cut down once you become familiar and more confident with cutting your own hair (it was my first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is brand new and the old one works much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now the old, sharpened clippers work better than the new ones I just bought.  </li>
            <li>Just keep it dry and its more than worth it.</li>
            <li>super powerful compared to my old Remington.</li>
            <li>It oozes quality, and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great product, especially for those with limited HAIR.</li>
            <li>Was great in the beginning several months but the lever switch became loose and wouldn&#x27;t maintain its position and bought a replacement hair cut kit and now the mechanical blade will not function correctly.</li>
            <li>I opened the package to find a nice set of clips and other accessories.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been giving myself flat top haircuts for years.</li>
            <li>They are pretty sharper and don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot too much to make sure it&#x27;s cut.</li>
            <li>My first haircut on myself looked good by following the simple instructions.</li>
            <li>My first time cutting my own hair looked just as good as when the barber did it.  </li>
            <li>The other 2 Wahl products we own have been in use for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Nice sharp blade.</li>
            <li>My husband gives himself a flat top every 3 weeks using clippers.  </li>
            <li>Love these clippers, they are great for just about anything when it comes to cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>but in general it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li>It works ok and does a reasonable job, but it takes several passes to clip the hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as loud as my last trimmer either, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>The cut was super clean, so I would try a longer length guide to start and then go smaller from there</li>
            <li>This shaver/trimmer does a good job with lots of different &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; for different length of cuts.  </li>
            <li>I just received this item, tried it for the first time - its so noisy that really too much !</li>
            <li>Pays for itself, good for cutting your own hair or having someone do it for you.  </li>
            <li>Quiet and cuts clean and quick.</li>
            <li>I expect a few more times and she&#x27;ll be comfortable and a at home pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is very easy to cut your hair shorter than you want, be careful.</li>
            <li>I liked having more control using scissors, but it took so much longer (his hair is thick!)</li>
            <li>I cut my hair (very curly) and my roommates (very straight) and we have zero complaints.</li>
            <li>Bought this giving the product benefit of the doubt, but it is SUPER LOUD!.</li>
            <li>These are very nice, heavy, like professional barber clippers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wahl units for many decades and it seems if you take a little time to clean and oil them</li>
            <li>Seems very rugged, long cord, works great so far, came in a nice hard case.</li>
            <li>terms of the item&#x27;s functionality, I love it, I used it for a hair cut that was kind of long on a male, and it worked flawlessly, no hair pulling, not sticking of any kind, it was so easy to use and had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>you ripped on the first use, but we don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very concern about a product that i bought at your store on the first week of November this year.</li>
            <li>i was pretty amazed about these , would recommend them to anyone that wants to save money.</li>
            <li>If you are a man who is tired of not being satisfied with your hair stylist - you know, one time it looks great, the next time you look like a palm tree...</li>
            <li>so unless you keep your hair more than 5-6&amp;#34; long you should be good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>It comes with oil and maintenance instructions which I&#x27;ve mostly disregarded, and has still lasted me this long.</li>
            <li>my kind of cut, you do the sides and back first, around the ear next, and then finally the top.</li>
            <li>whether cutting your own hair or that of other family members there is a learning curve involved and the hair cuts may not come out perfect at first.</li>
            <li>They have a pretty sleek look and you can get  a really sleek haircut out of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;professional\\&quot; Andis clipper blade pretty much yanked the hair out of my head.</li>
            <li>For the best-looking haircut (for a guy with short hair) don&#x27;t be afraid to use the scissors on the top, and don&#x27;t worry about making it PERFECTLY even.</li>
            <li>Considering I spent only $25-30 on it, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to last forever, so I was very happy with that purchase.</li>
            <li>Cheap(low-quality)/Metal blade/Takes twice as long to cut my hair and much more patience</li>
            <li>and my wife says we look just as good if not better doing it ourselves.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s not a bad set up.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and will cost you less than one good haircut from a professional.</li>
            <li>I seriously could not stop saying \\&quot;I love these clippers!\\&quot; as I cut their hair &#x3D;).</li>
            <li>Though it would be nice to have a short instruction manual on how to use the left and right ear pieces.</li>
            <li>is that if you get them wet they can rust really easily!</li>
            <li>Pretty nice little kit for the price</li>
            <li>These clippers work decent, but they get hot pretty quick, and also get loud.</li>
            <li>i usually cut my own hair, came with everything came on time cuts great with no snags this will last me a long time</li>
            <li>I am now able to cut my husband&#x27;s hair instead of making a special 60 mile round trip to town.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and effective.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very solid, clip smoothly and don&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
            <li>But they are super loud.</li>
            <li>Easy to use to keep yourself looking human when in a rush.</li>
            <li>The attachments make trimming easy, especially the ones for tapering.</li>
            <li>I am VERY particular about some of the things</li>
            <li>haircuts are not always easy to attain so this kit enables him to do it himself and keep his hair short for under his helmet..</li>
            <li>I used it instantly on myself and was blown away with how easy it was.</li>
            <li>Yeah buddy, if you have an easy shave (I&#x27;m a simple buzz cut every time) than this is way wiser than spending $15 a haircut.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for several months now, and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>You can always work your way down, but you can&#x27;t work your way back up, lol.  </li>
            <li>Great product powerful and sharp , a good selection of tools , a little Heavy , but</li>
            <li>I will certainly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>You will certainly find some use for this machine.</li>
            <li>Totally smart buy.  </li>
            <li>I have my wife cut my hair because at $16-$20 a pop, this will be a large money</li>
            <li>pretty quiet, very powerful, and lots of extras.</li>
            <li>Brand New!!</li>
            <li>Of course, I bought the same clippers again since I was so happy with the previous set.    </li>
            <li>It is quiet, fast, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>They are solid, very well constructed, and have a strong motor.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer made quick work of the husband&#x27;s thick hair and there wasn&#x27;t a peep about &#x27;pulling&#x27; or &#x27;catching&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have had the new one for a few months and have been happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, functional, and easy to use!</li>
            <li>It may take an extra pass or two to get all the hair but for my needs it works fine.</li>
            <li>The combs it comes with are also great and really make cutting his hair easily.</li>
            <li>The guards for the clippers are basic guards, they work perfectly fine, as some people said they&#x27;re &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Wahl, and all other hair experts recommend that you start with the comb that leaves the most hair on your head first.</li>
            <li>but they stay on just fine with a solid grip.</li>
            <li>Quiet, solid trimmer with more guides than you&#x27;ll ever need!  </li>
            <li>I have used others and they work okay too, but this is made of higher quality plastic than the other value brands.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to cut my own hair, saving me $15 a month, paying for itself in a few short months.  </li>
            <li>it grew back rather quickly!</li>
            <li>A very high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is very high quality and works so well.</li>
            <li>cuts good, i am new at do it your self cuts once i get the balls to really cut some off the top ill Update.</li>
            <li>These are good for the money, and very smooth cutting.</li>
            <li>I was going to just buy the two angled guards for a current clipper, but realized I could get the whole kit for close to the same price... much better equipment than before, and now I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour trying to get the hair over their ears!</li>
            <li>They work exactly as advertised and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and the price makes it a real bargain!</li>
            <li>I found I have to go over the cats more than once in certain areas, but it&#x27;s not much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid little machine and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I pretty much just run the clippers over my head to buzz all my hair off, and only use guides to clean up my eye brows, but that doesn&#x27;t detract from how well these clippers do what they do.</li>
            <li>With a little practice and a good mirror, you will give yourself a professional haircut every time and save money.</li>
            <li>I do like the sides short and faded, but i like a little more on the top.</li>
            <li>It was the easiest to use and the haircut looks very Professional!!</li>
            <li>It takes a few times to get used to cutting so make sure that you don&#x27;t have some party to attend and need to look your best when you first start out!</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous at first, but they are SO EASY to use!</li>
            <li>Agree with most of the other positive posts.</li>
            <li>and it made a huge nick in the back of my head (on both sides).</li>
            <li>just works really well ... smooth and quiet...</li>
            <li>Very well built and they feel substantial, not like some cheap Chinese junk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades cut really well.</li>
            <li>It cuts very evenly and without any effort at all.</li>
            <li>It cuts really well.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really have any problems with it.</li>
            <li>A couple pulls but it didn&#x27;t really hurt or anything.</li>
            <li>I have an Oster T-Trimmer that works very well</li>
            <li>I love this one, it is wide.</li>
            <li>and it was still too much.</li>
            <li>This does not get a very close cut.</li>
            <li>but she also stated it cuts my hair much smoother and with ease.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve buzzed my whole head.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>In retrospect I wish I spent the $8 more for the one with the personal/around ear trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it too much yet</li>
            <li>It is recommended to buy this set with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Only wish it was cordless, but not that important.</li>
            <li>As they&#x27;re meant to glide through hair, they don&#x27;t need to be very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I like that the clipper comes with a five-year warranty, and I&#x27;ve found Wahl&#x27;s customer service to be very helpful in providing information when I&#x27;ve emailed and called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it worked really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Reasonably fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It also cuts hair (on my head) very well.</li>
            <li>I dont think they&#x27;ve ever been to a real barber shop.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really lose.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I would recommend Wahl to anyone looking for a very durable hair cutter.  </li>
            <li>Very disorganized.</li>
            <li>They cut hair very well.    </li>
            <li>shipped fast as described</li>
            <li>I really like these clippers.</li>
            <li>I have used it about five times now and cuts very well.</li>
            <li>Much happier.   </li>
            <li>I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>but this one had really cheap attachments and one broke shortly after I got it.  </li>
            <li>Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of hair to plow through and it made it so much easier to do so in increments.</li>
            <li>its just vibrates too much.</li>
            <li>Very well please with this product.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast, so getting 2/month is $50.  </li>
            <li>If you really, really want to cut your hair at home, go for it.  </li>
            <li>things don&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>It works great but came with some broken combs.</li>
            <li>This has worked very well for me learning to cut my fiance&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>It also is very  </li>
            <li>very loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t fit in hand properly.  </li>
            <li>My only issue with the kit is the apron included is about as cheap as you can get.</li>
            <li>They work really well and came with a ton of guards.</li>
            <li>Really inexpensive for the quality.  </li>
            <li>Rest really didn&#x27;t need to be cut.  </li>
            <li>Stainless steel blade is well constructed.  </li>
            <li>Really like the guards, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll cut your hair, it has all the accessories you&#x27;d expect, and it matches your stainless steel decor.</li>
            <li>It also works really well on hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing to complain about here.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>n ready to go, didn&#x27;t need to screw anything to adjustment or any of that..</li>
            <li>It feels very sturdy and well constructed, just like one you would see in a barber shop.</li>
            <li>This hair cutting kit is awesome!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how they work on mine which is much thinner.  </li>
            <li>I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and started out using a cheap cutter that we bought at a local drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I will save so much money using this on my two boys.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my bead.</li>
            <li>Seem very durable.  </li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t died and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog much.</li>
            <li>Seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever been to a salon or a barber, it makes just as much noise as the ones over there.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t  cut very  well at all.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is it is sound but</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use it as an all-around body trimmer as opposed to just my head.</li>
            <li>I must say it does its job very well.</li>
            <li>It has proven to be very durable and</li>
            <li>I think it is reasonable.</li>
            <li>only thing that would make thiis better imo is maybe make it not so heavy :)</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon</li>
            <li>It trims really well.</li>
            <li>No tugs or scrapes, either - just a very professional-looking haircut from a decidedly non-professional barber.  </li>
            <li>The clippers itself were better quality than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>tried cutting my own hair with a fade, and it really didn&#x27;t come out all that nice.</li>
            <li>I was going to go to my barber for a haircut which costs the same as this kit, so instead me being cheap</li>
            <li>16$ at the barber every two weeks adds up fast .&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>It does it job well and does come with a wide variety of accessories - most of which I have never used till date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only issue I sense is that if it is used for sometime without switching it off intermittently I feel I can sense a light smell coming out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only a matter of time before that cheap hinge breaks.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Wahl brand hair clipper!</li>
            <li>This unit feel solid and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>You can really tell in the feel of the adjustment lever.  </li>
            <li>It cuts my hair very well.</li>
            <li>powerful, not a lot of noise, complete set</li>
            <li>I really like the adjustability of this clipper.</li>
            <li>But this Wahl kit is very well made and gets the job done immediately.</li>
            <li>It works just as I hoped it would, really well.</li>
            <li>This product from Wahl works very well.  </li>
            <li>In fact you don&#x27;t want to go too fast or try and get too much of the fur coz that will clog up the blade.  </li>
            <li>this works really well.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>Cuts fast, no pulling, boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li>The instruction booklet is very understandable too.</li>
            <li>Sturdy electric clippers that does as promised, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is much quieter though.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the look and feel of these clippers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like the tapered guards for \\&quot;edging\\&quot; and the case keeps everything together.</li>
            <li>Free to me after my second haircut (savings over paying for haircare).</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was leery of the type of quality that this set would have based on the low price, but it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and we saved much money for hair cut.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get clogged with too much hair like others.  </li>
            <li>It really is a haircut kit, even with the cape included.</li>
            <li>To finish off, a wetting of the hair and some Bed Head gel and I&#x27;m ready for town!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>With Amazon&#x27;s return policy, you can&#x27;t really lose!cutting my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the thing just conked off, I could have been electrocuted or the whole Power supply could have been damaged.</li>
            <li>This is the heaviest of all the clippers I have ever owned, but it is also the best cutting pair.</li>
            <li>Very Smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>better than I expected</li>
            <li>it comes with a whole pile of attachments.</li>
            <li>Perfect for cutting my beard</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful but loud.</li>
            <li>The guides are very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be built very well and</li>
            <li>This Wahl kit comes with absolutely everything you need to cut hair.</li>
            <li>That means it cuts really well.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>them because I was ready for a change.</li>
            <li>an advanced user, but for the simple stuff it does what it is suppose</li>
            <li>I just started cutting my hair and these are perfect to start with.</li>
            <li>We save so much money not having his hair cut in a salon.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the included cleaning brush and oil for the clippers.</li>
            <li>You can do weekly touch ups and keep your family looking very well groomed all the time.</li>
            <li>did the job for which I bought this very well.</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>It really stank the house up</li>
            <li>It gets the job done but the guards rattle a lot and do not stay on very well.</li>
            <li>Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>We decided to stop wasting so much money at in-and-out barbers.</li>
            <li>I guess it is cheap (!)</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much was included with the product.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care as it has paid for itself after 3 uses.</li>
            <li>&amp; my expectations are high for this trimmer!  </li>
            <li>undercut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cape and accessories that come extra are cheap.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work really well either...</li>
            <li>Not too noisey cuts smooth and comes with a lot of guards for various hair lengths.</li>
            <li>My son has hear that is very think</li>
            <li>thanks the machine is beutifull</li>
            <li>I wanted a set that would just run straight through without jamming or pulling hair.</li>
            <li>and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Also works very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t force the plastic screw too much or else you may break the plastic screw.</li>
            <li>Turning the power screw too much counter-clockwise can misaligned the blades.</li>
            <li>the noise it makes is really too high to bear !</li>
            <li>Quiet and smooth, lots of extras</li>
            <li>Works really well and comes with almost everything you would need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying I just plunked them on my DIY workbench and did the job, but it really wasn&#x27;t hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Numerous attachments fit about any hair situation.  </li>
            <li>My wife accidentally shaved off too much, yep...</li>
            <li>shaves very well..</li>
            <li>Offers good cutting edges, accurate and precise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve been using mine for a whole year</li>
            <li>They cut really close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Works very well mistakenly.</li>
            <li>I really like how these cut and also how they look and feel.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are tiny and cheap - don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll use them - but the clippers work well.</li>
            <li>how wonderful that no one will need to dirty a bath towel to catch hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Plenty of guards, a pair of scissors, hair clips, combs, everything but the barber is included in this kit and the price was better than we had expected.  </li>
            <li>very good.，The quality is very good，I like it</li>
            <li>had to oil the on/off switch after a while because it stuck so much.</li>
            <li>It has everything (probably too much) that I need to cut my hair and trim my beard.</li>
            <li>Too much vibration on the hand.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair very efficiently and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I got a real apron instead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real money saver.</li>
            <li>It saves us so much money</li>
            <li>I think made very well for these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought for my mother who really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>Price comparison to very bed.</li>
            <li>It cuts and trims really well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and seems to have all of the attachments I will need.</li>
            <li>The clippers arrived extremely fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Very noisy..</li>
            <li>I feel like a real barber.  </li>
            <li>:  Go to a beauty supply store and buy a REAL cape.</li>
            <li>Works fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li>very well made.  </li>
            <li>Seem to cut fast (duration of haircut) yet don&#x27;t get any tugs.  </li>
            <li>but you could always rough up that spot for more grip if need be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an expert, but it work very well for me</li>
            <li>Runs quietly and cuts as smooth as butter.  </li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll get nicks and pink spots on your face :)  </li>
            <li>Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>one I purchased identical to this is very very quiet and light.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>I really like this machine.</li>
            <li>Although it vibrates too much for my taste</li>
            <li>I learned my lesson and like using them now, but I&#x27;m much more careful now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>24 piece kit really covers every cut you would need.</li>
            <li>All the guide combs are made out of plastic, most of them are warped and not straight, looks like it was exposed to heat and was deformed.</li>
            <li>I am a former Cosmetologist and enjoy the Wahl cutter.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a real keeper of a trimmer.  </li>
            <li>even though I&#x27;ve only had them for a short time the durability seems to be good so far.  </li>
            <li>They give you two different combs (with different grading) and a nice pair of hair scissors.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face!</li>
            <li>The eyebrow trimmer is nice, but not short enough for me.</li>
            <li>In fact, the guides on this clipper attach a lot more solidly than they did on my old one.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face!</li>
            <li>But to be honest, they get close ENOUGH, and have enough guards to pull off whatever you need them to do.</li>
            <li>Difersnt kind of styles strobg motor and heavy constrccion , brand name.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face!</li>
            <li>Good so far, it seems like a heavy duty product.</li>
            <li>My husband was used to his older, heavier cutter, and despite us discussing a very funny Amazon review about this exact possibility, the same thing happened to him when he used it the first time.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for home usage.&lt;br /&gt;There are different shoes that help you make your cut easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These have been such a money saver (as my old clippers were), but are very comfortable to cut (unlike my older clippers).</li>
            <li>Between this baby and my Flowbee I can crank out my own haircut in 10 minutes or less!</li>
            <li>For a guy who only have flattop like my bf, it is very economical.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product I heard many people complain about the noise this machine produces, but I can assure you this product makes no less of a noice than any regular trimmer.</li>
            <li>My better half has never cut hair before, so the first time was an adventure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very nice piece with a solid heavy duty body.</li>
            <li>Once I bought the first new one my daughter wanted one to cut her dogs hair with.</li>
            <li>However, this is the clear winner when it comes to trimming hair and getting the right length.</li>
            <li>However, this is the clear winner when it comes to trimming hair and getting the right length.</li>
            <li>However, this is the clear winner when it comes to trimming hair and getting the right length.</li>
            <li>but if your looking for something to last a long time, I suggest to get something a bit more quality!</li>
            <li>sure to use Wahl or other brand clipping oil to retain the longevity of clippers.</li>
            <li>May suggest the other version with a clipper setting greater than 1&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>So we&#x27;re not going to bark and scream on how these are better than other brands.  </li>
            <li>More than I expected for my money!</li>
            <li>I recieved the clippers earlier thab the original arrival date.</li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t hardly hear them ruin and the old man said he could not feel any kind of pulling!</li>
            <li>You can always work your way down quickly by using the next number comb (higher numbers leave more hair; the lower the number, the closer the cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, and not worth the money.</li>
            <li>While functionally it is ok, but cosmetically the appearance is very rough.</li>
            <li>the unit is very high quality , would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Cuts hair very well was very excited about the outcome and many different options to cutting hair overall good quality</li>
            <li>Make sure to always lubricate any clipper right before you use it, and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a professional set of clippers or anything, but it does just fine.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep it clean and provide some basic maintenance, you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Quiet and gives a clean cut.</li>
            <li>It only takes me about 15 minutes and about 5 minutes clean up time.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because the scissors aren&#x27;t the best quality, which I half expected anyway in a kit at this price.  </li>
            <li>only wish they would have offered little more oil, but that is fine.</li>
            <li>I have not gone to Supercuts; I am able to maintain my short hair length all the time; whereas before I needed to visit Supercuts regularly; I use the # 12 comb on my whole head every day to maintain the 1.5\\&quot; length that I like; they are very quite and inconspicuous.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and it is very sturdy and high quality.</li>
            <li>I didnt want to spend too much money on new clippers and These clippers were priced very well.....</li>
            <li>it has a lot of different prices to it to assure we can get the right cut!</li>
            <li>The cutting guides are good, and the clipper is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive hands thanks to rheumatoid arthritis, and these clippers do not hurt me to use unless I&#x27;m having a real flare, and when that happens, I cannot even hold cotton candy without hurting, so</li>
            <li>so I finally broke down and bought my own thank you very much</li>
            <li>Dry was fine, though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Wahl still makes good clippers, but it is clear that they are cutting corners on their cheaper models.</li>
            <li>It is very sad, I never had a Wahl and my Barbers always mentioned it as the best.</li>
            <li>NOT too loud or too hot when operated.</li>
            <li>I usually cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>But this is the first one that completely stopped working w/o warning (no loudness/chattering beforehand).  </li>
            <li>This was my first pair of clippers and I was pleasantly surprised - the clippers are sturdy, and get the job done well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty complete set</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when I first use them, its noise is too loud.</li>
            <li>They perform like professional clippers costing 4-5 times as much money!  </li>
            <li>Con: -It was loud, at first.</li>
            <li>so i Got this product with really good reviews , but when i used it ,it started making weird loud sound which is unbearable .</li>
            <li>but overall, not bad.</li>
            <li>My last set was 2+ years old, and I never oiled them and they were still kicking just fine.</li>
            <li>so when you set it down make sure the cover is face up.</li>
            <li>My clippers were a little noisy right out of the box but after dropping some of the lube they supplied it turned out fine and it slices through hair like nothing.</li>
            <li>is well made, solid, and perfect for personal use as it has all kind of accessories, I started cutting my own hair last month with this product, is a hard thing to do and the results are not what I expected, but i&#x27;m sure I will improve my skills.</li>
            <li>Only con so far is that it gets hot quite quickly.</li>
            <li>All new barbers and home cutters (MAYBE EVEN PROS) should buy this clipper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still surprised by how many accessories they were able to cram into such a small box</li>
            <li>6 flat tops with it so far, and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Still works great after almost a year, can&#x27;t say if it would hold up to commercial use but for my personal use it is still sharp and cuts great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My boyfriend was going to the barber, paying $20 to get his hair buzzed every couple of months, and more than half the time, he came home hating the hair cut anyway.</li>
            <li>Just be careful as the plastic cover has teeth that chip easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a serious complaint, but it would have been nice for the whole set to be there.</li>
            <li>Has a wide variety of settings and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the Wahl clippers are quite a bit heavier and vibrate more than my previous ConAir clippers.  </li>
            <li>I have used this set for many years now, and typically every 2 years</li>
            <li>I previously had a better (to me)</li>
            <li>The clipper itself is of a decent weight and feels very durable and sturdily built with a powerful motor (a big difference between the ones made in China).</li>
            <li>Bought this for the same price as a smaller Wahl  kit, this one has more extras.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for body hair grooming</li>
            <li>Next one I was sure about the power outlet, but it is the same noise.</li>
            <li>The combs included are really useful and the directions are clear and concise.</li>
            <li>For the cost, this is a decent clipper.  </li>
            <li>I did a decent job considering the size of these clippers.  </li>
            <li>There is simply no reason to spend any more money on a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>For the price I am able to save $20.00 + per month on cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a high-quality hair clippers at a decent price</li>
            <li>A quick disclaimer, I only shave my head (no guard on the clippers)</li>
            <li>would definitely buy again, as this has many attachments to use for all kinds of different hair styles and lengths.  </li>
            <li>Bought to replace an older Wahl electric I had for over 10 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Took me a couple weeks of daily looking &amp; reading to finally pick this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is the carrying case could be larger and more organizational, as everything is cramped into it.</li>
            <li>For questions of how close these cut, you have to understand that decent quality clippers have 2 screws affixing the to blade.</li>
            <li>It has enough guides to do many different length cuts.  </li>
            <li>Much quieter than his old one, and much lighter.  </li>
            <li>but i was also being realistic with my expectation.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping to come out looking somewhat decent from a DIY haircut.  </li>
            <li>Decent product..</li>
            <li>main thing to keep in mind</li>
            <li>/&gt;-No hassle waiting in shop and waiting for the one or two decent</li>
            <li>The only con I can see with this product is that this is more of a trimming kit than haircut kit, but can still be used to cut your hair if you are looking to trim it only and not cut it with scissors.</li>
            <li>I can quickly do my entire head and not worry about going over the same spot so many times.</li>
            <li>Motor is nothing like the older one&#x27;s, this one has power and cuts</li>
            <li>The main cutter seems to be made of metal instead of plastiic.  </li>
            <li>If you want to save money as well as get a decent haircut then get one of these.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my own hair for years and the Wahl cuts my hair better then</li>
            <li>for the older, bushy eyebrow gals--and guys--not that I&#x27;m one of those ;</li>
            <li>for the older, bushy eyebrow gals--and guys--not that I&#x27;m one of those ;</li>
            <li>Now I will have to wait several more weeks before I can use them again - because there is nothing left to cut.  </li>
            <li>I had another pair of Wahl clippers from several years back and even like this pair better.  </li>
            <li>You get better at cutting your own hair every time you do so</li>
            <li>The main unit, one comb, scissors, brush, and cape is all I need.  </li>
            <li>Works perfect for cutting my 3 year old sons hair.</li>
            <li>I quickly put it back in the package and returned it.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly for side burns.</li>
            <li>It WAS VERY VERY LOUD VIBRATED MY WHOLE FACE AND ARM.</li>
            <li>Super high quality, will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very surprised !</li>
            <li>My usage is very simple: I bought it to keep my haircut to the lowest (meaning the limit between shaving my head completely and having a little millimeters of hair, military style), and it gets the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend, with no prior background in cutting men&#x27;s hair, uses them like a pro and saves us $20 every month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed how sturdy the clippers felt when I first opened the box.</li>
            <li>It feels really sturdy and I&#x27;m sure this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>High quality for the price and made in USA.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Wahl cutter is not unpleasantly loud and cuts cleanly without pulling.</li>
            <li>and if I want to get it fixed I will have to pay for the shipping to the manufacturer and the return postage which is about $5 short of the original cost.</li>
            <li>Get some other kind of detail buzzer for the back of your neck.</li>
            <li>I bought this as new one and, for roughly the same price, it feels much more substanial and of a higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Clippers can be a bit loud at certain times.</li>
            <li>So, read the manual a little more.</li>
            <li>They also include everything you could possible need for the whole process!!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend saving up a little more and get something rated for barbers.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE sticking out my little chest and telling them, &amp;#34;Thank</li>
            <li>We get better cleaning results using a can of compressed air instead of that little brush.</li>
            <li>Its working frequency is fixed, not 50/60 Hz!!</li>
            <li>as well i think its a little heavier duty than most.</li>
            <li>A little more practice...</li>
            <li>This does not mean that any fur longer than 3/4\\&quot; will be cut...</li>
            <li>I wish the motor were a little more powerful,but it still does what I ask it to do.  </li>
            <li>Many blade choices and the combs help too although one of the combs I received was a little bent...</li>
            <li>The first one actually worked quite well, which is why I ordered a second one, when the original was dropped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wish though that Wahl would make some more attachments in just a little longer lengths.</li>
            <li>Older models feel more sturdy and heavy duty while this one feels like it has cheaper plastic.</li>
            <li>This is a well built hair cutting kit at a very good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Power switch is flimsy and other reviews tell of it easily</li>
            <li>Has a nice hard case but its all just thrown in the case.</li>
            <li>These clippers come in a nice hard plastic storage case and include a variety of guards, brushes, scissors, etc.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times were a little &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; because they do make a noise and are pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product is great and does everything you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>My dad&#x27;s old Wahl cuts much closer.</li>
            <li>It really feels professional when you use it.</li>
            <li>the clerk seemed really surprised that i didn&#x27;t want to cough up that much money for a</li>
            <li>The first 9 months of cutting my hair and my brothers hair, it was great.</li>
            <li>It is loud, but really, does that matter?</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too loud and cut really well, no tugs, or rips.</li>
            <li>Came complete and fast,  and till this day still works gets its use each week with 3 boys in the house</li>
            <li>Over all, this is a great product and you won&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li>far they work very well</li>
            <li>I use it on my 3 year old son and he doesn&#x27;t complain and it cuts so fast.  </li>
            <li>It has a SOLID build and lot&#x27;s of useful</li>
            <li>If I had to do it over, I would wait and spend a few $$ more on a set that includes a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very noisey and after a short period of use they become extremely hot.</li>
            <li>Went from the back forward throughout the whole cut and after putting some styling mousse through my hair I was amazed at how well my first cut turned out.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>Using different attachments , I had my daughter trim the back and top for a complete haircut .</li>
            <li>I have only used it few times but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I had to buy one of my own, and I have saved at least the cost of what I paid for it in haircuts this year alone.</li>
            <li>Maybe others are normal, either way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet, but has a powerful motor.</li>
            <li>but maybe only 2 or 3 of them are useful the rest if just junk that you will end up throwing away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a guy with a normal haircut</li>
            <li>i used it only once and will use it again on sunday, but for using it for the first time, it cuts and trims very well.</li>
            <li>Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat for this unit, I would guess it&#x27;s a few bucks more in a store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, but they aren&#x27;t loud enough that I would complain or make a big deal about it...</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve gone through quite a few clipper sets but this one is of much better quality.</li>
            <li>it is heavy and bulky, and is not cordless (we should&#x27;ve paid more attention before buying it).</li>
            <li>The actual clippers work nicely but it&#x27;s not worth what I paid for this set.</li>
            <li>Definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>and they still work like normal,</li>
            <li>i have cut my own hair with this thing twice now and even my old retired usmc boss likes the results...and he usually doesn&#x27;t like anything i do</li>
            <li>After using the product only once, I find that it is not cutting and tends to snag the hair.  </li>
            <li>I will update this review if I do someone&#x27;s thick locks and have problems but so far I am very satisfied with this clipper set.</li>
            <li>Feels more heavy duty than the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything that comes in the box is useful for personal use or in a barbershop.</li>
            <li>For the record, my hair is kind of thick</li>
            <li>Well... its good... not great.</li>
            <li>This product is efficient and easy to use, and I got a very neat beard trim with little effort.</li>
            <li>I buzz my own hair down with it, though it tends to take quite a number of passes before the hair is actually</li>
            <li>We were both surprised at how well this kit worked - definitely professional quality!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to switch back to the old set, which I&#x27;m glad I kept, and maybe keep the new set as a backup.  </li>
            <li>A good piece at very low cost, but its very heavy and vibrates ​harder while using.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use, and all the different guides are extremely helpful.  </li>
            <li>Walh would not cut hair (Not dull, would not cut hair at all) and even tried adjusting blade alignment per manual.</li>
            <li>The razor worked well for the first couple hair cuts but quickly stopped cutting effectively.</li>
            <li>The plastic cover is pretty flimsy and it could use a brush for cleaning off the tools afterwards, but luckily I had these left over from my last haircutting kit.</li>
            <li>Needed new clippers because mine were old and ready to be retired.</li>
            <li>professional And High quality hair cutter, but a little bit heavy its perfect for hair shop not for daily use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for almost 10years off and on so these are smooth,fairly quieted easy to use.</li>
            <li>I decided at the price trying these made far more sense that paying half of what they cost for one hair cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Me and my better half are not hairstylists or professional in any way shape or form.  </li>
            <li>less then 30 minutes later both boys were done and loving their hair cuts.  </li>
            <li>I just started cutting my own hair and these clippers made it really easy.</li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long, the trimmers are relatively quiet, and it all comes in a nice carry container made of hard plastic that helps keep the product relatively organized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a big deal, since the price is right....</li>
            <li>He obviously likes it, and for me, the price was right.</li>
            <li>left and right side trimming unit does not match with 1 and 2, which suppose to be used together with side unit.</li>
            <li>It also comes with one for the left and right ears and one for the eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>They give you all the necessary tools to cut the hair, it&#x27;s just going to take practice before you get it right.</li>
            <li>, I found the Right and Left taper combs to cut around the ear.</li>
            <li>There is a left and right ear attachment that you circle the ear with</li>
            <li>An adapter for around right and left ear - Eyebrows - beard.</li>
            <li>If you hold it just right, you can get it to be fairly quiet.  </li>
            <li>I told her we are going to get a HUMAN CLIPPER right now</li>
            <li>The ear tapering attachment will cut short unless you do it right way.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this new set, is much better quality than his previous and cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a shot after weighing the negative reviews against the positive ones and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It seemed about half as strong as the first one, could barely cut through hair after 2 months, and by the end was pulling hair out of my beard.</li>
            <li>When I use trimmer my single most important requirement, other than it should actually trim, is  it should not have any pull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing pays for itself pretty much on the first haircut...and then saves you $50/month, or $600/year (net, post-tax), or about $1000/year gross income.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of cutting my own hair, I&#x27;m much happier - being able to cut my hair every two weeks so that it always looks neat and trimmed, just the way I like it - without constantly flushing money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male, who wants to start cutting my own hair to save money and give myself hair cuts more often.</li>
            <li>They definitely aren&#x27;t for shaving without using a guard; the unit is loud because the blades are sharp and moving very fast and would love to chew up soft flesh if given the opportunity.</li>
            <li>The Wahl is not near as loud as the Con Air, but it&#x27;s not the most quiet set of clippers either.  </li>
            <li>My only real dissatisfaction is that the case it came in was way too small to give any kind of organization to it.</li>
            <li>I did notice my number 2 doesn&#x27;t fit as snug as the other pieces, you can&#x27;t tell by looking or feeling it though.  </li>
            <li>They seem a bit heavy, and I am pretty sure the \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; cover is painted plastic.. but its the internal components that I am concerned about.. not the cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WARNING best friends are not good at cutting hair, don&#x27;t be fooled by their confidence :)</li>
            <li>Other than that I really enjoy the product</li>
            <li>The blades are well fit and sharp.  </li>
            <li>it becouse I live in Brasil.</li>
            <li>I got my husband this as one of his birthday gifts since he had been mentioning needing a new one.</li>
            <li>The clippers looked they were used already, even though i brought them new.</li>
            <li>Was this a refurbished device being sold as new ?</li>
            <li>These are the dullest blades I have ever had on a new wahl clipper set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had for 3 years is sharper than this new one.  </li>
            <li>Brand new out of the box</li>
            <li>new one thinking it was faulty</li>
            <li>live in Angola, waited a lot of to but hands on it, i don&#x27;t wanna blow it away.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>5 stars besides being used when I was told it was new.</li>
            <li>I had one trimmer of this brand since 7 years ago, and I decided to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Oh and mine seemed brand new</li>
            <li>Still like new</li>
            <li>I live in New Zealand where the volagr output is 220/230v.</li>
            <li>I get a new set (I cut my hair every week...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product on a weekly basis and it still performing like it was brand new</li>
            <li>Still fairly new</li>
            <li>Never had an issue, it continues to live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li>We needed a new razor for my husband and my sons haircuts.</li>
            <li>I bought the new set for myself, but decided to give it to my son who was headed to college.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase this if you live or are going to use this product in Australia.</li>
            <li>I figured I could use some of that money I saved to buy my wife a new set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>We are not eligible for Amazon refund because the return time has expired and it is not in new condition.  </li>
            <li>Probably needs a new head or something.  </li>
            <li>I live in Europe but purchased this from US.</li>
            <li>I needed a new set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>Husband needed new clippers.</li>
            <li>This new Wahl clipper replaced a Wahl clipper which was given to us new in about 1961.  </li>
            <li>i have been using this for a around two months now and its good no major issues yet.its feels very heavy duty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and very sharp.</li>
            <li>The next pair I bought him was from Costco, they may be just a cheap, but I least they have easy returns.</li>
            <li>But as long as you keep the blades clean after use and free from moisture it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They cut cleanly without any pulling and the wide variety of guides makes a haircut a breeze.  </li>
            <li>It nicked up my scalp, left visible red marks, and left me in pain, particularly around my hairline at the top of my neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years ( and friends that want a free dew).</li>
            <li>14 more word required is stupid and not needed to  make a good review</li>
            <li>The clippers are a nice hefty size but they&#x27;re comfortable and I had no problem holding them and cutting with them.</li>
            <li>I was replacing my old cutters because they were missing a lot of hairs (no matter how many times I went over the section)</li>
            <li>After cutting my own hair just three times it had already paid for itself, and that&#x27;s assuming a fairly cheap haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is for a previously asked question from a reviewer, for people like me with close hair cuts, perfect, only con, the taper lever(the plastic lever that makes the blades go up and down very cheap and made of poor plastic material.</li>
            <li>I went into the market ready to spend much more than I did, knowing I&#x27;d be saving money in the long run, but multiple reviews from various other, more expensive razors pointed towards this one and after heavy use I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet compared to some other cheap ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>High quality, was surprised how well made and versatile.</li>
            <li>Very complete kit</li>
            <li>At the moment it makes a VERY LOUD noise, which would make it unbearable to use.</li>
            <li>I have been very surprised as how well these clippers have lasted.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a very old Wahl brand trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Very loud.</li>
            <li>Yet like a monster, this thing is very loud.</li>
            <li>The guard settings (1,2,3, etc.) seem a little longer than the ones my barber uses but other than that, it does a good job</li>
            <li>Overall pleased with the product - my only complaint is that it&#x27;s incredibly heavy and the plastic protector pieces could fit better</li>
            <li>chord is just long enough that you can get around easily without tripping over it.</li>
            <li>These puppies ARE THAT LOUD!</li>
            <li>This piece of machinery fits the bill, and my wife is a natural!</li>
            <li>Other than that, the are well worth the money!</li>
            <li>But the cheap guard really ruins the product.</li>
            <li>At first after I did the back</li>
            <li>It still works, but for the first 30 seconds it hummed quietly.</li>
            <li>Pretty solid clippers.</li>
            <li>Been satified so far!</li>
            <li>It was evidently the last one they had in stock</li>
            <li>I have had NO PROBLEMS with it so far!</li>
            <li>This is the second one of these I have owned since the first one finally stopped working after so much use!</li>
            <li>You get more attachements and combs than you&#x27;ll ever need, a cleaning brush and a small container of oil.</li>
            <li>Before returning it I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and WOW!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However did get hot after maybe only 10 minutes use.</li>
            <li>I just got this two days ago and gave myself my first hair cut last night.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to send them back &amp; will only be reimbursed $15 for shipping when it will likely cost more than double that much from Australia &amp; I should be compensated for the harm done to my ears!</li>
            <li>I wear my hair pretty short</li>
            <li>No more sitting around waiting in a haircut salon for a crummy cut or paying through the nose for a slightly better cut.</li>
            <li>Got this one as a replacement, and if it lasts as long, its well worth it.  </li>
            <li>pretty old&lt;br /&gt;these have a longer guard than where sold with clippers back then.</li>
            <li>Although this is a relatively cheap product, the quality of the materials was below average.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend starting out with a higher number attachment, like I did, just to test out the length.  </li>
            <li>We love the fact that with the Wahl Haircut Kit, it will pay for itself in just a few hair cuts!  </li>
            <li>so I finally got this product and gave him his first haircut at home.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used these, they only cut 50% of the hairs in one pass.</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty solid cut.</li>
            <li>Although i&#x27;ve never personally used a more expensive one, I don&#x27;t see a need for a better clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought better Wahl kits in the past.</li>
            <li>I am finally the barber I always wants to be!</li>
            <li>My stylist wife has owned a set of these clippers since we were married almost ten years ago.  </li>
            <li>but WOW!</li>
            <li>I wish the switch was more like a traditional on/off or some other design that was easier to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything you need to get a pretty standard fade gentleman style.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is truly a complete hair grooming kit!  </li>
            <li>It is too loud for me!</li>
            <li>5 stars simply because it works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I usually get buzz cuts and didn&#x27;t want to have to pay $10 a haircut any more.</li>
            <li>complaint, these have a very strong vibration which causes a loud noise when operating.  </li>
            <li>My first haircut was not very good, the 2nd much better.</li>
            <li>The attachments are a bit poor quality   Significant sound when switched on but its not as loud as others say</li>
            <li>I followed some online instructions to carefully lap the blades on a nice, flat honing stone, and then oiled and put them back together.  </li>
            <li>As many other reviews have stated already, it leaves a lot of hair behind even after many passes.  </li>
            <li>Whoever stated that it was so loud their neighbors were complaining, must live in a cardboard box.</li>
            <li>Cuts smooth again when slightly raised.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, sturdy, long lasting do it yourself kit for your monthly grooming needs</li>
            <li>the plastic parts do not fit too easily in the carrying case.</li>
            <li>i order this and in the first use it made a loud noise and sent it back, it did not work.</li>
            <li>Clippers do not get hot after several uses and is built like in the old days according to the user.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if they last as long as my previous ConAir clippers, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been trained in cutting hair and my boys looks pretty good when I&#x27;m finished with them.  </li>
            <li>This one is heavy and strong.</li>
            <li>have other Wahl products that are even more dissapointing, such as a nose hair trimmer that depending how you hold it will decide if it wants to work or not (been that way since day 1) and a smaller touch up trimmer that needs to be push started by hand by moving the blade to get it going.</li>
            <li>This has a very powerful motor and the clippers are very sharp.</li>
            <li>On a positive note its actually made in the USA.</li>
            <li>the positive, I tested it for a second.  </li>
            <li>also doesn&#x27;t seem to have come with a #2 length blade, so either I cut it pretty short or pretty long.</li>
            <li>Gives a good cut but not able to cut short enough</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;d be easier to just get a whole new set then to replace individual guards.  </li>
            <li>We had a cheap haircut kit that we bought at Walmart and it didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>If you loosen these guys, you can push the top blade back and tighten with less clearance for a zero cut.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I&#x27;ll cut the head, but I&#x27;m not super skilled -</li>
            <li>My current wahl is 30 years old and clip on guides are showing their age, so I&#x27;m ready for new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used these twice so far, but my experience with them have been positive.</li>
            <li>great bargain!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its not a professional machine, its written on the back of the machine only for home use, only regrets, its not dual voltage</li>
            <li>clippers are LOUD, yes, not extremely loud, but a loud enough &amp;#34;buzzzzzzzzzz&amp;#34; But that loud buzz makes me feel like the clippers have power to them and isn&#x27;t some cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>However, the guides are pretty adequate, and as long as you aren&#x27;t rough with them</li>
            <li>I have been to 2 or 3 large beauty supply stores and probably 29 different locations between Houston and LA.</li>
            <li>This Kit gives you such a large choice of attachments.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I literally cannot figure out what the difference is between certain models, but I selected these over the Home Pro model because with the Amazon coupon there was only a 4 dollar difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The accessories are a little cheap.</li>
            <li>one of my attachments cracked a little bit where you take it off, but it&#x27;s plastic and a really cheap set.</li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly the blades are real sharp</li>
            <li>As long as you clean and oil this, it will last for years.</li>
            <li>These clippers seem to be very well made, a little hard for me to turn on, but otherwise they do a good job.</li>
            <li>After buying this I will have to consider spending a little more next time.  </li>
            <li>I decided i wanted to spend a little more for quality to make them last this time.</li>
            <li>I have my wife come back and trim it out a little to make sure everything looks even and</li>
            <li>Okay, sometimes I need a little help with the back!</li>
            <li>Also, I could stand for it to have a little more power especially considering the fact that it works off of the wall outlet.</li>
            <li>Add a little oil occasionally and you won&#x27;t need to buy another for many years.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve given myself around ten pretty decent haircuts (that is to say, this thing has paid for itself ten times over).</li>
            <li>The on-off switch has way too much resistance, and it randomly turns off during use unless I hold the switch in a certain way which makes using it that much more cumbersome.</li>
            <li>Compared to the only other clippers I&#x27;ve used these are quite and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>23 y/o male who wanted to start cutting his own hair to control quality and try new cuts without paying every time i want try something new or just do a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>These were a huge upgrade and were a lot more efficient when it came to cutting.  </li>
            <li>This is a great kit for cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li>My wife has always done a great job cutting all our families hair.</li>
            <li>Great value for amatuer hair cutting.  </li>
            <li>Great Hair Cutting Kit..saves me lots of money.  </li>
            <li>this is a great kit, everything you need for cutting hair and trimming.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll start cutting hair on the side, lol.</li>
            <li>It works great, even though I am clueless about cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a great value and works for cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t follow any of the instructions that came with it but cutting my friend&#x27;s hair turned out great.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats this great mchine in terms of hair cutting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple times cutting my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I already owned a Wahl mustache trimmer and despite my horrific care of the product, it still functions great after many years.</li>
            <li>The clippers are slighlty heavy but the soft ergonomic grip is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, especially if you&#x27;re in the military.</li>
            <li>The case is kept closed by a plastic latch which has a cheap plastic strip hinge instead of a proper hinge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off let me clear the air on some confusion.</li>
            <li>I would have to run my old clippers over my hair over and over.  </li>
            <li>It is also a lot quieter than my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>Not as loud as some reviews indicate.  </li>
            <li>had a different make clipper with a ceramic blade, this cuts much better.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>So loud I stop use it</li>
            <li>These clippers are so loud that they are unusable.</li>
            <li>Had to finish the whole process to the same length.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Wahl for years</li>
            <li>B000FJ17N0 WAHL Professional 2 Hole Precision Clipper Blade (Model:1045-100)]].  </li>
            <li>so I used a pair of old clippers that we used to use on my families show cattle.  </li>
            <li>Ordering printer cartriges through Amazon is much easier and the same price and running around.</li>
            <li>Our old clippers were burning out so I bought another one from the store.</li>
            <li>The Unit seems robust, ergonomic and professional in terms of build quality.</li>
            <li>I might just have to buy another one of those...unless Wahl decided to decrease the product as a lot of companies tend to do nowadays thanks to Amazon&#x27;s neglection to inform consumers that the 5-star product might not be the same product in terms of materials and design.</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve had is the #1 guard wants to come off while using it.  </li>
            <li>It still works but is loud.</li>
            <li>My old wahl set</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an old set of clippers that started pulling hair.</li>
            <li>Seems to do the job so far.</li>
            <li>I like the variety of attachments to cut varying lengths of hair with complete ease.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kinda loud if noise is one of your pet-peeve.</li>
            <li>It cuts like professional hair clippers</li>
            <li>and I still use this kit frequently.</li>
            <li>This is my least favorite hair trimmer I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are much heavier than my last pair, and hopefully that equates to durability.</li>
            <li>but wow, it felt like I placed a massager on my head.  </li>
            <li>I could also tell it did not catch and pull the hair like my old set was doing.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot under long use, but works well.</li>
            <li>but it does get hot if you use it for too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking extremely loud.</li>
            <li>This kit comes with an instruction booklet that teaches you how to achieve a professional looking haircut.  </li>
            <li>I have been giving myself haircuts since I purchased it, and have used it frequently without issue.  </li>
            <li>Not some cheap, gimmicky clipper that rotates or goes cordless.</li>
            <li>Feels professional, just like the barber shop.  </li>
            <li>, it makes a loud</li>
            <li>All parts seem to be manufactured well, the handset does not get hot, the cord is quite long.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t keep the hair off the blades and oil it frequently, it will get loud and vibrate like a dildo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300 400 Color Complete Haircutting]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>young lady who did my hair for over 20 years is not doing my bald head</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Replaced my Oster clippers (10 yrs old) with these.</li>
            <li>Never had a Wahl before, so when I got rid of my old (carpy)</li>
            <li>and so far the clippers are doing well.</li>
            <li>i have been through a lot of cutters and there just are none that work like professional ones.  </li>
            <li>I knew the Wahl name from my old barber and from a pair of clippers my mother had as I grew up, so</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t a barbershop professional grade trimmer since that is NOT what they are.  </li>
            <li>his old one was litterally ripping his hair out.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers said it was unusually loud, but I didn&#x27;t notice any issues with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband and I both shave our heads and we wanted a sturdy model to replace our old plastic Wahl.  </li>
            <li>far as price is concerned</li>
            <li>The build quality is solid and like I mentioned before it has proven to be very durable even after extended usage.</li>
            <li>very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with the standard set of hair combs.</li>
            <li>my 2 year old son used to cry a lot while going out for hair cut...</li>
            <li>Well, These do work like the Pro Clippers of old.</li>
            <li>The whole kit comes with several extensions and &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my hair maybe 10-12 times so far with zero issues.</li>
            <li>I was greatly surprised at the quality of the unit.</li>
            <li>It is a professional level unit with attachments for everything.....</li>
            <li>Shopping early does not always pay.</li>
            <li>this product was extremely loud to a point where my family downstairs could hear the noise.</li>
            <li>it being loud when i sud just have had to plug and play with no complications.</li>
            <li>So far did not face any problem with it.</li>
            <li>The loud noise, and the vibrating take NOTHING away from this</li>
            <li>I have owned this set for what&#x27;s gotta be nearly 5 years now.</li>
            <li>I used it to cut my 21 month old son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This set of clippers has served me well, using them every two weeks for nearly 3 years.</li>
            <li>I have used them for near a year and have no complaints of signs of wear.  </li>
            <li>All in all, my hair looks like it was professionally done.  </li>
            <li>and my old Wahl was going out.  </li>
            <li>brother trims his hair with it frequently and it works</li>
            <li>Not as loud as the my old clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything else in the kit felt well made, and you really get everything you need to give someone a basic hair cut.</li>
            <li>It cuts just as well as the others and, naturally, the noise disappears as soon as it&#x27;s against your head.  </li>
            <li>took it for personal use and I was not expecting so much accessories in it.</li>
            <li>Lighter than my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li>Assume it will work as well as the old one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s professional one.</li>
            <li>Inflation is still going on, the old set was about $7.00.</li>
            <li>So far it has lasted two haircuts.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my 10 year old Wahl clippers with these.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit in order to cut my three year old son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>If use it for a long time, it will be hot.  </li>
            <li>I got this Wahl haircut kit to replace an old one that wasn&#x27;t working so well anymore.</li>
            <li>The clipper and combs cut evenly and professional looking.</li>
            <li>After that was done, I took off the combs and with the help of a mirror, used the clipper to trim the side angles of the back and a straight line across the bottom.</li>
            <li>Tried it this morning, soft trim experience.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>We have saved hundreds on haircuts so far.</li>
            <li>(The only piece I didn&#x27;t like was the ear peice that&#x27;s supposed to cut around the ears as I didn&#x27;t think it did much for my son.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is loud.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly loud either,</li>
            <li>The thickest (and highest numbered) attachment will leave the hair longer as you glide the unit along the scalp and the head should be divided up into three sections with the neckline and ear area as one section or swath, the mid head the second swath, encircling the middle of the skull, and the top area the third section.  </li>
            <li>WOW WOW...</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old clippers that stopped working</li>
            <li>I used a rechargeable Remington trimmer for a few years to trim my hair, this was a fantastic upgrade</li>
            <li>far as I&#x27;m concerned the Chrome Pro clippers work like a charm.  </li>
            <li>even my 5 year old didn&#x27;t seem to mind them buzzing around his ears.  </li>
            <li>They were so loud that you could probably hear them 2 houses away.  </li>
            <li>My wife used #3,4,5 to cut my hair twice and it looked professionally done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, works very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 3 trims so far on my husband &amp; son &amp; it&#x27;s met all our needs.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I bought these because the blades on my old ones seemed to be dulling</li>
            <li>It does not give me a very close shave when I want the hair on my head to be very short.</li>
            <li>Wow- bought this 3 years ago and forgot to leave a review.</li>
            <li>, I want well shaved completely and this one works well on me.</li>
            <li>When my old Conair died, which I&#x27;ve had for 20 years, I purchased another at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Complete dud</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just realized how much money these clippers have saved me and they definitely payed themselves off.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so quiet, and cut really well.  </li>
            <li>so I gave up and got out my old clippers to finish the job.....</li>
            <li>They are reliable, professional tools.</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;re in for a wild ride.</li>
            <li>It cuts completely, so there&#x27;s no need for repeated strokes.</li>
            <li>have an old (5yrs)</li>
            <li>My 21/2 year old son will not sit for a scissors hair cut</li>
            <li>As a final note, this razor can&#x27;t even get very close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t too loud, either.</li>
            <li>( he was a professional barber) and it is ancient but still works like a charm.</li>
            <li>They are not heavy to hold while using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It just simply works very well.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time last week and to my surprise, got exactly what I expected from a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>bit loud</li>
            <li>After I began using this clipper I noticed that it&#x27;s quite loud..</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s horribly loud, also alot of vibration.</li>
            <li>Yes they&#x27;re loud, but what clippers aren&#x27;t?</li>
            <li>B007ROCZVY Salon Sundry Professional Hair Salon Nylon Cape with Snap Closure - 50\\</li>
            <li>Its lighter than my old clippers and lot sharper</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell I haven&#x27;t been to my old barber.</li>
            <li>I had an old Wahl that I used for my husband and son.</li>
            <li>It was 34 years old -</li>
            <li>not too loud.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, they are heavy, sturdy and did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>It is much quieter than our last set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>I have used this once so far to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>The only criticism is the inclusion of a very flimsy drape.  </li>
            <li>they are really really loud.</li>
            <li>too loud.</li>
            <li>way to loud.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save money.</li>
            <li>I wish they were metal like the Oster Professional</li>
            <li>After the storm i used the old Wahl once.</li>
            <li>We bought this set to replace some of her professional clippers that have worn out.  </li>
            <li>The clipper is lighter than the old one and cuts well</li>
            <li>Replaced an old Conair unit with this one.</li>
            <li>totally worth of the money we have spent.</li>
            <li>Fantastic buy, I bought to replace my eight year old Remington as plastic pieces broke or missing.</li>
            <li>The cape that came with the kit is more like a garbage bag, and it only lasted a few haircuts before it broke.</li>
            <li>Only notable issue with was a misalignment with the blade head, which I noticed after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li>like:&lt;br /&gt;-it was fun cutting my own hair</li>
            <li>Love the kit and clippers but the included scissors broke after only a few hair cuts.</li>
            <li>There is a fair amount of vibration but not so much that I worry about cutting his ear off.  </li>
            <li>The case is big enough to easily fit all the pieces without having to worry about enough room to close it, but it&#x27;s still quite small for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>I was right, because it died completely after only the third time I used it.  </li>
            <li>This is where I noticed that the right side of my head is bald further back than it should be.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used three, the second shortest and the left and right behind-the-ear trimmers.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that is weird is the on/off switch seems like it could have been designed better but nothing significant to stop you from buying.</li>
            <li>Today, I bought the Wahl Color Pro because this clipper is now useless, and it is the same exact product, except cheaper and has a plastic finish and more colors instead!</li>
            <li>Much better than the trimmers I&#x27;ve bought in the past!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had so many hair clippers in the past and this one stacks up beyond belief!</li>
            <li>instructions are clear and easy to understand and follow, the results look professional, it takes less time than you would have to wait for your turn at the barbershop and pays for itself the second time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat though.  </li>
            <li>Pls do not buy wahl products in case you will not able to return it as me - its easy to throw out this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other brand clippers break on me within 2 years, so I feel like I&#x27;m getting my moneys worth on these so far.    </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the cheapnees feeling of the guards themselves, but they fit on the trimmer well and they do not need to be anything special so its not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I am giving this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s a very nice set and works well for its designed purpose, but if you plan on cutting poodle hair with it (like I did), you may want to rethink it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe it (especially step #6 where it tells you to use a guide with number one above than the one you used #step 3; I&#x27;d say try two to three numbers higher than in #step3 at least or better, just use a shearing scissor to trim the top/front of the head).</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I was done with both ears, I put the number six comb on the clipper (they change out instantly) and starting at the front of my hair, cut straight back at first as the hair fell off.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t rinse it with water, clean it out using the little brush.</li>
            <li>The green 0.5 guard would be very nice, but it has a little trouble staying attached to the clippers and makes a funny noise because it rattles a bit.  </li>
            <li>I have used them with the assistance of my girlfriend on three occasions to trim my back and sides of my hair, whilst keeping a long center region to be able to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also useful for trimming my beard as well as hair in other locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a buzz cut, so eventually I thought to myself that paying for a buzz cut is a waste of money since I&#x27;m a full time college student and don&#x27;t make much money because I only work part-time.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, powerful clippers with a selection of guards, scissors, combs and other accessories.</li>
            <li>Powerful and sharp.  </li>
            <li>I have thicker curly hair and this is powerful enough to cut right through it with out making there usual loud noise of Stop</li>
            <li>Figured I give Wahl a try to replace my 5 year old Remington since it did not seem it was cutting as good as new and blades</li>
            <li>The scissors and combs get the job done and although they are not top quality they are fine for home use.</li>
            <li>I needed to do several passes to get all the hair - which is pretty standard for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I wanted to start cutting my own hair and these have made it super simple.</li>
            <li>This product cuts decent enough but upon opening the box and turning it on i found out</li>
            <li>However, you have to go over the same spot 2-3 times to get a decent even cut with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty simple, so I only use one guard.</li>
            <li>I usually do a straight shave with no attachments, and after several passes using this product, barely any hair was removed.</li>
            <li>the operation is smooth, not loud, and the vibration is minimal.</li>
            <li>I had an el cheapo unit for about 5 years until I finally decided to get a decent unit.</li>
            <li>At first I was kind of nervous, but once I started cutting</li>
            <li>Mainly use for very short haircut, close to skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend you try the Wahl brand and more specifically, these clippers and for the price I am sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with Wahl in the past, but I will likely not buy from them again.</li>
            <li>This has a beefy feel to it compared to most other corded clippers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re serious about home hair cutting, I&#x27;d suggest you add a nice pair of professional grade scissors and a few nice combs to this kit as the included pair are rather cheap.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend, especially for bodygrooming.</li>
            <li>I hope that Amazon goes back to its regularly high level of quality control.    </li>
            <li>this is a really nice hair cutting machine...... especially for its price, its really cheap but it not only does the job but exceeds...  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is very solid and high quality.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t get this high of quality for this low of a price when I was</li>
            <li>This set came highly recommended on multiple sites.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are on a budget and need something that can definitely handle any job you can throw at it.</li>
            <li>This is my second kit as it is easier to by a new kit than to deal with the attachments and blades when they get old.</li>
            <li>and these clippers are still cutting my hair and everyone in da fam just as good as new...</li>
            <li>cuts right through my long hair without a need for a 2nd pass through.  </li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s greatly and it&#x27;s not as heavy as other models in the market, my only concern is that after 15 or 20 minutes of use on my first try it started making a loud noise, i hope this doesn&#x27;t give me trouble in the future.</li>
            <li>The last thing you do is use the barber shears and styling comb to even out any cow licks and clean up around the ears.</li>
            <li>the downside, it is a bit heavy, which isn&#x27;t a problem for a strong guy like me, but I could see how it might be for a smaller, weaker person.</li>
            <li>The clippers themselves are fine, guide combs are plenty sturdy, the smaller sizes are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li>huge waste of money!</li>
            <li>It comes with an assortment of attachments, even an illustration on cutting your own hair into a barber/salon type cut- which I will not try!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately for Wahl, they have made such a great product that I don&#x27;t need to upgrade for several years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it runs smoothly and feels like a robust piece of equipment that should perform well for years to come.</li>
            <li>my surprise  for the first time this trim offered absolutely no pull at all.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the sample oil bottle is leaky and messy and the cutter gets pretty hot after a while.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what is expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate the skin with sharp points, does not get as hot as my old buzzer.  </li>
            <li>so be careful on giving a stroke on your head, just use the gauge 8 first then 7, 6 ,5 up to your desired length of hair.</li>
            <li>so i buy this set, treat it like garbage, and in 2-4 years when its had enough, i get another one for the price of 1 normal haircut at the barber</li>
            <li>Some of the clipper attachments chatter because they don&#x27;t fit on tight enough.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment if it&#x27;s great at chopping down long thick hair,  however,  </li>
            <li>Went down to the scalp with no cutting or scratching.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl clippers are much heavier and of a higher standard quality the previous clippers I have bought.</li>
            <li>Something about these combs they are hard to grasp hair easily.</li>
            <li>This is a good little haircutter, but not amazing.</li>
            <li>However after about 6 months of using it pretty consistently it started to get dull and eventually stopped working.</li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t loose power at certain angles like the cheapies can.</li>
            <li>My wife refuses to use the new set until I pull them apart and sharpen the blades the same way.  </li>
            <li>the only reason I gave it two stars is because it arrived on time and in new condition</li>
            <li>We attempted our second cut with the new Wahl today and it was a disaster.  </li>
            <li>I figured the new one would be solid as a clipper</li>
            <li>however the user manual is not that extensive so that a new user can use it straightaway.</li>
            <li>If only I was great at cutting hair now...</li>
            <li>Cutting my own hair now really looks like I got it done somewhere</li>
            <li>(really the only big gripe for me)  </li>
            <li>I was going to return it and just continue using my old connair, which even though is ten years old</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a Christmas present &amp; from what I&#x27;m told, it makes my fiances various grooming needs much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li>These clippers look and feel much more expensive than they really are.  </li>
            <li>To be clear, I like a very simple haircut that can almost completely be done with a clipper, but it does involve gradual changes in length.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well, has all the cutting guide combs you would ever need and a nice plastic case to store everything in.</li>
            <li>If you couldn&#x27;t do metal at this price, at least use a more solid and quality plastic.</li>
            <li>We had a Wahl product in the past and were quite pleased with it as it was sturdy, reliable and it lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and had really no trouble learning to use it.</li>
            <li>I found the construction to be distinctly shoddier than the black plastic Wahl clippers that I purchased 15 years</li>
            <li>As the voltage there is about 10% less than in the US (100V vs 110V), I wanted a powerful clipper to start as I was going to lose about 10% in efficiency.  </li>
            <li>Got super rusty after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>unfortunately that&#x27;s about the only thing that&#x27;s good about them.</li>
            <li>Also Its very loud when next to your ears.</li>
            <li>only complaint is they vibrate pretty heavily when compared to my old cordless trimmer, HOWEVER, these are by far beefier and better made.  </li>
            <li>They never get bogged down by my thick hair, and its easy enough for my to use on my own head.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time the other night.  </li>
            <li>I told my friends as a joke that me and my roommate would be giving each other haircuts and everyone was interested to see how I&#x27;d look after the weekend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely a must-have item for guys or girls who are interested in the female or male variety.</li>
            <li>Anxious to keep practicing and getting better at cutting my own hair</li>
            <li>I just purchased this item and tried it for the first time the other day.  </li>
            <li>I will admit I cut it a little shorter than originally planed but not as short as it could of been.</li>
            <li>Its not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as sharp as the first day I got it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how appropriate this product would be if I was a professional hairdresser and expected to earn my living with it, but for DIY haircuts at home</li>
            <li>Clippers are very sharp and glide right through the hair.  </li>
            <li>Clippers are very sharp and glide right through the hair</li>
            <li>I bought these to save money on haircuts since I only ever get a buzz cut from SuperCuts and decided it was pointless to keep tossing $20 their way when I could do it myself just as easily.</li>
            <li>says it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to hold (the clippers, I mean).</li>
            <li>says it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to hold (the clippers, I mean).</li>
            <li>It was time I got new clippers as my old blades were starting to pull and the oil wasn&#x27;t doing enough for the blades.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work, the package is unharmed for this reason it seems to me that the product was broken before it was put into the package, so i would liketo make a claim about this and ask for the better way to resolve this problem, it&#x27;s so dificult to me to send back the item because i live in venezuela.</li>
            <li>it more than I had expected I had looked at the same thing in Walmart and got this for less money</li>
            <li>It was really not a bad set of clippers and if ONLY my furbaby would cooperate he would look less like an escapee from a mental hospital and more like a little prince!  </li>
            <li>Huge vibration and noise, blades not cutting the hair, very poor quality in general.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and contains a large number of clipper guide/ combs.</li>
            <li>The first 4 cuts were horrible, but now I know how to cut my hair as good as my previous barber. :)</li>
            <li>This one is less than half the price and works better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a clean cut, you have to keep going over the same spot a few times.</li>
            <li>The tough part is fading the top and sides, but it gets easier with practice.  </li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far, except it does run a little hot after awhile.</li>
            <li>When using it to shave the neckline, it pulls rather than cuts, sound like a dull blade.</li>
            <li>The scissors it comes with are dull and cheap</li>
            <li>trims great just like at the barber when i was an ugly lil tike.</li>
            <li>I generally just sport a buzzcut so paying $30 a month to a barber to buzz my hair with clippers doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the durability of a couple of the battery trimmers, but I do love how light and maneuverable they are.</li>
            <li>Get a ceramic-bladed set; these types of clippers tend to perform better on cutting in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently shaved my head and my 1 year old boy needed a haircut, so I decided \\&quot;what the hell\\&quot; and made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m recommending you buy these just to see how loud they actually are.  </li>
            <li>Wahl&#x27;s web site doesn&#x27;t provide much on specifications, but I found the Wahl global site that confirms the standard blade on this clipper cuts from 0.8mm to 2.5mm, though the blade number is different in this country:</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li>But was surprised to know that the product does not meet international standards.</li>
            <li>The quality is apparent in these clippers.</li>
            <li>but it still had the same loud noise.</li>
            <li>He has been professionally groomed several times but to reduce this expense I decided to take the job of grooming on myself.      </li>
            <li>It actually isn&#x27;t that loud at all.</li>
            <li>People in earlier reviews were saying that this was too loud of a product.</li>
            <li>I bought this wahl clipper to replace a ten year old \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; connair clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this unit one time thus far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra few dollars to get this kit instead of a cheaper one.</li>
            <li>Ultimately you need to take off all the guards and just cut directly with the metal</li>
            <li>The only thing that it needs for improvement would be having a clip that goes as far as the machines for shaving.</li>
            <li>So far that&#x27;s the only problem that i found.</li>
            <li>So the simple fix i had to place a piece of sponge between the metals and guess what it solved all my problems and the loud noise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I do very basic trimming work with it, but i&#x27;m surprised by the complaints about noise and vibration.</li>
            <li>We took it out again to cut my sons hair, and while doing the back of his hair near the neck these clippers cut him, never have I had clippers cut someone before like</li>
            <li>The only drawback was the loud rattling noise it made when I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old kit finally died so when I saw this was one of the highest rated ones on Amazon</li>
            <li>The only one that we have that comes close to being a well made clipper would be the old worn out 1960&#x27;s model year</li>
            <li>This replaced and old one of a different brand.</li>
            <li>Gave the same perfection as I get from a professional barber.</li>
            <li>the second time use...started making loud noise.  </li>
            <li>it was loud as a vibrator, and started to smoke, and almsot didn&#x27;t cut anything (and i have a japanese hair)</li>
            <li>My husband and 23 year old son had used the former for years.  </li>
            <li>have given only two haircuts so far</li>
            <li>I purchased these because my old 25 year-old clippers finally conked out.  </li>
            <li>They are solid, they feel like professional clippers.  </li>
            <li>This was a plus on price and quality, definitely recommend it whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it feels and cuts like a professional tool.</li>
            <li>I could barely even feel my hair being cut.</li>
            <li>Have a bunch of accessories that come with, but I&#x27;m a simple man and haven&#x27;t even bothered exploring them so far.  </li>
            <li>The package barely came today</li>
            <li>His old clippers finally bit the dust so after reading reviews, decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>I bought this unit to replace a Conair haircut kit that was starting to get old.  </li>
            <li>First haircut last night, worked as expected.</li>
            <li>You know it is most irritating</li>
            <li>Well, this set is not doing any better (not any worse either)  </li>
            <li>My wife (who cuts my hair) mentioned it was heavier than my previous cutters and vibrates a little more</li>
            <li>It cuts great, usually I have to go over my hair a few times to get it down</li>
            <li>They would start breaking down after a few uses and make more noise than a lawnmower.</li>
            <li>My first usage with this thing cut me 3 times because it&#x27;s incredibly sharp!</li>
            <li>Not too heavy but heavy enough to be substantial and prove itself a worthy and useful.  </li>
            <li>if you do purchase, there&#x27;s a few easy to follow videos with nice tips, especially when cutting kids&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>The clipper is bit more cheaply built than the last one with lighter weight plastic housing, a smaller slide switch rather than heavy duty rocker style switch, and the new power cord is a standard flat electric cord rather than the old heavy duty round cord.</li>
            <li>After spending $30 on haircuts here in New York, I decided it was time for me to try cutting my own hair.  </li>
            <li>It has an amazing array of attachments all stamped with measurements so as to make the set less confusing to use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only been a few nicks which drew blood and a couple of bald patch incidents, but hey..hair grows  quickly doesn&#x27;t it?  </li>
            <li>Bought the clipper for our new dog that has long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The razor has enough horsepower to make cuts in a single pass or two and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I first had the Conair HCT495 in black for about three years</li>
            <li>it lasted less then 10 minutes before getting hot shutting off and smoke started to come out.</li>
            <li>I have had this unit for two weeks now and have no complaints, it seems to be holding up better than other units I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the actual product works really well!</li>
            <li>Works much better than other units I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>Maybe because being new the blades are much sharper or maybe because I used all the guides I didn&#x27;t think I would use (left taper, tight taper, ear guide, eyebrow guide)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and should last a long, long</li>
            <li>These are sharp and work very well.</li>
            <li>A little heavy, but can deal with that for the better quality.</li>
            <li>The first unit I received had a loud buzzing noise and misaligned blades that produced an uneven haircut, so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I carefully followed the instructions for oiling the blade, but the new set jammed several times on the first use.  </li>
            <li>I have a beard trimmer that is more powerful than this shaver; it&#x27;s THAT bad.  </li>
            <li>I use the 3 setting for the back and sides and the 8 for the top, and then I let the top grow out for a few of months while cutting the back and sides with the 3 about monthly.</li>
            <li>Such a shame since my old one was fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as the old one that finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised that a product this well made could sell for such a low price and yet be made in the USA.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy things like stepping outside in public wait a few days after cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li>The current one is aligned correctly, though it still seems like the motor is on the cusp of being loud at some point in the future.  </li>
            <li>My son is only a year old and I like how quiet the clipper is.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is too many pieces and no great storage device in the box.</li>
            <li>Smooth, powerful cutting.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers complain about the poor quality of the guides, but they&#x27;re the same as those my ex-barber uses.  </li>
            <li>My hair is short and thin and most of the time I would get it cut just because over my ears.  </li>
            <li>My older cutter would get jammed up every so often so I invested in these.  </li>
            <li>This set has poor quality clip attachments, the #1 attachments does not even snap in any more and it has only been 2 months of use (1-2 a week).      </li>
            <li>This thing is heavy, powerful and feels built to last.  </li>
            <li>This is a good basic hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li>After reading a few reviews I found that as long as the clippers are oiled then it should work well; this has been true for the two times that I have used it.</li>
            <li>These work very well, come with good instructions are are mostly idiot proof.  </li>
            <li>I usually buzz my hair down to about 1/4 of an inch and, with these clippers, I was to able to get the job done evenly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>The other items in the kit are pretty standard - see comment above about shaving my head.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it i messed up a little  </li>
            <li>With a little bit of oil (included) doing my first haircut was no problem for the blade.  </li>
            <li>I was close to returning them but thought I would do a little searching on Google first.</li>
            <li>My husband was a little reluctant at first but sat in the chair.  </li>
            <li>Its a heavy duty well made set, with all the attachments you could need.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li>it cut right through my hair not much vibration and it half as loud as this thing was.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried about the reviews saying the combs were weak and fell off easy.  </li>
            <li>Happy cutting everyone!</li>
            <li>This one works amazing and comes with all the different parts you would need including a small brush to wipe it off and a small tube of oil</li>
            <li>Great value to have in your hair cutting tool kit!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Loved that it has a very practical case so that even the sloppiest person (the other person using this) puts it all back in the case!!!</li>
            <li>kit comes with a very small amount of oil, but these won&#x27;t last long if you don&#x27;t keep the blade oiled, so better get some extra blade</li>
            <li>We let her play and test out different things until it was apparent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a whole lot better doing it this way than cutting too short</li>
            <li>Although it comes with lots of peripherals and is powerful and sturdy, this product does not cut as close as my past clippers.</li>
            <li>After a year of heavy use the machine still works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It broke on the first use, but the clippers and attachments more than made up for that minor disappointment.</li>
            <li>This weighty trimmer feels far more expensive than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this one mows thru it easy .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started cutting my own hair to save a little more cash in an effort to pay back my student loans a little quicker.</li>
            <li>Cheaper hair cutters also become dull rather quickly which causes them to pull hair.</li>
            <li>the only thing i would point out is do not loose the oil and the brush.</li>
            <li>I suggest lubricating every other or after a day of heavy use by lightly oiling and then allowing blades to move back and forth after cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had to be careful when breaking in a new set of clippers to not cut my ears,</li>
            <li>Not much to say about this new Wahl cutter.</li>
            <li>But if you keep them dry or dry them off right after you use them they will last a long time!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>yeah, there&#x27;s a mess to clean up afterward, but these things don&#x27;t get bogged down, cut consistently, and don&#x27;t pull people&#x27;s hari out.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m slightly less deaf and much happier as result.  </li>
            <li>It does the job in half the time, gets very close, plugs in, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging.  </li>
            <li>the whole kit costs less than a haircut.</li>
            <li>But now finding myself on a fixed income and deciding to wear my hair short for however long the mood strikes</li>
            <li>I wanted the least expensive, make brand clippers available that were adjustable, but could cut to bald (.000&amp;#34;) or (.0000&amp;#34;), as per multiple models advertised at aSilly&#x27;s beat supply.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this machine from the first time I push ON it really not easy to handle</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even more unfortunate is that I don&#x27;t currently have a three-way mirror and poor lighting in my bathroom, requiring many passes on the back of my head to get it even.</li>
            <li>THE TRIMMER ALLOWS YOU TO TRIM THE NECK AND SIDE-BURN AREAS VERY CLOSELY; THIS ONE ONLY CUTS DOWN TO 1/32 INCH OR SO.</li>
            <li>I am a single mother of a 6yr old boy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts hair, has a few snags, does not work on facial hair too well, and is much larger than what I had first expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am VERY DISAPPOINTED because I bought this item because of the fact that it is one of the best</li>
            <li>the clippers themselves seem to be  very durable and built to last years and years, and i dont think you should expect any less.</li>
            <li>My young adult son asked me to order these after the wife used his previous one as he refused to take them back for reason you can guess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seemingly nice carry case is useless as everything goes in loose.</li>
            <li>They are very smooth when cutting, and not that loud.  </li>
            <li>Had to buy this new Wahl cutter due to Hurricane Sandy.</li>
            <li>works very well cutting my husband and sons hair it a lil lounder than i thought but that was fine by me.</li>
            <li>Other than that, you have absolutely every single blade type you could ever dream of in this case.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased about that.</li>
            <li> Also, it sometimes gets incredibly noisy and shakes, even when the clipper head is oiled and completely free of hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Wahl Chrome Pro 24 piece haircut kit and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> but I am very pleased with the way they worked and if they hold up as well as my friends have, I should have them for years to come.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this kit.</li>
            <li> - I am very pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of these clippers.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, however it would have been better if it came with a cleaning brush, a tool to change the blades and the oil required to use on the product.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, cuts very smooth.</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with them and all the accessories that come with them</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve let my wife cut my hair with this and its nice and gets a good cut</li>
            <li> Nice clippers for a good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to trash a product for what is probably my own mistake, so I&#x27;m giving it 3/5 stars.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well and comes with a good selection of attachments and a nice carrying case.  </li>
            <li> We tried out both clippers right away to see if they worked, and they both work perfectly!</li>
            <li> Shipping came right on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve got a nice weight to them and are very easy to use for beginners, while more experienced family has also expressed their surprise in how good they are.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in perfect conditions and very fast.</li>
            <li> great for clean shaving and shaving your head!</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair (buzz cuts) and this cuts beautifully and easily.  </li>
            <li> The weight of the Wahl threw me off at first, but after using them it felt perfect.</li>
            <li> way better than the Con-air thing I was using!</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, the value is outstanding!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Anyway, excellent purchase which paid for itself after the first cut.</li>
            <li> With the help of my wife, I just did my first cut myself and I am very happy with this unit.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome, does exactly as described</li>
            <li> Without the guide I was able to trim up around my ears and side burns, and then I was done!</li>
            <li> I love these clippers!</li>
            <li> Cuts well and included more attachments then I will ever use!  </li>
            <li> They will more than pay for themselves in just two haircuts and there was no waiting for a hair cut in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> It is impressive how much of a higher quality cut this unit provides.</li>
            <li> i didn know it came with clippers and blade oil and everything, you cant find anything better than that for the price!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to my barber if I had one any more!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Wahl clippers over 25 years ago and they are still working flawlessly (though I had to add some electrical tape to the cord after years of overflexing).  </li>
            <li> This one is even better!</li>
            <li> I love these clippers!</li>
            <li> Have used it for beard trimming and hair cuts and it couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>

            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The clippers work fantastic and cut my hair great.  </li>
            <li> If you demand an amazing haircut</li>

            <li> The quality seems great, and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap by any means.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have had these clippers for 4 years now and they still work amazingly.</li>
            <li> would an amazing product if the plastic guards kept their shape.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I got nothing to say except that it is amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>

            <li> I would recommend this product anybody looking for cheap clippers with great quality.</li>
            <li> everything about this Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit is amazing.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> These are an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Amazing at home hair-cutting set.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; plastic finish on the handle of these clippers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like the starter kit for guys&#x27; hair grooming needs.</li>
            <li> As for the cape, it is nice to have one so that you won&#x27;t get hair all over you.</li>
            <li> Comes with a comb and a scissor which is handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice kit and it cuts hair nicely, but it just doesn&#x27;t get around the edges well.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> After my roommate banned me from using his Remmington, I had to get my own</li>
            <li> So the shortest guard at 3mm kind of melted away.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter, and she was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for two years to do all my own hair cuts.  </li>
            <li> I learned to cut my own hair with this thing.</li>
            <li> It is really handy, even u have no experince, u can do it as well as a barber does.   </li>
            <li> Cuts really well and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t move on its own.</li>
            <li> The price was nice and they are made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> Nice set of clippers.</li>
            <li> nice balance, lots of accessories come with it.  </li>
            <li> My grandson admired the smoothness of the unit and desired one of his own.</li>
            <li> Which is nice, but doesn&#x27;t solve my problem.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my own fault, but this product doesn&#x27;t work in EU.</li>
            <li> Nice and quite.  </li>
            <li> I use it to trim my beard and it cut cleanly nice blade.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s nice to know that I have all these extras just in case...</li>
            <li> Works nicely.</li>
            <li> On to YouTube I went and searched how to cut your own hair using a clipper.</li>
            <li> While I was away in college, I couldn&#x27;t find a nice barbershop in any form around me.</li>
            <li> I am expecting many years of good use.</li>
            <li> so I bought this set of clippers to cut my own hair</li>
            <li> kit is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an Andis Deluxe set I have had for years.  </li>
            <li> I asked him how he liked it</li>
            <li> I just cut my own hair a couple of days ago.</li>
            <li> the clippers them selfs are really nice</li>
            <li> I was searching for hair clippers because I wanted to learn to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was NERVOUS because I&#x27;d never cut my own hair before.</li>
            <li> I bought these because a couple of friends in college liked the Wahl brand.</li>
            <li> have to be honest, however.</li>
            <li> Cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> And keep your hair cut and beard and eye brows done nice.</li>
            <li> The selection of guards that comes with this is nice.</li>
            <li> I use them once a week to cut my own hair</li>
            <li> Yeah, just a nice piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is this trimmer has a power adjustment screw which allows you to increase the power in the situation that your home outlets supply lower voltage than they should.</li>
            <li> Also liked the amount of accessories that came with it.</li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair like I do you are already saying yourself 15-20 dollars on each haircut.</li>
            <li> All of it comes in its own storage case which is durable and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nicely it&#x27;s everything in one product.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, has good weight, not like a cheap plastic crappy thing!</li>
            <li> These clippers have already paid for themselves after using them to cut my own hair a couple times.  </li>
            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who does hair trimming at home and needs a handy kit to help with the project.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice product does what it says, would buy again.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of cheaper plastic and doesn&#x27;t have a nice weight.</li>
            <li> These clippers allow me to cut my own hair and of any family and friends I might decide to do it for.</li>
            <li> They come with a nice variety of guides, scissors and a case.  </li>
            <li> I did manage to come up with one of my own.</li>
            <li> I do not claim to be a hair stylist, I am just a guy that cuts his own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose my son liked it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m rating that as a good thing as it probably means they are mostly metal and not plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built nicely</li>
            <li> and I just works nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s astounding.</li>
            <li> So he suggested to watch some video&#x27;s on youtube on how to cut your own hair.  </li>
            <li> NEVER EVER CUT YOUR OWN HAIR.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&#x60;s, thats very complet and sale price.</li>
            <li> Both my boys use this and cut their own hair because they both like it</li>
            <li> it seems to work well, and because it is made in the USA and it works dad loved it for xmas, Everyone buy more Made in the USA stuff</li>
            <li> this is a nice set tools</li>
            <li> Use on my own head and beard once a week.</li>
            <li> My wife, who was doing my hair more recently, absolutely loved the cut and said she&#x27;s retired fromcutting</li>

            <li> Good ol cheap buzz cut.</li>
            <li> I use them mostly just to cut my own hair</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with these</li>
            <li> but so far it has been working perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Ive used these clippers about 20 times and so far, so GREAT!</li>
            <li> WOW for $25, this is the best clipper you can buy.  </li>
            <li> Finally able to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Immediately noticed the blades operate  more effectively against my scalp versus the battery operated clipper I had before.</li>
            <li> would have liked more storage room in the case so it&#x27;s not all cluttered and just thrown in there.</li>
            <li> far, it&#x27;s perfect for what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I set the shop-vac by the bathroom door and just sucked up the hair and took a shower and felt great like a fresh barber shop haircut.</li>
            <li> Included many attachments that come in a nice, compact case.</li>
            <li> I wound up watching some youtube videos and using them to give myself my own haircut (fade on sides, buzzed on top).</li>
            <li> This thing looks good and it is precise.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy to get these professional clippers for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I am actually able to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> So far, these have been excellent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying clippers since the 80&#x27;s, and this by far is the best set I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is good for what it is.. a cheap trimmer.</li>
            <li> Maybe more if you go somewhere really nice.</li>
            <li> It works better than my dying pair and it looks nice, BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK</li>
            <li> Did a great job even though she was a nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof, but I still have both my ears and a nice haircut.</li>
            <li> Very fine hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Also, with all of the accessories, i could easily find the guard for my type/length of hair!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> , you gotta get a wahl, works easy and no hassle!</li>
            <li> Still going strong!</li>
            <li> Ok well this definatly is a good easy to use trimmer,  very smooth to cut woth and has all the guards u could think of.</li>
            <li> I love the new clipper and attachments, and I am confident it will be give me excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> If you are able to cut your hair near a wall outlet (which I don&#x27;t see why you shouldn&#x27;t) than this is your best bet.  </li>
            <li> Although, I do recommend going to a professional every now and then to make sure you&#x27;re looking your best.</li>
            <li> It gave me a good clean cut and wasn&#x27;t, in my opinion, too noisy.  </li>

            <li> Great haircutting set with many useful attachments.  </li>

            <li> Great product that does exactly what you would want it</li>
            <li> They got the job done perfectly and neatly, I feel like an actual barber being able to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> This worked great for a buzz cut and paid for itself with the first cut at home instead of a salon.</li>
            <li> I will be happy giving myself free clean cuts with this.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, glides through the hair, gives a quick and great cut.  </li>

            <li> Cuts hair, doesn&#x27;t get too warm, and cleans up easily.</li>

            <li> Nicely balanced and easy to use.</li>
            <li> also it has a nice weight and it is easy to operate.</li>
            <li> My wife cut my hair and did a very nice job for her first hair cut.  </li>
            <li> Remember to oil it though, or better, just read the instructions and you will be fine!</li>
            <li> Nice and powerful clipper, lots of combs, pretty fair instructions, good case.</li>
            <li> The included apron is marginally effective, I have fine hair</li>
            <li> The different-sized blade guards work just fine, and I liked how it it comes with a manual showing how to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular but works fine.</li>
            <li> and it is just as good as the first haircut I did months ago!</li>
            <li> It done a wonderful job on my dog,, very quiet and easy to use and easy to clean, great storage box..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very straight forward and comes with nice directions to get you started (although I suggest you watch lots of YouTube videos!).  </li>
            <li> However, since I cut my own hair, I have a problem with the chrome finish reflecting too much light.</li>
            <li> So I bought these clippers for him, pointed him to a youtube video - and he is more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Pro has many clipper heads, all numbered</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for more than 6 months</li>
            <li> This is a good product: useful and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I cut most of my hair, then girlfriend helped trim around the ears/back of neck.    </li>
            <li> These cut much better.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Buy it and stop paying top dollar for a haircut.</li>
            <li> A great haircutting tool at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It can cut ok, but the noise is unbeareble</li>
            <li> but i wish I would have ordered one with more attachements so that i can have more options for hair lengths .</li>
            <li> that was a lovely clipper.  </li>
            <li> but This WAHL clipper is so much better.</li>
            <li> but they will also probably cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li> We have not been pleased until now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> It is great, very convenient to use .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking to buy one more set at 220V for my parents.</li>
            <li> Combined with a YouTube instructional video I found, I am saving us money every month that has more than paid for this kit.</li>
            <li> The Wahl cutter is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Most males do not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any more noisy than the ones they use in the hair salons.</li>
            <li> One more cut and it will have paid for itself.     </li>
            <li> For the price there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved A LOT of cash since I quit going to the barber.  :-)</li>
            <li> thing about this Whal is that I find myself wanting to cut my hair more often.</li>
            <li> We used safety scissors in 1st grade that cut my hair better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was satisfied but not blown away.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be a pro!  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting better every time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you had some skill you could shave a jesus piece in your hair.</li>
            <li> Not the top of the line in the clipper world</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my beard.  </li>
            <li> It also cuts better than a cordless.    </li>
            <li> I was able to readjust with a screwdriver, but no problems since.</li>
            <li> , it works better but still</li>
            <li> Seller needs better QC.</li>
            <li> Has many attachments some of which you may never used</li>
            <li> I might be able to tighten the adjustment switch</li>
            <li> And had that for about 2 years and the bottom blade wasn&#x27;t touching the top blade anymore when set at the closes setting.</li>
            <li> I used it many times on myself</li>
            <li> but I have no idea if it would be any better.</li>
            <li> These clippers are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl clippers for 12 years to shave my head and have always been pleased with them...until this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once to date, but they behaved beautifully!</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it&#x27;s perfect for beard trims and haircuts, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a daily close-shave razor.</li>
            <li> I like all of the attachments that it came with even though I probably won&#x27;t use most of them.  </li>
            <li> One of the best cost-cutting measures I&#x27;ve taken next to a rice cooker.</li>
            <li> It comes with more attachments then I&#x27;ll ever use and it seems to be built well</li>
            <li> Hair cutters plugged into a wall are SO MUCH BETTER than the wireless ones.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m the one who uses them to cut his hair, we both love them.</li>
            <li> The many attachments are plentiful and gives you options.</li>
            <li> I love this kit</li>
            <li> I love this product and so does my son, the person I bought it for.</li>
            <li> and I am now with short hair and it looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> The Wahl is sturdy and really cuts GREAT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also cut many of my friends&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> :) There are gentler ones for beard trimming and for that I recommend a ConAir model.</li>
            <li> It comes with more attachments than you know what to do with.</li>
            <li> The buzzers are great and they work very well  </li>
            <li> Top of the line performance once you get used to the difference.</li>
            <li> Have given 30+ buzz cuts over the last year and still doing great!</li>
            <li> Be sure to oil as directed.  </li>
            <li> More attachments with it than I think anyone would ever need.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut much more efficiently</li>
            <li> - I think I may get more &#x27;customers&#x27; when family comes to town.</li>
            <li> Nicely constructed ,doesn&#x27;t feel cheap .</li>
            <li> You may also adjust the adjustment lever for more tension.</li>
            <li> This clipper set did an fantastic job!</li>
            <li> If you do, you won&#x27;t be satisfied with this product (unless you&#x27;re just that skilled).</li>
            <li> I would say I&#x27;ve given myself 25 haircuts pronanly more.</li>
            <li> Love it always go with a wahl</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Comes with more attachments than I need, but glad to know I am covered.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well they would work for anything fancier, but for a buzz cut, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better for the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This comes with absolutely everything that you will need to give some great haircuts.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and we both love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be on the safe side</li>
            <li> Quality is fantastic for the price!</li>
            <li> - so many pirces</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great deal.</li>
            <li> What more do you want?</li>
            <li> I am sure I won&#x27;t be buying another pair for 10 more years.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, they are really durable and you can feel the quality in them while using them.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> sure how they&#x27;ll stand up to time, but based on everyone&#x27;s reviewing it&#x27;s looking like it.</li>
            <li> Maybe they cleaned it well :)</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> those who said this thing jams up all the time, you must have hair made of steel because I&#x27;m fairly sure the motor in this thing could start my diesel truck.</li>
            <li> The kit has just about everything you could imagine; however, the trimmer itself is just okay.</li>
            <li> When this started to give out, we decided to invest some more for a better unit.  </li>
            <li> Maybe too many attachments.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding kit.</li>
            <li> Be sure to &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; the cutter each time BEFORE use.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t able to keep their shape and spread apart.</li>
            <li> You get many attachments</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have to spend $100 for some pro ones that cuts way better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much time to use this kit, but I believe it is a great value.  </li>
            <li> and it was ok, then I moved and did not take it with me</li>
            <li> As I said in the title the trimmer itself is ok.</li>
            <li> and I really love it</li>
            <li> quality of this clipper set is top notch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> after many uses it still cuts like day one.</li>
            <li> than that, the product is worth its price and feels really good to use.</li>
            <li> Im glad I got this</li>
            <li> , I am satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> and it is listed as the top of the list of hair clippers.</li>
            <li> I worked in a beauty shop, and I know how they are supposed to run, and today most don&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li> Like I said, its ok, it will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a four star for these Wahl hair clippers, I love Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li> And I love the weight, grip and ease of these trimmers.</li>
            <li> More attachments, so I can keep on giving myself haircuts.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Specifically chose the corded as we didn&#x27;t want one more charger cluttering up the counter.  </li>
            <li> After 2 haircuts it&#x27;s already more than paid for itself.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this clipper kit for a Christmas gift on Oct 26.&lt;br /&gt;It looked great, several attachments, good product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE haircutters.  </li>
            <li> to, what more can I ask for?  </li>
            <li> Has saved me more money</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I had the somewhat cheaper Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro clippers before and was quite pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> Sure beats the price at the stores.</li>
            <li> Most clippers will buzz, get over it.</li>
            <li> they probably do a better job, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> If u do buy id suggest getting better made guides.</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t think you can do any better.  </li>
            <li> The attachments gave no problems and there are many of them.</li>
            <li> I have a short haircut and this does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping really great price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the clippers on the top of my head, I used the scissors provided.  </li>
            <li> To blend in the sides with the top, I just switched the lever on the clippers from up(closest cut) to down(longer cut).  </li>
            <li> I am a barber and i am satisfied with the clipper.</li>
            <li> I recommend the clipper since it cuts smoothly and evenly!</li>
            <li> Wish the had more sizes for shorter trimming.</li>
            <li> sure it comes with lots of attachments</li>
            <li> love it love it</li>
            <li> love it love</li>
            <li> it love it</li>
            <li> The product worked perfectly well and meets all my domestic purposes.</li>
            <li> this!i didn&#x27;t able to use it..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Many accessories comes with the kit.</li>
            <li> The clippers worked well, felt nice and sturdy, and held the guide securely.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they love it.</li>
            <li> These more then pay for themselves.  </li>
            <li> Look forward to using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Could be better.</li>
            <li> I wish it cut better then again</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t paid top dollar for these clippers.</li>
            <li> A lot better than the ones i get from walmart or tj maxx.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions in the booklet and went with a 1 at lower part of head, then a 2 to blend it, then a 3 on the top.</li>
            <li> Lovely product use it for everything to trimming my beard to touching up between hair cuts</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied and had 0 problems.  </li>
            <li> ok soooo.</li>
            <li> i love this thing</li>
            <li> and im glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> but when the kids trot off to University you need more.  </li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with</li>
            <li> Good job Wahl on another great product at a low price!</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl clippers for many years.</li>
            <li> I love my Wahl Haircut kit.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> The idea of a conplete kit makes it even better..</li>
            <li> So this 24 piece somes with way more than I need</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> More on that in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You use the arch or rocking technique as you move the clipper up the side of the head, pulling the clipper away from the top as you finish your move.</li>
            <li> The Chrome Pro has a taper lever on the side and this adds a greater degree of adjustment as you cut.</li>
            <li> HA :)</li>
            <li> Side lever that adjusts length moves the top part around at an angle.</li>
            <li> Plan on spending more like 3x this price, as this cutter just can&#x27;t do it well.  </li>
            <li> A better blade</li>
            <li> I love these for the price.  </li>
            <li> it had more attachments for shorter hair though</li>
            <li> love the clippers &amp; all the accessories.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But again what you are paying for here is a really good hair clipper which would be well worth the price without all the extras.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li> But once you get the hang of it people won&#x27;t be able to tell if you did it yourself or paid for it.</li>
            <li> And the accessories, soooo many accessories.</li>
            <li> You should spend your money on a better quality clipper.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but really seems like a great deal</li>
            <li> I really love these clippers for doing men hair.</li>
            <li> Its already paid for itself of course and my wife is actually getting real good at using it!</li>
            <li> :) There are gentler ones for beard trimming and for that I recommend a ConAir model.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought them.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Better buy.</li>
            <li> more than paid for this clipper.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this product for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> Good machine and worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S make sure you buy this from the seller that I bought it from, they will take care of you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll end up purchasing a better set of shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Included accessories appropriate</li>
            <li> Love the product and it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we got it.</li>
            <li> We love this and are already saving money by&lt;br /</li>
            <li> If the weight of the clippers were more evenly disbursed, they would be easier to handle for at-home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One more time Thank you and see you</li>
            <li> I love this clippers</li>
            <li> but I love my girlfriend the most.lol..</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I did the math and after owning these clippers for two years now, I have been able to save $960 not including what I tip out to the barbers.</li>
            <li> I use it all and my kids love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed that a set of clippers that is frankly quite inexpensive was actually serviceable.  </li>
            <li> After getting this I was able stop going to the barbershop, and save  that 10 bucks or so month..  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Made in USA...even better.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, it&#x27;s really about an 18 piece set...</li>
            <li> Check here for more videos and photos that I have posted http://goo.gl/xuUikP .  </li>
            <li> She is pleased with them</li>
            <li> and so I am pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> Way more attachments than I will ever need.</li>
            <li> They both have very different hair types, it this cut their hair great!  </li>
            <li> Comes with more attachments than I will ever use.  </li>
            <li> I have been buzzing my husband&#x27;s hair for many years.  </li>
            <li> My husband attempted to adjust it (each time getting one more swipe in before it died), and then to disassemble and repair it, without luck.  </li>
            <li> because it was mostly instructing on how to cut hair.  </li>
            <li> The chrome addition came so many extras.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> and hopefully I&#x27;ll get more skills with time.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Make sure to oil the blades before each use to lengthen the blade&#x27;s life for sure.</li>
            <li> This should cost more than it does at the moment!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> im done just to make sure...</li>
            <li> (Heart of Illinois on the Rock River) Works Fantastic!</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s getting better and understanding how to approach it better.  </li>
            <li> It need more comb number</li>
            <li> but I love the guards and case</li>
            <li> Well made and much better</li>
            <li> love buying stuff on amazon since i m prime member</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It builds up so much static electricity that it literally attracts the hair to you ON BOTH SIDES and covers you with the clippings.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair that were cordless, much better.</li>
            <li> It is great thank you sooo much</li>
            <li> love it, love it.</li>
            <li> but, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving money and getting a better cut than I was often getting at the budget hair salons.</li>
            <li> It came with a storage case and many accessories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li> I cut my hair using the &amp;#34;6 on the side, and #7 on top.</li>
            <li> It came out better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Havent paid for a haircut since i got this, one of my better amazon investments.</li>
            <li> but i wish the box was more organized to hold them</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> I love the case.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he has been more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li> but i just love how this one is so much cheaper and great quality...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love his hair at 1/8 and this does the job.</li>
            <li> Brought this almost 5 months back, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This haircut kit has paid for itself more than 20 times.</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> and they work outstanding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than my pair of conair trimmers.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to take a chance and try it.  </li>
            <li> great razor and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> More pieces than what I need.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the purchase and package</li>
            <li> yet the reviewer said these were better.</li>
            <li> The trimmer missed many areas.  </li>
            <li> Wahl makes it better.  </li>
            <li> and I am fairly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thank you outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Better than my cordless Conair.  </li>
            <li> It cuts faster and more efficiently.</li>
            <li> Works very well, from a great and reliable brand.  </li>
            <li> Better off to leave out of kit than create the feel of junk.  </li>
            <li> These are one of the best purchases I have made recently.</li>
            <li> but for the price, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this model so when Amazon had one of their awesome daily deals on Wahl</li>
            <li> said he enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> good quality, under $30, and for the clippers to not hurt if I&#x27;m trying to cut my own hair fast.</li>
            <li> The absolute best price was right here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well, all the right attachments.</li>
            <li> Looking for a replacement, I found this gem and chose it because it got good reviews and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and very well made.  </li>
            <li> Powerful, runs clean and produces great results.</li>
            <li> very powerful!</li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> I used a #1 comb and raised it, and it came out pretty good; a nice and smooth looking cut.</li>
            <li> It came with a full set of attachments and the kit was reasonably priced; so it qualifies as a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Clean nice cut,</li>
            <li> Pros: complete set, strong built, good price, good for home use, reliable    </li>

            <li> We knew the first time we used them that they were good.</li>
            <li> a good clipper avid this one.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> It works pretty good,  but what do I know I&#x27;m just using it as a tattoo gun.</li>

            <li> (ra-ma-da-ma-dama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved using these clippers so much that I couldn&#x27;t stop!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten to a point where people ask me where I get my haircuts because I do a pretty good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This haircut kit was one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Loved it from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I gave myself my own hair cut using the various clips and did a very nice fade that friends were very complimentary about, never cut my own hair before</li>
            <li> I use these once a week at least and they work great very good design can cut all lengths of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> Great improvement with the new attachments which are stronger and not flimsy.</li>
            <li> Great clippers even came with the new .5 guard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it does what it says and it comes at a great price, though I can&#x27;t say I wouldn&#x27;t prefer a new Conair if I had to make the purchase over again.</li>
            <li> my son hates having his hair cut and thought if I could do it quickly with clippers it would be nice for both of us.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is more compact, runs quieter and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> i really love the case, fits everything and easy to store once not in use</li>
            <li> On my end, it was a reasonable price for a good product :)</li>
            <li> This model is probably as good as or better than the clippers you get at a barber, and it really zips through my rapidly fading hair.</li>
            <li> So far I have cut my better halfs hair my grandson&#x27;s my brother in law&#x27;s couple times each and still running great</li>
            <li> Out of the box the clippers look nice and feel light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The system makes it very easy to use and detailed instructions make the process easy to understand.  </li>
            <li> but that is because I am very special about my hair.  </li>
            <li> Great set of clippers thus far!</li>
            <li> These clippers have worked great for me so far!</li>
            <li> (If you want it perfectly even, use the buzzer with a guide) I&#x27;ve found that the slightly uneven look is much more attractive than just using a buzz guide and doing the whole thing that way.</li>
            <li> what a clean job!</li>
            <li> This thing is very user friendly and great for beginners.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most powerful one and it comes with a very Nice case and comes with everything I need to do my own hair at home.</li>
            <li> Super easy to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> The motor is nice and smooth, the clippers cut cleanly, and all the attachments you could ask for are included.</li>
            <li> Very good american product.</li>
            <li> I have only used it one time as of now and I can say its very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once, or to be more accurate, my wife has used it one me once.</li>
            <li> Great value, and no problem after nearly 2 years....</li>
            <li> It has worked great so far.</li>
            <li> So far it works great.</li>
            <li> Plus tax free:)</li>
            <li> I got this to use as a beard trimmer and it works great so far.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for old Conair model</li>
            <li> It came with a cheap plastic smock that I just use to cover my sink and counter top to catch the hair.</li>
            <li> So smooth and with many attachments.</li>
            <li> Paying $25 a cut twice a month was becoming OBNOXIOUS.</li>
            <li> I had the Ultra adjustable by Andis , which was great, so now I will dispose of this one and try to find a blade for the old one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the power converter, I&#x27;ve used two different ones, from 220 to 110, but the clipper was making an incredible noise and it was shaking way too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The side clips are great and give a professional look.</li>
            <li> Whats nice about is, its got alot of clips and comes with a comb, and the small scissors that comes with kit works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now, and with minimal maintenance, it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> We are on our 5th free hair cut, and many to come.  </li>
            <li> Sheers work great (and not at all too loud).  </li>
            <li> For the $30 I am so far happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes it great for retired and hairy old man keep unsightly hair under control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great machine, not too loud.</li>
            <li> but it works great so far.</li>
            <li> better than the light plastic models.</li>
            <li> I will enjoy using them for many years, as they seem to be quality made.  </li>
            <li> I have used it 4 times, and is working great so far.</li>
            <li> our cheap one from walmart works a lot better and is cordless.</li>
            <li> Old lady was happy.</li>
            <li> The cape isn&#x27;t terrific but that can be dealt with; the scissors work nicely and the finished haircut is quite nice!</li>
            <li> , i settled on this set and have been quite happy with the performance so far.</li>
            <li> Great product, looks like it will hold up to frequent use.  </li>
            <li> So far it is a great  trimmer and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> As I said, the accessories and the shaver looks cheap but works OK, has a lot of accessories.</li>
            <li> But then, what isn&#x27;t more cheaply built nowadays?</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Delivered was fast and good product.</li>
            <li> The motor itself is quite powerful and nice</li>
            <li> but I am just doing to get rid of this all together and invest in a good quality set with a real guide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is just very noisy, but otherwise works really good.</li>
            <li> When I received this, I loved it so much that I purchased a spare.</li>
            <li> It looks good but doesn&#x27;t feel really durable..</li>
            <li> Very powerful, not noisy, and love all the attachments/accessories it comes with.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend didn&#x27;t have anything for his hair, and this set has really helped him get everything all at once at a super great price.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic hair shaving toolkit, it has every thing I needed and saved me a lot of money, it is easy to use and I was able to shave my hair by my self with it, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> A cordless clipper gives one more flexibility and mobility, but a corded unit like the Wahl 79524-2501 has an adequately lengthed cord, more power than a cordless, and no waiting time for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair was still long on one side, so I wanted to even it out, but now I just cut my own hair every month!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this kit comes with an awesome selection of different attachments, and the clipper itself cuts smoothly and cleanly without snagging on any hair.</li>
            <li> , this is an excellent clipper that cuts clean and smooth, and the kit comes with such a variety of length attachments</li>
            <li> The scissors aren&#x27;t great, but they are decent enough for a kit like this.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, what you get is great for the price.</li>
            <li> It is very accurate and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great price that will save you a ton of money when considering how much even cheap places like great clips charges.  </li>
            <li> Great product- use it for my regular free haircut (by my wife); does a good job and is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Has weight to it and is a very nice clipper, replacing a 15 year old one by Remmington.</li>
            <li> Very effective and not too loud.</li>
            <li> Other than that.. AWESOME</li>
            <li> Due to my wonderful girlfriend botching my haircut</li>
            <li> The blade is still sharp and still gives a flawless cut.  </li>
            <li> After a little online research I found that most people said Wahl makes the best clippers.  </li>

            <li> Switching guides on the clipper is a breeze as they snap on and off easily - but not too easily.    </li>
            <li> Overall, Wahl&#x27;s product isn&#x27;t jaw-droppingly amazing, but it&#x27;s good deal for 27 dollars.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to take apart for oiling/cleaning.</li>
            <li> The plastic guides are easy to snap on and off and the instructions are easy to follow.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Update May 10, 2014:  I&#x27;ve been using these clippers once weekly since I purchased the kit, and they&#x27;re still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I strongly doubt that.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you need besides good scissors is a nice brush for the neck.</li>
            <li> Not too noisy, but strong vibration during operation;</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND BUYING THE CHROME-PRO VERSION THAT COMES WITH A TRIMMER IF YOU ARE DOING HOME BARBERING.</li>
            <li> The vibration was too strong my head shakes while I run it across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had this over a year still going strong.</li>
            <li> A good realistic price purchase.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I would like,</li>
            <li> going strong just change blade</li>
            <li> it is strong.</li>
            <li> Point is it shows how strong Wahl cutters are.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> The price is also decent, so in all this is a good product, I like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, every week I used this machine and I feel good, hapy and the short hair and never long</li>
            <li> The attachments, which for me are very important, were cheap, cheap ,cheap.</li>
            <li> The included scissors, comb and cape are not as high a quality as the clippers, but I already had good scissors.</li>
            <li> Spend more money and get a better one that does what it&#x27;s made to do, this one went right in the trash can where it belongs.</li>
            <li> From one handsome man to another - this thing will help keep you that way while keeping your shekels right where they belong: riding safely on your hip.</li>
            <li> I just use it at it&#x27;s lowest setting to shave my head works great easy to clean I like it and an epic price tag for everything you get.</li>

            <li> But after 10 minutes or so, it was fine.  </li>
            <li> The motor is strong and runs smoothly.</li>
            <li> For $25, you really can&#x27;t get a better deal on men&#x27;s clippers!</li>
            <li> After realizing that all the stylists at the hair place really did was shave the side of my head with one of these and then hand-trim the top, I decided to try it for myself and save some money!    </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s more - it gets very hot after some time of use.</li>
            <li> This product has lasted much longer than the Remington we purchased and gives much better cuts!</li>
            <li> I was willing to pay twice as much for a set this good, and glad I came across the review that referred to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong electricity is very powerful.</li>
            <li> Strong, plus the no. 1/2 green guide is perfect for beard trimming.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and overall a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use by amatuers like myself, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They included scissors but are pretty cheap, of course a good pair would cost more than the whole kit</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s great quality and there are so many cool accessories for the hair buzzer that fit in the tiny box.</li>
            <li> I gave myself a near perfect, professional looking haircut!</li>
            <li> think She and the clippers do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Especially compared to the way I cut anything, after having a few drinks too many!</li>
            <li> The price is very fair and you receive a lot of attachments (maybe a little too many).  </li>
            <li> It has a large selection of sizes of attachments, of which I use about 2 of them, but it&#x27;s nice to have options.</li>
            <li> They work flawless with a plastic guard on them (I use the 1/2 size) and are a little &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; without a guard on but don&#x27;t rip out hairs.  </li>
            <li> , I wish it was a little lighter, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Very smooth action, good close clipping, no discomfort to patient and a good solid feel to the operator.</li>
            <li> then I have spent lol :)</li>
            <li> Awesome price and do a great job at cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my sons hair and also for my beard which was a huge beard.</li>
            <li> And now my girlfriend, best friends, and parents are great at cutting my hair now.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, storage kit is sturdy and secure</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair clipper and seems better than the old one I have been using for two years.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product for the price</li>
            <li> Great kit, this my second Wahl chrome pro clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap walmart clippers for years.</li>
            <li> Got electrocuted, no longer can the attachment fit.</li>
            <li> The packed contents are nice, but the attachments feel very flimsy.</li>
            <li> kinda cheap</li>
            <li> It cuts effortlessly and smooth.</li>
            <li> It has all the attachments you could ever need and the cutter is smooth and efficient.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy using it yourself.</li>
            <li> It cut so smooth, I accidentally shaved part of my scalp.(Frackin A)  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet noticed it pulling on my hair or anything, it&#x27;s been smooth.    </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a finer blade available that cuts from 0.4mm to 1.0mm, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is three month&#x27;s later, working great.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity, but if it lasts a year I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth for sure.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic just what I needed to get the job done</li>
            <li> two gripes about the product are the clipper attachment feel cheap like i&#x27;m going to break them when i snap them on to the sheers.</li>
            <li> And the price will also fit any budgit. ....</li>
            <li> Vibrates so much it could effectively be used as a body massager  </li>
            <li> Entirely smooth surface with no attempt to design any helpful grip whatsoever into the handle area</li>
            <li> This one is no different and works great.  </li>
            <li> Its a strong, clean cut with no tugging.</li>
            <li> I rarely feel like I got more than I paid for.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work, or what my hair would end up looking like, but I have to say it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> downside of this item is that the case is really cheap and doesn&#x27;t have dedicated slots for any of the attachments - so you just shove everything into the box when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> The motor sound did not &amp;#34;bog down&amp;#34; even in the thickest parts of his scalp.</li>
            <li> The important part is that these clippers work.  </li>
            <li> When I received these clippers, I immediately started to shave my head and the the clippers were smooth with no bumps.</li>
            <li> Seems like a very solid trimmer and works great.</li>
            <li> -lots of combs, although i only use 3 or 4  -plenty of accessories  -great</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews about this product, I was worried when I read that the pieces were really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I did put a drop of light oil on the blade which helped lube it.  </li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s great and has a lot of adapters if you needed to use different settings!  </li>

            <li> The wahl is much more powerful and doesn&#x27;t get clogged.</li>

            <li> : some of the attachments are really cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> However, the scissors are so cheap and flimsy that I wondered why Wahl would even bother including them.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and has every piece you&#x27;d need to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Husband is in the navy, so it comes in handy very often.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Wahl clipper prior to this one, both worked great.</li>
            <li> However, no blades could be found and I didn&#x27;t want to buy something if I didn&#x27;t know it would fit.</li>
            <li> These had replacement blades available</li>
            <li> The light that reflects off the clippers (which can be seen in my mirror&#x27;s reflection) can kind of make lines appear on my hair that aren&#x27;t really there.</li>
            <li> This haircutting kit is quite good and professionally designed for this price range.    </li>
            <li> Super easy to use, easy to understand directions and numbering</li>

            <li> Good clippers, no complaints so far.</li>

            <li> These seem to have tons of power and just cut right through both the top of my head and my beard.</li>
            <li> After doing lots of research, reading many of the reviews here at Amazon, and looking for the right price point and combination of features, etc.</li>
            <li> I highly advise getting a pair of shearing scissors to give your hair cut a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; finish!</li>
            <li> After I finished using it, I use FastBlast, that air in the can that&#x27;s used to clean keyboard to remove the fine hair pieces from the blade and guards.</li>

            <li> They offered to refund me 20% of the original purchase price.</li>
            <li> After shopping around on Amazon, I decided to give these a try because I am familiar with the brand name and it was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a nice carrying case, that I was also able to fit the extra bottle of blade lube that I purchased from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured this was a fluke since I&#x27;m normally very pleased with items shipped directly from Amazon.</li>

            <li> figured out that my outlet blew the GFI breaker and the original clippers still work</li>

            <li> My mom just cut my hair, and did an awesome job in just a few minutes with this kit!</li>
            <li> I felt pretty confident that I wanted a Wahl clipper set when I went looking for one.</li>
            <li> I bought this buzzer originally just to do some touch ups and trim my beard.</li>
            <li> All in all, pretty satisfied though.</li>
            <li> Usually, Amazon does an excellent job of shipping.</li>
            <li> Wanted to return but had to include some original packaging I no longer had.  </li>
            <li> Great for beard trimming, durable and have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Just got it today and was excited to try it, so plugged it in.</li>
            <li> Great investment for the long run.</li>
            <li> Though I originally bought it for my beard, I now use it to trim my hair.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> First off, the plastic apron is nothing more than a kitchen garbage bag in the shape of an apron...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re super cheap, like me--or you don&#x27;t have someone to cut your hair, doing it yourself with this kit is a super easy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re super cheap, like me--or you don&#x27;t have someone to cut your hair, doing it yourself with this kit is a super easy.</li>
            <li> But the clippers are worth the chaos!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this all the time for his kinky beard and it keeps him looking so fresh and so clean clean!</li>
            <li> These clippers are better made than my old set, and they cut very smoothly.</li>
            <li> thanks for making this so easy!</li>
            <li> I borrowed this kit from my roommate to cut my own hair, and I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> so when I returned it and tried to order another one I was unable to and had to order the 23 piece non-chrome unit which arrived quickly, in great shape and has paid for itself already by doing a great job of hair and beard trimming.    </li>
            <li> no pulls, it cuts cleanly...  </li>
            <li> I kept it clean and oiled, but it just kept getting louder and louder along with the vibrations.</li>
            <li> i love the various guards and accessories that came with it in the nice carrying case.</li>
            <li> This kit has all the stuff i need to get my buzz cut quick and cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this product , It cuts fast and runs smooth and the price is unbeatable .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the next hair cut I will be able to do it all on my own without the help of my wife.</li>
            <li> It comes with all the accessories you would need except for a brush to clean the blades.</li>
            <li> and you have to go over and over some areas to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it did a wonderful job on my hair.</li>
            <li> Using the scissors on the top made my hair look more professionally done.  </li>
            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> I got this because I get a clean cut when I go to the barber</li>
            <li> well built my third set of clippers and by far the best .</li>
            <li> this seller definitely did a superb job on the shipping speed action</li>
            <li> I was able to cut my son&#x27;s hair in a very low haircut and shaped  the lines around his head, nicely.</li>
            <li> clean  </li>
            <li> Clean the clipper blades after every use, and oil them when they get noisy.</li>
            <li> and it gave a really clean cut.</li>
            <li> I was not going to try and clean it or shake it</li>
            <li> FREE super saver shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did have to get a toothbrush to clean off the hair from the teeth and soforth.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job cutting hair, has good weight.</li>
            <li> It has everything I need to have a clean hear cut.</li>
            <li> yes,it&#x27;s really strong and useful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a couple different kinds of clippers for around $25 from Walmart but they always got caught in my hair and were not that pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> With Amazon, deal was quick and easy, quick shipping time.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for just a simple great pear of clippers for normal use you cant get much better than these.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to have this Wahl perform as good as a professional model I had used for 45 years and paid big money for at that time.  </li>
            <li> The blade cuts very well and makes very precise edges.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make them as good as their original buzzers but definitely get the job done.</li>
            <li> These clippers are so sharp and beautiful to handle, they are a true dream.  </li>
            <li> Good Build quality, feels heavy, many accessories and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> At first I started using this machine and it felt professional made of great quality great feel and not loud at all, However within 10 minutes the body of the machine started getting extremely hot.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using americans electric tools, everything looked fine when i receive the package, but when i plug the clipper to the wall the sound it</li>
            <li> cuts really well, very sharp, comes with tools with the machine, very handy, design is nice aswell, i recommend it.</li>
            <li> and it is super user friendly.  </li>
            <li> Happy for my money spent and will recommend to my friends as well.</li>
            <li> Good quality, several numbered length attachments, scissors, and combs included.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are cool;</li>
            <li> used it at least three times already and its worked excellently.</li>
            <li> The set is full and addressed all your need to operate at home.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for professional use as my husband had the same brand and style for 10 years to cut his own hair at home and always loved them.  </li>
            <li> I really have used this alot more than I thought.  </li>
            <li> He has thick, course hair and this works perfectly for him.</li>
            <li> The attachments are MANY and also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It feels so good to have short hair again.  </li>
            <li> It feels incredibly sturdy and heavy and cuts well</li>
            <li> it.:-O explained to her that i have owned at least 10 clippers that have performed flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Me, not being one to send things back, just cleaned it really good and put it to work.</li>
            <li> I recently started buzzing my head, and figured I&#x27;d invest in a good buzzer/clippers for in home use.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this trimmer, works as good as before.</li>
            <li> My last pair of wahl clippers lasted 12 years and were not as good as these.</li>
            <li> Such a good investment.</li>
            <li> I will say they look very sleek and stylish and came with all the accessories needed for a well-groomed man.  </li>
            <li> I will have to see if their claim to these clippers are self sharpening is true.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far with them, and the unit itself is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> He loved the cut and decided he wanted his hair to be that short.  </li>
            <li> A good quality personal tool.</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; comes with many attachments-</li>
            <li> Good instructions inside to help you out and remind you what settings to use for different parts of the head.</li>
            <li> Super quite,  cut really clean, I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> This haircut kit makes for a good trimming machine whether you are looking to trim your hair or facial hair as well.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a good set of clippers, look no further.</li>
            <li> Good quality clippers especially foe the price</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I felt that it was a good deal and would definitely buy again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair really godd and had no troble with it:)</li>
            <li> this is true -- because the outer case was all plastic (lightweight plastic at that).  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend good overall, however one of the components was melted.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a good, solid hair cutter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full proof.</li>
            <li> I bought these same clippers 4 years ago and absolutely loved them - gave a 5 star review at the time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> Nice professional type kit even for home use.</li>
            <li> My fiance has thick hair and these cut through his hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Not a bad pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li> forget the noise, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good one made by a military guy who shows men how to cut their own hair with the clippers (something most of us military guys have had to do more than once).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good one made by a military guy who shows men how to cut their own hair with the clippers (something most of us military guys have had to do more than once).</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> You may want to go to a professional first and get a good shape for your head and follow up with the trims from the Wahl.</li>
            <li> Very happy, nice build quality - far better than other similarly priced brands.</li>
            <li> This kit is very nicely made and is complete with many accessories that are individually labeled and</li>
            <li> I shaved my own head and this made it easy to do, even in the back.  </li>
            <li> Pretty easy to achieve myself.  </li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair for the first time with it and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time to give my husband a haircut that would be easy to deal with while hospitalized.  </li>
            <li> Enter this kit - it&#x27;s pretty easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> its lovely with a low noise and clean cut ability,its for sure a product i will always recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good home set - more guards than I needed for my &#x27;crew&#x27; but they snap tight and work well.  </li>
            <li> I wish they did, as it takes too many passes to complete my own haircut, ESPECIALLY when using the 3/4 guard on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Luckily the kit is pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Its very quite and cuts very clean.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day to shave my head and it works great.</li>
            <li> It works great and has a wide array of attachments!</li>
            <li> For just a little more than one hair cut would cost you, you can buy this and save a good amount of money.</li>
            <li> Between the excellent directions and a little practice, it really yields a super looking haircut.</li>
            <li> It is great for a buzz with the light green  (</li>
            <li> Powerful and cuts clean in one pass without pulling.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well, and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> just make sure you have a steady hand</li>
            <li> Returned them and I then got the Wahl Chrome model and made a quick pass, expecting some resistance.  </li>
            <li> actually purchased a second set to groom my dog since they work so great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger and heavier than most cordless beard trimmers; but it&#x27;s designed for more rigorous use.    </li>
            <li> overall, for its function, this clipper works perfectly besides problem i had above.</li>
            <li> Hair grows quickly so that helps while you are learning your technique.</li>
            <li> However, when I actually received the product, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Perfect cutting and nice accessories.</li>
            <li> Pays for itself quickly.</li>
            <li> I did not buy it for the apron though, so that is the only reason my rating is one star short of perfect.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, hair grows again.</li>
            <li> I have not used most of the stuff that comes in the haircut kit as I just use the main cutter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did go through it quickly</li>
            <li> but I had to do it quickly</li>
            <li> Quick buzz and hop in the shower</li>
            <li> The kit also has a lot of good accessories - more than you need most likely - which is better than having too few.</li>
            <li> it gives quick and efficient buzz cuts with no snagging.</li>
            <li> This seemed like the best trimmer I could find at any local store so it is what I purchased, however I am finally fed up with it.</li>
            <li> This Chrome Pro kit is excellent (the parts are sturdy and the shaving abilities have upped a notch with the extra shaving parts and solid chrome body.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that the eyebrow trimming tool would cut too short, but it really does a great job.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick service.</li>
            <li> Even better than expected (which is nice).  </li>
            <li> Cuts through quickly ...strong design... use it for my head and face</li>
            <li> that while making what really counts here in the USA is why you can buy it at such a great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> these are a great buy and will not only pay for themselves but also help you start saving money real</li>
            <li> Love the versatility with all the different size guards and love the fact that they include a sheet to cover yourself in so that hair doesn&#x27;t get on you.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t scare my dog, and everything works well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Kit comes with many different attachments and gives many options.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the older version</li>
            <li> This product worked seamlessly with my first haircut, at this point I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love how it came with so many accessories and different sized clips.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair, so being light and maneuverable is a big plus.</li>
            <li> quick math 10</li>
            <li> Also, even though the clippers look nice and feel comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t carry over into the actual job they are meant to do.</li>
            <li> the clippers started getting warm and weren&#x27;t really doing much</li>
            <li> Excelente maquina con todos sus accesorios y llego super rapido</li>
            <li> Lots of good attachments and the instructions are very well written and concise, with pictures and diagrams.</li>
            <li> I am sure but just to be sure I returned it and bought one at local store that I could verify</li>
            <li> I can now cut my husband&#x27;s hair quickly and easier than ever before.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very nice to work with and the motor part is heavy which is nice as it doesnt feel like the normal plastic as others do.</li>
            <li> We use the set at home but it gives a very professional haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like my hair is going to be long any time soon, more due to genetics than these clippers, but this set is perfect for keeping groomed.</li>
            <li> I got mine very fast, but I&#x27;m dissapointed because it vibrates a lot and make a lot of sound.</li>
            <li> Better materials and high quality.</li>
            <li> No complaints to date, very good quality, and the price was unbelievable....</li>
            <li> She liked these even better than her nice salon set that had broken.  </li>
            <li> Actually the barber did me a great favor, because I realized that the tool she was using to cut my hair was most likely a Wahl, or Wahl like tool.  </li>
            <li> After I get my money&#x27;s worth many times over for thesei will likely invest in Wahl brand top end clippers for lifetime use.</li>
            <li> though, for the price, this was exactly I needed and Wahl didn&#x27;t cheap out on their design of the shaver itself</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and works really well!</li>
            <li> I own other machines that have lasted me for years and have a slightly better clip design.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li> We were excited to get these clippers but they were nothing what we expected based on the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried them, they had a couple of minor issues but after two or three uses they they smoothed out and work near perfect.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, I expect this product to last quite a while (and I cut my hair about twice a week using no attachments at</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean and all of the accessories are very helpful and useful.</li>
            <li> I think the 24 piece is great for simple male haircuts, I don&#x27;t see why you would need anything more.</li>
            <li> This item paid for itself the very first day I had it.</li>
            <li> The accessories are all as advertised and easy to use and the haircuts, whilst not at the level of the barbershop due to user error, they are getting there and it is really great to have so much control over what the cut will look like.....and the clippers paid for themselves on the first cut!</li>
            <li> You really need to clean it well after each use and oil it after to keep it running smooth.  </li>
            <li> The cord has a nice range and so far the haircut has been consistent and quick.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it for anyone that wants to cut their own hair and save money.</li>
            <li> You pretty much just throw them all in the case in a jumbled mess and hope for the best!</li>
            <li> I needed a new haircut kit and this product more than meets my needs.</li>
            <li> Glad to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> The black sizing combs that you attach to the razor look like they came out of a McDonald&#x27;s happy meal.  </li>
            <li> dig the scissors, probably will never use the cheap feeling apron, don&#x27;t have much of a need for more than 3 of the guides, and feel that the combs are decent quality.  </li>
            <li> great but a co worker found this set for even less at bed bath beyond</li>
            <li> two cuts, I&#x27;ve pretty much got my favorite cut figured out, and the kit has already paid for itself.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy, makes easy cuts without pulling or getting caught.  </li>
            <li> It cuts great though, and it didn&#x27;t take long to get his whole head</li>
            <li> Included is an instruction manual that I really should have paid more attention to, but I was pretty eager to see results immediately, so</li>
            <li> but it was still too strong and vibrating too much.</li>
            <li> It was easy painless and fast.</li>
            <li> It comes with pretty much everything you need to be able to groom yourself, your pets, etc.</li>
            <li> it has a small mirror, it would really deserve the best.</li>
            <li> Very well built and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Clippering around my daughter&#x27;s ears was challenging, the taper guides, I think assume that you want it pretty much buzzed around the ears.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, cut hair fast.  </li>
            <li> It works easily and fast.</li>
            <li> Operation is pleasant, with nicely-fitting blade guards and minimal shaking.</li>
            <li> It is heavier than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I was able to move along more quickly because it cut more efficiently.</li>
            <li> Quite good through it seems not really new</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to save money going to the barber, or just wants to look good when your hair starts getting a bit shaggy, in between visits.</li>
            <li> Some cheaper ones don&#x27;t cut right through the hair right away and take many, many attempts to finally get your desired style.</li>
            <li> it on the exact day they said he would!</li>
            <li> It was like a hot knife through butter, and poof!</li>
            <li> You get so many things for such a small price tag, I feel very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really like these clippers!!</li>
            <li> Such a better quality, compared to the ones I bought at Target years ago!</li>
            <li> I broke the first one after dropping it on a ceramic floor, so no  fault of the product!</li>
            <li> Thanks Wahl !!</li>
            <li> For about $5 more, this trimmer IS PROFESSIONAL QUALITY!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Originally we had bought a higher end Con-Air brand.</li>
            <li> The cat is happy with his new short hair and enjoys the attention when I clip him!</li>
            <li> The body of the clipped was designed to be held easily and fit the curve of my hand, there are more than enough attachments to chose from and the instructions were clear and easy to understand.     </li>
            <li> The comb sizes on this machine are made of the type of plastic that is kind of flexible, much more durable than the ones from my previous rechargeable ones.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with very detailed instructions about how to cut hair and all the pieces of the kit are clearly marked with what it is for.</li>
            <li> But the machine itself looks very professional and very powerful!</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t stop to clean it out, the cut would not be consistent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people say that the guides were really brittle and any pressure will break it because they seem fine to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with that as my hair grows rather fast.  </li>
            <li> Work just fine, and look really sleek.</li>
            <li> Compared to another trimmer I owned earlier, this one barely creates any sound and is very effective in help trimming.</li>
            <li> I guess short short hair is becoming very popular.  </li>
            <li> Great price, cuts well, but the unit itself feels a little ...</li>
            <li> The build, however feels solid and is rather ergonomic (in a good way, its a smart design)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super solidly built, has a sleek look due to the chrome finish, and it&#x27;s way more powerful and awesome than any clippers I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> Plus it costs about as much as one hair cut at a cheap salon and was about $14 cheaper than the comparable model at Target</li>
            <li> Everything works very well and the parts do not look cheap to me.</li>
            <li> The guide combs are cheap and don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  </li>
            <li> Even considered offering free haircuts for the whole of the JRROTC at one point for charity....</li>
            <li> It seems to be made of a light weight plastic and the guides are very flimsy compared to the connaire&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> primary use for this devise is shaving hair from chest of patient who is about to have an electrocardiogram, This machine functions  very well as a shaver.</li>
            <li> The sheet to help keep hair off of you is really think and cheap, almost like a crappy trash bag.</li>
            <li> Cheap and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping via Prime &amp; packaged securely.</li>
            <li> thing comes packaged nicely, even with a cape, but was most useful was a pamphlet for her to read through that described techniques and a few example haircuts.  </li>
            <li> These clippers feel heavy and work great.  </li>
            <li> It poses a distraction when trying to achieve an even fade with a more natural blend.</li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair, I would advise against the chrome body and go for a solid colored plastic model.</li>
            <li> Love the product so far.</li>
            <li> One of the most solid products available.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you know what your doing (its a haircut, not rocket science), then these clippers will pay for themselves after a couple uses and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> unit definitely worth the money (the boys give it a thumbs up).</li>
            <li> This Wahl clipper is a breath of fresh air.  </li>
            <li> they start getting hot, I oil the blade,  then switch over to scissors for a while so it can cool</li>
            <li> WOW, what a great clipper for $25.00 I had a Conair clipper set that I used for years which I paid about the same price, it worked well for years</li>
            <li> The chrome hair clipper is powerful and that&#x27;s why I prefer the power supply clipper compared to the cordless one.</li>
            <li> I knew that in about 2 or 3 weeks if cut evenly will grow back uniformly which it is doing nicely.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, but this on is much louder that the last one.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, efficient, powerful and well constructed.  </li>
            <li> Annoyingly loud; the kit should include a free set of earplugs for the user and anyone else in the house  -VIBRATION!</li>
            <li> Not only did they provide a really nice \\&quot;How</li>
            <li> It does have some metal fregments which means this blade has been freshly made.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just oil it after every dozen or so uses and be sure to clear out the teeth with a brush after each use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit louder than most Barber-shop, professional clippers.    </li>
            <li> If your wanting a nice cut for a low price these are the clippers to have.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for the last 9 years.</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> article back, don&#x27;t work good, so much vibration</li>
            <li> Its nice enough for a home haircut.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised on how many attachments that are with this machine , and</li>
            <li> I think it is very much worth the price..</li>
            <li> Well worth it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to cut someone else&#x27;s hair than your own because there&#x27;s a lot of mirror action involved.</li>
            <li> Works great so far, have only had for a couple of months but does the trick.</li>
            <li> It was powerful and seemed to work well.  </li>
            <li> They worked great, never had any problems with them until last week when they just completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it, it has paid for itself in barber savings.</li>
            <li> If anyone has doubts on purchasing this set, please take the time to read my review - It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> Worth it for just the clippers alone.</li>
            <li> the one next to it off, but they continue to work without incident, the nice part is the part that broke is replaceable so these will be around for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper body seems nice and solid.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; has been a &amp;#34;STANDARD&amp;#34; in the hair-cutting and electric razor business for longer than most of you reading this have been alive.</li>
            <li> for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that most of the reviewers have not had this problem with these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about professional clippers, but I can&#x27;t imagine how they would be much better than this.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this Wahl Haircut kit, I expected a good home hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> this is well worth it  </li>
            <li> The case is smaller than the cloth case I had with the Color Pro clippers which is handy since I put the clippers under the already crowded sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> if you want a budget professional trimmer, it has many accessories in its kit.</li>
            <li> , lots of extras, the clipper runs quiet which is nice too.</li>
            <li> I decided recently to try and cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> The case it came in is useful.  </li>
            <li> After that it was extremely loud, although it still worked for six more months.</li>
            <li> I found out one of my brother in laws cuts his own hair, same boat as me</li>
            <li> Love the fact that Wahl replaced the cheap plastic attachments which accompanied my earlier kit.</li>
            <li> I also like the accessories  clipper blade guides, blade cleaning brush, scissors, body-drape to capture shaved hair with clip fasteners, and clipper-blade oil lubricant  that comes with the kit to make it complete to get that freshly groom appearance that most women like on a man.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare deals where I felt like I was ripping off the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The different types of clips are handy.</li>
            <li> It does the job and is an extremely powerful buzzer.</li>
            <li> I had $9.36 worth of points saved up already</li>
            <li> I had $9.36 worth of points saved up already</li>
            <li> They are more professional than just home clippers.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Kit comes complete with many items in a convenient carry case for storage and travelling.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> The combs are nice as there are a lot of different lengths to pick from.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely had a barber or hair stylist cut my hair</li>
            <li> If you know someone who needs/wants their hair cut frequently, this kit will save you many trips to the barber.</li>
            <li> Useful for haircuts and beards.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited until my mid 40s to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just the razor in its own packaging, which was not enough to protect it well, banging around when I picked up the box.</li>
            <li> The device itself is solid and weighted nicely.</li>
            <li> Pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> -The price -Some useful attachments</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet, cuts like a pro.</li>
            <li> well worth every cent.</li>
            <li> These clippers feel very solid and obliterate hair, meaning they perform their designated function, which I can honestly say the Norelco stuggled with sometimes.</li>
            <li> These are much better than my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> It is not battery powered so having to leave it plugged in while using acan be a bit of a restriction, however it is powerful.</li>
            <li> For this price, it is so worth getting.</li>
            <li> Replaced his 10+yr old Wahl trimmer and he was in love with everything you get in the package.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair several times, so it&#x27;s paid for itself already.</li>
            <li> My old Oster works much better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Wahl so this was rare</li>
            <li> It has everything anyone could possibly need to cut hair on their own EXCEPT an instructional video.  </li>
            <li> machine is so effective, where it comes, no hair left there.</li>
            <li> Wielded by confident hands, this capable piece of machinery is equally adept should you decide to point it north or due south.</li>
            <li> Worked well when it was working but broke down way too quickly, I take good care of things I owe</li>
            <li> Blades have stayed sharp over many many cuts now.</li>
            <li> First one broke quick</li>
            <li> When I ordered this it came to me SUPER FAST!</li>
            <li> Received it quickly and it was exactly what it promised to be.</li>
            <li> Ok, I was a little nervous at first, since I&#x27;ve never cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> of the unique and, perhaps, more helpful accessories are the Left and Right side taper combs (I don&#x27;t think my wife&#x27;s ever even looked at those yet--</li>
            <li> Very nice, heavy duty, lots of attachments.  </li>
            <li> They are so easy to use, and so far, don&#x27;t get too hot to hold onto, like so many of the older ones did.  </li>
            <li> A decent pair of hair stylist scissors would cost many times the cost of this whole set!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The instructions are very helpful and it come with many length attachments as well as scissors which are decent.</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t cut as good as my older pair, which are the same model.</li>
            <li> Comes with decent packaging and a good assortment of accessories and has solid construction.</li>
            <li> The new one is fine for the most part, but it runs noticeably louder than my old one, even after adjusting the power screw.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this kit comes with far more accessories than I will ever need, as I mostly use the 1/16\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot; guides or the bare blade.  </li>
            <li> Other than that a really good set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Other Wahl broke and this seems to be a good replacement.</li>
            <li> Just right for the novice.  </li>
            <li> I noticed right away that when I turned this on, it vibrated in a way that didn&#x27;t seem right to me.  </li>
            <li> They cut right through hair.</li>
            <li> This was right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Plugs right into the wall.</li>
            <li> right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The cord is just the right length.  </li>
            <li> and they sent it right out.</li>
            <li> The quality is there and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li> Clippers glide right through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Comes with everything you need to get started and is priced right.</li>
            <li> It comes with a variety of trimming clips to adjust the right length you are seeking.</li>
            <li> These clippers powered right through course, curly hair without a problem.</li>
            <li> it buzz&#x27;s right through that stuff.</li>
            <li> Seems to work all right.  </li>
            <li> This is about all there is to say right now...</li>
            <li> No charging to hassle with and the price is right.</li>
            <li> And I was right.  </li>
            <li> Plus the 25 bucks for the haircut every week goes right to the savings account.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Just a quick review: - good cutting hair clippers that can give you a haircut just as good as at the barbershop if done by the right</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks, these clippers were great.</li>
            <li> Have patience, understand your first might not be a success, but just laugh and keep it up.  </li>
            <li> The set includes a ton of pieces even though I only use the guard and the case is pretty nice.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Oster, Wahl, Vidal Sassoon hair clippers in the past (one of each since 1999) and by far Wahl is the best in terms of product life and functionality.</li>
            <li> I do how ever cut my own hair and keep it pretty short</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than my old one conair,that one was too hot when it worked for a while,but wahl isn&#x27;t,good quality.</li>
            <li> I think this helps him feel more secure as well, as it isn&#x27;t a completely strange</li>
            <li> very noisy and dose not give a clean cut  rigid .</li>
            <li> This trimmer never snags, cuts cleanly, and is fast.</li>
            <li> Simple to use quick, easy and clean.</li>
            <li> The first thing you learn is that Wahl&#x27;s professional line of clippers in the top used brand of clippers by pros in the world.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they clean the clippers very well and don&#x27;t want him exposed to ring worm,</li>
            <li> For a young male looking to cut his his own hair, these do just that!</li>
            <li> My dad has the exact same one which made me want to get my own.</li>
            <li> My wife used to be a professional hair dresser and has cut my hair since we were married (many years ago).  </li>
            <li> It comes with instructions and makes it easy to cut your own little boys hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is very easy to use and now this mom is a pro.</li>
            <li> It is very easy and I was finished with both sides and the back in a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this set does exactly what I.  Clean cut, reliable and more than enough settings.  </li>
            <li> I should probably knock off half a star because this awesome device showed me my future...</li>
            <li> really does the job easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Strong, doesnt vibrate out of your hand, easy to clean, blades stay sharp.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have bought Conair clippers and they have all been great.</li>
            <li> This kit provides more combs than I actually use, but it&#x27;s nice to have them just the same.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it performs since it&#x27;s for the fella, but I can tell you that it reached me promptly and the packaging looks great.</li>
            <li> They sound and feel like normal barber clippers to me.  </li>
            <li> Great product for an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> and they now sound like normal</li>
            <li> BUT the actual clippers, the most important part, works really well.</li>
            <li> do nicely for a vwry long time.</li>
            <li> I liked it as long as it worked, Then it stopped working after I cleaned it.</li>
            <li> Give a nice even cut and they are not loud at all which some reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li> As for the rest of the kit, it is not hard to tell that the accessories are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> After having a cheap remington vacuum clipper set for several years, I decided to find a good sturdy clipper set.</li>
            <li> The large variety of comb sizes is wonderful but the blade really isn&#x27;t sharp enough.</li>
            <li> my first clipper had some problems with scissors part and noise, but after complaining amazon sent me the new one with one day free shipping&lt;br /&gt;It seems, clipper is powerful, but this five star is for customer service,-</li>
            <li> Then at the time of my purchase, there was a Special Offer attached to this product (always look for Amazon&#x27;s Special Offers).</li>
            <li> Then at the time of my purchase, there was a Special Offer attached to this product (always look for Amazon&#x27;s Special Offers).</li>
            <li> It takes some practice and a little more time, but looks much better (IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The motor does not overheat easily like so many other clippers I&#x27;ve had tends to do.  </li>
            <li> broke(cracked right by the first screw).</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 because I thought the clipper would be more heavy duty, but on the positive side it is lightweight and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Received quickly, and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I cant find any that are half as good</li>
            <li> I was able to cut around my four year old son&#x27;s ears without having to worry if I was going to accidentally nip his ear because he doesn&#x27;t hold still very well.</li>
            <li> After years of shelling out way too much for a simple #2 buzz cut I wanted to take matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li> Unit has a professional feel to it ----- heavier than another brand that I have, but easy to use -----</li>
            <li> I consider these a great investment because I&#x27;ve already saved over $300 by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have all the different accessories and also all the different sizes.</li>
            <li> None the less, good purchase.</li>
            <li> They cut very even and the chrome looks pretty cool</li>
            <li> This is great for cutting my own hair and my friends hair as well.</li>
            <li> Based on the good previous reviews of these Wahl clippers, I decided to try them</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these sets in the last year after the my Son dropped, and broke the still perfectly good 40 year old Wahl trimmer I had all those years.</li>
            <li> but I am excited that I got my purchase in as I don&#x27;t feel they are quite worth the new higher price.</li>
            <li> Aside this, the trimmer is elegantly constructed of fine materials giving it that sharp look.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and sleek, this clipper set can handle the shaggiest mop top in no time with absolutely no snagging.</li>
            <li> Money well spent for sure!</li>
            <li> the Wahl Clippers arrived exactly on the day I ordered  the $3.99 same day shipping is great for those who need stuff in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> never an ounce of resistance, always a very crisp and very even cut.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped this item completely loose in a box, with no padding or air cushioning of any kind.  </li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The device itself is strong and is kept in a nice small carrying case.</li>
            <li> know the Wahl name and when I saw this set and the very reasonable price, I just ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Very very very noisy clipper</li>
            <li> The motor moves the blades very fast and so it does not pull hair at all.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very very bed quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut about 4-5 heads of hair so far with this clippers and they seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Seems to not cut fine soft hair as well.</li>
            <li> There are other better quality combs available</li>
            <li> This one is lighter and cuts just fine, but it does not cut like the old one we had.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a fine product that has held up well with frequent use.</li>
            <li> The old one still works fine.</li>
            <li> There are so many options available in terms of the clipper sizes and other accessories provided with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never tried the other set, but with what I&#x27;ve got, this is the sturdiest, strongest, and most accurate set I&#x27;ve got for $25.</li>
            <li> Works well, a little noisy, but a good buy.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine for the first 30 seconds and then started to vibrate erratically - so loud that I cannot use it because my neighbors begin to bang on the walls.</li>
            <li> it is very smooth and comfortable, absolutely a good tool, now I find that cutting hair is an art.</li>
            <li> power is good for long or short hair, the grip is very nice, and the scissors that come with it are very sharp, to my surprise.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for my Pomeranian&#x27;s hair, not for a human&#x27;s hair, and these clippers are amazing!  </li>
            <li> Save so much money doing haircuts at home!</li>
            <li> Gave the first haircut yesterday, and with the instructions they give you, it worked out quite well.  </li>
            <li> Only used twice so far but very pleased.</li>
            <li> I do use mineral oil occasionally to keep it in tip top condition.</li>
            <li> I forgot to oil it before i used it for the first time</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer but for a several more dollars you could buy a Wahl set that has one.</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The blade is smooth and not choppy.</li>
            <li> Cut my hair in 5 min, with no difficult.</li>
            <li> I am overseas so, the first one I burne it with 220 volts.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this kit to anyone, and would instead recommend spending another $25 and getting a higher quality model...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but I&#x27;m guessing it will only take a couple of more times</li>
            <li> My first pair</li>
            <li> Return policy is about 30 days be aware.</li>
            <li> As I opened my Haircut kit, the first thing I took a look was the blade on cutter.  </li>
            <li> This thing pulled on my beard hair when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> It comes with more than enough guides and extensions.</li>
            <li> exactly what you&#x27;d expect for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably advise you to get a higher end model</li>
            <li> The first was for my home use.  </li>
            <li> - Does exactly what you&#x27;d want.</li>
            <li> First of all for that price, and manufactured in the US, and all those pieces included, does its job, pays off in one or two haircuts, it is</li>
            <li> sure to oil them regularly.</li>
            <li> Actually, it turned out much better than it had using scissors, and it was so much faster, too!  </li>
            <li> start out with the longest attachment first....</li>
            <li> Saves me $15 a cut, so it paid for itself after the first two cuts.  </li>
            <li> It works well when you need a haircut but can&#x27;t get to the barber and your wife is willing to cut it....</li>
            <li> This is a much better clipper set than my last one, and that one lasted about 7 years.</li>
            <li> The cape that comes with it feels pretty flimsy, so I like to just drape a towel around his shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It almost has too many accessories for my personal needs, but I&#x27;m glad it came with all the clipper guards and scissors for my initial &#x27;taming of the mane&#x27;.</li>
            <li> When I turn on the clipper, it was so loud and didn&#x27;t sound like a clipper at all.</li>
            <li> As for the Clippers themselves they function exactly as one would expect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with all the clippers from 1 to 8, and then several more extras.  </li>
            <li> Used them the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Comes with many different level heads.</li>
            <li> At the barber all i do is ask for different sizes on the top and sides.  </li>
            <li> I had combs from an old one that fit on it</li>
            <li> The first time I used this clipper, I put on the 1/16th adjuster and had no issues.  </li>
            <li> ; - )</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x60;It gets hot after 30 minutes of usage, but I think that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this product instead, which is the exact clipper, but in a plastic shell:</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> I love the extra guards that come with it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> I did have to adjust the blades when I first got them.</li>
            <li> Not a difficult haircut to keep.</li>
            <li> My wife just gave me my first haircut with the Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Trimmer.</li>
            <li> Looking forward for more of such deals.</li>
            <li> This thing is sturdy and does the job MUCH better than the garbage CONAIR, I recently purchased.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like this machine from the first time I push ON.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they have so many models at different prices.</li>
            <li> know exactly what pull sensation I am talking about,</li>
            <li> It works like hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many clipper sets over the years and they always fall short.</li>
            <li> These have held up pretty well for the price point.</li>
            <li> This sucker works great.</li>
            <li> I have two sets of this trimmer, The first one I bought I had for quite a while</li>
            <li> Has lots of extra parts that most individuals will never use.</li>
            <li> And you get all this for just a smidge more than what I was paying for an fairly low price haircut!</li>
            <li> really like it!</li>
            <li> We just stick to a higher grade around the ears now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to cut your own hair than it looks</li>
            <li> - it makes haircuts go so fast!</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep my 3 boys looking crisp, and used for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I almost never use a guide over a #2, but for close cuts, it does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> In fact, it looked pretty funny.</li>
            <li> Not difficult because I cut it to 1/4 inch.  </li>
            <li> and it should last for many years.</li>
            <li> case could use some more organization or a different layout, as I feel everything is cluttered in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> sure enough i now am a pro!  </li>
            <li> suggest buying better clips to hold back your hair though.</li>
            <li> works pretty well&lt;</li>
            <li> I learned from ear number one to trim it first.  </li>
            <li> My husband finally decided to go with a buzz cut and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Over all, it really was worth the price.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, this clipper did not overheat...</li>
            <li> I use this for my son&#x27;s hair, and they are better then the last set of clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently begun clipping my own hair, and my first pair of clippers were fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever cut anybody&#x27;s hair, besides my dog&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Now my top of my head has only 1/2 inch of hair.</li>
            <li> It was my first time</li>
            <li> had this exact model in our home</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Motor stopped working during first use.</li>
            <li> It was pretty chintzy and I just pitched it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first cut with the Wahl Chrome Pro.</li>
            <li> (all of the many accessories are listed above)</li>
            <li> I finished the top of my head from the back, moving from all directions over the swirl to ensure an even cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this every week and my hair will stay looking great without growing long and then getting cut short again.</li>
            <li> I had spotted this same clipper at Sam&#x27;s Club for more money than Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had spotted this same clipper at Sam&#x27;s Club for more money than Amazon.</li>
            <li> With Amazon&#x27;s return policy, you can&#x27;t really lose!</li>
            <li> The Shaver is very well made!</li>
            <li> Some of the extras that come with the clippers are pretty junkie.  </li>
            <li> I thought he was going to take his head off when I first heard it.</li>
            <li> I like the product overall, glad I brought it.</li>
            <li> Very well made!</li>
            <li> the slower I went the better results, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same spot 10 times like my cheaper model.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Cut through like a hot knife on butter.</li>
            <li> I did that and the first haircut</li>
            <li> This cutter is like a hot knife going through butter.</li>
            <li> you can buy with your eyes closed, the model is nice, came in the allotted time, I have no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he will get several years of use out of it.</li>
            <li> They get way too hot to even hold.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and every time he uses it he tells me how much he loves it!</li>
            <li> A real money saver too!  </li>
            <li> So much better than last Wahl we bought.</li>
            <li> The sound isn&#x27;t loud or bothersome.</li>
            <li> Use it for college and works great comes with all the clipping lengths just sucks</li>
            <li> Worked the first time &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this, I have given my husband haircuts instead of sending him to the barber and saved so much!</li>
            <li> It was a great and long lasting product</li>
            <li> Thanks to this set, I didn&#x27;t butcher my haircut!  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice on first my dad, then my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> Has numerous attachments, cape to put on your shoulders, is very quiet to operate; couldn&#x27;t be more pleased &amp; was a bargain at this price.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> First use with 2 boys went well.  </li>
            <li> Had my first one for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I just had my first haircut with it and the difference between the 79524-2501 and the 79300-400 is NIGHT AND DAY.</li>
            <li> clippers themselves are durable from metal and work very well!</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the buy</li>
            <li> /&gt;People from Europe - be aware that if you buy this hair cutter from US, you will have issue with the electrical characteristics - this one is designed for 110 volt and 60 hertz electricity.</li>
            <li> I asked him if the sound is too loud</li>
            <li> sure if they will last though?</li>
            <li> Has yet to catch my hair and cuts really well!</li>
            <li> The guards are cheap-ish plastic, but I only use guards 2 and lower and have had no problem whatsoever, even after changing them out many times.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I have to constantly oil and brush my razors so they don&#x27;t lock and pull my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is my first clipper</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a larger attachment if you don&#x27;t want to shave off your kid&#x27;s side burn!</li>
            <li> It cuts as smooth as a hot knife through soft butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So take precautions while using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Read the manual first.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of clippers</li>
            <li> But I can tell this is a durable and consistent set.</li>
            <li> Kit box could be a bit larger or better designed</li>
            <li> They have a cord so be aware they are not cordless..</li>
            <li> The case is hollow and everything is just kind of thrown in there...</li>
            <li> It has all ready paid for itself by doing two h/c!</li>
            <li> Now, I just really need to practice!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the comb set is all plastic so after a while I may need to replace the combs I use the most.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what was described.  </li>
            <li> Delivered product was exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Better than my last pair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a smooth trimmer, easly quietest trimmers that I have owned!</li>
            <li> and I immediately used the machine for the first time to cut my hair and it started to overheat and started to smell.  </li>
            <li> The product is exactly which describes the provider.</li>
            <li> I had the first one for years.</li>
            <li> has all the necessary hair clips for any type of stylish cuts.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay for occasional trims and cuts.</li>
            <li> Very well made and a bargain at twice the cost!</li>
            <li> its price can do exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The last one I purchased several years ago, worked wonderfully, and recently died.</li>
            <li> So many different guards give you lots of choices as well.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty quality, good product.</li>
            <li> Good,  just used a few time got it paid for already</li>
            <li> It is a little noise it , I cut my hair Flat Top style and this machine does a verry good job.</li>
            <li> (again, took me an hour), but I&#x27;m sure that time will cut down once you become familiar and more confident with cutting your own hair (it was my first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is brand new and the old one works much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now the old, sharpened clippers work better than the new ones I just bought.  </li>
            <li> Just keep it dry and its more than worth it.</li>
            <li> super powerful compared to my old Remington.</li>
            <li> It oozes quality, and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Great product, especially for those with limited HAIR.</li>
            <li> Was great in the beginning several months but the lever switch became loose and wouldn&#x27;t maintain its position and bought a replacement hair cut kit and now the mechanical blade will not function correctly.</li>
            <li> I opened the package to find a nice set of clips and other accessories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving myself flat top haircuts for years.</li>
            <li> They are pretty sharper and don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot too much to make sure it&#x27;s cut.</li>
            <li> My first haircut on myself looked good by following the simple instructions.</li>
            <li> My first time cutting my own hair looked just as good as when the barber did it.  </li>
            <li> The other 2 Wahl products we own have been in use for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Nice sharp blade.</li>
            <li> My husband gives himself a flat top every 3 weeks using clippers.  </li>
            <li> Love these clippers, they are great for just about anything when it comes to cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> but in general it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li> It works ok and does a reasonable job, but it takes several passes to clip the hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as loud as my last trimmer either, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> The cut was super clean, so I would try a longer length guide to start and then go smaller from there</li>
            <li> This shaver/trimmer does a good job with lots of different &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; for different length of cuts.  </li>
            <li> I just received this item, tried it for the first time - its so noisy that really too much !</li>
            <li> Pays for itself, good for cutting your own hair or having someone do it for you.  </li>
            <li> Quiet and cuts clean and quick.</li>
            <li> I expect a few more times and she&#x27;ll be comfortable and a at home pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is very easy to cut your hair shorter than you want, be careful.</li>
            <li> I liked having more control using scissors, but it took so much longer (his hair is thick!)</li>
            <li> I cut my hair (very curly) and my roommates (very straight) and we have zero complaints.</li>
            <li> Bought this giving the product benefit of the doubt, but it is SUPER LOUD!.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, heavy, like professional barber clippers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl units for many decades and it seems if you take a little time to clean and oil them</li>
            <li> Seems very rugged, long cord, works great so far, came in a nice hard case.</li>
            <li> terms of the item&#x27;s functionality, I love it, I used it for a hair cut that was kind of long on a male, and it worked flawlessly, no hair pulling, not sticking of any kind, it was so easy to use and had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> you ripped on the first use, but we don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very concern about a product that i bought at your store on the first week of November this year.</li>
            <li> i was pretty amazed about these , would recommend them to anyone that wants to save money.</li>
            <li> If you are a man who is tired of not being satisfied with your hair stylist - you know, one time it looks great, the next time you look like a palm tree...</li>
            <li> so unless you keep your hair more than 5-6&amp;#34; long you should be good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> It comes with oil and maintenance instructions which I&#x27;ve mostly disregarded, and has still lasted me this long.</li>
            <li> my kind of cut, you do the sides and back first, around the ear next, and then finally the top.</li>
            <li> whether cutting your own hair or that of other family members there is a learning curve involved and the hair cuts may not come out perfect at first.</li>
            <li> They have a pretty sleek look and you can get  a really sleek haircut out of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;professional\\&quot; Andis clipper blade pretty much yanked the hair out of my head.</li>
            <li> For the best-looking haircut (for a guy with short hair) don&#x27;t be afraid to use the scissors on the top, and don&#x27;t worry about making it PERFECTLY even.</li>
            <li> Considering I spent only $25-30 on it, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to last forever, so I was very happy with that purchase.</li>
            <li> Cheap(low-quality)/Metal blade/Takes twice as long to cut my hair and much more patience</li>
            <li> and my wife says we look just as good if not better doing it ourselves.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s not a bad set up.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and will cost you less than one good haircut from a professional.</li>
            <li> I seriously could not stop saying \\&quot;I love these clippers!\\&quot; as I cut their hair &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> Though it would be nice to have a short instruction manual on how to use the left and right ear pieces.</li>
            <li> is that if you get them wet they can rust really easily!</li>
            <li> Pretty nice little kit for the price</li>
            <li> These clippers work decent, but they get hot pretty quick, and also get loud.</li>
            <li> i usually cut my own hair, came with everything came on time cuts great with no snags this will last me a long time</li>
            <li> I am now able to cut my husband&#x27;s hair instead of making a special 60 mile round trip to town.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and effective.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very solid, clip smoothly and don&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
            <li> But they are super loud.</li>
            <li> Easy to use to keep yourself looking human when in a rush.</li>
            <li> The attachments make trimming easy, especially the ones for tapering.</li>
            <li> I am VERY particular about some of the things</li>
            <li> haircuts are not always easy to attain so this kit enables him to do it himself and keep his hair short for under his helmet..</li>
            <li> I used it instantly on myself and was blown away with how easy it was.</li>
            <li> Yeah buddy, if you have an easy shave (I&#x27;m a simple buzz cut every time) than this is way wiser than spending $15 a haircut.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for several months now, and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> You can always work your way down, but you can&#x27;t work your way back up, lol.  </li>
            <li> Great product powerful and sharp , a good selection of tools , a little Heavy , but</li>
            <li> I will certainly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> You will certainly find some use for this machine.</li>
            <li> Totally smart buy.  </li>
            <li> I have my wife cut my hair because at $16-$20 a pop, this will be a large money</li>
            <li> pretty quiet, very powerful, and lots of extras.</li>
            <li> Brand New!!</li>
            <li> Of course, I bought the same clippers again since I was so happy with the previous set.    </li>
            <li> It is quiet, fast, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> They are solid, very well constructed, and have a strong motor.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer made quick work of the husband&#x27;s thick hair and there wasn&#x27;t a peep about &#x27;pulling&#x27; or &#x27;catching&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have had the new one for a few months and have been happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, functional, and easy to use!</li>
            <li> It may take an extra pass or two to get all the hair but for my needs it works fine.</li>
            <li> The combs it comes with are also great and really make cutting his hair easily.</li>
            <li> The guards for the clippers are basic guards, they work perfectly fine, as some people said they&#x27;re &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wahl, and all other hair experts recommend that you start with the comb that leaves the most hair on your head first.</li>
            <li> but they stay on just fine with a solid grip.</li>
            <li> Quiet, solid trimmer with more guides than you&#x27;ll ever need!  </li>
            <li> I have used others and they work okay too, but this is made of higher quality plastic than the other value brands.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to cut my own hair, saving me $15 a month, paying for itself in a few short months.  </li>
            <li> it grew back rather quickly!</li>
            <li> A very high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is very high quality and works so well.</li>
            <li> cuts good, i am new at do it your self cuts once i get the balls to really cut some off the top ill Update.</li>
            <li> These are good for the money, and very smooth cutting.</li>
            <li> I was going to just buy the two angled guards for a current clipper, but realized I could get the whole kit for close to the same price... much better equipment than before, and now I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour trying to get the hair over their ears!</li>
            <li> They work exactly as advertised and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and the price makes it a real bargain!</li>
            <li> I found I have to go over the cats more than once in certain areas, but it&#x27;s not much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid little machine and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I pretty much just run the clippers over my head to buzz all my hair off, and only use guides to clean up my eye brows, but that doesn&#x27;t detract from how well these clippers do what they do.</li>
            <li> With a little practice and a good mirror, you will give yourself a professional haircut every time and save money.</li>
            <li> I do like the sides short and faded, but i like a little more on the top.</li>
            <li> It was the easiest to use and the haircut looks very Professional!!</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get used to cutting so make sure that you don&#x27;t have some party to attend and need to look your best when you first start out!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at first, but they are SO EASY to use!</li>
            <li> Agree with most of the other positive posts.</li>
            <li> and it made a huge nick in the back of my head (on both sides).</li>
            <li> just works really well ... smooth and quiet...</li>
            <li> Very well built and they feel substantial, not like some cheap Chinese junk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades cut really well.</li>
            <li> It cuts very evenly and without any effort at all.</li>
            <li> It cuts really well.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> A couple pulls but it didn&#x27;t really hurt or anything.</li>
            <li> I have an Oster T-Trimmer that works very well</li>
            <li> I love this one, it is wide.</li>
            <li> and it was still too much.</li>
            <li> This does not get a very close cut.</li>
            <li> but she also stated it cuts my hair much smoother and with ease.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve buzzed my whole head.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> In retrospect I wish I spent the $8 more for the one with the personal/around ear trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it too much yet</li>
            <li> It is recommended to buy this set with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Only wish it was cordless, but not that important.</li>
            <li> As they&#x27;re meant to glide through hair, they don&#x27;t need to be very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I like that the clipper comes with a five-year warranty, and I&#x27;ve found Wahl&#x27;s customer service to be very helpful in providing information when I&#x27;ve emailed and called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Reasonably fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It also cuts hair (on my head) very well.</li>
            <li> I dont think they&#x27;ve ever been to a real barber shop.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really lose.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I would recommend Wahl to anyone looking for a very durable hair cutter.  </li>
            <li> Very disorganized.</li>
            <li> They cut hair very well.    </li>
            <li> shipped fast as described</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers.</li>
            <li> I have used it about five times now and cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Much happier.   </li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> but this one had really cheap attachments and one broke shortly after I got it.  </li>
            <li> Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of hair to plow through and it made it so much easier to do so in increments.</li>
            <li> its just vibrates too much.</li>
            <li> Very well please with this product.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast, so getting 2/month is $50.  </li>
            <li> If you really, really want to cut your hair at home, go for it.  </li>
            <li> things don&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> It works great but came with some broken combs.</li>
            <li> This has worked very well for me learning to cut my fiance&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It also is very  </li>
            <li> very loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t fit in hand properly.  </li>
            <li> My only issue with the kit is the apron included is about as cheap as you can get.</li>
            <li> They work really well and came with a ton of guards.</li>
            <li> Really inexpensive for the quality.  </li>
            <li> Rest really didn&#x27;t need to be cut.  </li>
            <li> Stainless steel blade is well constructed.  </li>
            <li> Really like the guards, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll cut your hair, it has all the accessories you&#x27;d expect, and it matches your stainless steel decor.</li>
            <li> It also works really well on hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing to complain about here.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> n ready to go, didn&#x27;t need to screw anything to adjustment or any of that..</li>
            <li> It feels very sturdy and well constructed, just like one you would see in a barber shop.</li>
            <li> This hair cutting kit is awesome!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how they work on mine which is much thinner.  </li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and started out using a cheap cutter that we bought at a local drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I will save so much money using this on my two boys.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my bead.</li>
            <li> Seem very durable.  </li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t died and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog much.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever been to a salon or a barber, it makes just as much noise as the ones over there.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  cut very  well at all.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is it is sound but</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use it as an all-around body trimmer as opposed to just my head.</li>
            <li> I must say it does its job very well.</li>
            <li> It has proven to be very durable and</li>
            <li> I think it is reasonable.</li>
            <li> only thing that would make thiis better imo is maybe make it not so heavy :)</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> It trims really well.</li>
            <li> No tugs or scrapes, either - just a very professional-looking haircut from a decidedly non-professional barber.  </li>
            <li> The clippers itself were better quality than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> tried cutting my own hair with a fade, and it really didn&#x27;t come out all that nice.</li>
            <li> I was going to go to my barber for a haircut which costs the same as this kit, so instead me being cheap</li>
            <li> 16$ at the barber every two weeks adds up fast .&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> It does it job well and does come with a wide variety of accessories - most of which I have never used till date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only issue I sense is that if it is used for sometime without switching it off intermittently I feel I can sense a light smell coming out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a matter of time before that cheap hinge breaks.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Wahl brand hair clipper!</li>
            <li> This unit feel solid and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> You can really tell in the feel of the adjustment lever.  </li>
            <li> It cuts my hair very well.</li>
            <li> powerful, not a lot of noise, complete set</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustability of this clipper.</li>
            <li> But this Wahl kit is very well made and gets the job done immediately.</li>
            <li> It works just as I hoped it would, really well.</li>
            <li> This product from Wahl works very well.  </li>
            <li> In fact you don&#x27;t want to go too fast or try and get too much of the fur coz that will clog up the blade.  </li>
            <li> this works really well.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> Cuts fast, no pulling, boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li> The instruction booklet is very understandable too.</li>
            <li> Sturdy electric clippers that does as promised, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is much quieter though.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the look and feel of these clippers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like the tapered guards for \\&quot;edging\\&quot; and the case keeps everything together.</li>
            <li> Free to me after my second haircut (savings over paying for haircare).</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was leery of the type of quality that this set would have based on the low price, but it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and we saved much money for hair cut.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get clogged with too much hair like others.  </li>
            <li> It really is a haircut kit, even with the cape included.</li>
            <li> To finish off, a wetting of the hair and some Bed Head gel and I&#x27;m ready for town!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> With Amazon&#x27;s return policy, you can&#x27;t really lose!cutting my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the thing just conked off, I could have been electrocuted or the whole Power supply could have been damaged.</li>
            <li> This is the heaviest of all the clippers I have ever owned, but it is also the best cutting pair.</li>
            <li> Very Smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> better than I expected</li>
            <li> it comes with a whole pile of attachments.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cutting my beard</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful but loud.</li>
            <li> The guides are very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be built very well and</li>
            <li> This Wahl kit comes with absolutely everything you need to cut hair.</li>
            <li> That means it cuts really well.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> them because I was ready for a change.</li>
            <li> an advanced user, but for the simple stuff it does what it is suppose</li>
            <li> I just started cutting my hair and these are perfect to start with.</li>
            <li> We save so much money not having his hair cut in a salon.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the included cleaning brush and oil for the clippers.</li>
            <li> You can do weekly touch ups and keep your family looking very well groomed all the time.</li>
            <li> did the job for which I bought this very well.</li>
            <li> I like it so much.</li>
            <li> It really stank the house up</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but the guards rattle a lot and do not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> We decided to stop wasting so much money at in-and-out barbers.</li>
            <li> I guess it is cheap (!)</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much was included with the product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care as it has paid for itself after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> &amp; my expectations are high for this trimmer!  </li>
            <li> undercut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cape and accessories that come extra are cheap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work really well either...</li>
            <li> Not too noisey cuts smooth and comes with a lot of guards for various hair lengths.</li>
            <li> My son has hear that is very think</li>
            <li> thanks the machine is beutifull</li>
            <li> I wanted a set that would just run straight through without jamming or pulling hair.</li>
            <li> and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Also works very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t force the plastic screw too much or else you may break the plastic screw.</li>
            <li> Turning the power screw too much counter-clockwise can misaligned the blades.</li>
            <li> the noise it makes is really too high to bear !</li>
            <li> Quiet and smooth, lots of extras</li>
            <li> Works really well and comes with almost everything you would need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying I just plunked them on my DIY workbench and did the job, but it really wasn&#x27;t hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Numerous attachments fit about any hair situation.  </li>
            <li> My wife accidentally shaved off too much, yep...</li>
            <li> shaves very well..</li>
            <li> Offers good cutting edges, accurate and precise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using mine for a whole year</li>
            <li> They cut really close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Works very well mistakenly.</li>
            <li> I really like how these cut and also how they look and feel.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are tiny and cheap - don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll use them - but the clippers work well.</li>
            <li> how wonderful that no one will need to dirty a bath towel to catch hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Plenty of guards, a pair of scissors, hair clips, combs, everything but the barber is included in this kit and the price was better than we had expected.  </li>
            <li> very good.，The quality is very good，I like it</li>
            <li> had to oil the on/off switch after a while because it stuck so much.</li>
            <li> It has everything (probably too much) that I need to cut my hair and trim my beard.</li>
            <li> Too much vibration on the hand.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair very efficiently and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I got a real apron instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real money saver.</li>
            <li> It saves us so much money</li>
            <li> I think made very well for these days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother who really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> Price comparison to very bed.</li>
            <li> It cuts and trims really well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and seems to have all of the attachments I will need.</li>
            <li> The clippers arrived extremely fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Very noisy..</li>
            <li> I feel like a real barber.  </li>
            <li> :  Go to a beauty supply store and buy a REAL cape.</li>
            <li> Works fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li> very well made.  </li>
            <li> Seem to cut fast (duration of haircut) yet don&#x27;t get any tugs.  </li>
            <li> but you could always rough up that spot for more grip if need be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but it work very well for me</li>
            <li> Runs quietly and cuts as smooth as butter.  </li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll get nicks and pink spots on your face :)  </li>
            <li> Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> one I purchased identical to this is very very quiet and light.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> I really like this machine.</li>
            <li> Although it vibrates too much for my taste</li>
            <li> I learned my lesson and like using them now, but I&#x27;m much more careful now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 24 piece kit really covers every cut you would need.</li>
            <li> All the guide combs are made out of plastic, most of them are warped and not straight, looks like it was exposed to heat and was deformed.</li>
            <li> I am a former Cosmetologist and enjoy the Wahl cutter.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a real keeper of a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> even though I&#x27;ve only had them for a short time the durability seems to be good so far.  </li>
            <li> They give you two different combs (with different grading) and a nice pair of hair scissors.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face!</li>
            <li> The eyebrow trimmer is nice, but not short enough for me.</li>
            <li> In fact, the guides on this clipper attach a lot more solidly than they did on my old one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face!</li>
            <li> But to be honest, they get close ENOUGH, and have enough guards to pull off whatever you need them to do.</li>
            <li> Difersnt kind of styles strobg motor and heavy constrccion , brand name.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face!</li>
            <li> Good so far, it seems like a heavy duty product.</li>
            <li> My husband was used to his older, heavier cutter, and despite us discussing a very funny Amazon review about this exact possibility, the same thing happened to him when he used it the first time.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for home usage.&lt;br /&gt;There are different shoes that help you make your cut easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These have been such a money saver (as my old clippers were), but are very comfortable to cut (unlike my older clippers).</li>
            <li> Between this baby and my Flowbee I can crank out my own haircut in 10 minutes or less!</li>
            <li> For a guy who only have flattop like my bf, it is very economical.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I heard many people complain about the noise this machine produces, but I can assure you this product makes no less of a noice than any regular trimmer.</li>
            <li> My better half has never cut hair before, so the first time was an adventure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very nice piece with a solid heavy duty body.</li>
            <li> Once I bought the first new one my daughter wanted one to cut her dogs hair with.</li>
            <li> However, this is the clear winner when it comes to trimming hair and getting the right length.</li>

            <li> However, this is the clear winner when it comes to trimming hair and getting the right length.</li>
            <li> but if your looking for something to last a long time, I suggest to get something a bit more quality!</li>
            <li> sure to use Wahl or other brand clipping oil to retain the longevity of clippers.</li>
            <li> May suggest the other version with a clipper setting greater than 1&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> So we&#x27;re not going to bark and scream on how these are better than other brands.  </li>
            <li> More than I expected for my money!</li>
            <li> I recieved the clippers earlier thab the original arrival date.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t hardly hear them ruin and the old man said he could not feel any kind of pulling!</li>
            <li> You can always work your way down quickly by using the next number comb (higher numbers leave more hair; the lower the number, the closer the cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> While functionally it is ok, but cosmetically the appearance is very rough.</li>
            <li> the unit is very high quality , would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Cuts hair very well was very excited about the outcome and many different options to cutting hair overall good quality</li>
            <li> Make sure to always lubricate any clipper right before you use it, and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a professional set of clippers or anything, but it does just fine.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep it clean and provide some basic maintenance, you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Quiet and gives a clean cut.</li>
            <li> It only takes me about 15 minutes and about 5 minutes clean up time.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because the scissors aren&#x27;t the best quality, which I half expected anyway in a kit at this price.  </li>
            <li> only wish they would have offered little more oil, but that is fine.</li>
            <li> I have not gone to Supercuts; I am able to maintain my short hair length all the time; whereas before I needed to visit Supercuts regularly; I use the # 12 comb on my whole head every day to maintain the 1.5\\&quot; length that I like; they are very quite and inconspicuous.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it is very sturdy and high quality.</li>
            <li> I didnt want to spend too much money on new clippers and These clippers were priced very well.....</li>
            <li> it has a lot of different prices to it to assure we can get the right cut!</li>
            <li> The cutting guides are good, and the clipper is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive hands thanks to rheumatoid arthritis, and these clippers do not hurt me to use unless I&#x27;m having a real flare, and when that happens, I cannot even hold cotton candy without hurting, so</li>
            <li> so I finally broke down and bought my own thank you very much</li>
            <li> Dry was fine, though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Wahl still makes good clippers, but it is clear that they are cutting corners on their cheaper models.</li>
            <li> It is very sad, I never had a Wahl and my Barbers always mentioned it as the best.</li>
            <li> NOT too loud or too hot when operated.</li>
            <li> I usually cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> But this is the first one that completely stopped working w/o warning (no loudness/chattering beforehand).  </li>
            <li> This was my first pair of clippers and I was pleasantly surprised - the clippers are sturdy, and get the job done well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty complete set</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when I first use them, its noise is too loud.</li>
            <li> They perform like professional clippers costing 4-5 times as much money!  </li>
            <li> Con: -It was loud, at first.</li>
            <li> so i Got this product with really good reviews , but when i used it ,it started making weird loud sound which is unbearable .</li>
            <li> but overall, not bad.</li>
            <li> My last set was 2+ years old, and I never oiled them and they were still kicking just fine.</li>
            <li> so when you set it down make sure the cover is face up.</li>
            <li> My clippers were a little noisy right out of the box but after dropping some of the lube they supplied it turned out fine and it slices through hair like nothing.</li>
            <li> is well made, solid, and perfect for personal use as it has all kind of accessories, I started cutting my own hair last month with this product, is a hard thing to do and the results are not what I expected, but i&#x27;m sure I will improve my skills.</li>
            <li> Only con so far is that it gets hot quite quickly.</li>
            <li> All new barbers and home cutters (MAYBE EVEN PROS) should buy this clipper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still surprised by how many accessories they were able to cram into such a small box</li>
            <li> 6 flat tops with it so far, and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Still works great after almost a year, can&#x27;t say if it would hold up to commercial use but for my personal use it is still sharp and cuts great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was going to the barber, paying $20 to get his hair buzzed every couple of months, and more than half the time, he came home hating the hair cut anyway.</li>
            <li> Just be careful as the plastic cover has teeth that chip easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a serious complaint, but it would have been nice for the whole set to be there.</li>
            <li> Has a wide variety of settings and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the Wahl clippers are quite a bit heavier and vibrate more than my previous ConAir clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have used this set for many years now, and typically every 2 years</li>
            <li> I previously had a better (to me)</li>
            <li> The clipper itself is of a decent weight and feels very durable and sturdily built with a powerful motor (a big difference between the ones made in China).</li>
            <li> Bought this for the same price as a smaller Wahl  kit, this one has more extras.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for body hair grooming</li>
            <li> Next one I was sure about the power outlet, but it is the same noise.</li>
            <li> The combs included are really useful and the directions are clear and concise.</li>
            <li> For the cost, this is a decent clipper.  </li>
            <li> I did a decent job considering the size of these clippers.  </li>
            <li> There is simply no reason to spend any more money on a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> For the price I am able to save $20.00 + per month on cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a high-quality hair clippers at a decent price</li>
            <li> A quick disclaimer, I only shave my head (no guard on the clippers)</li>
            <li> would definitely buy again, as this has many attachments to use for all kinds of different hair styles and lengths.  </li>
            <li> Bought to replace an older Wahl electric I had for over 10 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took me a couple weeks of daily looking &amp; reading to finally pick this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is the carrying case could be larger and more organizational, as everything is cramped into it.</li>
            <li> For questions of how close these cut, you have to understand that decent quality clippers have 2 screws affixing the to blade.</li>
            <li> It has enough guides to do many different length cuts.  </li>
            <li> Much quieter than his old one, and much lighter.  </li>
            <li> but i was also being realistic with my expectation.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping to come out looking somewhat decent from a DIY haircut.  </li>
            <li> Decent product..</li>
            <li> main thing to keep in mind</li>
            <li> /&gt;-No hassle waiting in shop and waiting for the one or two decent</li>
            <li> The only con I can see with this product is that this is more of a trimming kit than haircut kit, but can still be used to cut your hair if you are looking to trim it only and not cut it with scissors.</li>
            <li> I can quickly do my entire head and not worry about going over the same spot so many times.</li>
            <li> Motor is nothing like the older one&#x27;s, this one has power and cuts</li>
            <li> The main cutter seems to be made of metal instead of plastiic.  </li>
            <li> If you want to save money as well as get a decent haircut then get one of these.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for years and the Wahl cuts my hair better then</li>
            <li> for the older, bushy eyebrow gals--and guys--not that I&#x27;m one of those ;</li>
            <li> for the older, bushy eyebrow gals--and guys--not that I&#x27;m one of those ;</li>
            <li> Now I will have to wait several more weeks before I can use them again - because there is nothing left to cut.  </li>
            <li> I had another pair of Wahl clippers from several years back and even like this pair better.  </li>
            <li> You get better at cutting your own hair every time you do so</li>
            <li> The main unit, one comb, scissors, brush, and cape is all I need.  </li>
            <li> Works perfect for cutting my 3 year old sons hair.</li>
            <li> I quickly put it back in the package and returned it.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for side burns.</li>
            <li> It WAS VERY VERY LOUD VIBRATED MY WHOLE FACE AND ARM.</li>
            <li> Super high quality, will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very surprised !</li>
            <li> My usage is very simple: I bought it to keep my haircut to the lowest (meaning the limit between shaving my head completely and having a little millimeters of hair, military style), and it gets the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend, with no prior background in cutting men&#x27;s hair, uses them like a pro and saves us $20 every month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed how sturdy the clippers felt when I first opened the box.</li>
            <li> It feels really sturdy and I&#x27;m sure this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> High quality for the price and made in USA.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wahl cutter is not unpleasantly loud and cuts cleanly without pulling.</li>
            <li> and if I want to get it fixed I will have to pay for the shipping to the manufacturer and the return postage which is about $5 short of the original cost.</li>
            <li> Get some other kind of detail buzzer for the back of your neck.</li>
            <li> I bought this as new one and, for roughly the same price, it feels much more substanial and of a higher quality.  </li>
            <li> Clippers can be a bit loud at certain times.</li>
            <li> So, read the manual a little more.</li>
            <li> They also include everything you could possible need for the whole process!!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend saving up a little more and get something rated for barbers.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE sticking out my little chest and telling them, &amp;#34;Thank</li>
            <li> We get better cleaning results using a can of compressed air instead of that little brush.</li>
            <li> Its working frequency is fixed, not 50/60 Hz!!</li>
            <li> as well i think its a little heavier duty than most.</li>
            <li> A little more practice...</li>
            <li> This does not mean that any fur longer than 3/4\\&quot; will be cut...</li>
            <li> I wish the motor were a little more powerful,but it still does what I ask it to do.  </li>
            <li> Many blade choices and the combs help too although one of the combs I received was a little bent...</li>
            <li> The first one actually worked quite well, which is why I ordered a second one, when the original was dropped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wish though that Wahl would make some more attachments in just a little longer lengths.</li>
            <li> Older models feel more sturdy and heavy duty while this one feels like it has cheaper plastic.</li>
            <li> This is a well built hair cutting kit at a very good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Power switch is flimsy and other reviews tell of it easily</li>
            <li> Has a nice hard case but its all just thrown in the case.</li>
            <li> These clippers come in a nice hard plastic storage case and include a variety of guards, brushes, scissors, etc.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times were a little &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; because they do make a noise and are pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product is great and does everything you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> My dad&#x27;s old Wahl cuts much closer.</li>
            <li> It really feels professional when you use it.</li>
            <li> the clerk seemed really surprised that i didn&#x27;t want to cough up that much money for a</li>
            <li> The first 9 months of cutting my hair and my brothers hair, it was great.</li>
            <li> It is loud, but really, does that matter?</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too loud and cut really well, no tugs, or rips.</li>
            <li> Came complete and fast,  and till this day still works gets its use each week with 3 boys in the house</li>
            <li> Over all, this is a great product and you won&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> far they work very well</li>
            <li> I use it on my 3 year old son and he doesn&#x27;t complain and it cuts so fast.  </li>
            <li> It has a SOLID build and lot&#x27;s of useful</li>
            <li> If I had to do it over, I would wait and spend a few $$ more on a set that includes a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very noisey and after a short period of use they become extremely hot.</li>
            <li> Went from the back forward throughout the whole cut and after putting some styling mousse through my hair I was amazed at how well my first cut turned out.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Using different attachments , I had my daughter trim the back and top for a complete haircut .</li>
            <li> I have only used it few times but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I had to buy one of my own, and I have saved at least the cost of what I paid for it in haircuts this year alone.</li>
            <li> Maybe others are normal, either way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet, but has a powerful motor.</li>
            <li> but maybe only 2 or 3 of them are useful the rest if just junk that you will end up throwing away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a guy with a normal haircut</li>
            <li> i used it only once and will use it again on sunday, but for using it for the first time, it cuts and trims very well.</li>
            <li> Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat for this unit, I would guess it&#x27;s a few bucks more in a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, but they aren&#x27;t loud enough that I would complain or make a big deal about it...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gone through quite a few clipper sets but this one is of much better quality.</li>
            <li> it is heavy and bulky, and is not cordless (we should&#x27;ve paid more attention before buying it).</li>
            <li> The actual clippers work nicely but it&#x27;s not worth what I paid for this set.</li>
            <li> Definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> and they still work like normal,</li>
            <li> i have cut my own hair with this thing twice now and even my old retired usmc boss likes the results...and he usually doesn&#x27;t like anything i do</li>
            <li> After using the product only once, I find that it is not cutting and tends to snag the hair.  </li>
            <li> I will update this review if I do someone&#x27;s thick locks and have problems but so far I am very satisfied with this clipper set.</li>
            <li> Feels more heavy duty than the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything that comes in the box is useful for personal use or in a barbershop.</li>
            <li> For the record, my hair is kind of thick</li>
            <li> Well... its good... not great.</li>
            <li> This product is efficient and easy to use, and I got a very neat beard trim with little effort.</li>
            <li> I buzz my own hair down with it, though it tends to take quite a number of passes before the hair is actually</li>
            <li> We were both surprised at how well this kit worked - definitely professional quality!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to switch back to the old set, which I&#x27;m glad I kept, and maybe keep the new set as a backup.  </li>
            <li> A good piece at very low cost, but its very heavy and vibrates ​harder while using.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use, and all the different guides are extremely helpful.  </li>
            <li> Walh would not cut hair (Not dull, would not cut hair at all) and even tried adjusting blade alignment per manual.</li>
            <li> The razor worked well for the first couple hair cuts but quickly stopped cutting effectively.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover is pretty flimsy and it could use a brush for cleaning off the tools afterwards, but luckily I had these left over from my last haircutting kit.</li>
            <li> Needed new clippers because mine were old and ready to be retired.</li>
            <li> professional And High quality hair cutter, but a little bit heavy its perfect for hair shop not for daily use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for almost 10years off and on so these are smooth,fairly quieted easy to use.</li>
            <li> I decided at the price trying these made far more sense that paying half of what they cost for one hair cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Me and my better half are not hairstylists or professional in any way shape or form.  </li>
            <li> less then 30 minutes later both boys were done and loving their hair cuts.  </li>
            <li> I just started cutting my own hair and these clippers made it really easy.</li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long, the trimmers are relatively quiet, and it all comes in a nice carry container made of hard plastic that helps keep the product relatively organized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a big deal, since the price is right....</li>
            <li> He obviously likes it, and for me, the price was right.</li>
            <li> left and right side trimming unit does not match with 1 and 2, which suppose to be used together with side unit.</li>
            <li> It also comes with one for the left and right ears and one for the eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> They give you all the necessary tools to cut the hair, it&#x27;s just going to take practice before you get it right.</li>
            <li> , I found the Right and Left taper combs to cut around the ear.</li>
            <li> There is a left and right ear attachment that you circle the ear with</li>
            <li> An adapter for around right and left ear - Eyebrows - beard.</li>
            <li> If you hold it just right, you can get it to be fairly quiet.  </li>
            <li> I told her we are going to get a HUMAN CLIPPER right now</li>
            <li> The ear tapering attachment will cut short unless you do it right way.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this new set, is much better quality than his previous and cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a shot after weighing the negative reviews against the positive ones and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It seemed about half as strong as the first one, could barely cut through hair after 2 months, and by the end was pulling hair out of my beard.</li>
            <li> When I use trimmer my single most important requirement, other than it should actually trim, is  it should not have any pull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing pays for itself pretty much on the first haircut...and then saves you $50/month, or $600/year (net, post-tax), or about $1000/year gross income.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of cutting my own hair, I&#x27;m much happier - being able to cut my hair every two weeks so that it always looks neat and trimmed, just the way I like it - without constantly flushing money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, who wants to start cutting my own hair to save money and give myself hair cuts more often.</li>
            <li> They definitely aren&#x27;t for shaving without using a guard; the unit is loud because the blades are sharp and moving very fast and would love to chew up soft flesh if given the opportunity.</li>
            <li> The Wahl is not near as loud as the Con Air, but it&#x27;s not the most quiet set of clippers either.  </li>
            <li> My only real dissatisfaction is that the case it came in was way too small to give any kind of organization to it.</li>
            <li> I did notice my number 2 doesn&#x27;t fit as snug as the other pieces, you can&#x27;t tell by looking or feeling it though.  </li>
            <li> They seem a bit heavy, and I am pretty sure the \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; cover is painted plastic.. but its the internal components that I am concerned about.. not the cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WARNING best friends are not good at cutting hair, don&#x27;t be fooled by their confidence :)</li>
            <li> Other than that I really enjoy the product</li>
            <li> The blades are well fit and sharp.  </li>
            <li> it becouse I live in Brasil.</li>
            <li> I got my husband this as one of his birthday gifts since he had been mentioning needing a new one.</li>
            <li> The clippers looked they were used already, even though i brought them new.</li>
            <li> Was this a refurbished device being sold as new ?</li>
            <li> These are the dullest blades I have ever had on a new wahl clipper set.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had for 3 years is sharper than this new one.  </li>
            <li> Brand new out of the box</li>
            <li> new one thinking it was faulty</li>
            <li> live in Angola, waited a lot of to but hands on it, i don&#x27;t wanna blow it away.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> 5 stars besides being used when I was told it was new.</li>
            <li> I had one trimmer of this brand since 7 years ago, and I decided to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Oh and mine seemed brand new</li>
            <li> Still like new</li>
            <li> I live in New Zealand where the volagr output is 220/230v.</li>
            <li> I get a new set (I cut my hair every week...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product on a weekly basis and it still performing like it was brand new</li>
            <li> Still fairly new</li>
            <li> Never had an issue, it continues to live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> We needed a new razor for my husband and my sons haircuts.</li>
            <li> I bought the new set for myself, but decided to give it to my son who was headed to college.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this if you live or are going to use this product in Australia.</li>
            <li> I figured I could use some of that money I saved to buy my wife a new set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> We are not eligible for Amazon refund because the return time has expired and it is not in new condition.  </li>
            <li> Probably needs a new head or something.  </li>
            <li> I live in Europe but purchased this from US.</li>
            <li> I needed a new set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> Husband needed new clippers.</li>
            <li> This new Wahl clipper replaced a Wahl clipper which was given to us new in about 1961.  </li>
            <li> i have been using this for a around two months now and its good no major issues yet.its feels very heavy duty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very sharp.</li>
            <li> The next pair I bought him was from Costco, they may be just a cheap, but I least they have easy returns.</li>
            <li> But as long as you keep the blades clean after use and free from moisture it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They cut cleanly without any pulling and the wide variety of guides makes a haircut a breeze.  </li>
            <li> It nicked up my scalp, left visible red marks, and left me in pain, particularly around my hairline at the top of my neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years ( and friends that want a free dew).</li>
            <li> 14 more word required is stupid and not needed to  make a good review</li>
            <li> The clippers are a nice hefty size but they&#x27;re comfortable and I had no problem holding them and cutting with them.</li>
            <li> I was replacing my old cutters because they were missing a lot of hairs (no matter how many times I went over the section)</li>
            <li> After cutting my own hair just three times it had already paid for itself, and that&#x27;s assuming a fairly cheap haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is for a previously asked question from a reviewer, for people like me with close hair cuts, perfect, only con, the taper lever(the plastic lever that makes the blades go up and down very cheap and made of poor plastic material.</li>
            <li> I went into the market ready to spend much more than I did, knowing I&#x27;d be saving money in the long run, but multiple reviews from various other, more expensive razors pointed towards this one and after heavy use I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty quiet compared to some other cheap ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> High quality, was surprised how well made and versatile.</li>
            <li> Very complete kit</li>
            <li> At the moment it makes a VERY LOUD noise, which would make it unbearable to use.</li>
            <li> I have been very surprised as how well these clippers have lasted.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a very old Wahl brand trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very loud.</li>
            <li> Yet like a monster, this thing is very loud.</li>
            <li> The guard settings (1,2,3, etc.) seem a little longer than the ones my barber uses but other than that, it does a good job</li>
            <li> Overall pleased with the product - my only complaint is that it&#x27;s incredibly heavy and the plastic protector pieces could fit better</li>
            <li> chord is just long enough that you can get around easily without tripping over it.</li>
            <li> These puppies ARE THAT LOUD!</li>
            <li> This piece of machinery fits the bill, and my wife is a natural!</li>
            <li> Other than that, the are well worth the money!</li>
            <li> But the cheap guard really ruins the product.</li>
            <li> At first after I did the back</li>
            <li> It still works, but for the first 30 seconds it hummed quietly.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid clippers.</li>
            <li> Been satified so far!</li>
            <li> It was evidently the last one they had in stock</li>
            <li> I have had NO PROBLEMS with it so far!</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have owned since the first one finally stopped working after so much use!</li>
            <li> You get more attachements and combs than you&#x27;ll ever need, a cleaning brush and a small container of oil.</li>
            <li> Before returning it I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and WOW!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However did get hot after maybe only 10 minutes use.</li>
            <li> I just got this two days ago and gave myself my first hair cut last night.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Now I have to send them back &amp; will only be reimbursed $15 for shipping when it will likely cost more than double that much from Australia &amp; I should be compensated for the harm done to my ears!</li>
            <li> I wear my hair pretty short</li>
            <li> No more sitting around waiting in a haircut salon for a crummy cut or paying through the nose for a slightly better cut.</li>
            <li> Got this one as a replacement, and if it lasts as long, its well worth it.  </li>
            <li> pretty old&lt;br /&gt;these have a longer guard than where sold with clippers back then.</li>
            <li> Although this is a relatively cheap product, the quality of the materials was below average.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend starting out with a higher number attachment, like I did, just to test out the length.  </li>
            <li> We love the fact that with the Wahl Haircut Kit, it will pay for itself in just a few hair cuts!  </li>
            <li> so I finally got this product and gave him his first haircut at home.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used these, they only cut 50% of the hairs in one pass.</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty solid cut.</li>
            <li> Although i&#x27;ve never personally used a more expensive one, I don&#x27;t see a need for a better clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought better Wahl kits in the past.</li>
            <li> I am finally the barber I always wants to be!</li>
            <li> My stylist wife has owned a set of these clippers since we were married almost ten years ago.  </li>
            <li> but WOW!</li>
            <li> I wish the switch was more like a traditional on/off or some other design that was easier to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything you need to get a pretty standard fade gentleman style.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is truly a complete hair grooming kit!  </li>
            <li> It is too loud for me!</li>
            <li> 5 stars simply because it works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I usually get buzz cuts and didn&#x27;t want to have to pay $10 a haircut any more.</li>
            <li> complaint, these have a very strong vibration which causes a loud noise when operating.  </li>
            <li> My first haircut was not very good, the 2nd much better.</li>
            <li> The attachments are a bit poor quality   Significant sound when switched on but its not as loud as others say</li>
            <li> I followed some online instructions to carefully lap the blades on a nice, flat honing stone, and then oiled and put them back together.  </li>
            <li> As many other reviews have stated already, it leaves a lot of hair behind even after many passes.  </li>
            <li> Whoever stated that it was so loud their neighbors were complaining, must live in a cardboard box.</li>
            <li> Cuts smooth again when slightly raised.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, sturdy, long lasting do it yourself kit for your monthly grooming needs</li>
            <li> the plastic parts do not fit too easily in the carrying case.</li>
            <li> i order this and in the first use it made a loud noise and sent it back, it did not work.</li>
            <li> Clippers do not get hot after several uses and is built like in the old days according to the user.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if they last as long as my previous ConAir clippers, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been trained in cutting hair and my boys looks pretty good when I&#x27;m finished with them.  </li>
            <li> This one is heavy and strong.</li>
            <li> have other Wahl products that are even more dissapointing, such as a nose hair trimmer that depending how you hold it will decide if it wants to work or not (been that way since day 1) and a smaller touch up trimmer that needs to be push started by hand by moving the blade to get it going.</li>
            <li> This has a very powerful motor and the clippers are very sharp.</li>
            <li> On a positive note its actually made in the USA.</li>
            <li> the positive, I tested it for a second.  </li>
            <li> also doesn&#x27;t seem to have come with a #2 length blade, so either I cut it pretty short or pretty long.</li>
            <li> Gives a good cut but not able to cut short enough</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;d be easier to just get a whole new set then to replace individual guards.  </li>
            <li> We had a cheap haircut kit that we bought at Walmart and it didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> If you loosen these guys, you can push the top blade back and tighten with less clearance for a zero cut.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I&#x27;ll cut the head, but I&#x27;m not super skilled -</li>
            <li> My current wahl is 30 years old and clip on guides are showing their age, so I&#x27;m ready for new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these twice so far, but my experience with them have been positive.</li>
            <li> great bargain!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its not a professional machine, its written on the back of the machine only for home use, only regrets, its not dual voltage</li>
            <li> clippers are LOUD, yes, not extremely loud, but a loud enough &amp;#34;buzzzzzzzzzz&amp;#34; But that loud buzz makes me feel like the clippers have power to them and isn&#x27;t some cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> However, the guides are pretty adequate, and as long as you aren&#x27;t rough with them</li>
            <li> I have been to 2 or 3 large beauty supply stores and probably 29 different locations between Houston and LA.</li>
            <li> This Kit gives you such a large choice of attachments.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I literally cannot figure out what the difference is between certain models, but I selected these over the Home Pro model because with the Amazon coupon there was only a 4 dollar difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The accessories are a little cheap.</li>
            <li> one of my attachments cracked a little bit where you take it off, but it&#x27;s plastic and a really cheap set.</li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly the blades are real sharp</li>
            <li> As long as you clean and oil this, it will last for years.</li>
            <li> These clippers seem to be very well made, a little hard for me to turn on, but otherwise they do a good job.</li>
            <li> After buying this I will have to consider spending a little more next time.  </li>
            <li> I decided i wanted to spend a little more for quality to make them last this time.</li>
            <li> I have my wife come back and trim it out a little to make sure everything looks even and</li>
            <li> Okay, sometimes I need a little help with the back!</li>
            <li> Also, I could stand for it to have a little more power especially considering the fact that it works off of the wall outlet.</li>
            <li> Add a little oil occasionally and you won&#x27;t need to buy another for many years.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve given myself around ten pretty decent haircuts (that is to say, this thing has paid for itself ten times over).</li>
            <li> The on-off switch has way too much resistance, and it randomly turns off during use unless I hold the switch in a certain way which makes using it that much more cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Compared to the only other clippers I&#x27;ve used these are quite and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> 23 y/o male who wanted to start cutting his own hair to control quality and try new cuts without paying every time i want try something new or just do a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> These were a huge upgrade and were a lot more efficient when it came to cutting.  </li>
            <li> This is a great kit for cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li> My wife has always done a great job cutting all our families hair.</li>
            <li> Great value for amatuer hair cutting.  </li>
            <li> Great Hair Cutting Kit..saves me lots of money.  </li>
            <li> this is a great kit, everything you need for cutting hair and trimming.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll start cutting hair on the side, lol.</li>
            <li> It works great, even though I am clueless about cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this is a great value and works for cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t follow any of the instructions that came with it but cutting my friend&#x27;s hair turned out great.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this great mchine in terms of hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times cutting my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I already owned a Wahl mustache trimmer and despite my horrific care of the product, it still functions great after many years.</li>
            <li> The clippers are slighlty heavy but the soft ergonomic grip is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, especially if you&#x27;re in the military.</li>
            <li> The case is kept closed by a plastic latch which has a cheap plastic strip hinge instead of a proper hinge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off let me clear the air on some confusion.</li>
            <li> I would have to run my old clippers over my hair over and over.  </li>
            <li> It is also a lot quieter than my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> Not as loud as some reviews indicate.  </li>
            <li> had a different make clipper with a ceramic blade, this cuts much better.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li> So loud I stop use it</li>
            <li> These clippers are so loud that they are unusable.</li>
            <li> Had to finish the whole process to the same length.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl for years</li>
            <li> B000FJ17N0 WAHL Professional 2 Hole Precision Clipper Blade (Model:1045-100)]].  </li>
            <li> so I used a pair of old clippers that we used to use on my families show cattle.  </li>
            <li> Ordering printer cartriges through Amazon is much easier and the same price and running around.</li>
            <li> Our old clippers were burning out so I bought another one from the store.</li>
            <li> The Unit seems robust, ergonomic and professional in terms of build quality.</li>
            <li> I might just have to buy another one of those...unless Wahl decided to decrease the product as a lot of companies tend to do nowadays thanks to Amazon&#x27;s neglection to inform consumers that the 5-star product might not be the same product in terms of materials and design.</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had is the #1 guard wants to come off while using it.  </li>
            <li> It still works but is loud.</li>
            <li> My old wahl set</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old set of clippers that started pulling hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job so far.</li>
            <li> I like the variety of attachments to cut varying lengths of hair with complete ease.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda loud if noise is one of your pet-peeve.</li>
            <li> It cuts like professional hair clippers</li>
            <li> and I still use this kit frequently.</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite hair trimmer I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are much heavier than my last pair, and hopefully that equates to durability.</li>
            <li> but wow, it felt like I placed a massager on my head.  </li>
            <li> I could also tell it did not catch and pull the hair like my old set was doing.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot under long use, but works well.</li>
            <li> but it does get hot if you use it for too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking extremely loud.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with an instruction booklet that teaches you how to achieve a professional looking haircut.  </li>
            <li> I have been giving myself haircuts since I purchased it, and have used it frequently without issue.  </li>
            <li> Not some cheap, gimmicky clipper that rotates or goes cordless.</li>
            <li> Feels professional, just like the barber shop.  </li>
            <li> , it makes a loud</li>
            <li> All parts seem to be manufactured well, the handset does not get hot, the cord is quite long.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t keep the hair off the blades and oil it frequently, it will get loud and vibrate like a dildo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300 400 Color Complete Haircutting]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> young lady who did my hair for over 20 years is not doing my bald head</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Replaced my Oster clippers (10 yrs old) with these.</li>
            <li> Never had a Wahl before, so when I got rid of my old (carpy)</li>
            <li> and so far the clippers are doing well.</li>
            <li> i have been through a lot of cutters and there just are none that work like professional ones.  </li>
            <li> I knew the Wahl name from my old barber and from a pair of clippers my mother had as I grew up, so</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t a barbershop professional grade trimmer since that is NOT what they are.  </li>
            <li> his old one was litterally ripping his hair out.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said it was unusually loud, but I didn&#x27;t notice any issues with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband and I both shave our heads and we wanted a sturdy model to replace our old plastic Wahl.  </li>
            <li> far as price is concerned</li>
            <li> The build quality is solid and like I mentioned before it has proven to be very durable even after extended usage.</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with the standard set of hair combs.</li>
            <li> my 2 year old son used to cry a lot while going out for hair cut...</li>
            <li> Well, These do work like the Pro Clippers of old.</li>
            <li> The whole kit comes with several extensions and &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair maybe 10-12 times so far with zero issues.</li>
            <li> I was greatly surprised at the quality of the unit.</li>
            <li> It is a professional level unit with attachments for everything.....</li>
            <li> Shopping early does not always pay.</li>
            <li> this product was extremely loud to a point where my family downstairs could hear the noise.</li>
            <li> it being loud when i sud just have had to plug and play with no complications.</li>
            <li> So far did not face any problem with it.</li>
            <li> The loud noise, and the vibrating take NOTHING away from this</li>
            <li> I have owned this set for what&#x27;s gotta be nearly 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I used it to cut my 21 month old son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This set of clippers has served me well, using them every two weeks for nearly 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have used them for near a year and have no complaints of signs of wear.  </li>
            <li> All in all, my hair looks like it was professionally done.  </li>
            <li> and my old Wahl was going out.  </li>
            <li> brother trims his hair with it frequently and it works</li>
            <li> Not as loud as the my old clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything else in the kit felt well made, and you really get everything you need to give someone a basic hair cut.</li>
            <li> It cuts just as well as the others and, naturally, the noise disappears as soon as it&#x27;s against your head.  </li>
            <li> took it for personal use and I was not expecting so much accessories in it.</li>
            <li> Lighter than my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li> Assume it will work as well as the old one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s professional one.</li>
            <li> Inflation is still going on, the old set was about $7.00.</li>
            <li> So far it has lasted two haircuts.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my 10 year old Wahl clippers with these.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit in order to cut my three year old son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> If use it for a long time, it will be hot.  </li>
            <li> I got this Wahl haircut kit to replace an old one that wasn&#x27;t working so well anymore.</li>
            <li> The clipper and combs cut evenly and professional looking.</li>
            <li> After that was done, I took off the combs and with the help of a mirror, used the clipper to trim the side angles of the back and a straight line across the bottom.</li>
            <li> Tried it this morning, soft trim experience.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> We have saved hundreds on haircuts so far.</li>
            <li> (The only piece I didn&#x27;t like was the ear peice that&#x27;s supposed to cut around the ears as I didn&#x27;t think it did much for my son.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is loud.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overly loud either,</li>
            <li> The thickest (and highest numbered) attachment will leave the hair longer as you glide the unit along the scalp and the head should be divided up into three sections with the neckline and ear area as one section or swath, the mid head the second swath, encircling the middle of the skull, and the top area the third section.  </li>
            <li> WOW WOW...</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old clippers that stopped working</li>
            <li> I used a rechargeable Remington trimmer for a few years to trim my hair, this was a fantastic upgrade</li>
            <li> far as I&#x27;m concerned the Chrome Pro clippers work like a charm.  </li>
            <li> even my 5 year old didn&#x27;t seem to mind them buzzing around his ears.  </li>
            <li> They were so loud that you could probably hear them 2 houses away.  </li>
            <li> My wife used #3,4,5 to cut my hair twice and it looked professionally done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, works very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 3 trims so far on my husband &amp; son &amp; it&#x27;s met all our needs.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the blades on my old ones seemed to be dulling</li>
            <li> It does not give me a very close shave when I want the hair on my head to be very short.</li>
            <li> Wow- bought this 3 years ago and forgot to leave a review.</li>
            <li> , I want well shaved completely and this one works well on me.</li>
            <li> When my old Conair died, which I&#x27;ve had for 20 years, I purchased another at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Complete dud</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just realized how much money these clippers have saved me and they definitely payed themselves off.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so quiet, and cut really well.  </li>
            <li> so I gave up and got out my old clippers to finish the job.....</li>
            <li> They are reliable, professional tools.</li>
            <li> Then you&#x27;re in for a wild ride.</li>
            <li> It cuts completely, so there&#x27;s no need for repeated strokes.</li>
            <li> have an old (5yrs)</li>
            <li> My 21/2 year old son will not sit for a scissors hair cut</li>
            <li> As a final note, this razor can&#x27;t even get very close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t too loud, either.</li>
            <li> ( he was a professional barber) and it is ancient but still works like a charm.</li>
            <li> They are not heavy to hold while using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It just simply works very well.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time last week and to my surprise, got exactly what I expected from a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> bit loud</li>
            <li> After I began using this clipper I noticed that it&#x27;s quite loud..</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s horribly loud, also alot of vibration.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re loud, but what clippers aren&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> B007ROCZVY Salon Sundry Professional Hair Salon Nylon Cape with Snap Closure - 50\\</li>
            <li> Its lighter than my old clippers and lot sharper</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell I haven&#x27;t been to my old barber.</li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl that I used for my husband and son.</li>
            <li> It was 34 years old -</li>
            <li> not too loud.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, they are heavy, sturdy and did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> It is much quieter than our last set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have used this once so far to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The only criticism is the inclusion of a very flimsy drape.  </li>
            <li> they are really really loud.</li>
            <li> too loud.</li>
            <li> way to loud.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save money.</li>
            <li> I wish they were metal like the Oster Professional</li>
            <li> After the storm i used the old Wahl once.</li>
            <li> We bought this set to replace some of her professional clippers that have worn out.  </li>
            <li> The clipper is lighter than the old one and cuts well</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Conair unit with this one.</li>
            <li> totally worth of the money we have spent.</li>
            <li> Fantastic buy, I bought to replace my eight year old Remington as plastic pieces broke or missing.</li>
            <li> The cape that came with the kit is more like a garbage bag, and it only lasted a few haircuts before it broke.</li>
            <li> Only notable issue with was a misalignment with the blade head, which I noticed after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> like:&lt;br /&gt;-it was fun cutting my own hair</li>
            <li> Love the kit and clippers but the included scissors broke after only a few hair cuts.</li>
            <li> There is a fair amount of vibration but not so much that I worry about cutting his ear off.  </li>
            <li> The case is big enough to easily fit all the pieces without having to worry about enough room to close it, but it&#x27;s still quite small for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> I was right, because it died completely after only the third time I used it.  </li>
            <li> This is where I noticed that the right side of my head is bald further back than it should be.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used three, the second shortest and the left and right behind-the-ear trimmers.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that is weird is the on/off switch seems like it could have been designed better but nothing significant to stop you from buying.</li>
            <li> Today, I bought the Wahl Color Pro because this clipper is now useless, and it is the same exact product, except cheaper and has a plastic finish and more colors instead!</li>
            <li> Much better than the trimmers I&#x27;ve bought in the past!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had so many hair clippers in the past and this one stacks up beyond belief!</li>
            <li> instructions are clear and easy to understand and follow, the results look professional, it takes less time than you would have to wait for your turn at the barbershop and pays for itself the second time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat though.  </li>
            <li> Pls do not buy wahl products in case you will not able to return it as me - its easy to throw out this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other brand clippers break on me within 2 years, so I feel like I&#x27;m getting my moneys worth on these so far.    </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cheapnees feeling of the guards themselves, but they fit on the trimmer well and they do not need to be anything special so its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s a very nice set and works well for its designed purpose, but if you plan on cutting poodle hair with it (like I did), you may want to rethink it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe it (especially step #6 where it tells you to use a guide with number one above than the one you used #step 3; I&#x27;d say try two to three numbers higher than in #step3 at least or better, just use a shearing scissor to trim the top/front of the head).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I was done with both ears, I put the number six comb on the clipper (they change out instantly) and starting at the front of my hair, cut straight back at first as the hair fell off.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t rinse it with water, clean it out using the little brush.</li>
            <li> The green 0.5 guard would be very nice, but it has a little trouble staying attached to the clippers and makes a funny noise because it rattles a bit.  </li>
            <li> I have used them with the assistance of my girlfriend on three occasions to trim my back and sides of my hair, whilst keeping a long center region to be able to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also useful for trimming my beard as well as hair in other locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a buzz cut, so eventually I thought to myself that paying for a buzz cut is a waste of money since I&#x27;m a full time college student and don&#x27;t make much money because I only work part-time.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, powerful clippers with a selection of guards, scissors, combs and other accessories.</li>
            <li> Powerful and sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have thicker curly hair and this is powerful enough to cut right through it with out making there usual loud noise of Stop</li>
            <li> Figured I give Wahl a try to replace my 5 year old Remington since it did not seem it was cutting as good as new and blades</li>
            <li> The scissors and combs get the job done and although they are not top quality they are fine for home use.</li>
            <li> I needed to do several passes to get all the hair - which is pretty standard for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start cutting my own hair and these have made it super simple.</li>
            <li> This product cuts decent enough but upon opening the box and turning it on i found out</li>
            <li> However, you have to go over the same spot 2-3 times to get a decent even cut with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty simple, so I only use one guard.</li>
            <li> I usually do a straight shave with no attachments, and after several passes using this product, barely any hair was removed.</li>
            <li> the operation is smooth, not loud, and the vibration is minimal.</li>
            <li> I had an el cheapo unit for about 5 years until I finally decided to get a decent unit.</li>
            <li> At first I was kind of nervous, but once I started cutting</li>
            <li> Mainly use for very short haircut, close to skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend you try the Wahl brand and more specifically, these clippers and for the price I am sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with Wahl in the past, but I will likely not buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This has a beefy feel to it compared to most other corded clippers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about home hair cutting, I&#x27;d suggest you add a nice pair of professional grade scissors and a few nice combs to this kit as the included pair are rather cheap.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend, especially for bodygrooming.</li>
            <li> I hope that Amazon goes back to its regularly high level of quality control.    </li>
            <li> this is a really nice hair cutting machine...... especially for its price, its really cheap but it not only does the job but exceeds...  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is very solid and high quality.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t get this high of quality for this low of a price when I was</li>
            <li> This set came highly recommended on multiple sites.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are on a budget and need something that can definitely handle any job you can throw at it.</li>
            <li> This is my second kit as it is easier to by a new kit than to deal with the attachments and blades when they get old.</li>
            <li> and these clippers are still cutting my hair and everyone in da fam just as good as new...</li>
            <li> cuts right through my long hair without a need for a 2nd pass through.  </li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s greatly and it&#x27;s not as heavy as other models in the market, my only concern is that after 15 or 20 minutes of use on my first try it started making a loud noise, i hope this doesn&#x27;t give me trouble in the future.</li>
            <li> The last thing you do is use the barber shears and styling comb to even out any cow licks and clean up around the ears.</li>
            <li> the downside, it is a bit heavy, which isn&#x27;t a problem for a strong guy like me, but I could see how it might be for a smaller, weaker person.</li>
            <li> The clippers themselves are fine, guide combs are plenty sturdy, the smaller sizes are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> huge waste of money!</li>
            <li> It comes with an assortment of attachments, even an illustration on cutting your own hair into a barber/salon type cut- which I will not try!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for Wahl, they have made such a great product that I don&#x27;t need to upgrade for several years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it runs smoothly and feels like a robust piece of equipment that should perform well for years to come.</li>
            <li> my surprise  for the first time this trim offered absolutely no pull at all.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the sample oil bottle is leaky and messy and the cutter gets pretty hot after a while.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what is expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate the skin with sharp points, does not get as hot as my old buzzer.  </li>
            <li> so be careful on giving a stroke on your head, just use the gauge 8 first then 7, 6 ,5 up to your desired length of hair.</li>
            <li> so i buy this set, treat it like garbage, and in 2-4 years when its had enough, i get another one for the price of 1 normal haircut at the barber</li>
            <li> Some of the clipper attachments chatter because they don&#x27;t fit on tight enough.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment if it&#x27;s great at chopping down long thick hair,  however,  </li>
            <li> Went down to the scalp with no cutting or scratching.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl clippers are much heavier and of a higher standard quality the previous clippers I have bought.</li>
            <li> Something about these combs they are hard to grasp hair easily.</li>
            <li> This is a good little haircutter, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> However after about 6 months of using it pretty consistently it started to get dull and eventually stopped working.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t loose power at certain angles like the cheapies can.</li>
            <li> My wife refuses to use the new set until I pull them apart and sharpen the blades the same way.  </li>
            <li> the only reason I gave it two stars is because it arrived on time and in new condition</li>
            <li> We attempted our second cut with the new Wahl today and it was a disaster.  </li>
            <li> I figured the new one would be solid as a clipper</li>
            <li> however the user manual is not that extensive so that a new user can use it straightaway.</li>
            <li> If only I was great at cutting hair now...</li>
            <li> Cutting my own hair now really looks like I got it done somewhere</li>
            <li> (really the only big gripe for me)  </li>
            <li> I was going to return it and just continue using my old connair, which even though is ten years old</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present &amp; from what I&#x27;m told, it makes my fiances various grooming needs much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> These clippers look and feel much more expensive than they really are.  </li>
            <li> To be clear, I like a very simple haircut that can almost completely be done with a clipper, but it does involve gradual changes in length.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well, has all the cutting guide combs you would ever need and a nice plastic case to store everything in.</li>
            <li> If you couldn&#x27;t do metal at this price, at least use a more solid and quality plastic.</li>
            <li> We had a Wahl product in the past and were quite pleased with it as it was sturdy, reliable and it lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and had really no trouble learning to use it.</li>
            <li> I found the construction to be distinctly shoddier than the black plastic Wahl clippers that I purchased 15 years</li>
            <li> As the voltage there is about 10% less than in the US (100V vs 110V), I wanted a powerful clipper to start as I was going to lose about 10% in efficiency.  </li>
            <li> Got super rusty after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> unfortunately that&#x27;s about the only thing that&#x27;s good about them.</li>
            <li> Also Its very loud when next to your ears.</li>
            <li> only complaint is they vibrate pretty heavily when compared to my old cordless trimmer, HOWEVER, these are by far beefier and better made.  </li>
            <li> They never get bogged down by my thick hair, and its easy enough for my to use on my own head.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time the other night.  </li>
            <li> I told my friends as a joke that me and my roommate would be giving each other haircuts and everyone was interested to see how I&#x27;d look after the weekend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely a must-have item for guys or girls who are interested in the female or male variety.</li>
            <li> Anxious to keep practicing and getting better at cutting my own hair</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item and tried it for the first time the other day.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I cut it a little shorter than originally planed but not as short as it could of been.</li>
            <li> Its not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still as sharp as the first day I got it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how appropriate this product would be if I was a professional hairdresser and expected to earn my living with it, but for DIY haircuts at home</li>
            <li> Clippers are very sharp and glide right through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Clippers are very sharp and glide right through the hair</li>
            <li> I bought these to save money on haircuts since I only ever get a buzz cut from SuperCuts and decided it was pointless to keep tossing $20 their way when I could do it myself just as easily.</li>
            <li> says it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to hold (the clippers, I mean).</li>
            <li> says it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to hold (the clippers, I mean).</li>
            <li> It was time I got new clippers as my old blades were starting to pull and the oil wasn&#x27;t doing enough for the blades.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t work, the package is unharmed for this reason it seems to me that the product was broken before it was put into the package, so i would liketo make a claim about this and ask for the better way to resolve this problem, it&#x27;s so dificult to me to send back the item because i live in venezuela.</li>
            <li> it more than I had expected I had looked at the same thing in Walmart and got this for less money</li>
            <li> It was really not a bad set of clippers and if ONLY my furbaby would cooperate he would look less like an escapee from a mental hospital and more like a little prince!  </li>
            <li> Huge vibration and noise, blades not cutting the hair, very poor quality in general.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and contains a large number of clipper guide/ combs.</li>
            <li> The first 4 cuts were horrible, but now I know how to cut my hair as good as my previous barber. :)</li>
            <li> This one is less than half the price and works better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a clean cut, you have to keep going over the same spot a few times.</li>
            <li> The tough part is fading the top and sides, but it gets easier with practice.  </li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far, except it does run a little hot after awhile.</li>
            <li> When using it to shave the neckline, it pulls rather than cuts, sound like a dull blade.</li>
            <li> The scissors it comes with are dull and cheap</li>
            <li> trims great just like at the barber when i was an ugly lil tike.</li>
            <li> I generally just sport a buzzcut so paying $30 a month to a barber to buzz my hair with clippers doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the durability of a couple of the battery trimmers, but I do love how light and maneuverable they are.</li>
            <li> Get a ceramic-bladed set; these types of clippers tend to perform better on cutting in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently shaved my head and my 1 year old boy needed a haircut, so I decided \\&quot;what the hell\\&quot; and made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recommending you buy these just to see how loud they actually are.  </li>
            <li> Wahl&#x27;s web site doesn&#x27;t provide much on specifications, but I found the Wahl global site that confirms the standard blade on this clipper cuts from 0.8mm to 2.5mm, though the blade number is different in this country:</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li> But was surprised to know that the product does not meet international standards.</li>
            <li> The quality is apparent in these clippers.</li>
            <li> but it still had the same loud noise.</li>
            <li> He has been professionally groomed several times but to reduce this expense I decided to take the job of grooming on myself.      </li>
            <li> It actually isn&#x27;t that loud at all.</li>
            <li> People in earlier reviews were saying that this was too loud of a product.</li>
            <li> I bought this wahl clipper to replace a ten year old \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; connair clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this unit one time thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra few dollars to get this kit instead of a cheaper one.</li>
            <li> Ultimately you need to take off all the guards and just cut directly with the metal</li>
            <li> The only thing that it needs for improvement would be having a clip that goes as far as the machines for shaving.</li>
            <li> So far that&#x27;s the only problem that i found.</li>
            <li> So the simple fix i had to place a piece of sponge between the metals and guess what it solved all my problems and the loud noise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I do very basic trimming work with it, but i&#x27;m surprised by the complaints about noise and vibration.</li>
            <li> We took it out again to cut my sons hair, and while doing the back of his hair near the neck these clippers cut him, never have I had clippers cut someone before like</li>
            <li> The only drawback was the loud rattling noise it made when I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old kit finally died so when I saw this was one of the highest rated ones on Amazon</li>
            <li> The only one that we have that comes close to being a well made clipper would be the old worn out 1960&#x27;s model year</li>
            <li> This replaced and old one of a different brand.</li>
            <li> Gave the same perfection as I get from a professional barber.</li>
            <li> the second time use...started making loud noise.  </li>
            <li> it was loud as a vibrator, and started to smoke, and almsot didn&#x27;t cut anything (and i have a japanese hair)</li>
            <li> My husband and 23 year old son had used the former for years.  </li>
            <li> have given only two haircuts so far</li>
            <li> I purchased these because my old 25 year-old clippers finally conked out.  </li>
            <li> They are solid, they feel like professional clippers.  </li>
            <li> This was a plus on price and quality, definitely recommend it whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it feels and cuts like a professional tool.</li>
            <li> I could barely even feel my hair being cut.</li>
            <li> Have a bunch of accessories that come with, but I&#x27;m a simple man and haven&#x27;t even bothered exploring them so far.  </li>
            <li> The package barely came today</li>
            <li> His old clippers finally bit the dust so after reading reviews, decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace a Conair haircut kit that was starting to get old.  </li>
            <li> First haircut last night, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> You know it is most irritating</li>
            <li> Well, this set is not doing any better (not any worse either)  </li>
            <li> My wife (who cuts my hair) mentioned it was heavier than my previous cutters and vibrates a little more</li>
            <li> It cuts great, usually I have to go over my hair a few times to get it down</li>
            <li> They would start breaking down after a few uses and make more noise than a lawnmower.</li>
            <li> My first usage with this thing cut me 3 times because it&#x27;s incredibly sharp!</li>
            <li> Not too heavy but heavy enough to be substantial and prove itself a worthy and useful.  </li>
            <li> if you do purchase, there&#x27;s a few easy to follow videos with nice tips, especially when cutting kids&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> The clipper is bit more cheaply built than the last one with lighter weight plastic housing, a smaller slide switch rather than heavy duty rocker style switch, and the new power cord is a standard flat electric cord rather than the old heavy duty round cord.</li>
            <li> After spending $30 on haircuts here in New York, I decided it was time for me to try cutting my own hair.  </li>
            <li> It has an amazing array of attachments all stamped with measurements so as to make the set less confusing to use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only been a few nicks which drew blood and a couple of bald patch incidents, but hey..hair grows  quickly doesn&#x27;t it?  </li>
            <li> Bought the clipper for our new dog that has long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The razor has enough horsepower to make cuts in a single pass or two and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I first had the Conair HCT495 in black for about three years</li>
            <li> it lasted less then 10 minutes before getting hot shutting off and smoke started to come out.</li>
            <li> I have had this unit for two weeks now and have no complaints, it seems to be holding up better than other units I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the actual product works really well!</li>
            <li> Works much better than other units I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Maybe because being new the blades are much sharper or maybe because I used all the guides I didn&#x27;t think I would use (left taper, tight taper, ear guide, eyebrow guide)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive and should last a long, long</li>
            <li> These are sharp and work very well.</li>
            <li> A little heavy, but can deal with that for the better quality.</li>
            <li> The first unit I received had a loud buzzing noise and misaligned blades that produced an uneven haircut, so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I carefully followed the instructions for oiling the blade, but the new set jammed several times on the first use.  </li>
            <li> I have a beard trimmer that is more powerful than this shaver; it&#x27;s THAT bad.  </li>
            <li> I use the 3 setting for the back and sides and the 8 for the top, and then I let the top grow out for a few of months while cutting the back and sides with the 3 about monthly.</li>
            <li> Such a shame since my old one was fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as the old one that finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised that a product this well made could sell for such a low price and yet be made in the USA.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy things like stepping outside in public wait a few days after cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> The current one is aligned correctly, though it still seems like the motor is on the cusp of being loud at some point in the future.  </li>
            <li> My son is only a year old and I like how quiet the clipper is.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is too many pieces and no great storage device in the box.</li>
            <li> Smooth, powerful cutting.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers complain about the poor quality of the guides, but they&#x27;re the same as those my ex-barber uses.  </li>
            <li> My hair is short and thin and most of the time I would get it cut just because over my ears.  </li>
            <li> My older cutter would get jammed up every so often so I invested in these.  </li>
            <li> This set has poor quality clip attachments, the #1 attachments does not even snap in any more and it has only been 2 months of use (1-2 a week).      </li>
            <li> This thing is heavy, powerful and feels built to last.  </li>
            <li> This is a good basic hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I found that as long as the clippers are oiled then it should work well; this has been true for the two times that I have used it.</li>
            <li> These work very well, come with good instructions are are mostly idiot proof.  </li>
            <li> I usually buzz my hair down to about 1/4 of an inch and, with these clippers, I was to able to get the job done evenly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> The other items in the kit are pretty standard - see comment above about shaving my head.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it i messed up a little  </li>
            <li> With a little bit of oil (included) doing my first haircut was no problem for the blade.  </li>
            <li> I was close to returning them but thought I would do a little searching on Google first.</li>
            <li> My husband was a little reluctant at first but sat in the chair.  </li>
            <li> Its a heavy duty well made set, with all the attachments you could need.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> it cut right through my hair not much vibration and it half as loud as this thing was.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about the reviews saying the combs were weak and fell off easy.  </li>
            <li> Happy cutting everyone!</li>
            <li> This one works amazing and comes with all the different parts you would need including a small brush to wipe it off and a small tube of oil</li>
            <li> Great value to have in your hair cutting tool kit!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loved that it has a very practical case so that even the sloppiest person (the other person using this) puts it all back in the case!!!</li>
            <li> kit comes with a very small amount of oil, but these won&#x27;t last long if you don&#x27;t keep the blade oiled, so better get some extra blade</li>
            <li> We let her play and test out different things until it was apparent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whole lot better doing it this way than cutting too short</li>
            <li> Although it comes with lots of peripherals and is powerful and sturdy, this product does not cut as close as my past clippers.</li>
            <li> After a year of heavy use the machine still works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It broke on the first use, but the clippers and attachments more than made up for that minor disappointment.</li>
            <li> This weighty trimmer feels far more expensive than it actually is.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this one mows thru it easy .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started cutting my own hair to save a little more cash in an effort to pay back my student loans a little quicker.</li>
            <li> Cheaper hair cutters also become dull rather quickly which causes them to pull hair.</li>
            <li> the only thing i would point out is do not loose the oil and the brush.</li>
            <li> I suggest lubricating every other or after a day of heavy use by lightly oiling and then allowing blades to move back and forth after cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to be careful when breaking in a new set of clippers to not cut my ears,</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this new Wahl cutter.</li>
            <li> But if you keep them dry or dry them off right after you use them they will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> yeah, there&#x27;s a mess to clean up afterward, but these things don&#x27;t get bogged down, cut consistently, and don&#x27;t pull people&#x27;s hari out.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m slightly less deaf and much happier as result.  </li>
            <li> It does the job in half the time, gets very close, plugs in, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging.  </li>
            <li> the whole kit costs less than a haircut.</li>
            <li> But now finding myself on a fixed income and deciding to wear my hair short for however long the mood strikes</li>
            <li> I wanted the least expensive, make brand clippers available that were adjustable, but could cut to bald (.000&amp;#34;) or (.0000&amp;#34;), as per multiple models advertised at aSilly&#x27;s beat supply.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this machine from the first time I push ON it really not easy to handle</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even more unfortunate is that I don&#x27;t currently have a three-way mirror and poor lighting in my bathroom, requiring many passes on the back of my head to get it even.</li>
            <li> THE TRIMMER ALLOWS YOU TO TRIM THE NECK AND SIDE-BURN AREAS VERY CLOSELY; THIS ONE ONLY CUTS DOWN TO 1/32 INCH OR SO.</li>
            <li> I am a single mother of a 6yr old boy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts hair, has a few snags, does not work on facial hair too well, and is much larger than what I had first expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am VERY DISAPPOINTED because I bought this item because of the fact that it is one of the best</li>
            <li> the clippers themselves seem to be  very durable and built to last years and years, and i dont think you should expect any less.</li>
            <li> My young adult son asked me to order these after the wife used his previous one as he refused to take them back for reason you can guess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seemingly nice carry case is useless as everything goes in loose.</li>
            <li> They are very smooth when cutting, and not that loud.  </li>
            <li> Had to buy this new Wahl cutter due to Hurricane Sandy.</li>
            <li> works very well cutting my husband and sons hair it a lil lounder than i thought but that was fine by me.</li>
            <li> Other than that, you have absolutely every single blade type you could ever dream of in this case.</li>
            <li> This product sucks, DO NOT BUY, only used it once and broke right a way...</li>
            <li> Sharp and clean cutting, I cut my boys&#x27; hair in half the time, with better results.</li>
            <li> it is a bit tricky to get used to, but it&#x27;s certainly well worth the price and will save a load of money if you normally take frequent trips to the barber just to do a stupid simple trim.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Wahl for a long time and I cut my hubby&#x27;s hair about every 3 weeks Very high and tight.  </li>
            <li> a mom that is new to cutting hair, I found this extremely easy to use, and if needed, I will definitely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To much noise not easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because come reviews said it was quiet or not as loud as other buzzers.</li>
            <li> seems well made, versatile settings..very sharp, good cutting..</li>
            <li> Save time and money get your high and tight at home</li>
            <li> /&gt;Assuming a hair cut every 6 weeks (my usual) at about $10 after tip (at a really cheap place in a college town), this little kit saves me about $87/year - enough to pay for my Amazon Prime membership (which already pays for itself, btw).</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little lighter than the old one, but the razor is pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had other clippers that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as these did.</li>
            <li> that metal piece that vibrates is hitting the other metal part causing this loud noise.</li>
            <li> Blades are not as sharp as my old whal which lasted me 15 years hair cut every 1 to 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> one complaint is the so called book of instructions which is more like a small fold out poster with basic instructions and not a book.</li>
            <li> I also thought it would be hard to learn to use the clipper, but it comes with a small &#x27;how to&#x27; booklet that helped (but I also practiced on my husband before taking it to my son&#x27;s head :)).  </li>
            <li> ~&#x27; ],plus,they dont fit tightly enough,and they make so much noise when you try to use the clippers with one of the guards on,that it reminds me of my old pager,set to vibrate,on a glass coffee table,so you have to hold your finger on the guard at all times to keep it quiet,or it will drive you crazy.</li>
            <li> Husband also uses it to trim his beard regularly and it makes the job much faster than his usual beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Last me a long time, and only after several years of use shaving my head whenever it got to long (I keep my hair clipped short)</li>
            <li> but thats no big deal breaker for me as the cord is plenty long enough.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd set of &amp;#34;wahl&amp;#34; hair clippers for us and they last for years as long as you maintain them and oil them as needed.</li>
            <li> The accessories it comes with are nice but not useful when the razor itself fails to cut hair.</li>
            <li> once she had her new set, I took the old, dull clippers apart and figured I&#x27;d try sharpening them myself.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing is the case is a little on the cheap side, but that&#x27;s insignificant.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair rather short without much style, almost a military cut, just with a little flair.  </li>
            <li> at least it did not during the first 1.5 hours of continual use...after this duration..it started warming up but was still manageable...</li>
            <li> It comes with a small bottle of oil, scissors, combs, and a whole bunch of attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen any that have such long fins on them.  </li>
            <li> This is the third haircutting kit that I have owned in the last ten years or so (one simply stopped working, the other got ruined when my wife tried to use it to cut the dog&#x27;s hair).  </li>
            <li> The latch on it may not last so long, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> The cord is decently long and the clippers never pull my hair (have I said that enough?).</li>
            <li> Still does its job, but I feel like it won&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud and it has a relatively low vibration.  </li>
            <li> I think it can really last a long time.</li>
            <li> those two tools will help last the buzzer for a long time.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping these last as long.</li>
            <li> If they last long, and it seems like they will, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> My only gripe with it, is that power cord is not as long as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I need something that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who has incredibly thick hair, and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, and these cut through it like butter.  </li>
            <li> The clipper without a guard on is rather quiet, but the guards seem to be loose, creating the loud noise that other reviews mention.</li>
            <li> but it is so much louder than my other clippers that I need to drop it down to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I had to stop twice to re-oil and clean the blades because they stopped cutting (again this is normal for my hair)</li>
            <li> Extremely noisy, and couldn&#x27;t cut through my hair like other OLDER Wahl models had been.</li>
            <li> Now it must be admitted that the \\&quot;24-piece\\&quot; description is nearly irrelevant, as pieces include clips, combs, a garbage-bag type cape, and some cheap scissors, but the scissors will do until you get better ones (highly recommended--visit a beauty supply store and try out some), and one of the combs is not too bad.</li>
            <li> I found that though yes they do look cheap they are very sharp and work just as expected if not better.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s only complaint was that I didn&#x27;t cut his hair short enough, so I removed the guide and took it right down to a stub.  </li>
            <li> Wahl use to be dependable and good, but this model is pure crap!</li>
            <li> This Wahl clipper, unlike some of the cheaper ones found in other stores is made in the US and the quality difference is very apparent.</li>
            <li> My son had long, thick hair, VERY UNUSUAL FOR HIM, and we were worried that it would snag, or pull his hair out, rather than just clip it off, like he wanted.</li>
            <li> My fiance cuts my hair, we got a cheap pair from Ross but they were dull after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Is very high powered and can cut through thick hair (I have very coarse</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months and it still works, but I am shopping for a new buzzer now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe there are people giving positive reviews for this garbage.  </li>
            <li> This might become an issue for someone who uses larger guards, as the guards may bend, especially if the user presses down really hard on them (but then that person&#x27;s probably not doing it right).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> they will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This mostly happens when cutting the hair on the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> noise was so loud, my son complained when I cut near his ears.  </li>
            <li> Now of course the end result is a far less quality cut.</li>
            <li> My wife who has ZERO hair cutting experience was able to open this package and follow the instructions with ease.</li>
            <li> This one is not too heavy (not very light either) and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, without clogging or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it comes with 30 day money back and 5 year limited warranty</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would do it myself, but I am limited in my ability to perceive my entire head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fortunately, this Wahl clipper kit was very reasonably priced for what you get (and far cry less expensive than our $180 dog hair pullers, I mean, clippers).</li>
            <li> Though it was only $25, I was expecting some sort of quality, due to the positive past reviews and product description.  </li>
            <li> ...a bit too heavy...  and loud !</li>
            <li> I used a real flat head screwdriver for that.</li>
            <li> For just a little extra cost, I would highly recommend getting the Wahl razor over any other cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I need to buy that now, but the different clip sizes will help a lot to take care of the different parts if you start from the larger sizes then go down one by one to get the length you&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> I usually went to super cuts every few months and sometimes (like the summer)</li>
            <li> And for the price of the clippers (Which are usually around 40 bucks where I live) they pay for themselves after 1 use!</li>
            <li> Only used it 3 times so far, not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> The previous clippers I have owned could trim my hair and beard very close to the skin, though, of course, not all the way down.</li>
            <li> It came with all of the different trim pieces for different hair cutting heights and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud, but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> Could just be a bad fit between the blade and that particular guide.</li>
            <li> a comb isn&#x27;t quite low enough but the next comb would be too tight.</li>
            <li> A little awkward using two mirrors and left hand some but overall very easy</li>
            <li> Ordered the product with high dreams &amp; waited anxiously.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you straight up, it&#x27;s extremely hard to cut your hair when you are wearing glasses.</li>
            <li> how hard is it really to cut hair?</li>
            <li> the bottle that comes with, is OK but a bit inconvenient to use.).</li>
            <li> Wahl system that had more cutting teeth and could crop hair closer,</li>
            <li> it cutting better make my cuts easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I got this because i wanted to start cutting my husband&#x27;s hair, okay this thing has everything you wish you had;</li>
            <li> I love these clippers...makes cutting hair a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Definite upgrade over my old Wahl clippers which I had used for about the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the unit should have been adjusted at the factory and there was nothing specific in the literature about what to do if the clippers are loud.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a perfectionist, and take a long time to get it &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long they will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic is thin, cheap, and flexible on the #2 guard such that if you cut your hair with any downward pressure whatsoever, the guard flexs and creates uneven clipping.</li>
            <li> It took us a long time to get his hair cut.  </li>
            <li> and it was really long when I cut it.  </li>
            <li> WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG?</li>
            <li> They must not care what they look like as long as it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> This thing lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The blades keep their sharpness for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a loud clipper like some people</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t let my hair grow long</li>
            <li> Saves loads on haircuts and very simple to use with minimal maintenance.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak for long term reliability yet.</li>
            <li> she didn&#x27;t tell me the oil ran out and doesnt remember how long ago she ran out , and it locked up .</li>
            <li> It does save me a razor when i try to trim my long grown beard after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I partially blame myself for this because I neglected to oil my blades regularly.</li>
            <li> My husband is military and we have to cut his hair constantly to keep it in regs.</li>
            <li> (if it is longer), oil to oil the blades every few times the unit it used, and a lot of attachments to vary the length of the clipped hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the Conair clippers and they are far inferior to this unit.  </li>
            <li> Instead of getting grey hair</li>
            <li> It is not loud.</li>
            <li> I expect this to hold up for a long time.    </li>
            <li> My advice don&#x27;t cut hair without guard if you&#x27;re not a professional.</li>
            <li> Definitely professional heavy duty grade clipper...looks and feels like what the barber uses.  </li>
            <li> Received this package with some damage ~ The box itself that holds the razor and all its accessories is not intact, and some of the attachments broke, but I&#x27;m not really upset since the only ones I intend to use are intact and the razor itself works</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting an alternate set of hair clippers as I struggled with these when my hair was wet.  </li>
            <li> you need a machine for yourself and are not a professional.</li>
            <li> She took a long time cut my hair and had the clippers on for about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am no professional when it comes to using this product</li>
            <li> Not surprised though; it did get flooded.</li>
            <li> But all this was simply a minor disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just need to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Works good, they only problem is that it sometimes binds up when cutting thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is split down the middle and if cut too short will tend to spike.</li>
            <li> Cheap and hasn&#x27;t broken down after</li>
            <li> Very little hand vibration but seems to snag a lot more than previous Wahl clippers for delicate work (beards etc.)</li>
            <li> was the #4 guard is a little loose and it makes a really loud buzzing noise.</li>
            <li> Have had these clippers for a few months now and still just as sharp as day one,great product highly recommended</li>
            <li> Your hair better be BONE dry before you attempt to use these or you&#x27;ll be cleaning it out every pass (longer cutting teeth</li>
            <li> This clipper vibrates much less than an older Andis kit I owned previously.  </li>
            <li> Like you can go over the same area and some hair will be SLIGHTLY shorter or longer than the same hair.</li>
            <li> It took me about an hour from start to finish to get the cut right, but that could be attributed to me being extra careful and slow so not to mess up and is not a reflection of the clippers function.</li>
            <li> Unlike other clippers I&#x27;ve used, when you put these on short or long, they stay there.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, and other clippers I have purchased couldn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once and have never used any other home hair cut product, but this worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> The other day I was trimming my hair outside to avoid getting hair inside when my neighbor popped his head over the fence to see what brand of water blaster I had purchased.  </li>
            <li> I found that beard trimmers were not consistent enough for longer beards, so I decided to a home trimmer.</li>
            <li> sharp and seems it will last years.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Chinese($9.99) clippers which actually didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The combs and guides are flimsy - and as other reviewers have stated, the barber poncho is essentially a garbage bag.</li>
            <li> The sheer is EXTREMELY noisy and the adjustments doesnt work.  </li>
            <li> I only use the shortest setting and comb, so can&#x27;t speak to all the other accessories.</li>
            <li> Although I was disgusted with the first shipment, I was pleased at the ease of return and the speed of my refund, therefore I gave an extra star.</li>
            <li> The combs are not a flimsy plastic like several other sets I have seen on the market but sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The cutter is quiet, and extremely sharp, and has paid for itself in 3 haircuts.</li>
            <li> Plus some people get a bit weird about a little blood so better not.</li>
            <li> Definitely money well spent!</li>
            <li> I was initially worried because other comments talked about the noise and vibration; but I figured, it&#x27;s a hair clipper</li>
            <li> It was difficult to hold it in hand &amp; bear the noise, got real hot &amp; a weired smell started coming from it.</li>
            <li> I have had several Wahl hair cutter Due to Replacing them from my kids Breaking them.</li>
            <li> I bought anther of the same due to quality/price ratio</li>
            <li> The vacuum worked well the clipping head was very cheap and proved to be quite inconsistent and painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of an electric razor, they are perfectly sharp (for the limited times I have used them) and there are enough adjustments to cover the range of hair length for my needs along the side.</li>
            <li> The guards are made of cheap plastic that will constantly \\&quot;spread\\&quot; when you are cutting your hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with additional attachments for longer lengths (the previous one only had up to #4) and for cutting around the ears.  </li>
            <li> I had washed my hair, let it dry, and combed it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that it is missing is a brush to wipe away the hair on the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> Dead silent and work like a charm, although corded so limits their range, not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> Watching a few youtube videos helped guide me and this thing will definitely pay for itself (especially considering that a hair cut is $10-20 after tip plus gas to get there).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I got a dud, but this thing was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product did not want to cut after the first few small sweeps.  </li>
            <li> Heavy enough and noisy...seems you are running a big power house motor</li>
            <li> it is not new machine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time was shaky, just due to her not knowing how to do it.  </li>
            <li> do get a bit hot, but Ive never used any others so i&#x27;ts tough to compare, and the person who cut my hair is a novice.</li>
            <li> For the price of a single haircut I can now cut my hair myself and get a haircut I like at anytime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly I had to send it right back...</li>
            <li> I know very little about being a professional hair stylist, so whether or not this is a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; set</li>
            <li> I generally will go a few years between hair cuts or get it cut once</li>
            <li> Not worth repairing so had to buy a different model,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already ahead of the game, money-wise, with my first home haircut.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Comes in nice plastic case for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: (10/24/2014)&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> It does get a little hot towards the end, but nothing that&#x27;s too hard to deal with.</li>
            <li> Something inside is loose.</li>
            <li> The casing was loose.  </li>
            <li> Well, finally broke down any  bought this set .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t how short the guide combs for over the ear cut, had to go all the way down to a 3/8 to even out my hair</li>
            <li> First time out of the box and using it the product was very loud and painful and the blade actually fell off.</li>
            <li> Besides, I do a nice job cutting his hair and wanted to replace the Wahl clippers I misplaced a few months back.</li>
            <li> The Razor was very heavy amd loud.  </li>
            <li> It gets 4/5 stars for the way it cuts hair (when new), but loses a star for its noisiness.</li>
            <li> The adjustment lever on the clipper functions easily and the clipper-blades do not pinch the skin or pull hair during the hair cutting process.</li>
            <li> I did not know that cutting hair could be so easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly louder than a cordless trimmer, but not enough to be bothersome.  </li>
            <li> I learned that mistake early on when i first began cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And second, even though i have small hands I feel the on/off switch needs to be bigger.</li>
            <li> So I bought a another one to replace it, only for it to fail after 4 and half months in the exact same way.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues since i bought this less than a year back</li>
            <li> I sometimes drop them, so I slightly damaged last clippers.</li>
            <li> Was playing with different settings and accidentally gave myself a small bald patch on the side when using a low numbered comb.</li>
            <li> I have used these clippers extensively over the past couple years ago when I needed the replacement I did not hesitate to buy the same one.</li>
            <li> I typically cut my hair every 2 - 3 weeks, so the next cut will be this upcoming weekend.  </li>
            <li> Yes it also vibrates ever so slightly, which yet isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have purchased similar sets in the past (ConAir) which was in the same price range,  those sets lasted a for over a year before i had to buy a replacement.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as short as my previous Wahl trimmer did on setting one.</li>
            <li> comes with numerous black, plastic attachments that clip onto the unit itself and each one has a number and the enclosed chart shows a photo of each with its corresponding number and narrative description of what each can be used for.  </li>
            <li> However, the power cord seems to be made of a smaller diameter cord than my previous Wahl clippers and it almost looks like it doesn&#x27;t belong.</li>
            <li> Solid quality...expected nothing less from Wahl.</li>
            <li> less missed hairs than similar priced conair</li>
            <li> My hand started getting dark pink red!</li>
            <li> Used it for hair cuts (top of the head) and cutting beard down for shaving.</li>
            <li> She determined that these were finally getting dull, so I decided to buy her the same pair again as a gift -- since they&#x27;ve lasted so long, and are quite inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about the noise it would make, but really it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I expected from reading other reviews, it&#x27;s not quiet, but it is very tolerable, what I would expect from a machine like this.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay sharp long</li>
            <li> Sharp clippers, not loud in my opinion, &amp; all the sizes &amp; accessories of clips/combs, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The motor designs are weaker, and the are beaucoup weak plastic pieces in the drive train lending themselves too much movement, inprecision and rapid blade wear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use any attachments, just did a straight cut with the blades like I used to do with my old clipper, and that was when I realized there is something very wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> The blades are durable and stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> One other minor quibble -</li>
            <li> Cuts well and blades stay sharp as long as you oil them after each cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Think about it: you care way more about your appearance than some person you pay to spend a maximum of half an hour cutting your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it for anything fancy - just cutting my hair super short for the summer.</li>
            <li> So I keep it short and tight.</li>
            <li> People on amazon say that they are very noisy... which is very hard to believe...</li>
            <li> I mean, I thought it&#x27;s just the same as those clippers I bought for a price of 25 bucks which didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Works fine for cutting hair though.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, dependable and a little on the hefty side.</li>
            <li> the only problem is it a little noisy.</li>
            <li> Mine looked a little different then</li>
            <li> I was a little leery because of the low price, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Only worry is the shiny gray part seems to feel a little slippery</li>
            <li> but the blades on these seem to be just as dull as the old ones.</li>
            <li> Been paying $20 including tip to barber every 4-5 weeks, but when my wife and I had our first baby it became very hard for me to find time to go to he barber shop as my wife works odd hrs and weekends.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it wasn&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li> Should fit needs for any hair cutting.</li>
            <li> It cuts so clean, that I no longer have random lines on my head, and shaving takes half the time.</li>
            <li> But as the title suggests, if you do not own a mustache trimmer, buy the slightly more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read through the negative reviews and chuckled at the ones that say its too loud.  </li>
            <li> There was also some complaint that the product was too loud which I disagree with as well.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money and makes cutting hair quicker.  </li>
            <li> I have a Wahl trimmer that was my grandfather&#x27;s so it must be at least 50 years old.  </li>
            <li> Had to replace my old Wahl ): which lasted at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> The clippers we have used were at least that old and about worn out.  </li>
            <li> but , it&#x27;s heavy, big, slippery, and NOISY !</li>
            <li> (I do not use this razor for the center, where I use scissors and shears instead).</li>
            <li> Probably not, but considering they are under $30, they work just as expected.</li>
            <li> I have a military background so you can imagine my haircut.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they were any louder than I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> but it is expected.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely not recommend this product to anyone who cuts their hair using a guard.</li>
            <li> It cut my hair as expected.  </li>
            <li> The clipper itself is also surprisingly heavy and solid, which suggests reliability to me.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only used the item a few times</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this trimmer a few weeks</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son in the military.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll get nicks and pink spots on your face</li>
            <li> This clipper is a total waste.  </li>
            <li> These are not capable of that close of a trim.</li>
            <li> I recently wasted money by buying this kit at a big store, instead of amazon.</li>
            <li> and I wear a closer cut-- All to say that it takes roughly 15 minutes for my barber to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Also the clips are not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The money I spent on this has paid for itself over and over again saving money on hair cuts,</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers a few years back and used them probably 2-3 times a month.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> Heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> It did what I expected it to do and have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spent your money on this item.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> careful what you buy, read the return policy VERY&lt;</li>
            <li> it takes my wife maybe 6 minutes , with 2 minutes spent on eyebrows</li>
            <li> It vibrates heavily when it runs, with a big noise.</li>
            <li> i have absolutely no problems with this product...</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve purchased, blades keep sticking and end up sitting uneven with combed edge.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll get nicks and pink spots on your face</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also heavier than I expected</li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Works as well as expected.</li>
            <li> My husband used it only a few times and the motor stopped working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too big and too heavy for how I use it.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 5 kids and myself with expected results.</li>
            <li> My short hair had patches and looked uneven.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one prone to exaggeration, but in this case, there is no way to describe this product other than \\&quot;garbage\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The razor cuts about a quarter inch wide swath through my hair.</li>
            <li> They simply cut a path so narrow through the hair that it defies belief.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is so pathetically narrow that these cutters are essentially unusable for anything.</li>
            <li> this thing does it&#x27;s job solidly and without the battery waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military, and I bought these to cut my hair and some of my friends&#x27; to save money.  </li>
            <li> work as I expected them to.</li>
            <li> I gave my son a rather uneven haircut but second times a charm!</li>
            <li> Now it cuts unevenly and takes several passes to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here, everything works as it should.</li>
            <li> The plastic drape was not much help.</li>
            <li> Heavier than what I had expected</li>
            <li> The only thing i noticed was that the plug did not fit in my bathroom socket</li>
            <li> The snap ons do not really follow the depth cut that I expected.</li>
            <li> Finally, after losing a bet on a basketball game, where he agreed to shave his head, I decided I wasn&#x27;t letting one of his friends wield anything going near his head.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl Chrome Pro 24-piece Haircut Kit not only pays for itself in just a few trims, it saves the time and money spent traveling to and waiting at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> The clippers just hum not that annoying loud sounds cheap clippers make.</li>
            <li> My boys have thick hair &amp; it has no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li> The scissors it comes with are a bit worthless, but I already had a nice pair.</li>
            <li> Hate to figure it out by experimenting on someone&#x27;s hair or even my own hair.</li>
            <li> Quiet, very sharp, like it alot!</li>
            <li> The main issue with it is the fact that the slider that adjusts the teeth does not lock in place, so it makes it a little tough to properly fade with.  </li>
            <li> We have a cat with a very long coat, he is always hot &amp; looks uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I suggest marking numbers on all the guides with a white paint stick.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that minor complaint, I think it is a fine cutting</li>
            <li> This one is no comparison to my two previous cordless units, which took 5 times as long to cut hair.</li>
            <li> You will receive two, long, fine-toothed black plastic combs, clips to section off the three areas of the hair</li>
            <li> Also the receipt in the box was ripped in half and not complete.</li>
            <li> But even when you mess up a little the gaurds keep you from making a complete mess of the haircut.  </li>
            <li> The blade has a sharp finish at the tips(be careful).</li>
            <li> When I first started cutting his hair, I realized almost immediately that it was too short.  </li>
            <li> We love our Trimmer and I&#x27;ve been cutting my husbands hair at home for the past 5 times now, so it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I took unusually long-- like if they&#x27;re not intended to be used for long bouts of time or what&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We got through the first hair cut (took a lot longer then expected) and cleaned it up maybe thinking it was something we did wrong, oiled it and put it away.  </li>
            <li> The clippers themselves are a step above the base level clippers we expected, not quite up to par with the more expensive clippers, but very close to that end of the quality spectrum than the poorer quality</li>
            <li> It worked well for the first six months, but when I went to adjust the power screw (was using a lower wattage), it stopped cutting properly.</li>
            <li> The small brush included is just not large enough.</li>
            <li> The only problem is cutting the top back of your head since it&#x27;s tiresome to reach around</li>
            <li> if your looking for new hairclippers, even for commercial use, you cant go wrong here.</li>
            <li> The only downfall with this is the case doesn&#x27;t have any way to organize the length guards and a few of the plastic prongs of them are bent slightly.</li>
            <li> Only (3) stars because it&#x27;s heavy as compared to the Peanut clippers previously used.</li>
            <li> One issue I&#x27;ve found is that if hair gets caught, or if they are not oiled properly, it will make a very loud and unsettling vibrating rumble.</li>
            <li> , I read in few reviews about the clips being very delicate, but i feel it is very decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as when I go a professional barber</li>
            <li> All the trimmers sort of fall around each other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no pulls or any other issues with them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these clippers are louder than any other clippers that I have had used and</li>
            <li> but I really do not want to use it as it sounds like something is wrong and is loud enough to hurt my ears.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  sharp as a  mother f-er.</li>
            <li> I received this hair trimmer the other day, and I was just blown away.</li>
            <li> I could buy one about every other month and still save money over going to the barber shop.  </li>
            <li> My other one had stop clicks that it would stay at unless you moved it.</li>
            <li> The other guards stay attached.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly salon quality but</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and do the job.</li>
            <li> etc since they are usually so sharp.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are flimsy and I am concerned they won&#x27;t last, but the clippers are heavy and feel like quality!</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews stating it does not get as close and skin-tight as some people prefer, but I have a dedicated Norelco for that close of a shave.     </li>
            <li> This hair clipper was a value, so I was a bit skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> i need buy other...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m EXTREMELY UPSET.</li>
            <li> so I cannot speak to the other items in this kit besides the clippers.</li>
            <li> I had to totally turn it counter-clockwise to have it running without excessive noise</li>
            <li> I have been accustomed to receiving when ordering other models.</li>
            <li> for a small woman, it was too big.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t work as the other one I had.</li>
            <li> The boys appreciate a sharp clipper that doesn&#x27;t pull hair.</li>
            <li> I got this one online due to all the reviews.</li>
            <li> This gives you a horrendous &amp;#34;row&amp;#34; look as every other inch is shorter or longer.</li>
            <li> Tops. wouldn&#x27;t order from any other brand.</li>
            <li> The razor is relatively quiet and does not vibrate as much as other I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> im too lazy to package it up and send it back.. but be weary ..</li>
            <li> , I always have short hair, with this machine anyone can cut hair without any difficulty, and has 20 options of combs, there is a small problem the machine is not dual voltage 110</li>
            <li> Lots of power and options in a such a small package.</li>
            <li> Does not bite or grab the skin as some other clippers will do.</li>
            <li> im giving a 3 star because i had to tune the device due to</li>
            <li> the other set may work when oiled</li>
            <li> but the blades stay sharp due to its self sharpening titanium blades.</li>
            <li> The advertisement DID NOT advise that a power converter would not work out of the US due to not the power converting but the frequency.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s extremely noisy.</li>
            <li> It is medially sharp but it does the work.</li>
            <li> the unit is extremely noisy when using the closest trimmer guide.</li>
            <li> Unlike other clippers it doesn&#x27;t get stuck.</li>
            <li> Other than that the machine would suffice.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and we didn&#x27;t need to blend the hair at the edges of the swath lines like the instructions state you may need to do.  </li>
            <li> but other then that they work well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical whether they would work because of the low price, but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Oh and, be careful with the clipper attachments, they also feel rather malleable!  </li>
            <li> Bought these based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> The other day I snuck up on both my mother and sister and gave them a trim.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades...</li>
            <li> The other thing that I wish it would have had is an organized container for all the pieces it comes with.</li>
            <li> The only reason it got 4 instead of 5 is that it did not come with a 1 &amp; 1/2 guide which is what length i usually cut my hair.</li>
            <li> other reviews said it was noisy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of other products before but this one tops them all.</li>
            <li> It is extremely noisy and vibrating - it deafens my ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other online videos contradict each other so just go to the Wahl website directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other reviews prompted me to do buy this.</li>
            <li> past problems with similar devices occurred after months of use.  </li>
            <li> did not cost much and i have really thick hair so makes my life that much easier when I do not have to worry about it failing on me when cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with the other trim heads, but I will hang on to them for some future use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how often is too often for oiling, but perhaps the third time I&#x27;ll try not oiling them and see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because the other ones I owned just didn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> Lots of power, sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I read all of the other reviews looking for a replacement piece for the VIdal Sassoon clippers I had.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has ridiculously thick hair, and it used to take me almost an hour to cut it with our old clippers because they were constantly clogging - I had to move so slow.</li>
            <li> After trying to use them a few times I know I am not imagining things and have had to resort to using scissors for a low and tight trim.</li>
            <li> And I do mean far less.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had an undercut hairstyle for about three years now, and roughly every month i would need to take a trip to the barber to have the shaved side trimmed down</li>
            <li> This sure is heavy and will have a hard time if you aren&#x27;t used to cutting it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Final A adjustments can be made for the throw of the cutting blades by turning large plastic side scree to decrease noise.</li>
            <li> Clunky, heavy, gets hot easily, and it is just a horrible product.</li>
            <li> Only disadvantage is that it is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> The only tough part is squaring the back</li>
            <li> , I know you can&#x27;t be very rough with them.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of cordless trimmers always needing charged or new batteries.  </li>
            <li> Wahl&#x27;s marketeers might think a broken case will result in my buy a new set of shears; however, I&#x27;ll just glue some hook-n-loop (a.k.a. velcro) in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - the cape is cheap and annoying to fold back up - we threw it away with in one use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously had a cheap con-air clipper set that starting making an awful loud clicking noise that no amount of tinkering and grease could fix.  </li>
            <li> Also there is no way to get super close to the skin (like on the lower neck) without cutting some skin.  </li>
            <li> There are adequate guards for cutting to discrete</li>
            <li> /&gt;i read reviews complaining about the scissors that come with this set being cheap Chinese crap.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I was so cheap for so long :(</li>
            <li> This clipper is built very sturdy and came with a bunch of different sizes for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Had one one on active duty lost to an ex wife.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of paying a barber $20 to do something so simple.  </li>
            <li> That it&#x27;s corded instead of cordless is a HUGE plus to me, as I hate replacing earth-trashing batteries and using the trimmer when the charge is low.  </li>
            <li> Used it once was excessivly loud, started smoking and then failed to work, I want my money back</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, these clippers will not take hair down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Even after 3 passes there are a large number of hairs that escape uncut, with or without a guard.</li>
            <li> so I put a little oil on them and not much improvement.</li>
            <li> Have wasted time with other brands in the past and have come to believe that Wahl is the ONLY brand to use when it comes to trimmers.</li>
            <li> A little heavier and louder than I expected.</li>
            <li> Teeth are quite sharp on these compared to previous Wahl clippers that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> He said that the blades began to dull after multiple used though.</li>
            <li> The back is kinda hard to get but feel with your hair, use a mirror, or have someone by your side for help.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t oil your blades regularly, they will get dull over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still prefer traditional barbershops but those are hard to come by.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s still doing it the hard way), the ear guard (you can cut the hair evenly over your ears without getting \\&quot;white walls\\&quot;), and the eyebrow guard.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I needed to by a diffrient</li>
            <li> After cutting my family&#x27;s hair for ten years with two different sets of Conair clippers, I finally bought this American-assembled Wahl set.</li>
            <li> at least now I&#x27;ll know for next time.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint: cheapo plastic &amp;#34;smock.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Only negative is that the box they come in isn&#x27;t meant at all for organization, it is just a plastic box to stuff everything into...</li>
            <li> , absolutely nothing wrong</li>
            <li> I have experience with cheaper hair cutters and they are not fun.</li>
            <li> Feels like pro and is powerful when cutting..</li>
            <li> My hair has always grown so fast, I decided a long time ago to start cutting it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder if there are any negative consequences to cklipping your hair daily; could it cause hai loss or improve hair growth?</li>
            <li> Thats the only complaint i have with these clippers</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long this one is, maybe 5 feet?</li>
            <li> the NOT fun part is..</li>
            <li> The outside feels sturdy but the inside is delicate as a flower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to tell you based on the average joe shmoe use.  </li>
            <li> Now I have only one negative comment about this..</li>
            <li> Thought it would provide the necessary lining up which is pivitol for my husband&#x27;s hair cuts but the outcome is negative.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that is still doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like it too.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the noise and the way it jolts a bit when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> My son has thick, straw-like asian hair and it had no issues going through his.  </li>
            <li> Relatively quiet, but not even my son&#x27;s thick hair could hamper them in any way.</li>
            <li> I had a conair that I used for many years, despite a few broken tines and a cord that was irrevocably twisted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too heavy and wide for my hand.  </li>
            <li> If you want it for full time use I say its the wrong trimmer because it can cut kinda slow</li>
            <li> the clippers themselves are good enough,i suppose,but the guards are terribly built!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> are we sorry that we waited so long to replace the old one.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s been cutting my hair at home for years now and we recently replaced our tired old set of clippers with this new kit.</li>
            <li> It also is slightly louder than the Wahl clipper I previously owned for 15 years, probably due to the lighter weight housing.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is a hard plastic with enough room for a neck brush as well but takes up less space then the Andis set did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this set easily for anyone needing a hair cutting kit, especially families like ours where you&#x27;re cutting hair for multiple people.</li>
            <li> There is however one thing that lets this product down.  </li>
            <li> 12+ inches of hair down to a #4 buzz cut.</li>
            <li> This is accentuated when holding the clippers upside down.</li>
            <li> You have NOT let me down.  </li>
            <li> For a variety of reasons, I decided to just buy this set of clippers and shave my head down to a 1/4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry down the road when it does die .</li>
            <li> Had to buy a step down transformer.</li>
            <li> Brought an Adaptor which steps down Voltage from 240/220V to 120V, plugged it in</li>
            <li> No jamming, or hair pulling, or bogging down of the clippers.  </li>
            <li> You wont be let down.</li>
            <li> No hair getting caught in the teeth and being pulled, no slowing down on lots of hair.  </li>
            <li> we were going to have to buzz it all down to one length.  </li>
            <li> She cleaned the blade off with alcohol and strapped me down to the chair.</li>
            <li> works on the beard and the back, i mean</li>
            <li> Lots of combs to choose from and stays sharp with little maintenance.</li>
            <li> any other I have used!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t trust any other brand!</li>
            <li> I am giving it low stars because every single guider was broken into pieces when I received it.</li>
            <li> The cape is made from a very thin plastic, much like a trash can liner.</li>
            <li> very sharp doesnt pull hair like my previous clippers includes a lot of accessories and gets the job down without a hitch.</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend for Christmas since his other one was dead.  </li>
            <li> Very Sharp cutters.</li>
            <li> -blades stay very sharp  -no</li>
            <li> The blades are VERY sharp so don&#x27;t try to use this without a guard</li>
            <li> The cut is very sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blades are VERY sharp so don&#x27;t try to use this without a guard</li>
            <li> The blade does not seem to be very sharp when I try to use it.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a year now and the blade on the shaver is still very sharp.</li>
            <li> The blades are VERY sharp so don&#x27;t try to use this without a guard</li>
            <li> The trimmer blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Be VERY CAREFUL when using the ear trimming guides!</li>
            <li> For less than the price of 2 haircuts at a strip mall</li>
            <li> to wahl, please improve the quality of the black plastic parts.</li>
            <li> I paid $20+tip for a haircut that took the barber less than eight minutes to cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Which means I had my husbands hair done in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I updated from a previously used cheaper pair.  </li>
            <li> Sizing is bit odd for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black guy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now, people complaining of the loud rattling/buzzing (which I have not experienced) should read the 8 step instructions that come with everything - there is a bolt on the clippers that you can tighten/loosen to fix that problem.</li>
            <li> had to throw it away after a year, which is way less than the life I was expecting from this machine.</li>
            <li> If a slightly noisy and vibrating trimmer isn&#x27;t what you want, by a pro-grade Wahl and not these.  </li>
            <li> so I am not getting the close shave that my previous clippers gave me.</li>
            <li> Ive had a previous model of Wahl system which I used to give my sons and myself haircuts when they were kids.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets caught in the blade and ends up getting pulled out half the time.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a ConAir self charging model which served me well.  </li>
            <li> Which is typically when I would get my hair cut after work or a sat.</li>
            <li> Nothing less.  </li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars even though the the comb guides were all black and the numbers-corresponding to size- don&#x27;t jump out at you.</li>
            <li> They cut my hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li> Spending the less than $40 for this is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the buzzer for about a year and a half, and I have never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Mine are all black, and the size markings are embossed on the combs.</li>
            <li> I have less hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Sturdy &amp; slightly on the heavier side</li>
            <li> I replaced it with and a lot less noisy.</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair cut but in between hair cuts, I usually trim the sides and back of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use cutters like these to shave my head, a process that typically takes about five minutes.</li>
            <li> It took me over half an hour to accomplish it with these.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my previous Wahl which lasted 15 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like another quarter to half inch.</li>
            <li> It has everything you need except for one thing; half increment clips, or whatever they&#x27;re called.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it comes in it&#x27;s own case; has instructions on cutting hair properly; it has a bunch of guide combs; scissors; cutting cape; 2 black combs; a small brush and oil for cleaning and maintaining the clippers.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little heavy but other than that..</li>
            <li> it invariable becomes a tangled mess of black plastic guides and combs .  </li>
            <li> I also chose this product because I wanted a hard plastic case, not a soft bag.</li>
            <li> it just cuts the hair in an odd way, and there is no way to fix it if you mess up.</li>
            <li> Nearly a year ago I began cutting my own hair at home after dealing with paying $20+ per month and being unhappy with haircuts that were at best inconsistent and at worst just bad.</li>
            <li> So, I broke down and decided I had to try something a little easier.  </li>
            <li> If you had kids who hated getting their hair cut and yell and scream while you do it, get these suckers, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to hear them above the noise.  </li>
            <li> This has made cutting my sons hair so much easier!  </li>
            <li> I was just scared that I&#x27;d mess my hair up.  </li>
            <li> so i wouldn&#x27;t look like a shaggy mess, and each time i&#x27;d pay about $15 each time.</li>
            <li> did I MESS UP.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;ll take off too much hair!</li>
            <li> I let my girlfriend use this on me and it was her first time ever cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> Beginners manual included with instructions for your first hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I was hoping and praying my luscious thick locks would turn attractively grey over time....</li>
            <li> A little heavier than my previous one</li>
            <li> Even after the 6 months or so that we&#x27;ve had it is has not yet seemed to dull and pull his hair, so we are hoping it will stay that way for a long time!</li>
            <li> but the device rattles when turned on unless you grip it really tight.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because some have said that it was very loud</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve got a little boy, and shave his head also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The on/off switch gets a little stuck on ours.   </li>
            <li> We have two little guys five and under, who require haircuts about every four weeks in the summer.  </li>
            <li> , I thought that maybe with a little use, adjustments, oil etc...</li>
            <li> Use of the Wahl Chrome Pro was trouble-free although a little heavier than my twenty-five year-old Oster, and the included accessories makes DIY haircuts easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to groom my little dog.  </li>
            <li> In addition, there is little noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bulky to handle to cut your hair by yourself</li>
            <li> If they had been color coded, that would make it a little easier, but even then they would just be jumbled</li>
            <li> but maybe I&#x27;m getting a little carried away.</li>
            <li> After using it a little while it started to make some noise.</li>
            <li> but when I took the protector thing off the blades.. there was little hair stubbles in the razor..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> These clippers work well and pay for themselves with just a little use.  </li>
            <li> The ones they provide are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> But the included shears and cape leave a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> She had a little issue with the side burns</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one little thing I wish is that it had a longer cord.</li>
            <li> The one thing it doesn&#x27;t have is a little spray bottle for water.</li>
            <li> It was like a grocery store bag with little ties attached.</li>
            <li> and he had used it three times and now a little over one month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like my hair just a little longer than I can do with this.</li>
            <li> My wife can trim my hair with no problems with a little practice.</li>
            <li> I use it on myself as well as my parents and even my little Terrier.</li>
            <li> She might use it to cut her little child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The shears are a little chintzy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy</li>
            <li> For the price, I thought they would be a little bit cheaper in quality.</li>
            <li> I used it on my beard and it made an uneven mess.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin hair &amp; was only making it slightly shorter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of this poor blade the hair gest pulled if you want to make it less low to make fades and stuff.</li>
            <li> I am a single mother that has to save money when I can, and cutting my 20 month old son&#x27;s hair myself is one of the things I have to do in order to make ends</li>
            <li> I feel like it cuts a little bit unevenly.</li>
            <li> Clippers are a little heavy, but I like that.  </li>
            <li> It is also a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> It was like mowing down spring grass with a Hemi-powered lawn mower!</li>
            <li> Now that I have a piece that I attach to my deck&#x27;s stairs to attach a double-looped choker to, to hold my dog in place and prevent him from sitting his bottom down, I can get his lion cut done in no time!  </li>
            <li> Saving us $$ by shaving my husband&#x27;s hair down vs. going to the barber!</li>
            <li> but cutters seem to get stopped with hair easily  not very powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other systems in the past that got extremely hot after a few minutes of use and would be very uncomfortable on my neck, and others that pulled hairs out when they got caught in the blades.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this online because I couldn&#x27;t try it and it was less expensive than other clippers which brought me to believe that the quality was worse.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like anybody cutting my hair...</li>
            <li> It really glides as it cuts and can handle cutting a lot of length at one time.</li>
            <li> The kit comes with loads of different size clip-on guides for cutting different length hair.  </li>
            <li> Just gave myself a 4-8 buzz and the product included hair cutting instructions that were very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Cutting hair at homes saves a lot of money and these clippers will likely pay for themselves, only after a couple of haircuts.  </li>
            <li> Since the first haircut, the guide comb that we used was rattling so bad that my wife decided to send it back, it got to be pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> i hate the fact that has number 1.5, so cant get a smooth fade when shave with number 1 and then have to create a fade</li>
            <li> Cuts well (few pulls).  </li>
            <li> The handheld shaver is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> This spreading and flexing of the guard leads to wavy and uneven cuts of your hair.     </li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;banged&amp;#34; it on my hand a few times and it started working.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and has been working for a few months now.</li>
            <li> but I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> And if you run into a few reviews that complain about price, you have to think of the money just one of these a year will save you.  </li>
            <li> After three times use, it makes a broken noise occasionally, but it still works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any of the plastic pieces break on me and the clipper has stood the test of time under heavy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy duty clipper but not cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times on my boyfriend for haircuts.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty too.</li>
            <li> were missing.</li>
            <li> The product was missing screws which allowed the cover to come off the device.  </li>
            <li> So I figured why waste the money when he could get his hair cut at home.</li>
            <li> I set it to 1.5 and the job is done is a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost a 40 mile round trip to my Barber</li>
            <li> I have bought a few clippers to keep up with the family haircuts in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my teen son is in the JRROTC and got tired of  going to the hairdressers every 3 weeks and paying $20.</li>
            <li> saved tons of money on haircuts with this heavy duty trimmer</li>
            <li> I am probably missing some things....</li>
            <li> Bought this for someone for everyday use at work.  </li>
            <li> Its a $20 clipper that paid for itself in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this hair cutter for the few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have an autistic son who is quite a challenge to get haircuts done at the salon.  </li>
            <li> opening it a few days after Christmas, we found out&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $12-$15 per hair cut each time and decided I could do it myself since i like it short.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for a few months</li>
            <li> I had to cut my hair blind since I can&#x27;t nearly see anything without my glasses.</li>
            <li> The clippers are fairly heavy</li>
            <li> I had some trouble with it when I get it...</li>
            <li> Blade rusted after just a few use</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years......</li>
            <li> but after a few uses, you hear a louder buzz while it&#x27;s not in motion but turned on.</li>
            <li> The haircut is uniform without uneven trenches.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> Feels heavy in my hand telling me</li>
            <li> Had it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> so i have to go over areas a few times.</li>
            <li> I also like the way it fits in my hand, and when I turn it on, I know it is heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> You will save the price of these clippers in just a few haircuts.</li>
            <li> a few I&#x27;ll use but whatever is needed is there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used for approximately 2 months, only twice a week, and it no longer works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few months in</li>
            <li> Feel heavy duty.</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty and have used them for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last 6 months, and was poor from the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Will prob take me a few times to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll deal with the inconvenience of the missing vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is already broken and it is not possible to return it.</li>
            <li> Why would Wahl make this thing looks so sturdy and it turns out to be just a heavy piece of trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy and noisy but it does what it suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> I have been investigating them for a few months before I purchased.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already making a weird LOUD vibrating noise and</li>
            <li> Upon opening, everything was well organized and the clipper was firm and heavy (not some cheap crap quality product).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my son&#x27;s hair a few times with it.  </li>
            <li> Use it once a month year round</li>
            <li> you need to follow the instruction firmly, or you need</li>
            <li> To start: I&#x27;m not cheap.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I can&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
            <li> Not a huge issue for me</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one, or if they&#x27;ve changed what these are made out of, but this motor never seemed right.  </li>
            <li> The past purchases have been for a cordless unit an all of the previous units died after a year  or two.</li>
            <li> super disappointed...</li>
            <li> very poor instrument; was not even working, was making a loud noise.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too heavy for others who were cutting my hair to hold it for a reasonable time frame (say no more than 5 minutes).</li>
            <li> can be a little difficult to operate when using the clippers (however this may be a pro since you will be less likely to bump it on accident)</li>
            <li> enclosure case has a small hole in it &amp; is a bit tight on keeping all pieces in it.</li>
            <li> Does what it should, no strong comments on either side of the aisle for me.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair with scissors only, for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my male Family members hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> The motor made a strange click noise while cutting it on for the second time using it</li>
            <li> The weight is mostly near the blades and the tapering down the handle makes it awkward to grip sometimes.</li>
            <li> This product is highly unreliable, I had to stop cutting my hair midway because it broke on me.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair with Wahl clippers since my senior year in high school.</li>
            <li> its just now starting to get dull, pulling my hair instead of cutting, but only a bit.</li>
            <li> but not ideal for longer facial hair.</li>
            <li> I usually use the green 1/2, 1, 2, or 3 guards.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are heavy, but even I can use them, and I have small hands.</li>
            <li> Knowing this item has already paid for itself makes it hard to give it any less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Wahl clippers for over 2 1/2 years now, not a single plastic piece in the set has broken!</li>
            <li> Between banging it against my head and coming close to cutting off my ear (an exaggeration, but it felt that way) and then giving me really bad results, I decided to buy my own electric clipper set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought these with the intention of cutting my own hair so that I could save money from here on out and let me tell you that these bad boys did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Also, the little booklet on how to cut your hair helped a lot!</li>
            <li> The buzzer is very loud, which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive clippers as they are not better, just a different brand.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed in this product as I understand Wahl is a reputable name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Wahl clippers that started chattering, or just got too loud that I replaced because they were probably going bad.  </li>
            <li> Plus on amazon this was 20$ cheaper than any other retailer!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves clumps of hair and failed to leave clean lines when cutting the neck and ear areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the blades started to get dull after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> That said, I bought this particular product, because I had gotten my hair cut short (crew cut), after a barber gave me a VERY bad hair cut.  </li>
            <li> It also came with oil for the trimmer, scissors, and a few combs!</li>
            <li> My son attends a small college where the nearest barber is 17 miles away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been used twice a month for the past couple of years without incident.</li>
            <li> This set contains a lot of small usefull accessories.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one I had before was a different brand, more expensive and did a horrible job.</li>
            <li> back, thats silly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The manual is terrible; it&#x27;s mostly about how to give someone a haircut.  </li>
            <li> for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> -HEAVY!</li>
            <li> No more 15 dollar haircuts.</li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; I have is the plastic cape that comes with it - its useless as cut hair sticks to it.  </li>
            <li> The cord stretches with plenty of room, and I usually let my son play with it (</li>
            <li> And usually for $10.  </li>
            <li> Just not satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a price no better than this.</li>
            <li> No more trip to hair salon for my two kids after I purchased this razor.</li>
            <li> I have had a set of Wahl clippers in the past and they worked well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a small gift for the holidays, I got my money out of it in one day, I cut his and my step sons hair without any issues.</li>
            <li> It has finally gotten to the point where If I just look at it wrong, the comb will fall off.  </li>
            <li> Inside you will also find a small comb a scissor.</li>
            <li> I was unable to returned it because i took it back to my country and shipping it to US</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I took a small amount of time to cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> no more inconsistency</li>
            <li> I am not pleased at all by this product.</li>
            <li> Along with the small bottle of oil about all we use out of the kit is one guide and the hair cutters</li>
            <li> past set</li>
            <li> but he has 2 kids and NO FREE TIME!  </li>
            <li> To get the length I like, I already knew the comb numbers from past experience.</li>
            <li> Received and anxiously gave myself a needed buzz-cut.</li>
            <li> I have had clippers in the past that would pull their hair.  </li>
            <li> The power switch on the trimmer is tiny and difficult to turn on and off with one hand.</li>
            <li> It turns out there is an adjustment screw on the side to limit the power or travel (not sure which) of the blades.  </li>
            <li> My usual hair cut at a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; place was around 10 bucks or so every month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my hair buzzed with a #2 guard for the past year.  </li>
            <li> I get professional results when cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> This is not the dependable item of the past.  </li>
            <li> No more pulling hair out as you attempted to cut it.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these as Christmas presents for my daughters who have small boys.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this should be sold as hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> To fix this I glued two small strips of magnets to the bottom of the plastic guard, and with that, it magnetizes to the metal head of the clipper.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Wahl &amp; sadly, it has not lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I would get a separate small trimmer for the neck, ears, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> No more making appointments for haircuts when I get time</li>
            <li> I was dissappointed it did not come with the small one that I used for around the ears and</li>
            <li> I tried doing it myself recently, and although it didn&#x27;t turn out TERRIBLE, it was terribly difficult and would have been better with some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only painful to use, it also leaves long patches of hair.</li>
            <li> Was so disappointed that the large &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; piece was thin, hollow plastic.</li>
            <li> It cuts &#x27;like butter&#x27; and seems very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased this brand and have had very few problems.  </li>
            <li> When looking for a grooming tool I wanted a brand that is reliable, not too expensive and one that was not very loud when on.      </li>
            <li> it is not easy to get them all into the carrying case!</li>
            <li> no slipping when holding at awkward angles</li>
            <li> In general, Wahl products are disappointing and survive, IMHO, based on price point.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the people who gave negative reviews got a lemon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought 3 sets of this, each broken down after 2 month.  </li>
            <li> It cuts well but the noise is too loud that is almost impossible to use it.</li>
            <li> animal fur clipper that is damn near impossible to hold with my arthritis.  </li>
            <li> only drawback is the minor length adjustment lever often hits with the seem of the body getting annoying at times.</li>
            <li> but the on and off switch is a little tough to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> n make my hand shaked hard.  </li>
            <li> But this is hardly a deciding factor to get the clippers.</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 times and now the blade is completely dull and will not cut my hair.</li>
            <li> For $25 it&#x27;s hard to complain about it.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s hard to get to the power.</li>
            <li> but it did do the job and at $30 it is hard for me to complain about it.</li>
            <li> Its so dull that it leaves lines in the hair no matter what you do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with 2 hair clips for victims with longer hair, 2 combs, scissors, 13 blades, a maintenance kit (brush/screwdriver and oil), a blade cover, a hard plastic case, and a plastic apron.</li>
            <li> The guide combs that come with the set are pure crap though.</li>
            <li> Cheap CRAP!!!  </li>
            <li> I think before I ordered this that some people complained of it being noisy.</li>
            <li> The scissors sucks however.</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s made of solid steel and chrome plating can be cold to the touch  </li>
            <li> In my opinion people are confusing hair and these metal</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this for any novice, undertaking hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I can go over one spot several times and it will still be cutting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only two drawbacks are its kinda noisy when cutting close to the ears, and also when blade is at its shortest it doesn&#x27;t cut well, and it pulls hair.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this Wahl hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to do hair cutting at home.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short (about an inch at the longest) and if you wear yours longer you may want to research getting longer cutting combs for the clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I was already cutting my hair at home with a smaller cutter that was already beginning to fade.  </li>
            <li> At this writing, I like the unit and would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple and inexpensive hair cutting solution.</li>
            <li> Just using these clippers twice already pays for the cost of the clippers considering a haircut is at least $10.  </li>
            <li> , at least not like they used to.</li>
            <li> Hardest part is cutting the back and fading it.</li>
            <li> It comes with some simple instructions for cutting hair that I followed.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the plastic barber&#x27;s cape.</li>
            <li> Plugged in the Clipper fo 1st time &amp; gosh it made a deafning sound &amp; vibrated awfully.</li>
            <li> Kinda pulls my hair and it sucks &#x27;cause it hurts.</li>
            <li> Cutting guide attachments for various lengths, angles, sides of head, eyebrows, around ears...combs, clips, scissors, and it all packs up inside a convenient and sturdy carrying case.</li>
            <li> danger of cuts or injuries at all (at least in the way I used it or the way it is supposed to be used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s money in the bank every time you are using this for cutting hair vs paying it at the local barbershop.....</li>
            <li> A trivial complaint it would seem</li>
            <li> I had this product for at least 4 years.  </li>
            <li> purchased this because I want to shave my head at least once every two weeks</li>
            <li> yesterday night I complained and today the replacement has already been delivered</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was the included cape.</li>
            <li> At least now I have a chance of not ever having to buy another one for me.</li>
            <li> I wish the actual set came with a DVD to watch but you can look on YouTube for cutting suggestions.</li>
            <li> I ignored some of the negative reviews, I should have listened.</li>
            <li> No pulling of hairs  Works on thick hairs too   </li>
            <li> You have to move slowly the clipper thru the fur...</li>
            <li> everytime, it will catch a bit and you will slowly and gradually trim the fur.  </li>
            <li> The hair is too thick and the cutter can&#x27;t get through it well.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice, take it slow.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, I have always had thick hair.</li>
            <li> My advice: GO SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> My only grief with these is they don&#x27;t get quite as close as other clippers I&#x27;ve tried by wahl.</li>
            <li> I mean the one I had was from the 1960s and it lasted for over 40 years.  </li>
            <li> No more trips to the salon!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by other brands and go with this guy.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I dont usually rave about a product!</li>
            <li> HESITATE NO MORE!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s plugged in, this thing gets a-going and no trouble cutting hair!</li>
            <li> Currently I am not sure if the noise and vibrations are due to the transformation of the electricity or there is some issue with the hair cutting device.</li>
            <li> I was really disgusted to open this package (I noticed that the tape didn&#x27;t look factory sealed) to find that the cord for the clippers was sloppily retied and that the clippers were clearly used.</li>
            <li> Seriously, your wasting your review if that is all you have to complain about with these clippers.</li>
            <li> So at 15$ a pop that&#x27;s some serious savings.</li>
            <li> I thought that was ridiculous for a 10 minute hair cut.  </li>
            <li> I hope these last awhile as I am tired or replacing hair cutting razors.</li>
            <li> but I wanted a sturdier one vs a less expensive plastic model.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> thing is a serious pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I replaced it after a year of use (maybe a dozen hair cuts), which is unfortunate as the previous Wahl I had purchased had been a workhorse for over a decade.</li>
            <li> This machine works well and not too shaky to handle.</li>
            <li> I noticed the other day that when cutting my son&#x27;s thick hair, the hair would get stuck in a crevice by the head.  </li>
            <li> Has no problem cutting through thick hair unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little vague but does the job well.</li>
            <li> My husband owned a Conair set like this when we were married and cutting his hair was always a painful chore for us.</li>
            <li> and I constantly have a bad haircut when I use these clippers.</li>
            <li> We oiled them as directed and upon the first attempt at hair cutting they pulled a ton of hair, it was extremely painful.  </li>
            <li> I cannot emphasize enough how offensively bad this is.</li>
            <li> When it gets to the point where its starting to get painful</li>
            <li> Returned it, and got an American Made product, which I was honestly shocked to see.</li>
            <li> In a way, a 3 is not fair.</li>
            <li> Scissors quality was also not good.....</li>
            <li> It allowed me to adjust the clipper speed to match what I like, nothing worse than slow clippers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt when cutting and doesn&#x27;t slow down for anything.</li>
            <li> Leaving one side of the clippers cutting shorter than the other.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, so I took my time cutting the hair to avoid pinches or discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have used other clippers but they did not work as well as this hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li> I tried for 20 minutes to cut my hair, and managed to remove a small golf-ball-sized wad of random strands.</li>
            <li> I learned this from Wahl&#x27;s global site at: [...]  </li>
            <li> Not meant for weak hands.</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed at the quality of the clipper itself and especially the quality of the guides.</li>
            <li> No more scheduling hair cut appointments and paying expensive fees.</li>
            <li> Yes if you push on it, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of force to &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; them, but they move back, and while cutting hair, they don&#x27;t bend one bit!</li>
            <li> hesitate to pay the extra money, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair!</li>
            <li> The blades when cutting my sons hair which is very thick tended to bog down</li>
            <li> I was always afraid it would stop working half way through.</li>
            <li> Even at the closest setting, it leaves behind about an eighth inch of hair, which is pretty terrible.</li>
            <li> The plastic is thin, brittle and so weak it appears like it could snap at any moment.  </li>
            <li> The item is very bad, very loud voice gives me a headache that i dont use it anymore, dont buy</li>
            <li> The Remington hurt and cut VERY slowly.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and beard, and this guy trims both well.</li>
            <li> It works but very slow and eventually like</li>
            <li> Needless to say I didn&#x27;t let that blithering moron come anywhere near my hair, and I cut it myself.</li>
            <li> But the #2 attachment does not fit properly and rattles terribly.</li>
            <li> The product is a wahl 79524-2501 chrome pro 24-piece haircut kit i got this item completely broken</li>
            <li> Poor guy -</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be getting my hair cut at home, but got tired of going to barber shop and waiting for an extended period of time for a haircut.</li>
            <li> None of them have broken on me yet.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for him which he hadn&#x27;t t tired as yet.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this aspect of them.</li>
            <li> Before trying this product I had gone through about 4 rechargeable hair clippers that all ended with broken clip teeth.  </li>
            <li> It was heavy in weight and cut like it was cutting air.  </li>
            <li> the on/off switch was broken and not working</li>
            <li> This purchase was extremely disappointing and a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $15 for someone to use a #8 guide all over my head, So I decided I would try it</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> The scissors included, were already broken when I opened the case.  </li>
            <li> This product removes hair poorly, even at maximum power.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying $20 for hair cuts and bought this.  </li>
            <li> One of the clips had teeth broken</li>
            <li> I got so tired of battery powered clippers that can&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Am up in years and was getting tired of paying some one to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> They are quite versatile and have several attachments, but the scissors and comb that come with it are worthless.</li>
            <li> broken within 5 minutes of opening package.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken</li>
            <li> I got tired of the batteries dying.</li>
            <li> Bought an 220 to 120 v adapter and still very noisy , awful noise .</li>
            <li> One of the tooth on the number 5 guide was broken when I received it.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of paying someone $20 to cut my hair with clippers.</li>
            <li> I realized it&#x27;s almost impossible to mess up.  </li>
            <li> I hate my long time</li>
            <li> My old clippers (Wahl 12+ years)stopped working, so I bought conair clippers and was very disappointed in the quality.  </li>
            <li> reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that once you set the cutting height adjustment lever you have to be very careful that you don&#x27;t accidently hit it and change the setting when you reposition your hands on the unit while cutting and trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat this hair cutting kit for the price.</li>
            <li> they wouldn&#x27;t be so loud, however, nothing has worked and these clippers are horrible.  </li>
            <li> He said he didn&#x27;t realize how awful his old set was until he received this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not happy with how its already useless.</li>
            <li> Really shocked at the amount of product you get with so little money!</li>
            <li> It is puzzling, though, because I have a small beard trimmer from Wahl, and you could shear sheep with that thing - too bad</li>
            <li> Plus no more bad haircuts.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is getting bad reviews from noise and vibrations....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in what I received, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to poor quality or poor packaging.</li>
            <li> It was also very painful against my scalp, and caused some minor bleeding.</li>
            <li> plastic guards (those you use to decide the length of hair you want) are very weak and end up screwing up your haircut.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can not return  </li>
            <li> How silly is that?</li>
            <li> Trying to cut sideburns or around the neck is difficult with this because it does not get close to the skin.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong with this model.</li>
            <li> Cons: a bit noisy, not perfect for long-time use    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this information is sadly lacking from Wahl&#x27;s US</li>
            <li> i try to figure out whats wrong, n</li>
            <li> Come today, everyone, including random strangers, have been complimenting me on it.</li>
            <li> , Ill buy another Wahl to replace it, it has served me that well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say for the money you can&#x27;t go wrong, its already paid for itself in usage.</li>
            <li> Whats worst is this thing will turn your neck extremely red for some reason (perhaps the heat or friction).  </li>
            <li> Buying this product was difficult, because I based buying my hair clippers on peoples reviews.  </li>
            <li> yes ill deffinately buy again if  i needed too</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i had to stand there in Sillys for an hour looking at amazon reviews comparing.in store models.</li>
            <li> Living in Los Angeles is expensive enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> clippers started to fail after 9 months.</li>
            <li> lousy products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> all the others does just no matter how kept up and sharpened fails to do the job.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this company.</li>
            <li> Total crap!</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> but since I didn&#x27;t buy an expensive set of clippers to begin with, I was advised just to replace the clippers rather than having the blades sharpened.  </li>
            <li> so nothing is complicated.</li>
            <li> These clippers are useless and I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> Needless to say we put the clippers away and finished everything else with scissors.</li>
            <li> boy was i wrong</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with your 25 bucks.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna turn into the creepy bald guy.</li>
            <li> so storing it sans hair is rather difficult.  </li>
            <li> The cutters also are mediocre.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> it doesnt have sideburn trimmers but those arent expensive</li>
            <li> Durability is questionable.</li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions.. cant go wrong..  </li>
            <li> ; items are useless...</li>
            <li> If you hold them &#x27;wrong&#x27;</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for the dogs.</li>
            <li> I did it the wrong way</li>
            <li> Not a perfect solution</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the ends of the hair appear fizzy.</li>
            <li> Maintenance isn&#x27;t too difficult, nor is operating the device.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I missed the return window by two days.</li>
            <li> Now I do it at home and don&#x27;t have to make an expensive appointment.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but they all (including the clippers) seem like very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The quality on the picture is very approximate of the quality of the clippers themselves.</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t use ear guide because they&#x27;re shaky when attached on the cutter and can screw up really bad when cutting on the side/back of the ear</li>
            <li> One of the blade guides came broken :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointment and angry because I&#x27;m now stuck with a useless shaver.</li>
            <li> Maximum length attachment is 1-inch, which is kinda disappointing since I prefer 1.5 or 2-inch options.</li>
            <li> Cutting hair is like a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Works for cutting hair weekly.</li>
            <li> I thought the hair cutting scissors were just so-so, but they work.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for a while now, but hadn&#x27;t had the nerve to use any type of electrical trimmers/clippers.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up cutting myself every time.</li>
            <li> but I bought it for cutting hair bald and it does not cut close for bald heads.</li>
            <li> My husband and I had no problem carrying on a conversation while cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> so he isn&#x27;t afraid of the noise or vibration.  </li>
            <li> There were hair clippings on and around the cutting blades and some of the parts</li>
            <li> Any pressure causes them to move and bend while cutting.</li>
            <li> I will just keep them around as an emergency tool and buy something that allows for shorter cutting.</li>
            <li> Even my hand felt like it is still shaking after I finished cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair with this</li>
            <li> I just started cutting my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair with these.  </li>
            <li> I feel like a pro when cutting my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for use on a deployment and ended up cutting 8-10 people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Had a multitude of heads, scissors, comb, and a cover for when you are cutting hair.</li>
            <li> If it could even do it that is, as I couldn&#x27;t even finish cutting my hair &amp;</li>
            <li> The Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit went through my hair like it was cutting butter.</li>
            <li> I used to pay over $200 per year on cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> You can align the blades and adjust for cutting distance.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re cutting hair for gods sake.</li>
            <li> Just remember to use oil before and after every use to keep the blades cutting.</li>
            <li> : Some of the attachments don&#x27;t set well and rattle like crazy when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and started cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> After spending 8 years in the Army I&#x27;ve become quite used to cutting my hair often.</li>
            <li> Then it would just stop cutting, the blades would lock in place and it would just stop cutting.  </li>
            <li> It will lower and raise the cutting blades in case</li>
            <li> Now that I have a son, I am cutting his hair with Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> Defective... pulled hair out vs cutting.</li>
            <li> Cutting hair is a cinch with the numbered clipper combs.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointing.  </li>
            <li> -A T-Blade can be use to replace the blade -Cutting</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for 45 years.  </li>
            <li> The heads it provides for cutting don&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> then some when it comes to cutting or shaving hair.  </li>
            <li> It was no longer making the zigzag motion that does the cutting.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I tried ALL of the attachments, and then I kept on cutting without any attachments.</li>
            <li> and it vibrates like crazy.</li>
            <li> Got them for cutting hubbys hair.</li>
            <li> I am not a pro at cutting hair at all</li>
            <li> I already saved the cost by cutting my and my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> kit has everything you need for cutting hair at home</li>
            <li> My husband talked me into buying this and trying to save money by cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> do not believe my problems with it are user error since I have been cutting their hair at home now for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> This kit has everything you need for cutting hair at home.  </li>
            <li> I moved to the front and went at it with a forward motion, wrong!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry with this purchase!</li>
            <li> WTF!</li>
            <li> I got mad and threw them on the floor 4 times that I broke it, but I still finished my hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lame!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I have had this clipper for just under 2 months and it has failed!</li>
            <li> story...and a sad one (stop laughing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright!</li>
            <li> Its unpleasant as I am getting my hair cut but its not a deal breaker for me.  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair for 20 years and am so disappointed with this brand that used to be known for quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the bad review, but the bad experience that I&#x27;ve had with it is the reason.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in spite of the bad reviews it&#x27;s gotten.</li>
            <li> That was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> THESE CLIPPERS ARE BAD.</li>
            <li> may have a bad hair cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> and it was painful.</li>
            <li> The clipper will cut on and off by itself and if it does this while you are trying to cut hair it can be a bit painful.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t shocked that I broke it.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of paying $15 every month for a haircut, so I bought this kit and had my wife learn how to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> Sick of the barber trying to sell you hair thickening products?</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to maintain my beard having been disappointed by beard-specific trimmers.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> worst product i have ever bought, terrible cuts, heavy, bulky, doesn&#x27;t work for close beard trims, i hate it, instead buy the philips norelco trimmer</li>
            <li> Since there are attachments just for that, it made cutting his hair a breeze!</li>
            <li> Disappointed, thought its a dual power.</li>
            <li> The razor pulled the hair instead of cutting it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Saves me an expensive trip to the barber !!  </li>
            <li> Stupid Flanders.</li>

            <li> But don&#x27;t be retarded with it like me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to affect the operation but it is annoying.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> , I feel like an idiot .</li>

            <li> Very painful.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and order a HVAC 2000 Remington.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it doesn&#x27;t come with the 1 1/4 and 1 1/2 inch combs as I was hoping to grow my hair out so</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> might have given five stars if it hadn&#x27;t been for the AWFUL scissors.  </li>

            <li> TERRIBLE</li>

            <li> Can NOT be used (horrible noise and vibration) in countries with a power supply of 220 V &amp; 50</li>
            <li> The noise it makes is horrible.</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Worst piece of thing you can ever buy...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing trimmer! I have used this item to trim the hair of all of the men in my life. It works excellently. Lots of options for different levels of cuts. It also came with oil for the trimmer, scissors, and a few combs!</li>
            <li> I really liked the &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; plastic finish on the handle of these clippers. However, since I cut my own hair, I have a problem with the chrome finish reflecting too much light. It poses a distraction when trying to achieve an even fade with a more natural blend. The light that reflects off the clippers (which can be seen in my mirror&#x27;s reflection) can kind of make lines appear on my hair that aren&#x27;t really there. This mostly happens when cutting the hair on the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades cut really well. Definite upgrade over my old Wahl clippers which I had used for about the past 10 years. If you cut your own hair, I would advise against the chrome body and go for a solid colored plastic model. Overall a great product for the price</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper - so far anyway - just started using it - the attachments are wonderful - love the eyebrow attachment!!! Great sale too!</li>
            <li> Great clippers for the money</li>
            <li> I cut my bf&#x27;s hair for the first time with this!!!!!!!! Worked well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value cutters for the price but , it&#x27;s heavy, big, slippery, and NOISY !</li>
            <li> High quality for the price and made in USA. It cuts very evenly and without any effort at all. It&#x27;s quiet too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Save so much money doing haircuts at home!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter to use at college. She cuts hair on the side, to put a couple of dollars in her pocket.  Kits gives you everything you need at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve started cutting my own hair to save a little more cash in an effort to pay back my student loans a little quicker.</li>
            <li> Great value, and no problem after nearly 2 years....</li>
            <li> I have bought these as I regularly pay $40-50 for my hair cut at my preferred saloon. I have used them with the assistance of my girlfriend on three occasions to trim my back and sides of my hair, whilst keeping a long center region to be able to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of an electric razor, they are perfectly sharp (for the limited times I have used them) and there are enough adjustments to cover the range of hair length for my needs along the side. (I do not use this razor for the center, where I use scissors and shears instead). It is also a good idea to finish off a &amp;#34;buzzcut&amp;#34; with a pair of shears to blend the transitions of hair length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the purchase and see them as a great value for money. I highly advise getting a pair of shearing scissors to give your hair cut a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; finish!</li>
            <li> Love the product so far.</li>
            <li> Been cutting my own hair for almost two years now.  Get an extra vial of clipper oil but otherwise it has everything you need.  Probably saved hundreds in haircuts.</li>
            <li> i hate the fact that has number 1.5, so cant get a smooth fade when shave with number 1 and then have to create a fade</li>
            <li> Perfect - works awesome</li>
            <li> Great shears. I use them all the time, I cut my son&#x27;s hair and keep the back of mine shaved so they come in handy!</li>
            <li> Great kit, this my second Wahl chrome pro clippers.</li>
            <li> Great razor at a great price!  He rec&#x27;vd it on the exact day they said he would!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using cheap walmart clippers for years. The weight of the Wahl threw me off at first, but after using them it felt perfect. The only downfall with this is the case doesn&#x27;t have any way to organize the length guards and a few of the plastic prongs of them are bent slightly.</li>
            <li> Great clippers with a lot of accessories too. My fiance cuts my hair, we got a cheap pair from Ross but they were dull after a few uses. Decided to try these. Very happy with our decision.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Heavy duty quality, good product.</li>
            <li> Great working product. My husband was estactic.</li>
            <li> Got electrocuted, no longer can the attachment fit.</li>
            <li> My son attends a small college where the nearest barber is 17 miles away. So I bought these clippers for him, pointed him to a youtube video - and he is more than satisfied. The added bonus is he keeps his money in his pocket.</li>
            <li> It cuts well but the noise is too loud that is almost impossible to use it. Unfortunately I can not return  it becouse I live in Brasil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like the starter kit for guys&#x27; hair grooming needs. It&#x27;s got everything one could ask for. My boyfriend didn&#x27;t have anything for his hair, and this set has really helped him get everything all at once at a super great price. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought a Wahl, because the name has been around forever and it has a good reputation.  That said, I bought this particular product, because I had gotten my hair cut short (crew cut), after a barber gave me a VERY bad hair cut.  Actually the barber did me a great favor, because I realized that the tool she was using to cut my hair was most likely a Wahl, or Wahl like tool.  Between banging it against my head and coming close to cutting off my ear (an exaggeration, but it felt that way) and then giving me really bad results, I decided to buy my own electric clipper set.&lt;br /&gt;I know the Wahl name and when I saw this set and the very reasonable price, I just ordered it.  I&#x27;ve used it twice now and that has paid for the tool and all the accessories I got with it.  I never knew what they meant by &amp;#34;What number do you want on the sides?&amp;#34;  I always looked at them with a blank look.  The Wahl Pro has many clipper heads, all numbered and I discovered that the best for me is # 2 on the sides and # 3 on top and I don&#x27;t have to be beaten in the process.&lt;br /&gt;We are going to cut our grandson&#x27;s hair, which is longer, but feel very confident with the ease of use of this product.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to save money going to the barber, or just wants to look good when your hair starts getting a bit shaggy, in between visits. It has a SOLID build and lot&#x27;s of useful accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product, Great Deal, I&#x27;m Very Happy!!!</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair so I think this is the clippers and attachments  that she needs to do the job.</li>
            <li> Never worked properly.  Followed directions perfectly.  This clipper went in the trash.  Wahl should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> The case of the product is already FALLING APART!  I had to glue it to keep the case together.  I will not buy this product again.  Cheap CRAP!!!  This is nothing like the last model I ordered five years ago.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for cutting hair at home. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband thought it was a deal.  Good quality, several numbered length attachments, scissors, and combs included.  The case is flimsy, though.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the same price as a smaller Wahl  kit, this one has more extras. My last Wahl lasted 10 years, hope this one does the same. Seems very rugged, long cord, works great so far, came in a nice hard case. Good price.</li>
            <li> I use this to cut my son&#x27;s hair. I have used this for more than 6 months and I have had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it wasn&#x27;t great either. I needed to do several passes to get all the hair - which is pretty standard for my hair type. I have medium width hair, but a lot of it. I had to stop twice to re-oil and clean the blades because they stopped cutting (again this is normal for my hair) The packed contents are nice, but the attachments feel very flimsy. Maximum length attachment is 1-inch, which is kinda disappointing since I prefer 1.5 or 2-inch options. The build, however feels solid and is rather ergonomic (in a good way, its a smart design)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My husband owned a Conair set like this when we were married and cutting his hair was always a painful chore for us. We finally have replaced it with this Wahl set and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It cuts &#x27;like butter&#x27; and seems very heavy duty. Even after the 6 months or so that we&#x27;ve had it is has not yet seemed to dull and pull his hair, so we are hoping it will stay that way for a long time! Will definitely buy Wahl again for ourselves or gifts for others!</li>
            <li> This is a good product: useful and sturdy. This bundles lacks only one or two of the accessories (between very short trim and 10mm, there is nothing.</li>
            <li> I got my husband this as one of his birthday gifts since he had been mentioning needing a new one. It was packaged well, and shipped quickly. We tried out both clippers right away to see if they worked, and they both work perfectly! For $25, you really can&#x27;t get a better deal on men&#x27;s clippers!</li>
            <li> The machine works quite well. I read the instructions and cut the hair for my father, my husband and my boy. They all are happy with my work. totally worth of the money we have spent. But the package seems to have been opened already because there is hair on the machine. We simply cleaned it and do want to bother to ask for return.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for haircuts for about 6 months now. Knowing this item has already paid for itself makes it hard to give it any less than 5 stars. However, these clippers feel solid, cut well, and have plenty of accessories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut about 4-5 heads of hair so far with this clippers and they seem to work fine.  They are very smooth when cutting, and not that loud.  The plastic poncho style cover to keep hair off you ripped on the first use, but we don&#x27;t really need it.  All in all a good set of clippers.</li>
            <li> It works ok and does a reasonable job, but it takes several passes to clip the hair. If I had to do it over, I would wait and spend a few $$ more on a set that includes a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once and have never used any other home hair cut product, but this worked like a charm. I cut most of my hair, then girlfriend helped trim around the ears/back of neck.    To all guys: if you want a basic haircut, get this. Perfect!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had other clippers that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as these did. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> The clippers looked they were used already, even though i brought them new. Very noisey and after a short period of use they become extremely hot.</li>
            <li> Gave the first haircut yesterday, and with the instructions they give you, it worked out quite well.  I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair with scissors only, for a long time.  This speeds up the process.</li>
            <li> Great clipper! It is quiet, dependable and a little on the hefty side. It has an amazing array of attachments all stamped with measurements so as to make the set less confusing to use. The scissors and combs get the job done and although they are not top quality they are fine for home use. Between this baby and my Flowbee I can crank out my own haircut in 10 minutes or less!</li>
            <li> Great product! As advertised!</li>
            <li> One of the most solid products available. Definitely a must buy.</li>
            <li> I already owned a Wahl mustache trimmer and despite my horrific care of the product, it still functions great after many years. I recently shaved my head and my 1 year old boy needed a haircut, so I decided \\&quot;what the hell\\&quot; and made the purchase. It has everything you could want for the $$$. But as the title suggests, if you do not own a mustache trimmer, buy the slightly more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great construction, excellent accessories</li>
            <li> I would have to run my old clippers over my hair over and over.  These cut much better.  It is also a lot quieter than my old clippers.  Is it as good as a pro barber clipper? Probably not, but considering they are under $30, they work just as expected.</li>
            <li> A very high quality trimmer. Compared to another trimmer I owned earlier, this one barely creates any sound and is very effective in help trimming.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t use it as we intended.......us not the product</li>
            <li> These things are working great.  Strong, plus the no. 1/2 green guide is perfect for beard trimming.  Strong motor, plenty of guides.  Only used twice so far but very pleased.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product is great and does everything you&#x27;d expect. There is however one thing that lets this product down.  The other day I was trimming my hair outside to avoid getting hair inside when my neighbor popped his head over the fence to see what brand of water blaster I had purchased.  These puppies ARE THAT LOUD! This is the sort of item you would bring out at a party when tall stories were being exchanged. You could go grab them and say \\&quot;You&#x27;re not going to believe this, but check it out!\\&quot;  If you had kids who hated getting their hair cut and yell and scream while you do it, get these suckers, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to hear them above the noise.  I&#x27;m recommending you buy these just to see how loud they actually are.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Works Well  No pulling of hairs  Works on thick hairs too   The attachments are a bit poor quality   Significant sound when switched on but its not as loud as others say</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for several months now, and its still going strong. Great Product.</li>
            <li> My current wahl is 30 years old and clip on guides are showing their age, so I&#x27;m ready for new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power switch is flimsy and other reviews tell of it easily breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemingly nice carry case is useless as everything goes in loose. How silly is that?</li>
            <li> Excellent set of clippers</li>
            <li> wanted metal attachments and got plastic</li>
            <li> I found that beard trimmers were not consistent enough for longer beards, so I decided to a home trimmer. I&#x27;m very glad I did. This product is efficient and easy to use, and I got a very neat beard trim with little effort. I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working perfect! For the price is excellent! Remember to oil it though, or better, just read the instructions and you will be fine!</li>
            <li> I have owned this clipper for over 2 years and it is still working well. I do use mineral oil occasionally to keep it in tip top condition. It&#x27;s been used twice a month for the past couple of years without incident. The clippers are very comfortable to hold and it feels well built. The 24 piece kit has all that you need to perform a variety of haircuts. I&#x27;m very pleased with this clipper and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Holy sharpness batman! My first usage with this thing cut me 3 times because it&#x27;s incredibly sharp! It cuts really well. I haven&#x27;t used the blade adjuster at all, but there are tons of accessories that come with the kit. If you have a beard, or like short haircuts, this is for you. It doesn&#x27;t seem as loud as my last trimmer either, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Cheap, good clippers. If you know what your doing (its a haircut, not rocket science), then these clippers will pay for themselves after a couple uses and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this to shave his head and loves it.  Easy to use and does the job quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good set. I opened the package to find a nice set of clips and other accessories. I forgot to oil it before i used it for the first time (I believe that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re supposed to do it; bear with me I am a rookie), but I didn&#x27;t really have any problems with it. I used a #1 comb and raised it, and it came out pretty good; a nice and smooth looking cut. A couple pulls but it didn&#x27;t really hurt or anything. For something so affordable I wouldn&#x27;t complain at all. You get guide combs, combs to comb your hair, scissors, hair pins, oil, and a cape. The scissors are cool; kinda cheap but it&#x27;s alright. As for the cape, it is nice to have one so that you won&#x27;t get hair all over you. I tried tying one of the strings together and one of them tore, but no biggie as I still managed to get the cape on good. It doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer but for a several more dollars you could buy a Wahl set that has one. I have an Oster T-Trimmer that works very well so I didn&#x27;t need an extra one. Overall I am satisfied with the product. Would definitely buy a Wahl product again.</li>
            <li> Not as loud as some reviews indicate.  Cuts well (few pulls).  Easy to use lots of options for clipper lengths.&lt;br /&gt;I had a different make clipper with a ceramic blade, this cuts much better.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent unit definitely worth the money (the boys give it a thumbs up).</li>
            <li> I order a cordless Wahl that was smaller and ended up not liking it. I love this one, it is wide. I use it mainly for body hair grooming and it works beautifully. Comes with a comb and a scissor which is handy. The blade is smooth and not choppy. Great value and I think this model may be their best one.</li>
            <li> When I plugged it in the clipper was smoking and the motor exploded(died).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> So loud I stop use it</li>
            <li> Perfect. Cut my hair in 5 min, with no difficult. Buy it and stop paying top dollar for a haircut.</li>
            <li> Great product as represented. Only thing is too many pieces and no great storage device in the box. All the trimmers sort of fall around each other. Other than that.. AWESOME</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well. Even gives an instructions page on how to taper!  Easy to use and a TON of attachments..  And it was totally inexpensive too!</li>
            <li> I had a pair of Remington clippers before this one.  What a difference! The Remington hurt and cut VERY slowly.  This Wahl clipper is a breath of fresh air.  Cutting hair is like a breeze.  I never knew it could be done so quickly...and what a clean job! I can&#x27;t praise them enough.  Money well spent for sure!</li>
            <li> These clippers are so loud that they are unusable. I even tried using them with ear plugs and it was still too much. Don&#x27;t buy these clippers. My ears are still ringing.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like anybody cutting my hair... Well, that is unless you work at a barber&#x27;s shop. Now, after set backs at the job etc. I purchased this on a lightning deal. My wife watched several youtube videos, and learned to cut my hair. I have a military background so you can imagine my haircut. I am specific about what I want. This piece of machinery fits the bill, and my wife is a natural! Couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> This does not get a very close cut. Trying to cut sideburns or around the neck is difficult with this because it does not get close to the skin. My dad&#x27;s old Wahl cuts much closer. Because of this fact, I stopped using it all together. It&#x27;s a nice kit and it cuts hair nicely, but it just doesn&#x27;t get around the edges well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very concern about a product that i bought at your store on the first week of November this year. The product is a wahl 79524-2501 chrome pro 24-piece haircut kit i got this item completely broken and it doesn&#x27;t work, the package is unharmed for this reason it seems to me that the product was broken before it was put into the package, so i would liketo make a claim about this and ask for the better way to resolve this problem, it&#x27;s so dificult to me to send back the item because i live in venezuela.</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit&amp;#34; works great in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago and have used it twice.  It cuts my hair well and meets all my expectations. My wife (who cuts my hair) mentioned it was heavier than my previous cutters and vibrates a little more but she also stated it cuts my hair much smoother and with ease.  At this point I would recommend the cutters.</li>
            <li> Powerful, runs clean and produces great results.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my choice  I do not regret it.  This set contains a lot of small usefull accessories. Very good american product. I can now cut my hair myself.</li>
            <li> 12+ inches of hair down to a #4 buzz cut. These clippers work well. I haven&#x27;t had any snags in the 3-4 times I&#x27;ve buzzed my whole head. It has a nice weight to it. It isn&#x27;t too noisy. I&#x27;d recommend this model in a heartbeat, if anyone else was in the market for a set of personal clippers.</li>
            <li> A great haircutting tool at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This item comes in a great case with all the attachments. I love that it is easy to store and clean. I would recommend this to anyone looking to update or upgrade their clippers.</li>
            <li> Works for cutting hair weekly.</li>
            <li> The product was great, very good quality. I agree 100%</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and are very nice.   They cut easily without any pulling.  There are attachments for almost everything.   I didn&#x27;t think they were any louder than I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;A really good one!</li>
            <li> This is the second machine I get in two months. I am overseas so, the first one I burne it with 220 volts. Next one I was sure about the power outlet, but it is the same noise. They say it comes calibrated from the factory, well if that noise is calibrated I don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t to hear it after out calibration. It can cut ok, but the noise is unbeareble, I can&#x27;t stand the noise on my ears. It is very sad, I never had a Wahl and my Barbers always mentioned it as the best. I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Enough attachments to style any hair. Clippers can be a bit loud at certain times. Other than that, the are well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving myself flat top haircuts for years. Now I&#x27;ve got a little boy, and shave his head also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a perfectionist, and take a long time to get it &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several different clippers over the years.These clippers work decent, but they get hot pretty quick, and also get loud. Don&#x27;t know how long they will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a big deal, since the price is right.... After just 2 haircuts, it&#x27;s already earned it&#x27;s price and then some, considering every hair cut would have cost me $13 at the barber shop. (I think this kit is selling for $25)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they start getting hot, I oil the blade,  then switch over to scissors for a while so it can cool off-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a very small amount of oil, but these won&#x27;t last long if you don&#x27;t keep the blade oiled, so better get some extra blade oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done 6 flat tops with it so far, and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I am using this kit and it&#x27;s working fine for me. but i wish I would have ordered one with more attachements so that i can have more options for hair lengths .</li>
            <li> very good. sharp and seems it will last years.</li>
            <li> This kit comes equip with just about every piece you may need when giving a haircut at home. The only thing that it is missing is a brush to wipe away the hair on the back of the neck. The handheld shaver is a bit heavy but it is expected. The cord has a nice range and so far the haircut has been consistent and quick. The combs included are really useful and the directions are clear and concise.</li>
            <li> For the cost, this is a decent clipper.  We had a Wahl that was rechargeable, no cord, and the clipper blades just flipped off- that was a lovely clipper.  However, the blade attachment broke, and so we had to buy another clipper. This one&#x27;s blade screws on, which I suppose makes it longer lasting.  The short cord is something to get adjusted to.  The on/off switch gets a little stuck on ours.   However, for the cost, it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> My young adult son asked me to order these after the wife used his previous one as he refused to take them back for reason you can guess. He watches a lot of Youtube reviews before deciding on a product then researches further and asks our more experienced opinion as he has an affinity for the best products.</li>
            <li> WOW, what a great clipper for $25.00 I had a Conair clipper set that I used for years which I paid about the same price, it worked well for years but This WAHL clipper is so much better. It really feels professional when you use it. It cuts effortlessly and smooth. What a great value for $25. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so far so good! used it at least three times already and its worked excellently. pretty quiet, very powerful, and lots of extras. the clippers themselves seem to be  very durable and built to last years and years, and i dont think you should expect any less. and on top of all that its a great deal. if your looking for new hairclippers, even for commercial use, you cant go wrong here.</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect to maintain my &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; haircut and save money in the long run.  It has all the attachments you could ever need and the cutter is smooth and efficient.  I&#x27;ve used it three times now, and each time it has performed perfectly.</li>
            <li> works great. exactly what i wanted. only thing tho is that this is not for Lining up at all. cuts good, i am new at do it your self cuts once i get the balls to really cut some off the top ill Update.</li>
            <li> Avoid this product unless you don&#x27;t plan on using the guards!     The guards are made of cheap plastic that will constantly \\&quot;spread\\&quot; when you are cutting your hair. I use the #2 guard to cut my hair and I constantly have a bad haircut when I use these clippers. The plastic is thin, cheap, and flexible on the #2 guard such that if you cut your hair with any downward pressure whatsoever, the guard flexs and creates uneven clipping. This spreading and flexing of the guard leads to wavy and uneven cuts of your hair.     I would absolutely not recommend this product to anyone who cuts their hair using a guard. The clippers have good power and would be fine for anyone not using a guard. But the cheap guard really ruins the product.</li>
            <li> The product works great. It&#x27;s in perfect condition and came with all the pieces! I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I HATE HATE HATE paying to get my hair cut.  You either shell out tons of cash or you go to a place that charges ~$20 bucks for the same basic, generic haircut that is all done with clippers and might as well be buzzed anyway.  For less than the price of 2 haircuts at a strip mall I got this.  In retrospect I wish I spent the $8 more for the one with the personal/around ear trimmer.  I figured this has ear guards, and I have a microtouch so let&#x27;s save a couple of bucks.  Still not regretting the purchase.  Smooth, powerful cutting. I shaved my own head and this made it easy to do, even in the back.  The blades don&#x27;t loose power at certain angles like the cheapies can.</li>
            <li> Great equipment quick delivery</li>
            <li> The clippers work fantastic and cut my hair great.  I&#x27;ve had no pulls or any other issues with them.  I don&#x27;t think these clippers are louder than any other clippers that I have had used and even though I&#x27;ve only had them for a short time the durability seems to be good so far.  The set includes a ton of pieces even though I only use the guard and the case is pretty nice.    Overall this is a great price that will save you a ton of money when considering how much even cheap places like great clips charges.  I&#x27;m sure that you can get more powerful and more durable professional models but they will also probably cost a lot more.  If you are looking for just a simple great pear of clippers for normal use you cant get much better than these.</li>
            <li> One star maybe too generous.  I bought this model of clippers at a big box store.  When I went to cut my son&#x27;s hair a couple days later the clippers would not work properly.  They pulled my son&#x27;t hair instead of cut it.  I turned it off and back on and noted that it didn&#x27;t look like the blade was moving side to side like it should.  I &amp;#34;banged&amp;#34; it on my hand a few times and it started working.  Then it would stop. I&#x27;d hit it against my hand and it would start working again.  Poor guy - my son hates having his hair cut and thought if I could do it quickly with clippers it would be nice for both of us.  It took us a long time to get his hair cut.  He was a good sport about it but I was very disappointed in this product as I understand Wahl is a reputable name.</li>
            <li> Everything included works great.I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it too much yet but it seem to work just fine.</li>
            <li> The hair clipper is excellent.  It cut my hair as expected.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Enjoy using it yourself.</li>
            <li> This is the third razor I&#x27;ve bought in the last several year and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I had before was a different brand, more expensive and did a horrible job. This one is not too heavy (not very light either) and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, without clogging or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something simple, that just cuts hair, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this model.</li>
            <li> We received this haircutting kit yesterday, and I immediately didn&#x27;t like it.  My husband had a ten-year-old Conair kit that we decided to replace, but we shouldn&#x27;t have bought this model.  Though it was only $25, I was expecting some sort of quality, due to the positive past reviews and product description.  The black sizing combs that you attach to the razor look like they came out of a McDonald&#x27;s happy meal.  As do the actual combs.  The plastic is thin, brittle and so weak it appears like it could snap at any moment.  Also, the \\&quot;cape\\&quot; is simply a glorified kitchen garbage bag.  Literally the same thickness.  I would not recommend this kit to anyone, and would instead recommend spending another $25 and getting a higher quality model... that&#x27;s what we are going to do.</li>
            <li> We have tried several kinds of clippers for my husband. We have not been pleased until now. We knew the first time we used them that they were good. Clean nice cut, no pulling. Worked great. I would highly recommend, especially for bodygrooming.</li>
            <li> works great ... helps remove all the hair... just make sure you have a steady hand or you might nick yourself</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to wahl, please improve the quality of the black plastic parts.</li>
            <li> This did everything I needed it to and it easily paid for itself in 2 home haircuts. Great price and great value!</li>
            <li> I have tried other Chinese($9.99) clippers which actually didn&#x27;t work. Returned them and I then got the Wahl Chrome model and made a quick pass, expecting some resistance.  There was none.  Oops.  It cut so smooth, I accidentally shaved part of my scalp.(Frackin A)  Had to finish the whole process to the same length.  Point being.  It was like a hot knife through butter, and poof! No hair.  Works great.  Would recommend. But don&#x27;t be retarded with it like me.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I had an old Wahl for years and it finally gave up the ghost.  I mean the one I had was from the 1960s and it lasted for over 40 years.  This is why I bought another Wahl and I&#x27;m not sorry I did.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I just tossed this piece of junk in the trash. I tried for 20 minutes to cut my hair, and managed to remove a small golf-ball-sized wad of random strands. It is puzzling, though, because I have a small beard trimmer from Wahl, and you could shear sheep with that thing - too bad I don&#x27;t have any combs to use with it.    I think I&#x27;ll try a different brand...</li>
            <li> These clippers are awesome!  It came with everyth</li>
            <li> works like a champ, all the fittings.  works on the beard and the back, i mean head, i clip my HEAD hair!!  back, thats silly.</li>
            <li> This haircutting kit is quite good and professionally designed for this price range.    Pros: complete set, strong built, good price, good for home use, reliable    Cons: a bit noisy, not perfect for long-time use    You can buy it for personal &amp; home use.</li>
            <li> it does what it is supposed to do.  I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought this haircut set for my personal use. It is great, very convenient to use . The chrome hair clipper is powerful and that&#x27;s why I prefer the power supply clipper compared to the cordless one. The set is full and addressed all your need to operate at home. It is recommended to buy this set with a reasonable price. I&#x27;m looking to buy one more set at 220V for my parents.</li>
            <li> Fantastic buy, I bought to replace my eight year old Remington as plastic pieces broke or missing.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Combined with a YouTube instructional video I found, I am saving us money every month that has more than paid for this kit.</li>
            <li> very sharp doesnt pull hair like my previous clippers includes a lot of accessories and gets the job down without a hitch.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my son-in-law and he loved it.  It had every this he needed. A good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I was going to just buy the two angled guards for a current clipper, but realized I could get the whole kit for close to the same price... much better equipment than before, and now I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour trying to get the hair over their ears!</li>
            <li> Ok, I was a little nervous at first, since I&#x27;ve never cut my own hair. But, I&#x27;ve always said I&#x27;ve watched them cut my hair enough times I know I could do it if I could take my head off. Since that is not the best idea in the world. The Wahl cutter is the next best thing. READ the instructions. Most males do not. I am male. Therefore I did not. Almost disaster, but not quite. Remember to come from the back of the head and move forward. My hair is split down the middle and if cut too short will tend to spike. At first after I did the back I moved to the front and went at it with a forward motion, wrong! It cut too close. Thought I was going to end up with a reverse mohawk. Not in my plans. So, read the manual a little more. Went from the back forward throughout the whole cut and after putting some styling mousse through my hair I was amazed at how well my first cut turned out. I knew that in about 2 or 3 weeks if cut evenly will grow back uniformly which it is doing nicely. Would highly recommend this product. I think before I ordered this that some people complained of it being noisy. It&#x27;s not any more noisy than the ones they use in the hair salons. One more cut and it will have paid for itself.     PS: My wife&#x27;s name is on the review instead of mine. Don&#x27;t know why as I clicked on the email link asking me to write a review. I purchased it, she didn&#x27;t. Stupid Flanders. D&#x27;oh    MMcGrath</li>
            <li> I received this product 2 weeks ago. It worked fine for the first 30 seconds and then started to vibrate erratically - so loud that I cannot use it because my neighbors begin to bang on the walls. It still works, but for the first 30 seconds it hummed quietly. I tightened the screws to no avail. It still works but I really do not want to use it as it sounds like something is wrong and is loud enough to hurt my ears.</li>
            <li> I got sick of paying $15 every month for a haircut, so I bought this kit and had my wife learn how to cut my hair. We&#x27;ve had it for a year now and it&#x27;s still running strong. We haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far, except it does run a little hot after awhile. I haven&#x27;t yet noticed it pulling on my hair or anything, it&#x27;s been smooth.    The cape that came with the kit is more like a garbage bag, and it only lasted a few haircuts before it broke.</li>
            <li> works very well cutting my husband and sons hair it a lil lounder than i thought but that was fine by me.</li>
            <li> You can cut your hair and shave your beard. For the price there is nothing better. Only wish it was cordless, but not that important.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and beard, and this guy trims both well. I cut my hair myself and use a friend to even out the back of my neck. My only complaint is the cheapnees feeling of the guards themselves, but they fit on the trimmer well and they do not need to be anything special so its not a big deal. 4.5/5</li>
            <li> This set works perfect for home use. The clippers just glide without any pulling on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased a second set to groom my dog since they work so great!</li>
            <li> These clippers are very solid, clip smoothly and don&#x27;t get too hot.  Wahl&#x27;s web site doesn&#x27;t provide much on specifications, but I found the Wahl global site that confirms the standard blade on this clipper cuts from 0.8mm to 2.5mm, though the blade number is different in this country: [[ASIN:B000FJ17N0 WAHL Professional 2 Hole Precision Clipper Blade (Model:1045-100)]].  There&#x27;s also a finer blade available that cuts from 0.4mm to 1.0mm, [[ASIN:B000I3MRHI Wahl 1026-515 close cut clipper blade]] if you want to go even shorter. I learned this from Wahl&#x27;s global site at: [...]  Unfortunately this information is sadly lacking from Wahl&#x27;s US site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this kit comes with far more accessories than I will ever need, as I mostly use the 1/16\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot; guides or the bare blade.  This clipper vibrates much less than an older Andis kit I owned previously.  Many reviewers complain about the poor quality of the guides, but they&#x27;re the same as those my ex-barber uses.  As they&#x27;re meant to glide through hair, they don&#x27;t need to be very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two cuts, I&#x27;ve pretty much got my favorite cut figured out, and the kit has already paid for itself.  I like that the clipper comes with a five-year warranty, and I&#x27;ve found Wahl&#x27;s customer service to be very helpful in providing information when I&#x27;ve emailed and called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 10, 2014:  I&#x27;ve been using these clippers once weekly since I purchased the kit, and they&#x27;re still going strong.  I&#x27;ve saved A LOT of cash since I quit going to the barber.  :-)</li>
            <li> After my roommate banned me from using his Remmington, I had to get my own and so I did. This Whal does what you want and I find it so convenient that I cut my hair every month. Saves me $15 haircuts for 24 months now and works well with all the accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue with my roommate&#x27;s Remmington haircut kit is their guards; the plastic will warp under heat from the moving blades. So the shortest guard at 3mm kind of melted away. I was hesitate at purchasing this one without knowing and feeling the plastic and it worked out anyway. I have to remind myself not to keep it on all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing about this Whal is that I find myself wanting to cut my hair more often.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase. Christmas gift for my daughter, and she was thrilled.  It is three month&#x27;s later, working great.</li>
            <li> Ok well this definatly is a good easy to use trimmer,  very smooth to cut woth and has all the guards u could think of. The only reason i have not given 5 stars is i have only used it once yet, longevity will determine if this is 5 star or not. I will update review in a yr</li>
            <li> It worked fine.  For the record, my hair is kind of thick and it was really long when I cut it.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems but it wasn&#x27;t like an incredible experience, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual is terrible; it&#x27;s mostly about how to give someone a haircut.  Luckily the kit is pretty easy to use.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so I can&#x27;t speak to any longevity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have given five stars if it hadn&#x27;t been for the AWFUL scissors.  We used safety scissors in 1st grade that cut my hair better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was satisfied but not blown away.  Seems like a good deal for the money, though.</li>
            <li> I will never buy cordless clippers again. This one is no comparison to my two previous cordless units, which took 5 times as long to cut hair.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews I chose these clippers.  My husband has been bugging me forever to cut his hair, and he likes it short.  Not being a hair stylist I begged off the job for several years.  Finally, after losing a bet on a basketball game, where he agreed to shave his head, I decided I wasn&#x27;t letting one of his friends wield anything going near his head.  I didn&#x27;t have any \\&quot;human\\&quot; clippers so I used a pair of old clippers that we used to use on my families show cattle.  I did a decent job considering the size of these clippers.  However, I wasn&#x27;t going to use them ever again!  This is were Wahl comes into play.  They are very easy to use, and all the different guides are extremely helpful.  The guides allowed me to \\&quot;play\\&quot; with the length of his hair without getting to close.  The cut was super clean, so I would try a longer length guide to start and then go smaller from there depending on how short you want to go.  Compared to the only other clippers I&#x27;ve used these are quite and easy to handle.  I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but I&#x27;m guessing it will only take a couple of more times and I&#x27;ll be a pro!  :-)</li>
            <li> They work GREAT!  Best money could buy! I&#x27;ve had these for a year and I use them every 3 weeks so I guess that means I&#x27;ve used it almost 20 times.  So one $ per use and droping and no issues yet. The only complaint I have is that I needed to by a diffrient come to do my hair cut that was bigger but that is because I am very special about my hair.  This set has everything you need for a great price and the plastic box works great for keeping everything in one place.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to give myself haircuts as well as shave our cats for the summer. It turns out that the clipper is satisfactory for both tasks. I found I have to go over the cats more than once in certain areas, but it&#x27;s not much of a hassle. As for the rest of the kit, it is not hard to tell that the accessories are cheaply made. The combs and guides are flimsy - and as other reviewers have stated, the barber poncho is essentially a garbage bag. However, the guides are pretty adequate, and as long as you aren&#x27;t rough with them I doubt you&#x27;ll break anything. Switching guides on the clipper is a breeze as they snap on and off easily - but not too easily.    Overall, Wahl&#x27;s product isn&#x27;t jaw-droppingly amazing, but it&#x27;s good deal for 27 dollars. My wife gave me an excellent haircut in 15 minutes. The clipper itself is also surprisingly heavy and solid, which suggests reliability to me. It is also easy to take apart for oiling/cleaning. We&#x27;ve only used the item a few times so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity, but if it lasts a year I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth for sure.</li>
            <li> lots of accessories come with this and it is so easy to cut my own hair, saving me $15 a month, paying for itself in a few short months.  I bought this because I had brain surgery and as you might of guessed it, they shaved my head and my hair was still long on one side, so I wanted to even it out, but now I just cut my own hair every month!!  I&#x27;m getting better every time</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to experiment with my hair without paying lots of money. I have only used it once so far but it worked really well. I have pretty thick hair so I had to pass through a couple of times times for everything to cut evenly.</li>
            <li> Great price. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be getting my hair cut at home, but got tired of going to barber shop and waiting for an extended period of time for a haircut. I paid $20+tip for a haircut that took the barber less than eight minutes to cut my hair.  Decided my better half could cut my hair just as good and a lot more convenient for me. Well, after we both read the instructions and watched a short video, she cut my hair. Did a great job even though she was a nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof, but I still have both my ears and a nice haircut. Oh, btw, I had to pay her $20+tip.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for professional use as my husband had the same brand and style for 10 years to cut his own hair at home and always loved them.  They have done a great job and for the price, I will purchase them again when I wear this set out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for two years to do all my own hair cuts.  They came with a bunch of accessories........I&#x27;m sure if you had some skill you could shave a jesus piece in your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Wahl we have owned. Does a good job, but this on is much louder that the last one.</li>
            <li> I learned to cut my own hair with this thing. Now I look all sexy-rich and don&#x27;t pay barbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it: you care way more about your appearance than some person you pay to spend a maximum of half an hour cutting your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper, along with the time investment of learning how to properly use it, will both save you a ton of money, and help you determine a hairstyle that suits you. Not the top of the line in the clipper world but you don&#x27;t need it to be. It&#x27;s affordable and has been working for a few months now. Pretty solid clippers.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as advertised.  Works perfectly and I would recommend this product to my friends. Was quite happy with the amount of accessories.  Just right for the novice.  Excellent machine.</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend for Christmas since his other one was dead.  I got this for a great price!  He loves it!</li>
            <li> High quality, was surprised how well made and versatile.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my beard.  I was tired of cordless trimmers always needing charged or new batteries.  In my opinion, a product that is virtually always used 3 feet from an electrical outlet doesn&#x27;t need to be cordless.    It&#x27;s slightly louder than a cordless trimmer, but not enough to be bothersome.  It also cuts better than a cordless.    It&#x27;s larger and heavier than most cordless beard trimmers; but it&#x27;s designed for more rigorous use.    My one dislike is the length of the attachments.  I&#x27;ve never seen any that have such long fins on them.  It makes maneuvering around the face tricky.</li>
            <li> This haircut kit is excellent, i have had two haircut kits before this, but they not working like this, i recommend this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Used it for a year now. So that means I saved ~$500 on haircuts. Works great.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, efficient, powerful and well constructed.  Never looked back.  Only notable issue with was a misalignment with the blade head, which I noticed after a few months of use.  I was able to readjust with a screwdriver, but no problems since.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair (what&#x27;s left of it...) for the past 15 years. This is my 4th or 5th machine and it is by far the best I ever had. It cuts great and feels like good quality especially when considering the low price.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use. My husband gets his haircut at home now. Saves a lot of money.  Received quickly, and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic just what I needed to get the job done</li>
            <li> Bought this product to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair to avoid the salon charge. Paying for Men&#x27;s Haircut? Not happening. So I read the reviews and decided on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chord is just long enough that you can get around easily without tripping over it. The plastic guides are easy to snap on and off and the instructions are easy to follow. They give you two different combs (with different grading) and a nice pair of hair scissors. The hair glides through hair easily and does not pull, even when moving fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Oster, Wahl, Vidal Sassoon hair clippers in the past (one of each since 1999) and by far Wahl is the best in terms of product life and functionality. This will be my 2nd Wahl. The chrome clippers are solid and sturdy. The blades are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use Wahl or other brand clipping oil to retain the longevity of clippers. Don&#x27;t use WD-40! I learned that mistake early on when i first began cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two gripes about the product are the clipper attachment feel cheap like i&#x27;m going to break them when i snap them on to the sheers. And second, even though i have small hands I feel the on/off switch needs to be bigger.</li>
            <li> The kit comes with all the necessary tools to cut and trim just about any hair.  There is simply no reason to spend any more money on a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you should keep in mind:  it vibrates a lot.  That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Needed new clippers because mine were old and ready to be retired. This kit had everything I was looking for. They are quite and clip very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  sharp as a  mother f-er. Great buy</li>
            <li> This has made cutting my sons hair so much easier!  They also include everything you could possible need for the whole process!!  My first pair I&#x27;ve ever bought but they have already paid for themselves!</li>
            <li> After I received my &#x27;Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit&#x27; from Amazon.com , I proceded to try it on myself and found I could trim my eyebrows , sideburns and the hair on each side of my head using the attachments provided with the kit. Using different attachments , I had my daughter trim the back and top for a complete haircut . It was amazing how easy it was to accomplish. It&#x27;s a great haircut kit and I would recommend it to everyone to try.   P.S. And the price will also fit any budgit. .... B.H.</li>
            <li> Very very very noisy clipper&lt;br /&gt;Really i feel like i am using drill over my head !!!&lt;br /&gt;If y. Are looking for a good clipper avid this one.&lt;br /&gt;Dont loss your Mony for something you will never use it.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time the other night.  Great set and worth the money. Very quiet and cuts hair very nice.  My wife cut my hair and did a very nice job for her first hair cut.  Instructions are well written and user friendly.</li>
            <li> This item is solid, and once you use it twice, it pays for itself in terms of haircuts.  Granted, I keep my hair short and one length, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> It is really handy, even u have no experince, u can do it as well as a barber does.   I use it frenquently, works well, not that noisy as someone reviewed.   The scissors sucks however.</li>
            <li> Pros:  -Powerful motor  -Attractive sleek-looking design  -Lots of attachments and accessories    Cons:  -NOISY! Annoyingly loud; the kit should include a free set of earplugs for the user and anyone else in the house  -VIBRATION! Vibrates so much it could effectively be used as a body massager  -HEAVY! Feels like it&#x27;s made of solid steel and chrome plating can be cold to the touch  -SLIPPERY! Entirely smooth surface with no attempt to design any helpful grip whatsoever into the handle area</li>
            <li> Great product I can count on! Reasonably fast shipping.</li>
            <li> No more 15 dollar haircuts. A lot of accessories.</li>
            <li> I never seem to have problems with Amazon merchandise.  The oil for the clippers is a generous amount for the price.  Ordering printer cartriges through Amazon is much easier and the same price and running around.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using americans electric tools, everything looked fine when i receive the package, but when i plug the clipper to the wall the sound it so horrible n make my hand shaked hard.  i try to figure out whats wrong, n i found that the voltage is 110, while my country is 220.  then im try to use it with a stepdown trafo, it works better but still to noisy if i compare it to wahl clipper manufacured in asia.  overall, for its function, this clipper works perfectly besides problem i had above.</li>
            <li> I use it to cut my hair and my son&#x27;s hair. It has worked great so far. Plenty of different attachments.</li>
            <li> My wife has always done a great job cutting all our families hair. Our old clippers were burning out so I bought another one from the store. This one didnt have all the gaurd sizes. So I decided to get this one. It looked like the best one after comparing price, reviews &amp; product descriprion. So far it works great. It shipped on time &amp; in good condition.</li>
            <li> Just cut my hair for the first time on my own with the Chrome Pro. I told my friends as a joke that me and my roommate would be giving each other haircuts and everyone was interested to see how I&#x27;d look after the weekend. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t let that blithering moron come anywhere near my hair, and I cut it myself. Come today, everyone, including random strangers, have been complimenting me on it. Even Julie from math class. Especially Julie from math class. She finally said yes to me asking her on a date! And the date went so well that I&#x27;ve already proposed and she said yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a must-have item for guys or girls who are interested in the female or male variety.</li>
            <li> I received this hair trimmer the other day, and I was just blown away. They thought of everything with this package of goodies. Not only did they provide a really nice \\&quot;How To\\&quot; brochure, but they give you a plastic cape, all kinds of different length attachment combs, regular combs, scissors, hair clips, ear trimmer combs, ear edger attachment, oil, and even an eyebrow trimmer attachment! I think that covers it all. Whew! I thought...let me at him! You won&#x27;t be sorry with this purchase!</li>
            <li> First time out of the box and using it the product was very loud and painful and the blade actually fell off. Can&#x27;t return, just busted it out the box ordered about a month ago. Return policy is about 30 days be aware.</li>
            <li> yes,it&#x27;s really strong and useful</li>
            <li> The sheer is EXTREMELY noisy and the adjustments doesnt work.  When you try to adjust it to where there is no noise the sheer wont cut. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED because I bought this item because of the fact that it is one of the best but I wasted my money. TERRIBLE</li>
            <li> I read some reviews and people say the product they received was used.  I strongly doubt that.  As I opened my Haircut kit, the first thing I took a look was the blade on cutter.  It does have some metal fregments which means this blade has been freshly made. In my opinion people are confusing hair and these metal fregments.(pardon my wording here, but believe me, they can be mistaken in such way)  I tried these and they work. They do what they advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Perfect for haircuts. but not ideal for longer facial hair.</li>
            <li> Works great. Saving a lot of money by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer trimmed pubes. This gem is the perfect tool for the job. It also cuts hair (on my head) very well. The Unit seems robust, ergonomic and professional in terms of build quality. Pubes aside, these are the best twenty six bucks I&#x27;ve shelled out in a decade. - and to boot I can also shave my dog Scruffy!</li>
            <li> There was hair on the device when I received it.Was this a refurbished device being sold as new ? Seller needs better QC.</li>
            <li> This thing pulled on my beard hair when I tried it for the first time. I oiled it and tried multiple lengths and one of the shorter guards to no avail. I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t cut a lot of beard hairs compared to my smaller battery-operated Wahl. I might just have to buy another one of those...unless Wahl decided to decrease the product as a lot of companies tend to do nowadays thanks to Amazon&#x27;s neglection to inform consumers that the 5-star product might not be the same product in terms of materials and design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased this brand and have had very few problems.  I read through the negative reviews and chuckled at the ones that say its too loud.  I dont think they&#x27;ve ever been to a real barber shop.  This is my 3rd set of clippers from Wahl in the last 10 years.  This one is no different and works great.  My son has thick, straw-like asian hair and it had no issues going through his.  And if you run into a few reviews that complain about price, you have to think of the money just one of these a year will save you.  I could buy one about every other month and still save money over going to the barber shop.  The only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; I have is the plastic cape that comes with it - its useless as cut hair sticks to it.  But this is hardly a deciding factor to get the clippers.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp cutters. Cuts really well and does an excellent job. Has many attachments some of which you may never used but they are there. These clippers are heavier than the last one I had. The only thing that I do not like about them though is the clipper depth adjustment doesn&#x27;t stay put. My other one had stop clicks that it would stay at unless you moved it. I might be able to tighten the adjustment switch so it doesn&#x27;t move on its own. Haven&#x27;t checked that out.</li>
            <li> This is a well built hair cutting kit at a very good price. I use it successfully every two weeks.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Chrome Pro 24-piece Haircut Kit not only pays for itself in just a few trims, it saves the time and money spent traveling to and waiting at the barber shop. It can be used when it&#x27;s convenient for you and your family. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to maintain my beard having been disappointed by beard-specific trimmers. It comes with more than enough guides and extensions. Its a strong, clean cut with no tugging. I would definitely recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Works great for my husbands buzz cut!</li>
            <li> Extremely noisy, and couldn&#x27;t cut through my hair like other OLDER Wahl models had been. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> First one broke quick</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s Wahl and it&#x27;s American made. The second I got it I used it and let me tell you this is the best clippers I have even bought. It&#x27;s the same quality clippers barbers use in a barber shop. The clippers just hum not that annoying loud sounds cheap clippers make. And the switch is just like the barbers use. It makes that noticeable click sounds the pros use. Means its a high quality clipper.     I first had the Conair HCT495 in black for about three years then finally I dropped the clipper and the blade broke. And then replaced it with the Conair HCT495 in Chrome. And had that for about 2 years and the bottom blade wasn&#x27;t touching the top blade anymore when set at the closes setting. I replaced them with this Wahl set and I&#x27;ll never go back to Conair ever again. And the weight of the Wahl vs the Conair is noticeable. The Wahl has more weight to it which is a great thing. Means it&#x27;s made to last.</li>
            <li> I rarely feel like I got more than I paid for.  These clippers seem well built and work well especially when you consider the price.  The only issue I&#x27;ve had is the #1 guard wants to come off while using it.  The other guards stay attached.  The cleaning brush is also kinda chincy.  The price was nice and they are made in the USA.  I chose this product over the others specifically for the location of its manufacture.  Are you listening corporate America?</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay sharp long</li>
            <li> Great value for amatuer hair cutting.  Not exactly salon quality but exactly what you&#x27;d expect for the price. Plus tax free:)</li>
            <li> After three times use, it makes a broken noise occasionally, but it still works. I used it 6 times now. For a guy who only have flattop like my bf, it is very economical.</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect. Lots of combs to choose from and stays sharp with little maintenance. It was a great price for a very good kit.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good,  but what do I know I&#x27;m just using it as a tattoo gun.</li>
            <li> Excellent product arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> After realizing that all the stylists at the hair place really did was shave the side of my head with one of these and then hand-trim the top, I decided to try it for myself and save some money!    I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work, or what my hair would end up looking like, but I have to say it was worth the money. I just need to play around with the attachments more to figure out which ones I want to use, but I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> Nice set of clippers.</li>
            <li> I used it many times on myself (yes I cut my own hair! Takes a while and a lot of patience but it comes out alright. Not nearly as good as when I go a professional barber but if you need to save money and aren&#x27;t as vain as me ( I gave up and started going to the barber) then it&#x27;s a fine compromise. The clip&#x27;s aren&#x27;t that great quality but you get what you pay for. It does the job. I feel like it cuts a little bit unevenly. Like you can go over the same area and some hair will be SLIGHTLY shorter or longer than the same hair. Could be just my head, or my imagination. If you demand an amazing haircut I&#x27;d probably advise you to get a higher end model but I have no idea if it would be any better. never compared</li>
            <li> Still works great after almost a year, can&#x27;t say if it would hold up to commercial use but for my personal use it is still sharp and cuts great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice balance, lots of accessories come with it.  Great value.</li>
            <li> This is the second set purchased recently from Amazon.  The first was for my home use.  My grandson admired the smoothness of the unit and desired one of his own. I bought it for him - he likes it and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> I know very little about being a professional hair stylist, so whether or not this is a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; set I couldn&#x27;t tell you.  I do how ever cut my own hair and keep it pretty short and this set does exactly what I.  Clean cut, reliable and more than enough settings.  Plus it costs about as much as one hair cut at a cheap salon and was about $14 cheaper than the comparable model at Target so you can&#x27;t really lose.  Great for clean up the back or your hair and sideburns.</li>
            <li> I got mine very fast, but I&#x27;m dissapointed because it vibrates a lot and make a lot of sound. what&#x27;s more - it gets very hot after some time of use.</li>
            <li> Worked great , didn&#x27;t have a problem with clogged or faulty clippers. Have me a nice clean cut. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the third haircutting kit that I have owned in the last ten years or so (one simply stopped working, the other got ruined when my wife tried to use it to cut the dog&#x27;s hair).  This kit from Wahl is the best one we have owned.  I use it to cut our childrens&#x27; hair. Very sturdy, makes easy cuts without pulling or getting caught.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After cutting my family&#x27;s hair for ten years with two different sets of Conair clippers, I finally bought this American-assembled Wahl set. WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG? These clippers are fabulous! Sharp and clean cutting, I cut my boys&#x27; hair in half the time, with better results. I didn&#x27;t notice the noise either. Box says there is a *five year warranty* and *30-day money-back guarantee*. Now it must be admitted that the \\&quot;24-piece\\&quot; description is nearly irrelevant, as pieces include clips, combs, a garbage-bag type cape, and some cheap scissors, but the scissors will do until you get better ones (highly recommended--visit a beauty supply store and try out some), and one of the combs is not too bad. The box is a great design and holds everything with room for extras. The latch on it may not last so long, but we&#x27;ll see. The guards are budget-produced as well, but they do the job on these wonderful clippers. I seriously could not stop saying \\&quot;I love these clippers!\\&quot; as I cut their hair &#x3D;). The only thing you need besides good scissors is a nice brush for the neck. If you&#x27;re looking for a well-priced tool that does the job, this is it.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well, all the right attachments.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Wahl to anyone looking for a very durable hair cutter.  This kit is very nicely made and is complete with many accessories that are individually labeled and it comes with a how to guide with pictures explaining how to do specific styles of cuts.  The device itself is strong and is kept in a nice small carrying case.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Came quickly and has everything I need to do a great haircut for my two boys and myself.</li>
            <li> Great electric haircutter - Does exactly what you&#x27;d want. Has a tapering lever. Is relatively quiet and doesn&#x27;t jam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside of this item is that the case is really cheap and doesn&#x27;t have dedicated slots for any of the attachments - so you just shove everything into the box when you&#x27;re done. Very disorganized.</li>
            <li> Use it on my dog.  No razor burns, no cuts.  Lots of attachments for any area on dog.</li>
            <li> This is one of our best \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot; purchases to date. We have two little guys five and under, who require haircuts about every four weeks in the summer.  This purchase paid for itself after just two haircuts.  Super easy to use, easy to understand directions and numbering and we are very pleased with the end result!</li>
            <li> Recommended very good seller</li>
            <li> First of all for that price, and manufactured in the US, and all those pieces included, does its job, pays off in one or two haircuts, it is great bargain!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its not a professional machine, its written on the back of the machine only for home use, only regrets, its not dual voltage, its 110v can not be used in Europe, Australia, and Canada this is for a previously asked question from a reviewer, for people like me with close hair cuts, perfect, only con, the taper lever(the plastic lever that makes the blades go up and down very cheap and made of poor plastic material.</li>
            <li> I have been giving myself haircuts ever since I got this and I must say it has already paid for itself. It&#x27;s easy to use and overall a great product.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers. They&#x27;re sharp and do the job. But the #2 attachment does not fit properly and rattles terribly. It still works but is loud. I contacted amazon after finding this out even though it had been a couple months since I originally purchased it. They offered to refund me 20% of the original purchase price. Which is nice, but doesn&#x27;t solve my problem.</li>
            <li> After watching hair dressers cut my son&#x27;s hair (and paying $25.00 for it!) I decided I could learn! This unit payed for itself in just two uses and works great! Easy instructions for how to use it that I still use as a guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage case is super convenient as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - the cape is cheap and annoying to fold back up - we threw it away with in one use.&lt;br /&gt;  - there are so many attachments - and while the case is convenient it&#x27;d be nice if there was another bag inside you could use to store all of those pieces (that&#x27;s just the OCD in me talking).</li>
            <li> Works well no complaints</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl clippers for 12 years to shave my head and have always been pleased with them...until this purchase.  I&#x27;ve always had to be careful when breaking in a new set of clippers to not cut my ears, etc since they are usually so sharp.  Not this set.  These are the dullest blades I have ever had on a new wahl clipper set.  Extremely disappointed in this product.  My old wahl set I&#x27;ve had for 3 years is sharper than this new one.  Two stars because it was delivered timely and does work - just not up to the standard I am used to with wahl</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to have this Wahl perform as good as a professional model I had used for 45 years and paid big money for at that time.  The motor moves the blades very fast and so it does not pull hair at all.  A very good unit and the attachments would be perfect for first time or untrained want to be barbers. Very good value!</li>
            <li> These clippers include everything you need. I haven&#x27;t had any of the plastic pieces break on me and the clipper has stood the test of time under heavy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to oil them regularly. One issue I&#x27;ve found is that if hair gets caught, or if they are not oiled properly, it will make a very loud and unsettling vibrating rumble. This is accentuated when holding the clippers upside down. Just oil it after every dozen or so uses and be sure to clear out the teeth with a brush after each use.</li>
            <li> I got this to use as a beard trimmer and it works great so far.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my own fault, but this product doesn&#x27;t work in EU.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!  Great replacement for old Conair model</li>
            <li> The attachments are flimsy and I am concerned they won&#x27;t last, but the clippers are heavy and feel like quality! I&#x27;ve only used them once to date, but they behaved beautifully! Relatively quiet, but not even my son&#x27;s thick hair could hamper them in any way. The motor sound did not &amp;#34;bog down&amp;#34; even in the thickest parts of his scalp. It was like mowing down spring grass with a Hemi-powered lawn mower!</li>
            <li> I love it and it works great!</li>
            <li> I previously had a cheap con-air clipper set that starting making an awful loud clicking noise that no amount of tinkering and grease could fix.  I replaced the Con Air with this Wahl model. Now I&#x27;m slightly less deaf and much happier as result.  The Wahl is not near as loud as the Con Air, but it&#x27;s not the most quiet set of clippers either.  It&#x27;s a bit louder than most Barber-shop, professional clippers.    The important part is that these clippers work.  They cut hair very well.    I use it for beard trimming and shaving my head.  I usually use the green 1/2, 1, 2, or 3 guards.  The no-guard setting is short, but not skin-tight.  I agree with some of the other reviews stating it does not get as close and skin-tight as some people prefer, but I have a dedicated Norelco for that close of a shave.     Bottom line is it&#x27;s perfect for beard trims and haircuts, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a daily close-shave razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old set of clippers that started pulling hair. These are good for the money, and very smooth cutting.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. It cuts my hair just fine. For the price I am able to save $20.00 + per month on cutting my own hair. Whoever stated that it was so loud their neighbors were complaining, must live in a cardboard box. It is no louder than clippers at the barber shop. Seriously, your wasting your review if that is all you have to complain about with these clippers. If your wanting a nice cut for a low price these are the clippers to have. Besides they are made in USA unlike the competition of Con Air.</li>
            <li> I bought this to gift it to my friend in India. But was surprised to know that the product does not meet international standards. The voltage input is restricted to 110v and hence it will not work in countries that have 230v~50hz AC mains. I returned it instantly for a refund. If your usage for this product is international, I DO NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Last me a long time, and only after several years of use shaving my head whenever it got to long (I keep my hair clipped short) its just now starting to get dull, pulling my hair instead of cutting, but only a bit. When it gets to the point where its starting to get painful and I need a replacement, Ill buy another Wahl to replace it, it has served me that well.</li>
            <li> shipped fast as described</li>
            <li> Works great for a great price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than my old one conair,that one was too hot when it worked for a while,but wahl isn&#x27;t,good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this trimmer a few weeks but I am very pleased with them. Solidly built, it feels like a tool not a toy. Does a great job trimming.</li>
            <li> Bought this in an attempt to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  Being a novice, it was a bit daunting.  The system makes it very easy to use and detailed instructions make the process easy to understand.  Would definitely recommend this for any novice, undertaking hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers. They are pretty sharper and don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot too much to make sure it&#x27;s cut. Cutting my own hair now really looks like I got it done somewhere and people can&#x27;t tell lol.</li>
            <li> Like the attachments.  Nice and quite.  Just need to practice.  Hair grows quickly so that helps while you are learning your technique.</li>
            <li> This hair clipper was a value, so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, I can say now after using it a couple of times, that it delivers! Easy to use, and it cuts well. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent machine... very good... i need buy other... 👍</li>
            <li> This product is absolute GARBAGE!!!!!! I bought one which worked well for a while, then the arm on the inside which moves the blade broke(cracked right by the first screw). So I bought a another one to replace it, only for it to fail after 4 and half months in the exact same way. This product is highly unreliable, I had to stop cutting my hair midway because it broke on me. I&#x27;m EXTREMELY UPSET.</li>
            <li> Perfect clipper, very easy to use. I use it to trim my beard and it cut cleanly nice blade. I will recommend</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 because I thought the clipper would be more heavy duty, but on the positive side it is lightweight and easy to use! The attachments/guides are great. I thought the hair cutting scissors were just so-so, but they work. It came with easy directions and also I visited the website for instructional video clips. Great product for what we paid.</li>
            <li> BEING IN THE SHARPENING AND CLIPPER REPAIR BUSINESS I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT THE KIT IS WELL MADE A QUALITY PRODUCT THAT i KNOW WILL LAST FOR YEARS. WHEN I TELL THIS TO YOU I TELL IT WITH EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for a while now, but hadn&#x27;t had the nerve to use any type of electrical trimmers/clippers.  I liked having more control using scissors, but it took so much longer (his hair is thick!) and I ended up cutting myself every time. So, I broke down and decided I had to try something a little easier.  After shopping around on Amazon, I decided to give these a try because I am familiar with the brand name and it was inexpensive.  It also had lots of good reviews.  I am happy to say that his first hair cut using these turned out great!  Actually, it turned out much better than it had using scissors, and it was so much faster, too!  I like all of the attachments that it came with even though I probably won&#x27;t use most of them.  Still, it&#x27;s nice to know that I have all these extras just in case...you never know.  Anyways, I fully recommend this hair clipper.  My only advice is like others have said....start out with the longest attachment first....you can always go back and try a shorter one later.  It&#x27;s a whole lot better doing it this way than cutting too short and there&#x27;s no going back from there!</li>
            <li> We have been using this clipper set for about 6 months and it has saved us a lot of money. We give ourselves Burr haircuts so it is easy to use on yourself. Been satified so far!</li>
            <li> I cut my hair once a week with this and it works great.  Saves me $15 a cut, so it paid for itself after the first two cuts.  One of the best cost-cutting measures I&#x27;ve taken next to a rice cooker.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son for Christmas.  He obviously likes it, and for me, the price was right.</li>
            <li> I really have used this alot more than I thought.  It works well when you need a haircut but can&#x27;t get to the barber and your wife is willing to cut it....</li>
            <li> I now have a very short haircut and didn&#x27;t want to bother going to a hairdresser.  This clipper is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Received as advertised.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed!!!</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted at a good price.</li>
            <li> Its a basic razor, does basic things, if you can buy a more expensive razor with a track record of success.&lt;br /&gt;I say this because after having this razor, I&#x27;m buying a more expensive one, the. Oster 76 razor in woodgrain lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these awhile now and cut my husband&#x27;s hair and my son&#x27;s hair a couple times a month. Seems to not cut fine soft hair as well. I can go over one spot several times and it will still be cutting. But they get the job done and we haven&#x27;t replaced them. I have also had cheaper versions of this brand and they seem to cut the same.</li>
            <li> Figured I give Wahl a try to replace my 5 year old Remington since it did not seem it was cutting as good as new and blades we&#x27;re not replaceable.  Brand new out of the box Walh would not cut hair (Not dull, would not cut hair at all) and even tried adjusting blade alignment per manual. Blade appears to just vibrate and not move. Very disappointed and order a HVAC 2000 Remington.</li>
            <li> I use this to crop my husby&#x27;s hair. This is a real good product.</li>
            <li> its a good deal for the money. it works fine. no problem. only the carrying case is of low quality.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job so far. Pretty impressive, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have only used it few times but so far so good. It may take an extra pass or two to get all the hair but for my needs it works fine. It comes with more attachments then I&#x27;ll ever use and it seems to be built well ( time will tell ). I&#x27;d say for the money you can&#x27;t go wrong, its already paid for itself in usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy duty clipper but not cumbersome to use. I like the variety of attachments to cut varying lengths of hair with complete ease. I will certainly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Good kit for the self-haircut starters or beginners.    Not too noisy, but strong vibration during operation; nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> Hair cutters plugged into a wall are SO MUCH BETTER than the wireless ones.  If you are able to cut your hair near a wall outlet (which I don&#x27;t see why you shouldn&#x27;t) than this is your best bet.  You get so many things for such a small price tag, I feel very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Will take some getting used too with all the blade guards &amp; such...Was shipped to me in 3 days post order. Very surprised ! Very fine hair trimmer. Thank you. You have NOT let me down.  J.P.</li>
            <li> I just bought and have received the Wahl 79524. I don&#x27;t know if this hair-cutter is durable because I have only used 1 time, what I do know is it&#x27;s kinda loud if noise is one of your pet-peeve. The hair-clips are a kinda flimsy, but managable. You use it to cut your hair not mow a lawn. Did I mention it&#x27;s made in China, what isn&#x27;t now a day. If you are on a budget, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My fiance wanted clippers so for christmas I bought him some. Although I&#x27;m the one who uses them to cut his hair, we both love them. They work amazingly and we are happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times on my boyfriend for haircuts. Works nicely. The many attachments are plentiful and gives you options.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for those with limited HAIR.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a high-quality hair clippers at a decent price and I found that with these Wahl clippers. A quick disclaimer, I only shave my head (no guard on the clippers) so I cannot speak to the other items in this kit besides the clippers. In the past, I have bought Conair clippers and they have all been great. With these clippers, however, I could immediately tell the difference in quality. The Wahl clippers are much heavier and of a higher standard quality the previous clippers I have bought. When I received these clippers, I immediately started to shave my head and the the clippers were smooth with no bumps. The other items in the kit are pretty standard - see comment above about shaving my head. I would highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> very satisfied. paid around $ 25 for this product.  Already used twice, so it paid for itself.  simple to use, I read in few reviews about the clips being very delicate, but i feel it is very decent for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a conair i had purchased at walmart. One of the plastic pieces broke and the blade wasnt secured in by anything. This is a great replacement. Seems like a very solid trimmer and works great. I was skeptical because some have said that it was very loud but it&#x27;s actually not at all so i am happy with that. Only thing is that is weird is the on/off switch seems like it could have been designed better but nothing significant to stop you from buying. I have used it about five times now and cuts very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son in the military. He uses it often for his miltary crew cut. He seems very satisfied witrh it!</li>
            <li> Bought it years ago at BB&amp;B and its been working great. Strong, doesnt vibrate out of your hand, easy to clean, blades stay sharp. Plenty of good accessories with the exception of the combs, scissors, and plastic case. I tossed that junk after a year and put everything in a sturdy bag. Much happier.   Oh, the eyebrow trimmer works great too.</li>
            <li> If you like a relatively short haircut, then there is no reason to be paying for your haircut. I have cut my own hair for the last 9 years. Very simple and it saves money and time.   This is a much better clipper set than my last one, and that one lasted about 7 years. The quality is apparent in these clippers. I have been using them for about a year and a half.  Pros:  -blades stay very sharp  -no snagging of the hair  -lots of combs, although i only use 3 or 4  -plenty of accessories  -great price  Cons:  -when the clippers are on, the micro adjustment vibrates and changes, so you have to keep manually putting it back (really the only big gripe for me)  -longest comb is for 1 inch, so that can be a limitation for some  -on/off switch can be a little difficult to operate when using the clippers (however this may be a pro since you will be less likely to bump it on accident)</li>
            <li> My husband loves this new set, is much better quality than his previous and cannot beat the price! He has thick, course hair and this works perfectly for him. He&#x27;s used it about 5 times since Christmas and still loves the product. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome opossum. I love this kit</li>
            <li> Great product.  It has everything you need to do all kinds of hair cuts.  It even has a guide to help you out.  I love this product and so does my son, the person I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away that when I turned this on, it vibrated in a way that didn&#x27;t seem right to me.  I was right, because it died completely after only the third time I used it.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. He says it&#x27;s great quality and there are so many cool accessories for the hair buzzer that fit in the tiny box. I say it&#x27;s worth it. It cuts like professional hair clippers</li>
            <li> I had a conair that I used for many years, despite a few broken tines and a cord that was irrevocably twisted.  I bought this as new one and, for roughly the same price, it feels much more substanial and of a higher quality.  I only use the shortest setting and comb, so can&#x27;t speak to all the other accessories.</li>
            <li> Works great, cuts smoothly and contains all the clip-ons you would ever need. I would definitely recommend for home use.</li>
            <li> I have used this haircut for several times. it is very smooth and comfortable, absolutely a good tool, now I find that cutting hair is an art.</li>
            <li> Works well and serves its purpose for the amount paid. I have had no issues since i bought this less than a year back</li>
            <li> item is lovley will do the job but I bought it for cutting hair bald and it does not cut close for bald heads. Other than that a really good set of clippers.</li>
            <li> One of the blade guides came broken :( (guide 6).</li>
            <li> I made the big decision. My hair is leaving me in the back on the crown. I rocked my entire life with rockin&#x27; hair but faced it. THOSE DAYS are gone and when I looked in the mirror with both a hand held mirror and wall mirror, I saw that my barber actually has a backwards comb-over thing going on with me in the back!!!!! WTF! On to YouTube I went and searched how to cut your own hair using a clipper. I wanted to get rid of the longer hair and cut it short, short with a fade type cut. I watched several clips and then ordered the Wahl Chrome Pro. I THEN WENT FOR IT and I am now with short hair and it looks GREAT! I used 4 different guides and got the look I wanted. The Wahl is sturdy and really cuts GREAT. The attachments are MANY and also very sturdy. Watch the YouTube clips, get the Wahl and get happy.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers, they are great for just about anything when it comes to cutting hair.  Great job once again Wahl!!!</li>
            <li> While I was away in college, I couldn&#x27;t find a nice barbershop in any form around me. I borrowed this kit from my roommate to cut my own hair, and I instantly fell in love with it. I had to buy one of my own, and I have saved at least the cost of what I paid for it in haircuts this year alone. It doesn&#x27;t only shave hair but if you know what you&#x27;re doing and have a good eye it can give you a good textured cut. I&#x27;ve also cut many of my friends&#x27; hair. The only tough part is squaring the back, I wish there was a clip-on attachment for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 5 years later and I still use this kit frequently. It is still in great shape and I have saved hundreds on haircuts. Although, I do recommend going to a professional every now and then to make sure you&#x27;re looking your best. Happy cutting everyone!</li>
            <li> These are the loudest clippers I have ever heard.  They can probably shear through goat hair, but I am not exaggerating when I say you need to have ear plugs to use these clippers.  Your eardrums will hurt after 10 seconds of use.  Maybe the one I got is a lemon?  Maybe others are normal, either way, I thought that maybe with a little use, adjustments, oil etc... they wouldn&#x27;t be so loud, however, nothing has worked and these clippers are horrible.  I have used them for 2 clippings and had to put in foam ear plugs both times.  Attempting to send back for a different brand.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and everything worked great.  All the accessories are well made and easy to install and use. I don&#x27;t anticipate the combs breaking,</li>
            <li> Serves my purpose for a trim</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews about this product, I was worried when I read that the pieces were really cheap plastic. However, when I actually received the product, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Everything works very well and the parts do not look cheap to me. There was also some complaint that the product was too loud which I disagree with as well. My husband and I had no problem carrying on a conversation while cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> Love it I use it not just for the beard but touch ups between hair cuts unless I buzz it with one of combs.</li>
            <li> thought i was ordering a trimmer my mistake but works well!</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite hair trimmer I have purchased.  The Wahl brand is usually great but this one had really cheap attachments and one broke shortly after I got it.  Also there is no way to get super close to the skin (like on the lower neck) without cutting some skin.  I still use this but I had to find an attachment from another machine and I have to use a different buzzer to shave the neck.</li>
            <li> After trying a Conair razor and finding that it stopped working after two uses, I tried the Wahl razor here and it worked great. It really glides as it cuts and can handle cutting a lot of length at one time. For just a little extra cost, I would highly recommend getting the Wahl razor over any other cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product. For $25 you basically get a hair dresser quality clipper with numerous attachments. Beware (and reason for my star off)! I used the \\&quot;rounding tool\\&quot; for around the ear and it made a huge nick in the back of my head (on both sides). If you are going for a longer cut do not use the rounding tool. Good thing it grew back rather quickly!</li>
            <li> Great for trimming hair but not for beards! The blades are VERY sharp so don&#x27;t try to use this without a guard or you&#x27;ll get nicks and pink spots on your face :) There are gentler ones for beard trimming and for that I recommend a ConAir model. However, this is the clear winner when it comes to trimming hair and getting the right length. Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face! Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I purchased it bout 4 months ago.,used it 3 times and now all it does is scream loud,when turned on . Does not cut at all. I would not recommend! Wahl use to be dependable and good, but this model is pure crap! Wish I never purchased.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice and it was for a buzz cut.  It is great for a buzz with the light green  (1/16)&amp;#34; #.5MM adjustment comb. It feels so good to have short hair again.  I cut it, or I should say my wife cuts it every two weeks.  I did put a drop of light oil on the blade which helped lube it.  I used sewing machine oil.  I am expecting many years of good use.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for home haircuts. It works great and seems to be high quality for the price. NOT too loud or too hot when operated. It sounds and cuts just like the one at the barber shop where I USED to pay for haircuts. HOWEVER, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND BUYING THE CHROME-PRO VERSION THAT COMES WITH A TRIMMER IF YOU ARE DOING HOME BARBERING. THE TRIMMER ALLOWS YOU TO TRIM THE NECK AND SIDE-BURN AREAS VERY CLOSELY; THIS ONE ONLY CUTS DOWN TO 1/32 INCH OR SO.</li>
            <li> Works well...my barber ( wife :-) ) is happy!</li>
            <li> They only lasted 2 hair cuts so we are even compared to going to a barber.  They fell off a chair onto the floor and haven&#x27;t worked since, dispite readjusting everything in the clipper head.  I have cut hair for my family for decades, and this clipper went to college with #4, and didn&#x27;t last a month.  If I would have bought them from Costco I could return and get my money back, but I needed them delivered to his college. The next pair I bought him was from Costco, they may be just a cheap, but I least they have easy returns.</li>
            <li> This cuts through hair like no one&#x27;s business. I use it every other day to shave my head and it works great. Definitely a great investment.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve owned &amp; I have had about 1/2 a dozen clippers now.</li>
            <li> The voltage here in Nigeria is too low for it, so I haven&#x27;t used it since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works very good. Heavy duty too. I&#x27;ve used this now for a while and can&#x27;t complain. Great for a buzz cut. Good price too.</li>
            <li> Great Hair Cutting Kit..saves me lots of money.  I cut my hair at home and do not have to go to a Barber and spend money</li>
            <li> Seems to be working good</li>
            <li> Save time and money get your high and tight at home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this buzzer for almost 4 years now. It&#x27;s saved me a lot of money on hair cuts. It comes with more attachments than you know what to do with.</li>
            <li> Already paid for itself in savings.</li>
            <li> I started to get a receding hairline so I bought this set of clippers to cut my own hair all the same length.  Work&#x27;s great and has a lot of adapters if you needed to use different settings!  Great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> This shaver is lacking power. you have to comb through a section multiple times to cut hair. I have a beard trimmer that is more powerful than this shaver; it&#x27;s THAT bad.  I&#x27;m very disappointment and angry because I&#x27;m now stuck with a useless shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He does not have a lot of hair and I cannot see paying money every month for timming the hair that he does have. The trimmer works great and has a lot of guides included.  My husband is very pleased with the kit.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am a single mother that has to save money when I can, and cutting my 20 month old son&#x27;s hair myself is one of the things I have to do in order to make ends meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this along with an extra bottle of blade lube, and have had zero problems.  The cord stretches with plenty of room, and I usually let my son play with it (supervised, of course) so he isn&#x27;t afraid of the noise or vibration.  The cape that comes with it feels pretty flimsy, so I like to just drape a towel around his shoulders.  I think this helps him feel more secure as well, as it isn&#x27;t a completely strange feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend starting with the longer guards (the things that go over the blade).  When I first started cutting his hair, I realized almost immediately that it was too short.  It cuts great though, and it didn&#x27;t take long to get his whole head done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again, as this has many attachments to use for all kinds of different hair styles and lengths.  The quality seems great, and it doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap by any means.  Included is an instruction manual that I really should have paid more attention to, but I was pretty eager to see results immediately, so at least now I&#x27;ll know for next time.  It also comes with a nice carrying case, that I was also able to fit the extra bottle of blade lube that I purchased from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mom that is new to cutting hair, I found this extremely easy to use, and if needed, I will definitely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Booth</li>
            <li> This one is an excellent value for the price. I cut my own hair for the first time with this and was perfect. Only disadvantage is that it is a little heavy. Not meant for weak hands. But at a price below 30 $ this is an awesome product. Good power. Perfect cutting and nice accessories.</li>
            <li> I was really disgusted to open this package (I noticed that the tape didn&#x27;t look factory sealed) to find that the cord for the clippers was sloppily retied and that the clippers were clearly used. There were hair clippings on and around the cutting blades and some of the parts were missing. I figured this was a fluke since I&#x27;m normally very pleased with items shipped directly from Amazon. It was evidently the last one they had in stock so when I returned it and tried to order another one I was unable to and had to order the 23 piece non-chrome unit which arrived quickly, in great shape and has paid for itself already by doing a great job of hair and beard trimming.    I hope that Amazon goes back to its regularly high level of quality control.    Although I was disgusted with the first shipment, I was pleased at the ease of return and the speed of my refund, therefore I gave an extra star.</li>
            <li> For a variety of reasons, I decided to just buy this set of clippers and shave my head down to a 1/4\\&quot;. This is a great combo pack to buy! It almost has too many accessories for my personal needs, but I&#x27;m glad it came with all the clipper guards and scissors for my initial &#x27;taming of the mane&#x27;. I had a lot of hair to plow through and it made it so much easier to do so in increments. The clippers are much heavier than my last pair, and hopefully that equates to durability. It came with a cheap plastic smock that I just use to cover my sink and counter top to catch the hair. All in all, if you like a buzzed haircut for a variety of reasons, this set fits the bill. I&#x27;ll never use all of the accessories, but some of you may and will appreciate them.</li>
            <li> After buying this I will have to consider spending a little more next time.  This clipper is a total waste.  I have to spend 30 minutes using the damn thing and even then I don&#x27;t get an even cut.  Whats worst is this thing will turn your neck extremely red for some reason (perhaps the heat or friction).  I would totally avoid this product. It&#x27;s hard to believe there are people giving positive reviews for this garbage.  They must not care what they look like as long as it gets the job done.  I would recommend saving up a little more and get something rated for barbers.  I hope this saves people from making the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> The guide combs are cheap and don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  Any pressure causes them to move and bend while cutting. Hair has been different lengths every time.</li>
            <li> Although it comes with lots of peripherals and is powerful and sturdy, this product does not cut as close as my past clippers. The previous clippers I have owned could trim my hair and beard very close to the skin, though, of course, not all the way down. These are not capable of that close of a trim. As a result, they also do not allow you to line-up your hair. So... purchase these with desired closeness of trim in mind. I will just keep them around as an emergency tool and buy something that allows for shorter cutting.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on Amazon last August 31 and tried it on my self. I usually cut my own hair.  When I turn on the clipper, it was so loud and didn&#x27;t sound like a clipper at all. It sounded like a hammer drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the manual and found there was a \\&quot;power adjust\\&quot; screw on the side to increase/reduce power. I had to totally turn it counter-clockwise to have it running without excessive noise but it was still too strong and vibrating too much. I then went on to cut my hair but wow, it felt like I placed a massager on my head.  The vibration was too strong my head shakes while I run it across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, yes... it can cut hair... no pulls, it cuts cleanly...  its just vibrates too much. Even my hand felt like it is still shaking after I finished cutting.</li>
            <li> I even use this on my dogs and it does such a great job without over heating, I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> the Wahl Clippers arrived exactly on the day I ordered  the $3.99 same day shipping is great for those who need stuff in a short period of time. Although the Clippers did not come with the mini groomer I have been accustomed to receiving when ordering other models. As for the Clippers themselves they function exactly as one would expect.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Daughter ended up buying the same thing</li>
            <li> The buzzers are great and they work very well  but the on and off switch is a little tough to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> Top of the line performance once you get used to the difference. Very little hand vibration but seems to snag a lot more than previous Wahl clippers for delicate work (beards etc.)</li>
            <li> My old Wahl Chrome Pro lasted me a good 5 years. I decided to buy the same one. The new one is fine for the most part, but it runs noticeably louder than my old one, even after adjusting the power screw. I exchanged it for a brand new one thinking it was faulty but it still had the same loud noise. I can only assume they changed something to the motor since then. Such a shame since my old one was fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> article back, don&#x27;t work good, so much vibration</li>
            <li> Great finish and feel and all that... But just way too noisy...</li>
            <li> This kit has it all do a perfect home haircut.  The quality is good and the storage case makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> great product, American made is a plus. they cut great, not any louder and any others. I would buy again</li>
            <li> Bought to replace an older Wahl electric I had for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;The kit is nice. Lots of attachments for different hair lengths.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside I see is the on/off button. Seems a bit cheap. I would prefer a slide button. The razor is used every week and is perfect for what I need, shave head, trim goatee, sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;A nice unit.</li>
            <li> Keep oil on them and they will last. Have given 30+ buzz cuts over the last year and still doing great!</li>
            <li> Sons loved them for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Not a beard trimmer. This feels like a cat is scratching your face off.  Works fine for cutting hair though.</li>
            <li> These clippers are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! They cut right through hair. I didn&#x27;t even have to adjust them! Also, with all of the accessories, i could easily find the guard for my type/length of hair! And for the price of the clippers (Which are usually around 40 bucks where I live) they pay for themselves after 1 use! People on amazon say that they are very noisy... which is very hard to believe... BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY QUIET!!! Also, the clipper is very stylish and made for you to be able to hold it easily in you hand while you cut! All new barbers and home cutters (MAYBE EVEN PROS) should buy this clipper! I have had NO PROBLEMS with it so far!</li>
            <li> Very well please with this product. It works really well.</li>
            <li> Buying this product was difficult, because I based buying my hair clippers on peoples reviews.  Couldn&#x27;t find a brand or model that overwhelmed me based on them.  Took me a couple weeks of daily looking &amp; reading to finally pick this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  Sharp clippers, not loud in my opinion, &amp; all the sizes &amp; accessories of clips/combs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had them for a while now, so not writing this after 1 use.  I&#x27;ve used it enough to realize they work great for me.  Never a snag or pull of the hair, &amp; easy to maintain.  No problems here.  And was good price at the time.</li>
            <li> I had this for over a week, and I have no complaints. It&#x27;s very quiet, but has a powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Well made. Does its job. Gets easier with use. Pays for itself quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this so I can cut my hair with the number 3 clip.  If the clipper and #3 had been this $22 price, I would have been happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with all the clippers from 1 to 8, and then several more extras.  It&#x27;s a well-made unit and accessories.  The only negative thing is the case is a little on the cheap side, but that&#x27;s insignificant.</li>
            <li> Too noisy and vibrate too mux</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for home haircuts.  This is the second one of these I have owned since the first one finally stopped working after so much use!</li>
            <li> I am now able to cut my husband&#x27;s hair instead of making a special 60 mile round trip to town.  Be sure to oil as directed.  More attachments with it than I think anyone would ever need.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I recommend it. Excellent quality, as it says the publication. presentation is very good, the price adjusted.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. Now he says that he would like a pair of you guy&#x27;s trimmers to give him a proper edge up.</li>
            <li> It was not working after 5th use.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an Andis Deluxe set I have had for years.  Used them the first time yesterday.  They cut evenly and I did not have to go back over time and again to catch every hair.  Which means I had my husbands hair done in less than 10 minutes.  Seams well made.  The combs are not a flimsy plastic like several other sets I have seen on the market but sturdy.  I could also tell it did not catch and pull the hair like my old set was doing.  The carrying case is a hard plastic with enough room for a neck brush as well but takes up less space then the Andis set did.  Really like these clippers!!</li>
            <li> High Quality product. It feels incredibly sturdy and heavy and cuts well</li>
            <li> Clean design and easy to use. only drawback is the minor length adjustment lever often hits with the seem of the body getting annoying at times.</li>
            <li> Gets hot under long use, but works well.</li>
            <li> Clippers are a little heavy, but I like that.  Quality made machine, easy to use--I did a good job on my first try!</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers thus far!</li>
            <li> This actually wasn&#x27;t for me...I bought it for a Christmas Gift for my step-dad. I asked him how he liked it and he says it&#x27;s a really good product. He likes the design and performance of it. On my end, it was a reasonable price for a good product :)</li>
            <li> This saves us quite a bit of money in cutting/clipping the curls off!  Clipper works great and is a low hum. The only drawback is the carrying case could be larger and more organizational, as everything is cramped into it. However, would still recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Cuts amazing! way better than the Con-air thing I was using!</li>
            <li> Its nice enough for a home haircut. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair with this and I&#x27;ve let my wife cut my hair with this and its nice and gets a good cut but it does get hot if you use it for too long. Also Its very loud when next to your ears. I&#x27;m talking extremely loud. I can stand it but some might not like it.</li>
            <li> I just use it at it&#x27;s lowest setting to shave my head works great easy to clean I like it and an epic price tag for everything you get.</li>
            <li> Not a bad pair of clippers. It&#x27;s only two drawbacks are its kinda noisy when cutting close to the ears, and also when blade is at its shortest it doesn&#x27;t cut well, and it pulls hair. Cuts smooth again when slightly raised. On a positive note its actually made in the USA.</li>
            <li> The product was missing screws which allowed the cover to come off the device.  Does quality control exist anymore?  Very cheaply made, and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> When looking for a grooming tool I wanted a brand that is reliable, not too expensive and one that was not very loud when on.      We have a cat with a very long coat, he is always hot &amp; looks uncomfortable.  He has been professionally groomed several times but to reduce this expense I decided to take the job of grooming on myself.      I was delighted when the Wahl 79524-2501 kit arrived.  The body of the clipped was designed to be held easily and fit the curve of my hand, there are more than enough attachments to chose from and the instructions were clear and easy to understand.     The cat is happy with his new short hair and enjoys the attention when I clip him!</li>
            <li> My husband has always cut his own hair and he really likes this. Comes with many different level heads. He has curly Italian hair and this works great on him.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. So smooth and with many attachments. I just cut my own hair a couple of days ago. It was easy painless and fast.</li>
            <li> Indeed another money-saving purchase through Amazon-dot-com. Use of the Wahl Chrome Pro was trouble-free although a little heavier than my twenty-five year-old Oster, and the included accessories makes DIY haircuts easier.</li>
            <li> We purchased a  conair a few years back which did the job but was really a POS. The wahl is much more powerful and doesn&#x27;t get clogged. There&#x27;s no battery so it has to be plugged in but thats no big deal breaker for me as the cord is plenty long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a couple different kinds of clippers for around $25 from Walmart but they always got caught in my hair and were not that pleasant to use.  These seem to have tons of power and just cut right through both the top of my head and my beard. The accessories are nice and the box makes it easy to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> We use the set at home but it gives a very professional haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why i didn&#x27;t think of this years ago...  Haircuts like mine are simple.  At the barber all i do is ask for different sizes on the top and sides.  Pretty easy to achieve myself.  This kit comes with an instruction booklet that teaches you how to achieve a professional looking haircut.  All the necessary tools are included and the razor itself is basically the same thing the barber uses.  Super high quality, will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the barber cuts cost about $25.  My hair grows fast, so getting 2/month is $50.  This thing pays for itself pretty much on the first haircut...and then saves you $50/month, or $600/year (net, post-tax), or about $1000/year gross income.  Just by buying this you&#x27;re giving yourself $1000/year raise...and you save a lot of time and hassle going to the barber, and time is money in the bank also.  This is a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair with this wonderful haircutter the day I received it (after reading the instructions) and it came out perfect. I&#x27;m not kidding. I now cut my hair every weekend and always look like I have just been to the barber. The cutter is quiet, and extremely sharp, and has paid for itself in 3 haircuts. I wish I had purchased it years ago...could have saved myself hundreds of dollars. Also, it is a high-quality product and I know I will get years of use from it.</li>
            <li> I found hair in the machine. The used one was sent by the vender. I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS KIT!! I had decided to try to save some money and buy this kit to cut my boys&#x27; hair myself. This kit comes with very detailed instructions about how to cut hair and all the pieces of the kit are clearly marked with what it is for. I had never cut hair before and my kids hair has turned out great every time!!</li>
            <li> It done a wonderful job on my dog,, very quiet and easy to use and easy to clean, great storage box..</li>
            <li> If you really, really want to cut your hair at home, go for it.  This works OK but probably wouldn&#x27;t be useful to anyone doing much more than wanting to go bald every week.  The combs and snap on length things don&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> Great set for the money!</li>
            <li> Showed up with crooked blades and I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Delivered was fast and good product.</li>
            <li> Was great in the beginning several months but the lever switch became loose and wouldn&#x27;t maintain its position and bought a replacement hair cut kit and now the mechanical blade will not function correctly. Now have to send both in for servicing under the included 5 year warranty. Great product if it worked without malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> Well, this product is great. All the pieces are excellent.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised on how many attachments that are with this machine , and the clippers them selfs are really nice i was pretty amazed about these , would recommend them to anyone that wants to save money.</li>
            <li> cut me hair with the wahl wicked product, great design, yes yes yes yes ill deffinately buy again if  i needed too</li>
            <li> This is a great pair of clippers. The kit comes with all the accessories that you need to perform a great haircut. The price is very reasonable and will cost you less than one good haircut from a professional. I will never pay for a haircut again.</li>
            <li> This is a substantial product.  Not flimsey or cheap like alot of products like this.  I think it is very much worth the price..</li>
            <li> worst product i have ever bought, terrible cuts, heavy, bulky, doesn&#x27;t work for close beard trims, i hate it, instead buy the philips norelco trimmer</li>
            <li> I updated from a previously used cheaper pair.  These clippers cut much more efficiently and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li> Works good, they only problem is that it sometimes binds up when cutting thick hair. It comes with a oil and if applied regualarly it cuts smooth. The variety off cut sizes, and reliability makes it a good product for the money, would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just started cutting my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair with these.  It is really easy to do.  The tough part is fading the top and sides, but it gets easier with practice.  For the cost of one haircut, you can get this set and cut anyone&#x27;s hair - I think I may get more &#x27;customers&#x27; when family comes to town.</li>
            <li> Nicely constructed ,doesn&#x27;t feel cheap . Well worth it .</li>
            <li> I always lose the chargers to wireless clippers, so I needed one that just plugs in. It&#x27;s super solidly built, has a sleek look due to the chrome finish, and it&#x27;s way more powerful and awesome than any clippers I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> I recently wasted money by buying this kit at a big store, instead of amazon. But that&#x27;s my fault! I have been to 2 or 3 large beauty supply stores and probably 29 different locations between Houston and LA. My requirements err simple. I wanted the least expensive, make brand clippers available that were adjustable, but could cut to bald (.000&amp;#34;) or (.0000&amp;#34;), as per multiple models advertised at aSilly&#x27;s beat supply. Unfortunately, i had to stand there in Sillys for an hour looking at amazon reviews comparing.in store models. All adjustable models in their stock, that advertised.cutting to bald were $100...the clerk seemed really surprised that i didn&#x27;t want to cough up that much money for a it.:-O explained to her that i have owned at least 10 clippers that have performed flawlessly. And usually for $10.  Well, finally broke down any  bought this set . It performed flawlessly, with great power.   For questions of how close these cut, you have to understand that decent quality clippers have 2 screws affixing the to blade. If you loosen these guys, you can push the top blade back and tighten with less clearance for a zero cut. Be careful not to go to far, or you risk scalping yourself.You may also adjust the adjustment lever for more tension. Final A adjustments can be made for the throw of the cutting blades by turning large plastic side scree to decrease noise. Note: the Conned heir brand build many of thier models to not have blades adjusted, rendering them useless for short cuts. The motor designs are weaker, and the are beaucoup weak plastic pieces in the drive train lending themselves too much movement, inprecision and rapid blade wear. These budget minded wahlshave no similar bs issues. After I get my money&#x27;s worth many times over for thesei will likely invest in Wahl brand top end clippers for lifetime use.</li>
            <li> It works great but came with some broken combs. I had combs from an old one that fit on it so I did not have to send it back</li>
            <li> We love our Trimmer and I&#x27;ve been cutting my husbands hair at home for the past 5 times now, so it&#x27;s already paid for itself. It&#x27;s very easy to learn how to do it too.</li>
            <li> Sizing is bit odd for me. left and right side trimming unit does not match with 1 and 2, which suppose to be used together with side unit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product my boyfriend loves it. Ordering through Amazson was great we received it quick and the price was perfect.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for over a year now and am very glad I bought it.  I have been giving myself haircuts since I purchased it, and have used it frequently without issue.  It comes with pretty much everything you need to be able to groom yourself, your pets, etc.</li>
            <li> This has worked very well for me learning to cut my fiance&#x27;s hair.  Unlike other clippers I&#x27;ve used, when you put these on short or long, they stay there.  There is a fair amount of vibration but not so much that I worry about cutting his ear off.  Blades have stayed sharp over many many cuts now.</li>
            <li> I was searching for hair clippers because I wanted to learn to cut my own hair. Paying $25 a cut twice a month was becoming OBNOXIOUS. I&#x27;m a black guy and I wear a closer cut-- All to say that it takes roughly 15 minutes for my barber to cut my hair. $25 for 15 minutes? No thanks. Living in Los Angeles is expensive enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was NERVOUS because I&#x27;d never cut my own hair before. I bought these because a couple of friends in college liked the Wahl brand. This clipper set did an fantastic job! I wish I could upload photos onto this review to show a pic of my hair after leaving the barbershop and a pic of my hair today (I cut it last night). They are practically identical! I will never go back to the barbershop (if I can help it) and I&#x27;m saving $50/month! I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this product. My co-workers are complimenting my hair cut today and I LOVE sticking out my little chest and telling them, &amp;#34;Thank you. I did it myself.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest, however. It took me about an hour from start to finish to get the cut right, but that could be attributed to me being extra careful and slow so not to mess up and is not a reflection of the clippers function. They cut and work great! Note: YOU CANNOT RUSH CUTTING YOUR OWN HAIR. If you do, you won&#x27;t be satisfied with this product (unless you&#x27;re just that skilled). It&#x27;s much easier to cut someone else&#x27;s hair than your own because there&#x27;s a lot of mirror action involved. That&#x27;s my only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34;, it can take some time (again, took me an hour), but I&#x27;m sure that time will cut down once you become familiar and more confident with cutting your own hair (it was my first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Product came undamaged and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;- My college friend had these clippers for 2 years in college and, to my knowledge, they are still in good condition</li>
            <li> i usually cut my own hair, came with everything came on time cuts great with no snags this will last me a long time</li>
            <li> Only used it once but it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to use. Can save a ton of money. This set cost about the same as 1 haircut!</li>
            <li> I feel like a pro when cutting my husband&#x27;s hair. Great product! Easy to use and comes with a manual that makes it idiot-proof.</li>
            <li> This clipper works fine for me.  I like it. Easy to use. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money and makes cutting hair quicker.  Such a better quality, compared to the ones I bought at Target years ago!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  I&#x27;m not a professional hair cutter - just needed some quality clippers and I got them for a great price.  I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now, people complaining of the loud rattling/buzzing (which I have not experienced) should read the 8 step instructions that come with everything - there is a bolt on the clippers that you can tighten/loosen to fix that problem.</li>
            <li> This is one of my best investments. I use it about twice a month. Cut my own hair. Good ol cheap buzz cut. I would say I&#x27;ve given myself 25 haircuts pronanly more. So at 15$ a pop that&#x27;s some serious savings. Keep it oiled don&#x27;t rinse it with water, clean it out using the little brush. And keep your hair cut and beard and eye brows done nice. Love it always go with a wahl</li>
            <li> If you are a man who is tired of not being satisfied with your hair stylist - you know, one time it looks great, the next time you look like a palm tree... well, you need one of these! With a little practice and a good mirror, you will give yourself a professional haircut every time and save money.</li>
            <li> Huge vibration and noise, blades not cutting the hair, very poor quality in general. Pls do not buy wahl products in case you will not able to return it as me - its easy to throw out this.</li>
            <li> Works great so far, have only had for a couple of months but does the trick. Other Wahl broke and this seems to be a good replacement.</li>
            <li> I use it at home. I love it. I never used any similar product before.&lt;br /&gt;If it has a small mirror, it would really deserve the best.</li>
            <li> Something inside is loose. But otherwise it works great. Just need to get a trimmer now and hand held mirror now.</li>
            <li> Not some cheap, gimmicky clipper that rotates or goes cordless. That technology hasn&#x27;t been perfected yet. However, this technology has. Get it, practice a bit, and start saving money by cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> Given my husband some great haircuts even though I&#x27;ve not a clue what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat this hair cutting kit for the price. You get more attachements and combs than you&#x27;ll ever need, a cleaning brush and a small container of oil. We get better cleaning results using a can of compressed air instead of that little brush. The supply of oil included is sparse; one might want to buy a bottle of Wahl oil on Amazon or elswhere. It&#x27;s not expensive and should last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl cutter is not unpleasantly loud and cuts cleanly without pulling. The self sharpening blades work as well as advertised. A cordless clipper gives one more flexibility and mobility, but a corded unit like the Wahl 79524-2501 has an adequately lengthed cord, more power than a cordless, and no waiting time for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this Wahl hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, the value is outstanding! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to do hair cutting at home. I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to tackle the toughest of jobs.  Feels professional, just like the barber shop.  Comes with more attachments than I need, but glad to know I am covered.</li>
            <li> very noisy and dose not give a clean cut  rigid .</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good clipper but if your looking for something to last a long time, I suggest to get something a bit more quality!</li>
            <li> My Wahl does not work well, it makes a loud i try to regulate the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product but came with a manufacture failure.&lt;br /&gt;I live in Angola, waited a lot of to but hands on it, i don&#x27;t wanna blow it away.&lt;br /&gt;Need help with it.</li>
            <li> Great trimmers for cost. Powerful and cuts clean in one pass without pulling.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very powerful, not noisy, and love all the attachments/accessories it comes with.</li>
            <li> I bought these to save money on haircuts since I only ever get a buzz cut from SuperCuts and decided it was pointless to keep tossing $20 their way when I could do it myself just as easily. I&#x27;ve cut my hair with them twice now and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results. I don&#x27;t know how well they would work for anything fancier, but for a buzz cut, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better for the price.  One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that the power cord needs to be in the electrical outlet perfectly or the clippers will turn off. Since the cord is moving around a bit as you&#x27;re moving around the clippers, it tended to wiggle out a bit and turn itself off quite regularly.  The selection of guards that comes with this is nice. I personally only used the #3 guard and was happy with its length.  As noted by everyone else, the cape that comes with these is horrible and basically just a white trash bag-- I didn&#x27;t even use it. I just got naked and clipped my hair standing in the shower (without water), then scooped up the hair and placed it in the trash, then showered. It made cleaning up a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to groom my little dog.  It was far too big and far too heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t look as big as it is.  It&#x27;s just too heavy and wide for my hand.  It also is very  very loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive, I tested it for a second.  It was powerful and seemed to work well.  Came with all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for a small woman, it was too big.  Wouldn&#x27;t fit in hand properly.  I felt like I would have drop it and cut my dog.</li>
            <li> Great investment. I now cut hair for everyone in my family. It saves a lot of money. If you don&#x27;t know how, just watch an youtube video like I did.</li>
            <li> I am a single mother of a 6yr old boy. I need to save money where I can. The Wahl Chrome Pro helps with that. A haircut for him costs $12 a pop. Wahl makes it easy to do it myself.</li>
            <li> This thing lasts a long time. It seems to have great quality especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I have 5 boys and I have cut their hair for years. This is my second kit as it is easier to by a new kit than to deal with the attachments and blades when they get old. The blades keep their sharpness for a long time. My only issue with the kit is the apron included is about as cheap as you can get. It is just about as close to garbage bag material as you can get. I did not buy it for the apron though, so that is the only reason my rating is one star short of perfect. These clippers pay for themselves every third haircut, so when I cut my sons&#x27; hair, I save money every time.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for someone and she did not care for them.  Said they didn&#x27;t cut good that they pulled alot and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone....</li>
            <li> great set of clippers.  does everything i need it to plus some.  i look forward to using it for some time.</li>
            <li> When using it to shave the neckline, it pulls rather than cuts, sound like a dull blade. Also the clips are not what I expected.  I can not find two that are close enough in size that works to cut my husbands hair.  Just not satisfied with it. I had the Ultra adjustable by Andis , which was great, so now I will dispose of this one and try to find a blade for the old one.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool. I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great.</li>
            <li> This kit paid for itself after the second or third haircut I gave my husband with it. No more trips to the salon! Yay DIY! This kit provides more combs than I actually use, but it&#x27;s nice to have them just the same. None of them have broken on me yet. We&#x27;ve had this kit for about a year now, I think. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Work great, cuts much better than any home haircut kit I&#x27;ve had before. Lots of power. All parts seem to be manufactured well, the handset does not get hot, the cord is quite long. Will update my review in a year to state how well they keep working.</li>
            <li> It is a little noise it , I cut my hair Flat Top style and this machine does a verry good job.</li>
            <li> is well made, solid, and perfect for personal use as it has all kind of accessories, I started cutting my own hair last month with this product, is a hard thing to do and the results are not what I expected, but i&#x27;m sure I will improve my skills. Luckily for me, hair grows again.</li>
            <li> This comes with absolutely everything that you will need to give some great haircuts.  I use it on my 3 year olds hair and am very impressed with how easy it works.  It has enough guides to do many different length cuts.  The money I spent on this has paid for itself over and over again saving money on hair cuts,</li>
            <li> The first time I used this clipper, I put on the 1/16th adjuster and had no issues.  It&#x27;s not a loud clipper like some people have claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use any attachments, just did a straight cut with the blades like I used to do with my old clipper, and that was when I realized there is something very wrong with this product. It nicked up my scalp, left visible red marks, and left me in pain, particularly around my hairline at the top of my neck. I won&#x27;t use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use clipper oil. I have been shaving my head without any length adjustments for a number of years and never had any pain or red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for a rival company - I&#x27;m just a bald guy living out my life in relative obscurity. ; - )</li>
            <li> This is my 4th pair of Wahl Trimmers over the last 10 years.  These are great, no pulling, good clean cut.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers a few years back and used them probably 2-3 times a month.  They worked great, never had any problems with them until last week when they just completely stopped working.  They don&#x27;t turn on at all anymore.  I&#x27;ve had other Wahl clippers that started chattering, or just got too loud that I replaced because they were probably going bad.  But this is the first one that completely stopped working w/o warning (no loudness/chattering beforehand).  Still, I would buy another set (and am about to) w/o hesitation.</li>
            <li> I bought last pair like these at Rite Aid. I sometimes drop them, so I slightly damaged last clippers. You get a lot of different size covers, which I can&#x27;t use for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  We give our sons haircuts because they would rather us do it than a barber.  So I guess that says it all...user friendly.</li>
            <li> Great value, excellent clippers. Dead silent and work like a charm, although corded so limits their range, not a big deal to me. I suggest lubricating every other or after a day of heavy use by lightly oiling and then allowing blades to move back and forth after cleaning.</li>
            <li> The first 9 months of cutting my hair and my brothers hair, it was great. I felt no pulling or straining. It cut hair very smoothly. Easy to use. It actually isn&#x27;t that loud at all. It sounds quieter than most barber shop clippers and it isn&#x27;t scary to use. The chrome is just for show. Today, I bought the Wahl Color Pro because this clipper is now useless, and it is the same exact product, except cheaper and has a plastic finish and more colors instead! I would highly recommend that one instead.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers started to fail after 9 months. I kept it clean and oiled, but it just kept getting louder and louder along with the vibrations. I got mad and threw them on the floor 4 times that I broke it, but I still finished my hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;It gets hot after 30 minutes of usage, but I think that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;If you don&#x27;t keep the hair off the blades and oil it frequently, it will get loud and vibrate like a dildo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one for $30. I recommend this product instead, which is the exact clipper, but in a plastic shell: [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300 400 Color Complete Haircutting]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you pay, you save a lot than going to the hair cutter! I had no experience in cutting my own hair, but I soon learned. The first 4 cuts were horrible, but now I know how to cut my hair as good as my previous barber. :)</li>
            <li> Ordered this for use on a deployment and ended up cutting 8-10 people&#x27;s hair. Between the excellent directions and a little practice, it really yields a super looking haircut.</li>
            <li> Nice and powerful clipper, lots of combs, pretty fair instructions, good case. Only complaint: cheapo plastic &amp;#34;smock.&amp;#34; This is a versatile set.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was going to the barber, paying $20 to get his hair buzzed every couple of months, and more than half the time, he came home hating the hair cut anyway.So I figured why waste the money when he could get his hair cut at home. This thing is very user friendly and great for beginners. Neither of us knew anything about cutting hair before buying these but now, my boyfriend cuts his own hair and I just help him with the back and touch up anything he missed. I would highly recommend these clippers. They&#x27;re great. It does get a little hot towards the end, but nothing that&#x27;s too hard to deal with. The combs it comes with are also great and really make cutting his hair easily. I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a $10 set that I bought. I use them to cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home. They work really well and came with a ton of guards. Well worth it, it has paid for itself in barber savings.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a price no better than this. The brand of the clippers, and the fantastic job that it do is a keeper for me. If anyone has doubts on purchasing this set, please take the time to read my review - It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a around two months now and its good no major issues yet.its feels very heavy duty its a solid machine with accessories. the only problem is it a little noisy.</li>
            <li> Nice set; full accessories can do just about anything. Has held up well. Does what it should, no strong comments on either side of the aisle for me. Wahl makes solid products in my experience.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this it came to me SUPER FAST! I get worried about ordering this time of year because of the Christmas rush. Not sure how it performs since it&#x27;s for the fella, but I can tell you that it reached me promptly and the packaging looks great.</li>
            <li> Have used it once and just stopped: made a lot of noise, and when opened it i had found it arrived damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> Convenient to change hair cut set. In addition, there is little noise. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on in the future.</li>
            <li> Got super rusty after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw it away after a year, which is way less than the life I was expecting from this machine.</li>
            <li> For that price, perfect item.</li>
            <li> Update! After 2 1/2 years this clippers still work great! I use them once a month.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and we both love it. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and it&#x27;s so quiet! Could easily shave someone&#x27;s head while they sleep...</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s just easier to do one&#x27;s own hair when it becomes sparse! I hate my long time young lady who did my hair for over 20 years is not doing my bald head but heredity has set in!</li>
            <li> Works great, and its really quiet. Really inexpensive for the quality.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Plug it in and it cuts hair. almost as if it were a proper electric shaver or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriously though, for the price, this was exactly I needed and Wahl didn&#x27;t cheap out on their design of the shaver itself so it seems like it will do next do nicely for a vwry long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the power converter, I&#x27;ve used two different ones, from 220 to 110, but the clipper was making an incredible noise and it was shaking way too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the similar one after this one, and it worked normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the bad review, but the bad experience that I&#x27;ve had with it is the reason.</li>
            <li> Use them to cut my hair every 2-3 weeks. No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Best thing i ever bought!!</li>
            <li> People in earlier reviews were saying that this was too loud of a product. I disagree. It is fine for the great job that it does. It pays for itself by the second haircut as well. I love the extra guards that come with it. The cape is literally a trash bag cut in the shape of a cape, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I bought this for a quality haircut with several different options. That&#x27;s exactly what I got. I would buy this again. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start cutting my own hair and these have made it super simple. My hair looks as good as it ever has and I&#x27;ve saved a bit of money.</li>
            <li> Still learning how to cut my hair but this is the best!  My hair is short and thin and most of the time I would get it cut just because over my ears.  Rest really didn&#x27;t need to be cut.  Now I can do it when I want.</li>
            <li> shipping was great and speedy (hence the 2nd star). but had to replace the razor twice, as BOTH times it was delivered with hair in the razor blade!</li>
            <li> Had my first cut and it turned out pretty darn good. Will update when I&#x27;m a couple dozen cuts in though. It&#x27;s a little bulky to handle to cut your hair by yourself but I guess I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great, i love the adjustable blade.  all the guides were included and work fine.  the only problem is that the case is pretty small relative to all the things stuffed in there. it invariable becomes a tangled mess of black plastic guides and combs .  If they had been color coded, that would make it a little easier, but even then they would just be jumbled</li>
            <li> These clippers seem to be very well made, a little hard for me to turn on, but otherwise they do a good job.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers for a good price. I use them mostly just to cut my own hair and it goes smoothly every time. I did have to adjust the blades when I first got them. And when I removed the blades, there was hair in the clipper. This was right out of the box. Me, not being one to send things back, just cleaned it really good and put it to work. 5 stars besides being used when I was told it was new.</li>
            <li> It arrived well packaged and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers worked well, by all accounts. He was thrilled to be able to stop using his dog&#x27;s clippers.  :P</li>
            <li> Works great and does the job.  I have not used most of the stuff that comes in the haircut kit as I just use the main cutter.  I set it to 1.5 and the job is done is a few minutes.  Stainless steel blade is well constructed.  Just be careful as the plastic cover has teeth that chip easily so when you set it down make sure the cover is face up.</li>
            <li> Good clippers, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as expected. I had one trimmer of this brand since 7 years ago, and I decided to buy a new one. But it doesn&#x27;t work as the other one I had. This one is brand new and the old one works much better.</li>
            <li> i order this and in the first use it made a loud noise and sent it back, it did not work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my cheapo clippers work a lot better. Really like the guards, but that&#x27;s it. Heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> thank you very much, very good and useful</li>
            <li> this is now the second Wahl product in a row I have had I bought this at walmart. Mine looked a little different then the one pictured here. but it says chrome pro. it lasted less then 10 minutes before getting hot shutting off and smoke started to come out. It WAS VERY VERY LOUD VIBRATED MY WHOLE FACE AND ARM. lousy products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Conair 6 years ago for 20-25 years ago at walmart it cut right through my hair not much vibration and it half as loud as this thing was. Greatest clippers I have ever had now I cant find any that are half as good what happened to clippers?</li>
            <li> So I keep it short and tight. Not a difficult haircut to keep. But getting a cut for me and my son (7y/o) every week or two was staring to add up. I got these and my wife says we look just as good if not better doing it ourselves. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for almost 10years off and on so these are smooth,fairly quieted easy to use. There are plenty of guards so unless you keep your hair more than 5-6&amp;#34; long you should be good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend!&lt;br /&gt;KCCO</li>
            <li> Great product. Had this over a year still going strong. Well built.</li>
            <li> works great, accessories are great.  several clip sizes.  no complaints</li>
            <li> My wife just gave me my first haircut with the Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Trimmer. Basically I get a &amp;#34;buzz job&amp;#34; and was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t cut short enough. My concerns were unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be on the safe side she adjusted the height lever just above it&#x27;s lowest setting and based on how my &amp;#34;buzz job&amp;#34; turned out it will definitely cut as short as I want it, which is extremely short in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering it&#x27;s almost a 40 mile round trip to my Barber I&#x27;m already ahead of the game, money-wise, with my first home haircut.</li>
            <li> A lot of razor for the money. I&#x27;m not using it for anything fancy - just cutting my hair super short for the summer. It comes with an assortment of attachments, even an illustration on cutting your own hair into a barber/salon type cut- which I will not try!  Anyway, I am surprised at the quality for the price. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I cut my three boy&#x27;s hair and my husband&#x27;s, and this clipper is amazing! It is quiet, fast, and easy to hold. The boys appreciate a sharp clipper that doesn&#x27;t pull hair.</li>
            <li> Quality is fantastic for the price! Great clippers and have given three kids several haircuts and trim my beard weekly. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few clippers to keep up with the family haircuts in my lifetime. I decided i wanted to spend a little more for quality to make them last this time. So far, I am very happy with these and I hope they last. i love the various guards and accessories that came with it in the nice carrying case.</li>
            <li> Very complete kit - so many pirces it is not easy to get them all into the carrying case!</li>
            <li> This clipper has made in china all over it.</li>
            <li> Happy for my money spent and will recommend to my friends as well. Thanks for the great deal. Looking forward for more of such deals.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my teen son is in the JRROTC and got tired of  going to the hairdressers every 3 weeks and paying $20. Not just the money but the time.  This brand got great reviews so thought why not?  I&#x27;ve had these clippers almost 2 years now and they&#x27;re a work horse. The first couple of times were a little &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; because they do make a noise and are pretty powerful.  There&#x27;s only been a few nicks which drew blood and a couple of bald patch incidents, but hey..hair grows  quickly doesn&#x27;t it?  Its all good.  (Tip: always double check you have the correct  attachment on, lol). Overall, this is very easy to use and now this mom is a pro. Even considered offering free haircuts for the whole of the JRROTC at one point for charity....but maybe I&#x27;m getting a little carried away. Plus some people get a bit weird about a little blood so better not. Anyway, excellent purchase which paid for itself after the first cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll cut your hair, it has all the accessories you&#x27;d expect, and it matches your stainless steel decor. What more do you want?</li>
            <li> Works well and comes with tons of attachments!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift.  It is quiet and does its job.</li>
            <li> This product has saved me hundreds of dollars. If you only get buzz cuts, why the heck are you paying someone to cut your hair?</li>
            <li> great price ---4 star seller</li>
            <li> This is the very best clippers you can get, my husband loves them</li>
            <li> Very happy with these clippers.</li>
            <li> powerful! rock my hair!</li>
            <li> This is great for the price! I always cut my husbands hair and this did a great job. The scissors it comes with are a bit worthless, but I already had a nice pair. Worth it for just the clippers alone.</li>
            <li> It very good and it came on time</li>
            <li> saved tons of money on haircuts with this heavy duty trimmer</li>
            <li> I have had these clippers for 4 years now and they still work amazingly. I use them once a week to cut my own hair (that alone has saved me over $4000 versus going to the barber). I have never applied oil to them, or sharpened them, or even cleaned them besides just using my hand to push the hair away. I have dropped them multiple times and they are still working great. Unfortunately for Wahl, they have made such a great product that I don&#x27;t need to upgrade for several years.</li>
            <li> Works great wish I&#x27;d bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> My dad wanted a haircut kit for Christmas. I got this one online due to all the reviews. He said that the blades began to dull after multiple used though.</li>
            <li> This is simply a great buy. Quality trimmer for a great price! It will save you loads of cash on haircuts.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality of this razor. No more trip to hair salon for my two kids after I purchased this razor. Save time and money.</li>
            <li> For the price of a single haircut I can now cut my hair myself and get a haircut I like at anytime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are clear and easy to understand and follow, the results look professional, it takes less time than you would have to wait for your turn at the barbershop and pays for itself the second time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat though.  I wear my hair short (about an inch at the longest) and if you wear yours longer you may want to research getting longer cutting combs for the clipper.</li>
            <li> Replaced my Oster clippers (10 yrs old) with these. I am impressed by the ear trimmer attachment. The clippers are slighlty heavy but the soft ergonomic grip is comfortable. I also like the speed screw. It allowed me to adjust the clipper speed to match what I like, nothing worse than slow clippers. I have had a set of Wahl clippers in the past and they worked well. I am sure I won&#x27;t be buying another pair for 10 more years.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, they are really durable and you can feel the quality in them while using them. Have had them for about a year now and still no complaints. Great product overall</li>
            <li> I have more than two years using this stuff and it is like the first day. I really love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as the old one that finally gave out.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought this wahl clipper to replace a ten year old \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; connair clipper. I was initially disappointed at the quality of the clipper itself and especially the quality of the guides. It seems to be made of a light weight plastic and the guides are very flimsy compared to the connaire&#x27;s. one of the guides is even bent!  I was going to return it and just continue using my old connair, which even though is ten years old, I haven&#x27;t used it continuously. Before returning it I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and WOW! I gave myself a near perfect, professional looking haircut! Maybe because being new the blades are much sharper or maybe because I used all the guides I didn&#x27;t think I would use (left taper, tight taper, ear guide, eyebrow guide) I am very happy with the haircut. I&#x27;m definitely keeping this. It will pay for itself with just two haircuts!  Will update over the next ten years. Lol</li>
            <li> Never had a Wahl before, so when I got rid of my old (carpy) stanfford  hair clips and switched over to this, the difference in the motor&#x27;s power left me in amazement.  It is a good machine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great -- as plenty of various pieces. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I used it often and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This thing is sturdy and does the job MUCH better than the garbage CONAIR, I recently purchased. The Conair Simple Cut 12-Piece Haircut Kit, died LITERALLY after I used it once to buzz my head. Returned it, and got an American Made product, which I was honestly shocked to see. But, the quality was night and day. Had a multitude of heads, scissors, comb, and a cover for when you are cutting hair. I am probably missing some things....But, all and all should have bought this over the CONAIR. Extremely satisfied with the purchase. Has weight to it and is a very nice clipper, replacing a 15 year old one by Remmington.</li>
            <li> Yeah, just a nice piece of equipment. The blades are durable and stay sharp for a long time. It makes short work of a beard, if you&#x27;re trying to shave one off. I use it with the accompanying number 2 guard as a beard trimmer.  It also works really well on hair. There&#x27;s really nothing to complain about here. It&#x27;s just a quality product. The accessories are a little cheap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for someone for everyday use at work.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and so far the clippers are doing well. Clippers do not get hot after several uses and is built like in the old days according to the user.</li>
            <li> This product is a great deal and not bad price. I been shaving my entire body with it and i had no problems or irritations or anything. Its the best machine i got so far!!</li>
            <li> reliable hair trimmer. lots of different attachments for your hair cut needs</li>
            <li> Best purchase from Amazon yet. Works better than expected. My first haircut on myself looked good by following the simple instructions. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Not as noisy as some people were writing--- I&#x27;ve heard vibrators that were louder lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However did get hot after maybe only 10 minutes use. Not sure if I took unusually long-- like if they&#x27;re not intended to be used for long bouts of time or what&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp. Works well. Was playing with different settings and accidentally gave myself a small bald patch on the side when using a low numbered comb. Lesson learned how short the 1 comb is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how they&#x27;ll stand up to time, but based on everyone&#x27;s reviewing it&#x27;s looking like it. Very disappointed it doesn&#x27;t come with the 1 1/4 and 1 1/2 inch combs as I was hoping to grow my hair out so may order them separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth cut. Anxious to keep practicing and getting better at cutting my own hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have lots of hair cause I don&#x27;t let my hair grow long so I can&#x27;t comment if it&#x27;s great at chopping down long thick hair,  however,  I like my hair razor short without using a razor, for the time being and this thing gets it all,  it got as short as my beard trimmer I was using.  I was scared this trimmer was going to be to big but I was wrong.  It has the adjuster on the side.  I pulled this thing out of the box, read the manual, said it was already sync n ready to go, didn&#x27;t need to screw anything to adjustment or any of that.. And it worked prime time. . Oh and mine seemed brand new there was no left over hair in my unit. . Maybe they cleaned it well :)</li>
            <li> The noise it makes is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like this machine from the first time I push ON. It&#x27;s not possible to use it in practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise is the same that related in this video: [...]</li>
            <li> i have been through a lot of cutters and there just are none that work like professional ones.  I should of saved my money and bought a professional cutter with all the money I have spent.  It works but very slow and eventually like all the others does just no matter how kept up and sharpened fails to do the job.</li>
            <li> My last Wahl lasted almost 20 years. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this company. I don&#x27;t understand why they have so many models at different prices. This one is heavy and strong. I have a feeling it&#x27;s going to be around for another 20 years, too.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. The comfort grips are wonderful and it cuts with ease. He said he didn&#x27;t realize how awful his old set was until he received this. Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> This has a very powerful motor and the clippers are very sharp. The kit is great and a good price, this has saved me $$$ over going to the barbers.</li>
            <li> My husband wrote the review:  I bought this since I was already cutting my hair at home with a smaller cutter that was already beginning to fade.  I knew the Wahl name from my old barber and from a pair of clippers my mother had as I grew up, so the name already spoke of quality in my head.  I have used these about a dozen times and I simply buzz my hair to one length probably once every week or 10 days.  They work flawless with a plastic guard on them (I use the 1/2 size) and are a little &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; without a guard on but don&#x27;t rip out hairs.  I did drop them and chip an end tooth and 1/2 the one next to it off, but they continue to work without incident, the nice part is the part that broke is replaceable so these will be around for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is they vibrate pretty heavily when compared to my old cordless trimmer, HOWEVER, these are by far beefier and better made.  The motors between the 2 cannot be compared because that is apples to oranges.  They aren&#x27;t a barbershop professional grade trimmer since that is NOT what they are.  If a slightly noisy and vibrating trimmer isn&#x27;t what you want, by a pro-grade Wahl and not these.  But if you want something to do your own hair with, your kids, you neighbors, whatever, then these are a perfect at home set.  It comes with a lot of clipper trim lengths and the cord if plenty long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these to any friend that isn&#x27;t a barber/hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice set but cutters seem to get stopped with hair easily  not very powerful.</li>
            <li> These clippers are perfect for keeping your neck clean between haircuts,  High quality and more than I expected for the money.</li>
            <li> These clippers have worked great for me so far! This kit has all the stuff i need to get my buzz cut quick and cheap. The side clips are great and give a professional look.</li>
            <li> Bought for boyfriend for christmas cause his old one was litterally ripping his hair out. This one works amazing and comes with all the different parts you would need including a small brush to wipe it off and a small tube of oil so it works very nicely. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet!</li>
            <li> Works perfect to shave an Angora cat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When too many knots come to play, this is a real solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Doubt.</li>
            <li> The Wahl is working well, six cuts in.  The hair is short and fine and so not so challenging for it, but it is working flawlessly.  The accessories are all as advertised and easy to use and the haircuts, whilst not at the level of the barbershop due to user error, they are getting there and it is really great to have so much control over what the cut will look like.....and the clippers paid for themselves on the first cut!</li>
            <li> I just got this two days ago and gave myself my first hair cut last night. The thing is great. It feels very sturdy and well constructed, just like one you would see in a barber shop. For just a little more than one hair cut would cost you, you can buy this and save a good amount of money. I know I personally need a hair cut every 3 weeks max @ $20 with tip. That&#x27;s $347 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who said this thing jams up all the time, you must have hair made of steel because I&#x27;m fairly sure the motor in this thing could start my diesel truck. The nice thing is this trimmer has a power adjustment screw which allows you to increase the power in the situation that your home outlets supply lower voltage than they should. My guess is anyone who has had problems with this jamming up didn&#x27;t make that adjustment when they needed too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a small gift for the holidays, I got my money out of it in one day, I cut his and my step sons hair without any issues.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased. I broke the first one after dropping it on a ceramic floor, so no  fault of the product! I have used these clippers extensively over the past couple years ago when I needed the replacement I did not hesitate to buy the same one.</li>
            <li> Good clipper for home use.  The guard settings (1,2,3, etc.) seem a little longer than the ones my barber uses but other than that, it does a good job (I use the #2 guard).  Some reviewers said it was unusually loud, but I didn&#x27;t notice any issues with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should save me a fortune on haircuts over the years!</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for him which he hadn&#x27;t t tired as yet. Seem to get a lot of comments and friends who want to buy</li>
            <li> Total crap! These are the loudest things I&#x27;ve ever heard, louder than any of the power tools I have in the shed!&lt;br /&gt;If I had to cut 2 peoples hair back to back I&#x27;d go deaf! If it could even do it that is, as I couldn&#x27;t even finish cutting my hair &amp; I have fairly thin hair &amp; was only making it slightly shorter.&lt;br /&gt;It did go through it quickly but I had to do it quickly or I would&#x27;ve lost my hearing without ear plugs in. so forget using them while the kids are sleeping..&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to send them back &amp; will only be reimbursed $15 for shipping when it will likely cost more than double that much from Australia &amp; I should be compensated for the harm done to my ears!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a professional set of clippers or anything, but it does just fine. I buzz my own hair down with it, though it tends to take quite a number of passes before the hair is actually even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine also doesn&#x27;t seem to have come with a #2 length blade, so either I cut it pretty short or pretty long. It&#x27;s not a serious complaint, but it would have been nice for the whole set to be there.</li>
            <li> Great got this to cut my dads hair , and works awesome and cheap</li>
            <li> Clunky, heavy, gets hot easily, and it is just a horrible product.</li>
            <li> I have already saved around $200 in haircuts since I bought this. I wear my hair pretty short and I found I could cut it just fine by myself. No more sitting around waiting in a haircut salon for a crummy cut or paying through the nose for a slightly better cut.</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome! it&#x27;s cheap and works really well! one of my attachments cracked a little bit where you take it off, but it&#x27;s plastic and a really cheap set. So, what do you expect. The attachment still works, as of now.</li>
            <li> The kit has just about everything you could imagine; however, the trimmer itself is just okay. After using it a little while it started to make some noise. It doesn&#x27;t appear to affect the operation but it is annoying. They don&#x27;t quite make these things like they used to.</li>
            <li> cut my hair pretty good</li>
            <li> This hair cutting kit is awesome! I was able to cut around my four year old son&#x27;s ears without having to worry if I was going to accidentally nip his ear because he doesn&#x27;t hold still very well. Since there are attachments just for that, it made cutting his hair a breeze!</li>
            <li> The clipper body seems nice and solid. The blades when cutting my sons hair which is very thick tended to bog down so I put a little oil on them and not much improvement. We&#x27;ll see how they work on mine which is much thinner.  The attachments, which for me are very important, were cheap, cheap ,cheap. Not happy at all with this aspect of them.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and started out using a cheap cutter that we bought at a local drugstore.  When this started to give out, we decided to invest some more for a better unit.  After doing some research, we opted for this one.  I was pleased with additional attachments for longer lengths (the previous one only had up to #4) and for cutting around the ears.  I read comments about noise that I found unwarranted.  The case is a good alternative for keeping the pieces together and organized.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, I wanted: good quality, under $30, and for the clippers to not hurt if I&#x27;m trying to cut my own hair fast. I got it all with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have been such a money saver (as my old clippers were), but are very comfortable to cut (unlike my older clippers). I cut my hair (very curly) and my roommates (very straight) and we have zero complaints. The cord is decently long and the clippers never pull my hair (have I said that enough?). I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Had problems with device</li>
            <li> Hands down wahl makes the best clippers. Don&#x27;t be fooled by other brands and go with this guy.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My older cutter would get jammed up every so often so I invested in these.  These were a huge upgrade and were a lot more efficient when it came to cutting.  Only negative is that the box they come in isn&#x27;t meant at all for organization, it is just a plastic box to stuff everything into...</li>
            <li> It gives a big noise.</li>
            <li> This thing is noisy and will deafen you in no time. Worthless.  Should be taken off the market</li>
            <li> I have been using these Wahl clippers for over 2 1/2 years now, not a single plastic piece in the set has broken! This is a good quality set. Make sure to always lubricate any clipper right before you use it, and it should last a long time. I&#x27;ve had other brand clippers break on me within 2 years, so I feel like I&#x27;m getting my moneys worth on these so far.    Update: I&#x27;ve been using these for 5+ years now. It&#x27;s still running great.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve.  The first time I used it i messed up a little  But even when you mess up a little the gaurds keep you from making a complete mess of the haircut.  I will save so much money using this on my two boys.</li>
            <li> I gave myself my own hair cut using the various clips and did a very nice fade that friends were very complimentary about, never cut my own hair before and I just went for it and did it, w/o a mirro for my back too! I need to buy that now, but the different clip sizes will help a lot to take care of the different parts if you start from the larger sizes then go down one by one to get the length you&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> When I use trimmer my single most important requirement, other than it should actually trim, is  it should not have any pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know exactly what pull sensation I am talking about, You know it is most irritating feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise  for the first time this trim offered absolutely no pull at all.  It works like hot knife through butter. Correction, it is as smooth as knife through water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they would have offered little more oil, but that is fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price! I ordered this as a Christmas present &amp; from what I&#x27;m told, it makes my fiances various grooming needs much easier to deal with. Plus it comes with all kinds of helpful extras! Definitely money well spent!</li>
            <li> it is a wonderful set. just what i needed. i recently cut all my hair off and instead of paying a lot of money just for a trim this was a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I love this product , It cuts fast and runs smooth and the price is unbeatable .&lt;br /&gt;definitely good for all ages .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this unit one time thus far. It gave me a good clean cut and wasn&#x27;t, in my opinion, too noisy.  I typically cut my hair every 2 - 3 weeks, so the next cut will be this upcoming weekend.  At this writing, I like the unit and would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple and inexpensive hair cutting solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s a great product for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many clipper sets over the years and they always fall short. These have held up pretty well for the price point. Also liked the amount of accessories that came with it.</li>
            <li> Pros: easy to use, BUILT IN THE USA!!!!!, has a wire hook&lt;br /&gt;Cons: some of the attachments are really cheaply made.</li>
            <li> After years of shelling out way too much for a simple #2 buzz cut I wanted to take matters into my own hands. I went into the market ready to spend much more than I did, knowing I&#x27;d be saving money in the long run, but multiple reviews from various other, more expensive razors pointed towards this one and after heavy use I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;m still surprised by how many accessories they were able to cram into such a small box but it has everything I could possibly want. The razor has enough horsepower to make cuts in a single pass or two and is very sturdy. This razor was my first foray into shaving my head and the instructions detailed everything I might have questions about, overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> These clippers look and feel much more expensive than they really are.  The cut is very sharp.  It comes with a ton of necessities like a cape.  I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra few dollars to get this kit instead of a cheaper one.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my bead. Maybe too many attachments. Seem very durable.  Needs a nose/ear hair attachment.</li>
            <li> Clippers work well. Saves me money on my bi-weekly trims! Tons of guards , works great</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding kit. The kit contains more different size adapter than you will find a use for; but since every one is different, this kit is perfect. &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; has been a &amp;#34;STANDARD&amp;#34; in the hair-cutting and electric razor business for longer than most of you reading this have been alive. Be sure to &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; the cutter each time BEFORE use.</li>
            <li> The motor itself is quite powerful and nice, absolutely nothing wrong there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic guards (those you use to decide the length of hair you want) are very weak and end up screwing up your haircut. They aren&#x27;t rigid enough so as you slide across your face (in my case, thank god it wasn&#x27;t my head) they aren&#x27;t able to keep their shape and spread apart. This gives you a horrendous &amp;#34;row&amp;#34; look as every other inch is shorter or longer. Ultimately you need to take off all the guards and just cut directly with the metal part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would an amazing product if the plastic guards kept their shape.</li>
            <li> primary use for this devise is shaving hair from chest of patient who is about to have an electrocardiogram, This machine functions  very well as a shaver. Very smooth action, good close clipping, no discomfort to patient and a good solid feel to the operator.</li>
            <li> This kit has served my family well.  It works great and has a wide array of attachments!</li>
            <li> Best affordable brand clipper</li>
            <li> I use this clipper every two weeks to give my boyfriend a haircut and it works great! We are both very happy with it&#x27;s great construction and ease of use!</li>
            <li> Very well built and easy to use. Highly recommended for home usage.&lt;br /&gt;There are different shoes that help you make your cut easily.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cutting your own hair!</li>
            <li> Overall pleased with the product - my only complaint is that it&#x27;s incredibly heavy and the plastic protector pieces could fit better but it hasn&#x27;t died and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog much.</li>
            <li> this is a great kit, everything you need for cutting hair and trimming. the unit is very high quality , would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use well made product</li>
            <li> Tops. wouldn&#x27;t order from any other brand.</li>
            <li> This sucker works great. I had a fancy pants vidal sassoon brand for years and thought it worked well .. boy was I wrong. This one is less than half the price and works better.</li>
            <li> not working with 240v</li>
            <li> Great price and well made. Much better than the trimmers I&#x27;ve bought in the past! You get many attachments abd you don&#x27;t have to charge it. Plugs right into the wall.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  Quick buzz and hop in the shower and that&#x27;s it.  Well built and easy to use.  Gives the Mrs. and I something to do on a Saturday night...</li>
            <li> It did what I expected it to do and have. This machine was for my dad and he loves it. I own other machines that have lasted me for years and have a slightly better clip design.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good clippers and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shaver/trimmer does a good job with lots of different &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; for different length of cuts.  Some improvements on the design would make the on/off switch easier to work.  It is also a little heavy.  Seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li> I hated going to the barbers every 2 weeks to get a haircut.  Now with the Wahl Clipper I can do it myself.  It&#x27;s really easy to use.  Just YouTube some videos for tips on how to cut your hairstyle and that&#x27;s it.  If I knew it would be this easy to cut my own hair, I would&#x27;ve bought this sooner.  I was just scared that I&#x27;d mess my hair up.  So far so good.  Just using these clippers twice already pays for the cost of the clippers considering a haircut is at least $10.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of the Wahl clippers.  Some people have said that this is noisy.  I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s noisy at all.  If you&#x27;ve ever been to a salon or a barber, it makes just as much noise as the ones over there.</li>
            <li> Good Clippers - they do the job. The kit also has a lot of good accessories - more than you need most likely - which is better than having too few. Only (3) stars because it&#x27;s heavy as compared to the Peanut clippers previously used.</li>
            <li> Before trying this product I had gone through about 4 rechargeable hair clippers that all ended with broken clip teeth.  The comb sizes on this machine are made of the type of plastic that is kind of flexible, much more durable than the ones from my previous rechargeable ones.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> This clipper just doesn&#x27;t  do the job.  It doesn&#x27;t  cut very  well at all.  Maybe  my clipper  is defective. Idk.</li>
            <li> They are okay, they cut pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;They saved me a lot of money for having a barber cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, they take awhile to cut stuff.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to spend $100 for some pro ones that cuts way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a months now but so far it has been working perfectly.  it gives quick and efficient buzz cuts with no snagging.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much time to use this kit, but I believe it is a great value.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, especially if you&#x27;re in the military. Saves loads on haircuts and very simple to use with minimal maintenance.</li>
            <li> It is fine. The only problem is it is sound but all in all I think it was a good deal!</li>
            <li> Works great! Good way to save money on hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I have two sets of this trimmer, The first one I bought I had for quite a while and it was ok, then I moved and did not take it with me so I bought another. This seemed like the best trimmer I could find at any local store so it is what I purchased, however I am finally fed up with it. As I said in the title the trimmer itself is ok. It has always worked. The guide combs that come with the set are pure crap though. They are plastic and simply snap on, the problem is they also simply snap off...mid haircut... repeatedly...It has finally gotten to the point where If I just look at it wrong, the comb will fall off.  Also they give you 24 pieces but maybe only 2 or 3 of them are useful the rest if just junk that you will end up throwing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that most of the reviewers have not had this problem with these. There are other better quality combs available but I am just doing to get rid of this all together and invest in a good quality set with a real guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other Wahl products that are even more dissapointing, such as a nose hair trimmer that depending how you hold it will decide if it wants to work or not (been that way since day 1) and a smaller touch up trimmer that needs to be push started by hand by moving the blade to get it going. If you cut your own hair like I do you are already saying yourself 15-20 dollars on each haircut. So just invest in a good set of clippers from the get go.</li>
            <li> the blade works well but just doesn&#x27;t cut as close as others i have used.  I use it on my face so I am not getting the close shave that my previous clippers gave me.</li>
            <li> It did a great job. but gave us all a headache!&lt;br /&gt;The noise was so loud, my son complained when I cut near his ears.  It&#x27;s a good thing this machine does a good and quick job, because my kids almost woke up from the noise.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming and haircuts. Saves a ton of money on haircuts. Durable and easy to clean. Great buy at a great price</li>
            <li> Item arrived with no damage. Works great. Has lots of extra parts that most individuals will never use. Just a good set of clippers. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both shave our heads and we wanted a sturdy model to replace our old plastic Wahl.  This Chrome Pro kit is excellent (the parts are sturdy and the shaving abilities have upped a notch with the extra shaving parts and solid chrome body.  Very very happy with our purchase!</li>
            <li> works great, my husband was very happy with this.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great! I&#x27;m very pleased with their performance. They come with all the extras you need. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and I really love it, I would purchase another one if need be. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Works well clipping hair.  Lots of power and no hair pulling.  Very easy to use.  Does not work well edging hair lines such as along neck and sideburns.  As other reviewers have noted, these clippers will not take hair down to the skin.  One other minor quibble - the kit says it comes with scissors (which it does).  However, the scissors are so cheap and flimsy that I wondered why Wahl would even bother including them.  Simply a throw away item.</li>
            <li> I had a Wahl hair cutter for years and have been happy with it.  I bought this one so that there would be another in the family.  I have had the new one for a few months and have been happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s its a great value for the money.  The only drawback is that the sample oil bottle is leaky and messy and the cutter gets pretty hot after a while.  Its a $20 clipper that paid for itself in a few weeks.  Please keep making these in America.</li>
            <li> Nearly a year ago I began cutting my own hair at home after dealing with paying $20+ per month and being unhappy with haircuts that were at best inconsistent and at worst just bad. To be clear, I like a very simple haircut that can almost completely be done with a clipper, but it does involve gradual changes in length. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of cutting my own hair, I&#x27;m much happier - being able to cut my hair every two weeks so that it always looks neat and trimmed, just the way I like it - without constantly flushing money away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this clipper set is top notch. I don&#x27;t know anything about professional clippers, but I can&#x27;t imagine how they would be much better than this. The build quality is very good and it fields substantial in hand. They never get bogged down by my thick hair, and its easy enough for my to use on my own head. The cord is of good quality and a useful length, and the kit comes with a good assortment of attachments and tools, all in a compact case. And you get all this for just a smidge more than what I was paying for an fairly low price haircut! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair cutter for the few months. I use it as an all-around body trimmer as opposed to just my head. I must say it does its job very well. It has proven to be very durable and after many uses it still cuts like day one. The razor is relatively quiet and does not vibrate as much as other I have used in the past. It does not pull any hair and has not caused any skin irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as price is concerned I think it is reasonable. The build quality is solid and like I mentioned before it has proven to be very durable even after extended usage. I have experience with cheaper hair cutters and they are not fun. They would start breaking down after a few uses and make more noise than a lawnmower. Cheaper hair cutters also become dull rather quickly which causes them to pull hair. It hurts and makes the experience very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with the standard set of hair combs. It comes with 11 in total ranging from 3 mm to 25 mm. It also comes with one for the left and right ears and one for the eyebrows.  Inside you will also find a small comb a scissor. All of it comes in its own storage case which is durable and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pretty satisfied and would recommend this razor to anyone who is looking to purchasing a good durable hair trimmer at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> My barber recently raised his prices from $13 to $16 which is a 23% increase. I thought that was ridiculous for a 10 minute hair cut.  As a result, I thought it was time to research cutting my own hair. After doing extensive research online, I found that Wahl made the best clippers and that this Chrome Pro kit, with it&#x27;s high reviews, would cover my needs. I figured that if I used it twice and throw it away, I would still save money vs going to the barber at $16 a cut. With the help of my wife, I just did my first cut myself and I am very happy with this unit. It cuts very well, has all the cutting guide combs you would ever need and a nice plastic case to store everything in. I even just trimmed my pubs and it works good for that too. I think the next hair cut I will be able to do it all on my own without the help of my wife. I definitely don&#x27;t plan on throwing this clipper away any time soon. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. No more scheduling hair cut appointments and paying expensive fees. I can cut my hair how I want it whenever I want to.</li>
            <li> works great has a good amount of guards for hair length and works damn good clipper strength wise. only thing that would make thiis better imo is maybe make it not so heavy :)</li>
            <li> Feels like pro and is powerful when cutting.. But the guide that comes with it has instructions on how to cut. Don&#x27;t believe it (especially step #6 where it tells you to use a guide with number one above than the one you used #step 3; I&#x27;d say try two to three numbers higher than in #step3 at least or better, just use a shearing scissor to trim the top/front of the head). Also don&#x27;t use ear guide because they&#x27;re shaky when attached on the cutter and can screw up really bad when cutting on the side/back of the ear (I have a dent in the hair on the back of my ear because I trusted the guide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product is worth its price and feels really good to use.</li>
            <li> This product works great and it was affordable. I would recommend it to others. If only I was great at cutting hair now...</li>
            <li> This would payout in 1 hair cut...great product for price...my 2 year old son used to cry a lot while going out for hair cut...Now he is very comfortable in getting hair cut from me....</li>
            <li> Unit has a professional feel to it ----- heavier than another brand that I have, but easy to use ----- really like it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has every piece you&#x27;d need to get a clean cut. Husband is in the navy, so it comes in handy very often.</li>
            <li> when I opened it.. everything looked wrapped and what not but when I took the protector thing off the blades.. there was little hair stubbles in the razor.. freaking disgusting.. I threw it away.. im too lazy to package it up and send it back.. but be weary ..</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair! The Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit went through my hair like it was cutting butter. Whats nice about is, its got alot of clips and comes with a comb, and the small scissors that comes with kit works great! Im glad I got this, I am satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to make it easier to trim up my hair and stop wasting time and money at the barbershop. Received it quickly and it was exactly what it promised to be. Have wasted time with other brands in the past and have come to believe that Wahl is the ONLY brand to use when it comes to trimmers.</li>
            <li> Everything about this is great, except, don&#x27;t use the ear pieces.  They gave my husband bald patches over his ears.  We just stick to a higher grade around the ears now.</li>
            <li> Can I use this machine un Perú? 220v in  my country</li>
            <li> Works great for price range, but, it took a while to get it through my husbands hair.</li>
            <li> Cut hair with this twice and it turned out great. My set of clippers worked great (nice and quite but cutting hair fine) right out of the box. The instructions are very helpful and it come with many length attachments as well as scissors which are decent.</li>
            <li> I got nothing to say except that it is amazing</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, I like the attachments and it is easy to use and clean. I like the brand as well and it is listed as the top of the list of hair clippers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nicely it&#x27;s everything in one product. Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I recently started buzzing my head, and figured I&#x27;d invest in a good buzzer/clippers for in home use. These are FANTASTIC. The quality is definitely there. Ive used these clippers about 20 times and so far, so GREAT!</li>
            <li> Agree with most of the other positive posts.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price for a good set of clippers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to cut your own hair than it looks</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has ridiculously thick hair, and it used to take me almost an hour to cut it with our old clippers because they were constantly clogging - I had to move so slow. These work so well in his hair - it makes haircuts go so fast! But they are super loud. Our dog barks at them.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in when it came in and never worked. Will never buy the product again!</li>
            <li> great tool. paid for itself already!</li>
            <li> The Wahl 79524-2501 runs like a champ! My son had long, thick hair, VERY UNUSUAL FOR HIM, and we were worried that it would snag, or pull his hair out, rather than just clip it off, like he wanted. BOY DID THIS MACHINE, DO A NUMBER ON HIS HAIR!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKED BEAUTIFUL. It has all you need for a perfect hair cut. I worked in a beauty shop, and I know how they are supposed to run, and today most don&#x27;t work well at all, at least not like they used to. Well, These do work like the Pro Clippers of old. I was shocked. The instructions are great too. Because for someone that has no idea how to cut hair, the instructions show you , step by step, and it&#x27;s easy to understand, and with pictures too. The clippers are heavy, but even I can use them, and I have small hands. This is a quality product, and if you purchase it, you will like it too. I&#x27;m very sure.</li>
            <li> Cant put my finger on it but we had one from 23 years ago.  It was heavy in weight and cut like it was cutting air.  This one is lighter and cuts just fine, but it does not cut like the old one we had.  I noticed the other day that when cutting my son&#x27;s thick hair, the hair would get stuck in a crevice by the head.  If I didn&#x27;t stop to clean it out, the cut would not be consistent.  Like I said, its ok, it will do.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a noiseless hair trimmer. By no way buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Bad business&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t spent your money on this item.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power, great construction. I have pretty thick hair, and other clippers I have purchased couldn&#x27;t do the job. This clipper has plenty of power and attachments work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a four star for these Wahl hair clippers, I love Wahl trimmers. I&#x27;ve been cutting my male Family members hair for a long time. And I love the weight, grip and ease of these trimmers. This kit gives you everything you need.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! Made in USA. Sturdy, has good weight, not like a cheap plastic crappy thing! It comes with a comprehensive set of accesoires. For the price, it is unbeatable! For the price of two haircuts I got this one, it saves you LOTS of money!</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep my 3 boys looking crisp, and used for the first time.  Lots of power, works great.  All the length attachments are great.  Will save tons of money vs going to a barber.  Can&#x27;t speak for long term reliability yet.</li>
            <li> It trims really well. I was concerned about the noise it would make, but really it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I expected from reading other reviews, it&#x27;s not quiet, but it is very tolerable, what I would expect from a machine like this.</li>
            <li> I used to pay over $200 per year on cutting my hair. Bought this thing, never have to spend a cent again. Plus no more bad haircuts. It&#x27;s easy to use, and comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> Ive had a previous model of Wahl system which I used to give my sons and myself haircuts when they were kids.  Kit lasted 15 years!  Got this one as a replacement, and if it lasts as long, its well worth it.  More attachments, so I can keep on giving myself haircuts.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product! However after about 6 months of using it pretty consistently it started to get dull and eventually stopped working.</li>
            <li> At less than $20, these clippers have been a great value!  They are solid, very well constructed, and have a strong motor.  The whole kit comes with several extensions and &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34;.  These clippers have already paid for themselves after using them to cut my own hair a couple times.  :)</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t we buy this years ago!  The cord is just the right length.  Specifically chose the corded as we didn&#x27;t want one more charger cluttering up the counter.  The blade guides click easily into place and are effective.  My husband&#x27;s only complaint was that I didn&#x27;t cut his hair short enough, so I removed the guide and took it right down to a stub.  Would definitely buy again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a lower-quality Wahl clipper about 15 years ago, and I had to retire it. This model is probably as good as or better than the clippers you get at a barber, and it really zips through my rapidly fading hair. No tugs or scrapes, either - just a very professional-looking haircut from a decidedly non-professional barber.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love that it has many different sizes of clips, but on top of that its original metal clip can be adjusted as well. I would definitely recommend to buy. The only thing that it needs for improvement would be having a clip that goes as far as the machines for shaving. This one does not. Will trim your hair very low, but not as low as the shaving machines.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.  The casing was loose.  I was unable to returned it because i took it back to my country and shipping it to US was more expensive. So far that&#x27;s the only problem that i found.</li>
            <li> The machine works well and I am not having issues with the clippers but if you are going to be using the machine for longer than an fourty-five minutes or so it may start to overheat. Overall, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good. I cut my hair 2 time a month.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this trimmer, works as good as before. I love it!</li>
            <li> Brazil - Gramado - Rio Grande do Sul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lovely machine, I always have short hair, with this machine anyone can cut hair without any difficulty, and has 20 options of combs, there is a small problem the machine is not dual voltage 110 CAUTION -  I am outside of the U.S. have to have a transformador,</li>
            <li> had a different model of wahl and it was horrible, this is the best product by wahl for the price. highly reccomend</li>
            <li> Works great!  Has a wide variety of settings and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and contains a large number of clipper guide/ combs. Packaging is simple and contents are cluttered within. A good realistic price purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly what you would want it to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had so many hair clippers in the past and this one stacks up beyond belief! Cuts hair like butter and so easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the price is redic.</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 times and now the blade is completely dull and will not cut my hair. I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a month. I had a different Wahl clipper set before this one and that last me for 2 years. I was going to return or exchange it but it will not let me. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair maybe 10-12 times so far with zero issues. The set includes all of the bells and whistles for a variety of cuts. If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll figure out which you need for your cut, and stash the rest of the accessories away. Really high quality, made in america product. Because it&#x27;s plugged in, this thing gets a-going and no trouble cutting hair! You&#x27;ll save lots of money by not going to a barber for a simple &amp;#34;man cut&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> For $25 it&#x27;s hard to complain about it.  After 2 haircuts it&#x27;s already more than paid for itself.  The clippers itself were better quality than I expected for the price.  You can align the blades and adjust for cutting distance.  The guides are cheaper but they work fine.</li>
            <li> Lots of power and options in a such a small package. Very great device and looks very professional. Good work.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Nice clippers for a good price.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, and for the price, awesome!  I trim my husbands hair once a month and it is keeping up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what is expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I bought this for to trim my beard and it was so easy to use, I tried it on my hair. OK, first time use it was a bit shorter than anticipated, but it was neat and not gouged.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this Wahl Haircut kit, I expected a good home hair trimmer. I was greatly surprised at the quality of the unit. It is a professional level unit with attachments for everything.....all for under 30 bucks, Great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have an autistic son who is quite a challenge to get haircuts done at the salon.  The haircut kit is quite easy to use.  Would highly recommend this product.  One haircut pays for itself.</li>
            <li> Ordered this clipper kit for a Christmas gift on Oct 26.&lt;br /&gt;It looked great, several attachments, good product name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening it a few days after Christmas, we found out&lt;br /&gt;that the on/off switch was broken and not working properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful what you buy, read the return policy VERY&lt;br /&gt;carefully.  Shopping early does not always pay. The return&lt;br /&gt;time frame was before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Really nice. I like the numerous attachments, the carry case and the quality.</li>
            <li> Husband cuts his hair and the boys hair at home.  Has all the components needed line and edge.  Does not bite or grab the skin as some other clippers will do.</li>
            <li> Great Product, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now, and with minimal maintenance, it still works perfectly. Granted, I almost never use a guide over a #2, but for close cuts, it does exactly what I need. It is loud, but really, does that matter? Affordable, functional, reliable.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Would recommend it to anyone who does hair trimming at home and needs a handy kit to help with the project.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for over a decade, and this is probably the best haircutting tool that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. At this point, I can&#x27;t say how they will hold up over time, but I am very satisfied with them now. I was worried that the eyebrow trimming tool would cut too short, but it really does a great job. The included scissors could have been better/sharper, but otherwise it&#x27;s a great set.</li>
            <li> Can NOT be used (horrible noise and vibration) in countries with a power supply of 220 V &amp; 50 Hz, even though a transformer is used to convert the voltage from 220 to 110/120 V!! The clipper can only work at 110/120 V, 60 Hz. Its working frequency is fixed, not 50/60 Hz!! It would be helpful if this important information can be given in product description.   Amazon customer service is good though.</li>
            <li> Loved this piece.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so easy to cut your hair with this. And it&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;And there are like 8-9 sizes that comes with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with this kit. Saves a lot of money compare to barber shop.</li>
            <li> I got this couple of months ago and it is still working perfectly fine. Works great, comes with a lot of extra stuff (scissors, extensions etc.). Definitely recommended. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE haircutters.  It works as it is supposed to, what more can I ask for?  My wife says it cuts my hais just fine.</li>
            <li> This product was just what I needed. It&#x27;s already made up for it&#x27;s cost several times over. I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t do anything fancy with my hair. This trimmer never snags, cuts cleanly, and is fast. It&#x27;s a little loud, but nothing unbearable. It comes with all the accessories you would need except for a brush to clean the blades. It even comes with a picture-guide on how to cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried cutting my own hair with a fade, and it really didn&#x27;t come out all that nice. In fact, it looked pretty funny. I&#x27;d recommend just going one length all around if you&#x27;re going to do it yourself.</li>
            <li> I was going to go to my barber for a haircut which costs the same as this kit, so instead me being cheap I got this instead and it works Amazing. Has saved me more money then I have spent lol :)</li>
            <li> This product cuts decent enough but upon opening the box and turning it on i found out this product was extremely loud to a point where my family downstairs could hear the noise. After searching online i found out you can adjust the dial to reduce the noise which didnt work.. so i found a solution where i had to open the sheer and that metal piece that vibrates is hitting the other metal part causing this loud noise. So the simple fix i had to place a piece of sponge between the metals and guess what it solved all my problems and the loud noise. im giving a 3 star because i had to tune the device due to it being loud when i sud just have had to plug and play with no complications.</li>
            <li> Awesome, does exactly as described</li>
            <li> My wife now cuts my hair, saving me $20 every time. Easy.  Product works great. I called the company for an&lt;br /&gt;extra comb (size 1.5) and they sent it right out.</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught in the blade and ends up getting pulled out half the time.  Very painful.  This only started happening after the warranty period had ended.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. This is a good product. I use it regularly and I have not had any difficulty. As long as you clean and oil this, it will last for years.</li>
            <li> my wife cuts my hair every two weeks since 2011 with these  . she didn&#x27;t tell me the oil ran out and doesnt remember how long ago she ran out , and it locked up . just ordered another with 2 extra bottles of oil &#x3D;)  who knows maybe  the other set may work when oiled , it still hummed the blades just didn&#x27;t move . I have very thick hair and this one mows thru it easy . if you do an extra pass or two when your done it will get any stray hairs it missed . it takes my wife maybe 6 minutes , with 2 minutes spent on eyebrows lol . this is well worth it  imo  . 16$ at the barber every two weeks adds up fast .&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/25&lt;br /&gt;I figured out that my outlet blew the GFI breaker and the original clippers still work , I feel like an idiot . the good news is I kept the new ones so I don&#x27;t have to worry down the road when it does die .</li>
            <li> I have been using it for close to an year now. So far did not face any problem with it. It does it job well and does come with a wide variety of accessories - most of which I have never used till date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I sense is that if it is used for sometime without switching it off intermittently I feel I can sense a light smell coming out.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair.  Not difficult because I cut it to 1/4 inch.  I had the somewhat cheaper Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro clippers before and was quite pleased with them.  These clippers have a plastic storage case to keep everything together.  The case is smaller than the cloth case I had with the Color Pro clippers which is handy since I put the clippers under the already crowded sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one issue I have with the case.  (You listening Wahl?)  The case is kept closed by a plastic latch which has a cheap plastic strip hinge instead of a proper hinge.  It&#x27;s only a matter of time before that cheap hinge breaks.  Wahl&#x27;s marketeers might think a broken case will result in my buy a new set of shears; however, I&#x27;ll just glue some hook-n-loop (a.k.a. velcro) in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can heartily recommend this Wahl clipper.  The cutting guides are good, and the clipper is easy to use.  Best of all, when I give myself a hair cut, this clips more than one hair at a time.</li>
            <li> Should fit needs for any hair cutting. For a white dude that has a fro it meets the requirements and has a bunch of different hieght cutter attachments as well i think its a little heavier duty than most. keep it oiled and it should last for many years. I believe you can buy replacement parts from Wahl if needed.</li>
            <li> These clippers work well and pay for themselves with just a little use.  These are sharp and work very well.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the price at the stores. You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great. I&#x27;m a male, who wants to start cutting my own hair to save money and give myself hair cuts more often. The clippers came in on time, and worked outta the box. They are sharp, functional, and easy to use! The product came with some instructions I follow the best I could, and my haircut is perfectly fine, especially for the first cut. The back is kinda hard to get but feel with your hair, use a mirror, or have someone by your side for help. These clippers come with oil as well. The guards for the clippers are basic guards, they work perfectly fine, as some people said they&#x27;re &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34; well what? you want a guard made of steel or heavier material? You&#x27;re cutting hair for gods sake. The guards are not as flimsy as people make them out to be. Yes if you push on it, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of force to &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; them, but they move back, and while cutting hair, they don&#x27;t bend one bit! They&#x27;re great guards for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case could use some more organization or a different layout, as I feel everything is cluttered in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are LOUD, yes, not extremely loud, but a loud enough &amp;#34;buzzzzzzzzzz&amp;#34; But that loud buzz makes me feel like the clippers have power to them and isn&#x27;t some cheaply made product. Most clippers will buzz, get over it. Are you wanting to get clippers that are whisper quiet? what&#x27;s the need for that? sneak attack someones hair with it? no. forget the noise, it&#x27;s not bad at all. Yes it also vibrates ever so slightly, which yet isn&#x27;t a big deal. The loud noise, and the vibrating take NOTHING away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, well worth the purchase. Give it a chance. I will be happy giving myself free clean cuts with this. Practice makes almost perfect.</li>
            <li> Great price if you want a budget professional trimmer, it has many accessories in its kit. I use it as a part time house barber and it gets the job done. If you want it for full time use I say its the wrong trimmer because it can cut kinda slow but the blades stay sharp due to its self sharpening titanium blades. Just remember to use oil before and after every use to keep the blades cutting.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an economical price!  It pays for itself after 2 hair cuts.  I highly recommend this Wahl brand hair clipper!</li>
            <li> I liked it as long as it worked, Then it stopped working after I cleaned it. Probably my fault.</li>
            <li> I bought this Wahl for my son. He told me it works great for him and for his son, too!!</li>
            <li> Good home set - more guards than I needed for my &#x27;crew&#x27; but they snap tight and work well.  This unit feel solid and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> They work good for the price, clips are not of the best quality but they do the job.</li>
            <li> The advertisement DID NOT advise that a power converter would not work out of the US due to not the power converting but the frequency. This purchase was extremely disappointing and a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Well made and very useful.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had an undercut hairstyle for about three years now, and roughly every month i would need to take a trip to the barber to have the shaved side trimmed down so i wouldn&#x27;t look like a shaggy mess, and each time i&#x27;d pay about $15 each time. lame! as a self-serving individual that hates dependency, i decided i would just maintain it myself. and it was an excellent decision. heck yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this kit comes with an awesome selection of different attachments, and the clipper itself cuts smoothly and cleanly without snagging on any hair. it comes with a handy instructional book that helps if you&#x27;re shaving your hair for the first time, but i do recommend watching some instructional youtube videos to supplement that. it is a bit tricky to get used to, but it&#x27;s certainly well worth the price and will save a load of money if you normally take frequent trips to the barber just to do a stupid simple trim. albeit, barbers need to pay their bills, too, so a trip every now and then doesn&#x27;t hurt. they probably do a better job, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nevertheless, this is an excellent clipper that cuts clean and smooth, and the kit comes with such a variety of length attachments it&#x27;s kind of crazy. it&#x27;s a brilliant deal for the price and the quality you get, so i highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. I have owned this set for what&#x27;s gotta be nearly 5 years now. I use it every couple days to trim my beard - and every now and then to keep my torso in check. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll cut the head, but I&#x27;m not super skilled - so I let the pro&#x27;s do that. It comes with oil and maintenance instructions which I&#x27;ve mostly disregarded, and has still lasted me this long. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item and tried it for the first time the other day.  I previously had a ConAir self charging model which served me well.  The Wahl clippers seem to work fine.  I did notice that the Wahl clippers are quite a bit heavier and vibrate more than my previous ConAir clippers.  Actually, they vibrate so vigorously compared to the ConAir clippers that in all honesty I kind of lost my feel for the sections on the back of my head that I was cutting.  Time will tell if they last as long as my previous ConAir clippers, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I have used it weekly and have been very pleased. I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Cuts well and blades stay sharp as long as you oil them after each cut. They don&#x27;t make them as good as their original buzzers but definitely get the job done. Older models feel more sturdy and heavy duty while this one feels like it has cheaper plastic. You can really tell in the feel of the adjustment lever.  Don&#x27;t let the chrome part fool you, it is definitely not metal.</li>
            <li> does an excellent job looks nice and feels good in your hand no slipping when holding at awkward angles</li>
            <li> Very cheap looking and you have to go over and over some areas to get a clean cut. Still had to shave off some areas (sideburns, back of neck) because the cut wasn&#x27;t close enough.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice little kit for the price, lots of extras, the clipper runs quiet which is nice too.</li>
            <li> Nice product does what it says, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Comes with everything, even a portable traveling pack. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years ( and friends that want a free dew). It was time I got new clippers as my old blades were starting to pull and the oil wasn&#x27;t doing enough for the blades. This kit comes with so many different clippers that really help perfect those fades, etc. The wire is at a good length so there&#x27;s no issues there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside I would say would be the scissors. They&#x27;re kind of cheaper plastic and doesn&#x27;t have a nice weight. Still does its job, but I feel like it won&#x27;t last too long. Overall, great kit.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome gift for my husband it has a lot of different prices to it to assure we can get the right cut!</li>
            <li> With three boys all getting their hair cut about every four weeks, this saved us a lot of money.  This actually replaced clippers that I bought six years ago.  I looked into getting the blades sharpened but since I didn&#x27;t buy an expensive set of clippers to begin with, I was advised just to replace the clippers rather than having the blades sharpened.  These work very well, come with good instructions are are mostly idiot proof.  I&#x27;ve never been trained in cutting hair and my boys looks pretty good when I&#x27;m finished with them.  Plus there&#x27;s the convenience of being able to cut their hair whenever I have time and not pay Great Clips $14 to buzz them.</li>
            <li> Wahl is a very good brand. Im really satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic, stylish , very soft material. Excellent quality.  My husband loves it! 100% recomended</li>
            <li> My husband was spending $20 for a hair cut every month. So i finally decided to do it myself, i watched videos on utube, and sure enough i now am a pro!  We are on our 5th free hair cut, and many to come.  Recomend this to any one who likes to save money!  Just watche utube videos and practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li> Pros: Cheap and hasn&#x27;t broken down after 15 uses to cut hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Some of the attachments don&#x27;t set well and rattle like crazy when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Shaved okay. Died within 30 days. The motor made a strange click noise while cutting it on for the second time using it and it was done.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and reseached all of the different ones Wahl makes and decided to go with this one. It came with all of the different trim pieces for different hair cutting heights and is really easy to use. I was tired of paying $12-$15 per hair cut each time and decided I could do it myself since i like it short. Read the instructions, watch the video on-line and went at it. Simple to use quick, easy and clean. I have my wife come back and trim it out a little to make sure everything looks even and percise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it for anyone that wants to cut their own hair and save money. Great for kids and mens cuts, cant say how easy it would be for a womens hair cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in spite of the bad reviews it&#x27;s gotten. Thank goodness I did, because it works like a dream! Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it did a wonderful job on my hair. I have fairly fine hair and this was my first time shaving my own hair. It came with helpful instructions and a great assortment of tools.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest buying better clips to hold back your hair though. The ones they provide are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for a few months and id say it is a awesome device. The only downside is the cheapy plastic guides. If u do buy id suggest getting better made guides.</li>
            <li> Read the directions and it works fine.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could wear one of these out in home use.  MAYBE if you were grooming dogs or horses for a living, but not otherwise.  Reasonably quiet if adjusted properly and lubricated after use.  (I would recommend buying an additional bottle of lube ... the bottle that comes with, is OK but a bit inconvenient to use.). Also, excellent instruction videos on the Wahl website.</li>
            <li> I hate having to go to the barber shop and get a haircut. I don&#x27;t have a car and so I always had to take a metro. I decided recently to try and cut my own hair. Let me tell you straight up, it&#x27;s extremely hard to cut your hair when you are wearing glasses. I had to cut my hair blind since I can&#x27;t nearly see anything without my glasses.I read the instructions and started cutting my hair. To my surprise, I did pretty good. The only problem is cutting the top back of your head since it&#x27;s tiresome to reach around and you can&#x27;t see it. They give you all the necessary tools to cut the hair, it&#x27;s just going to take practice before you get it right.</li>
            <li> It looks great! It cuts my hair very well. I am happy to have this clipper for my daily needs.</li>
            <li> You have to know what you are doing. These clippers allow me to cut my own hair and of any family and friends I might decide to do it for. Perfect amount of sizes. I just wish it came with scissors. But you can&#x27;t be greedy. Good deal.</li>
            <li> powerful, not a lot of noise, complete set</li>
            <li> This product sucks, DO NOT BUY, only used it once and broke right a way... huge waste of money!</li>
            <li> Great price for the clipper and all the guards. I used it to cut my 21 month old son&#x27;s hair. I really like the adjustability of this clipper.</li>
            <li> It works well and has exceeded my expectations. Only thing to get for this is clipper oil. But as long as you keep the blades clean after use and free from moisture it will last a long time. My last pair of wahl clippers lasted 12 years and were not as good as these.</li>
            <li> Great buy for a very reasonable price.  Gives a good cut.</li>
            <li> works pretty well&lt;br /&gt;last brand was conair and were pretty old&lt;br /&gt;these have a longer guard than where sold with clippers back then.</li>
            <li> Love it and works great.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5-star rating I&#x27;ve finally achieved haircut I&#x27;ve been trying to get my barber to do for over 2 years he never would cut it short enough so I finally broke down and bought my own thank you very much does a beautiful job. Bjwolf</li>
            <li> I give my husband a buzz cut about once a month &amp; this works perfectly!  Really easy to use &amp; lots of attachments to get the the desired length.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift about 3 years ago and my friend still uses it! Good quality!</li>
            <li> So far I have cut my better halfs hair my grandson&#x27;s my brother in law&#x27;s couple times each and still running great, you can&#x27;t hardly hear them ruin and the old man said he could not feel any kind of pulling! Awesomeness! Well worth the good pricing!!</li>
            <li> I guess short short hair is becoming very popular.  Even a cheap, $12 haircut adds up if you want to keep it neat.  My daughter, who is in ROTC, has been asking me to get clippers for awhile.  These are very nice, heavy, like professional barber clippers.  They come with a nice variety of guides, scissors and a case.  For the price I don&#x27;t think you can do any better.  Clippering around my daughter&#x27;s ears was challenging, the taper guides, I think assume that you want it pretty much buzzed around the ears.  I learned from ear number one to trim it first.  &amp;#34;Oops!&amp;#34; is definitly not what you want to hear when getting a hair cut.  But as she reminded me, it grows back.  A little more practice...</li>
            <li> Good brand and also dependable. Easy to use to keep yourself looking human when in a rush. Also affordable priced.</li>
            <li> wahi -79524-2501 chrome pro 24-piece haircut kit,was superbe easy to use,but my kit comes without clipper 11/2 size 3/16 what going on.</li>
            <li> Watch out for the first usage, you might end up scalped.  :-)  My husband was used to his older, heavier cutter, and despite us discussing a very funny Amazon review about this exact possibility, the same thing happened to him when he used it the first time.  The initial cut wasn&#x27;t short enough, so he switched attachments for a closer cut.  Boy, did he get it!  Much quieter than his old one, and much lighter.  He&#x27;s happy with it.  Now, we just have to wait for his hair to grow out some.  Definitely a learning and experimenting curve.</li>
            <li> After spending 8 years in the Army I&#x27;ve become quite used to cutting my hair often. This set of clippers has served me well, using them every two weeks for nearly 3 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and have been cutting my own hair since 8th grade. My hair has always grown so fast, I decided a long time ago to start cutting it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it people - 1-2 haircuts a month $12-15 : 1 year &#x3D; $360 &#x3D; This kit will last approx 3 years: $1,080!! And that&#x27;s not including the time you are taking out of your day to go to a barbershop....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways - this is my 4th haircut kit and probably the best one I&#x27;ve purchased. Some cheaper ones don&#x27;t cut right through the hair right away and take many, many attempts to finally get your desired style. But this Wahl kit is very well made and gets the job done immediately. I&#x27;m done within 5 minutes. BAM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase this kit now.</li>
            <li> My husband finally decided to go with a buzz cut and I love it.  I bought this Wahl haircut kit so I could cut his hair at home. He hates to go to the barber.  Never done it before but it&#x27;s easy with all the attachments and guides. There&#x27;s a guide attachment for trimming around ears and even one to trim eyebrows.  They work!  I have a Wahl trimmer that was my grandfather&#x27;s so it must be at least 50 years old.  I would use it to trim my husband&#x27;s neck and it works fine - just doesn&#x27;t have all the attachments.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought this.  Update 2/24/15 - Still like new and I use it about every third week to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m still very glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This clipper is very powerful and comes with a case and a bunch of accessories. It&#x27;s perfect for people like me that like to cut their own hair. Okay, sometimes I need a little help with the back! Anyway these clippers have a solid feel in the hand and have chrome accents. The case is nice because all the stuff that comes with this clipper would otherwise be lost in my house! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> To much noise not easy to hold. I didn&#x27;t like this machine from the first time I push ON it really not easy to handle</li>
            <li> Really shocked at the amount of product you get with so little money! well worth it! very powerful! Hope this helped you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once, or to be more accurate, my wife has used it one me once. It works just as I hoped it would, really well. The attachments gave no problems and there are many of them. My only real dissatisfaction is that the case it came in was way too small to give any kind of organization to it. I did manage to come up with one of my own. Over all, it really was worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product from Wahl works very well.  I use it on my back hair, sideburns and to trim my regular head hair and it cuts all without any problems.  The price is very fair and you receive a lot of attachments (maybe a little too many).  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> After some research on google, i was convinced that a human clipper and a pet clipper are basically the same so instead of shelling out an additional $30 (minimum) for a clipper labelled for pets, I decided to get this one. Well, I was not disappointed...but i was also being realistic with my expectation. First and foremost, this clipper did not overheat...at least it did not during the first 1.5 hours of continual use...after this duration..it started warming up but was still manageable... I have a pekingese and i used the 3/4\\&quot; attachment. This does not mean that any fur longer than 3/4\\&quot; will be cut...it simply means that fur will not be cut shorter than 3/4\\&quot;.  You have to move slowly the clipper thru the fur...everytime, it will catch a bit and you will slowly and gradually trim the fur.  In fact you don&#x27;t want to go too fast or try and get too much of the fur coz that will clog up the blade.  It was really not a bad set of clippers and if ONLY my furbaby would cooperate he would look less like an escapee from a mental hospital and more like a little prince!  If you pet is well behaved, you can give this a try..and also try and cut outside or the backyard coz cleanup was another big hassle.</li>
            <li> I have a short haircut and this does the job perfectly. All the accessories work fine and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I would recommend this product.  Rick</li>
            <li> Used these clippers to create two fantastic mohawks, one for myself, and one for my fiancée.  They worked beautifully.  Went down to the scalp with no cutting or scratching.  Since my fiancée was immunocompromised at the time, this was a big deal.</li>
            <li> Although this is a relatively cheap product, the quality of the materials was below average.  I have purchased similar sets in the past (ConAir) which was in the same price range,  those sets lasted a for over a year before i had to buy a replacement.  This set has poor quality clip attachments, the #1 attachments does not even snap in any more and it has only been 2 months of use (1-2 a week).      I recommended going with a different product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping really great price. Was a Christmas gift, works great has a lot more attachments then I thought would be in it very happy</li>
            <li> Any possible buyer outside of the US check your voltage output of your plugs. I live in New Zealand where the volagr output is 220/230v. But the clippers are meant for 110/120v from the US plugs. Had to buy a step down transformer. Will update if it works. At the moment it makes a VERY LOUD noise, which would make it unbearable to use.</li>
            <li> I use this for my son&#x27;s hair, and they are better then the last set of clippers. I would rate as: Very Good- I would recommend.</li>
            <li> this works really well. really great.</li>
            <li> An important piece of warning - This is not a beard trimmer, it is a head haircut thing. I bought it thinking that it would help in beard too. It does save me a razor when i try to trim my long grown beard after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Exactly what every Guy must have on hand&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently begun clipping my own hair, and my first pair of clippers were fairly cheap. For the price of these, they&#x27;re quite nice! They&#x27;ve got a nice weight to them and are very easy to use for beginners, while more experienced family has also expressed their surprise in how good they are.</li>
            <li> I do not claim to be a hair stylist, I am just a guy that cuts his own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers let me cut my hair how I want it and when I want it.  I have used them for near a year and have no complaints of signs of wear.  There are adequate guards for cutting to discrete lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li> So when I purchased this clipper I was excited and when I received it I was also excited but when I used it, it cut my head. And it&#x27;s hard to get to the power. I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> a very good item relative to its price, and it cuts smoothly and it&#x27;s very powerful machine.  I took a small amount of time to cut my hair.  One thing I didn&#x27;t see yet is the aging effect on it.</li>
            <li> Well, I purchased these clippers because I wanted to save a $20 bill for every haircut I get by doing it myself.  The clippers came in yesterday and I opened them and told my wife that I&#x27;m going in the bathroom and I&#x27;m hoping to come out looking somewhat decent from a DIY haircut.  Not sure why this product is getting bad reviews from noise and vibrations....They sound and feel like normal barber clippers to me.  Trust me the noise isn&#x27;t that loud at all, and I used them in a closed bathroom.    Getting to the point, the clippers worked great.  I gave myself a perfect fade.  I didn&#x27;t use the clippers on the top of my head, I used the scissors provided.  Using the scissors on the top made my hair look more professionally done.  My wife was in Awe when she saw my haircut, and asked how the heck did I do this all by myself.  The only thing I asked her to do was trim my neckline.    I would recommend starting out with a higher number attachment, like I did, just to test out the length.  I started out with a #4 to test, then used a #3. You can always work your way down, but you can&#x27;t work your way back up, lol.  To blend in the sides with the top, I just switched the lever on the clippers from up(closest cut) to down(longer cut).  All in all, my hair looks like it was professionally done.  P.S. this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever cut anybody&#x27;s hair, besides my dog&#x27;s.  Maybe I&#x27;ll start cutting hair on the side, lol.</li>
            <li> This product brings joy to me! I am a barber and i am satisfied with the clipper. The clips and scissors are very good. I recommend the clipper since it cuts smoothly and evenly!</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Use this weekly.  Cuts great</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s extremely noisy. My children can&#x27;t use it because of the noise it makes.</li>
            <li> Very nice piece of equipment!</li>
            <li> Use once a week to shave my head.  Wish the had more sizes for shorter trimming.</li>
            <li> These were listed as hair clippers.....and my old Wahl was going out.  What I got was a very&lt;br /&gt;heavy animal fur clipper that is damn near impossible to hold with my arthritis.  Total disgust.</li>
            <li> Great Clippers at a great price - would buy again</li>
            <li> I like how easily I can give myself a good haircut. Saves me time and money!</li>
            <li> works great. is just very noisy, but otherwise works really good.</li>
            <li> Follow the instruction. Or you will be laughed by others.</li>
            <li> It wont cut FINE hair with any of the &#x27;adapters&#x27; attached, not even when spraying water or hairspray on the FINE hair.</li>
            <li> Such a good investment. As a guy with a normal haircut i wish i would have bought these much earlier. They litterally pay for themselves with just 2 cuts. I used to get my haircut monthly, now i do it weekly. Plus i know what to expect when i cut my hair, no more inconsistency everytime i go to the barber. The eyebrow trimmer is a great plus.</li>
            <li> I suppose my son liked it.  It was a b&#x27;day gift that he specifically requested.  I will say they look very sleek and stylish and came with all the accessories needed for a well-groomed man.  He appreciates and likes it -- and of course, the price is very good.</li>
            <li> Standard set of clippers that do the job!</li>
            <li> 2 years later, works like a champ. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am not pleased at all by this product. sure it comes with lots of attachments but they all (including the clippers) seem like very poor quality. One attachment was bent on arrival. the comb felt like a toy. it comes with 30 day money back and 5 year limited warranty i doubt it will survive 3 hair cuts.</li>
            <li> wahl is a great brand. this is not the only wahl product I have. I used this a couple of times and it cuts greaat! love it love it love it love it love it</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the clippers. Received it quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. fast shipping</li>
            <li> If you want an close cut and a good shave buy these clippers. They gave me the closest cut of any clippers I ever brought. I will have to see if their claim to these clippers are self sharpening is true.</li>
            <li> Makes me bald in under one minute!!! Still works after a year and easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the clippers, it&#x27;s my wife who cuts my hair so I can report from a recipient view that the Wahl Haircut Kit works great. The cut is smooth without pulled hair. The guides fit and work just as they should. Along with the small bottle of oil about all we use out of the kit is one guide and the hair cutters so nothing is complicated. The clippers are fairly heavy but I&#x27;m rating that as a good thing as it probably means they are mostly metal and not plastic.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Quick service. Works well.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.many more tools than needed.very easy to use and the parts go together very easy and work well.</li>
            <li> The product worked perfectly well and meets all my domestic purposes.</li>
            <li> This is F***ing ugly!i hate this!i didn&#x27;t able to use it..its not working!it has a lot of noise and the blade is not working!bulls***!</li>
            <li> Great clippers so good a purchased another pair for my brother in law to enjoy</li>
            <li> Gives a good cut but not able to cut short enough</li>
            <li> Excellent product, every week I used this machine and I feel good, hapy and the short hair and never long</li>
            <li> Love it. Works flawlessly and comes with a LOT of additional goodies. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> It works well. Don&#x27;t use it often, but I have no complaints. It cuts well. Used it for hair cuts (top of the head) and cutting beard down for shaving.</li>
            <li> Works just like a barber&#x27;s razor.  Many accessories comes with the kit. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my brother and boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother trims his hair with it frequently and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works great for maintaining beards.</li>
            <li> Clean. Good craftsmanship. But doesn&#x27;t cut as good as my older pair, which are the same model.</li>
            <li> Cuts fast, no pulling, boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li> I have this over a year now...work great...use it about every month on myself. I had some trouble with it when I get it...I had to adjust it on the side...to fine tune it after I plug it in for power</li>
            <li> Good, the attachments that came with it will do the job.</li>
            <li> These clippers are AWESOME!!!!!!!!! I will never got to the barber ever again. So many attachments that are perfect for any situation. Quiet blades. Great looks! MUST BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. We got this for trimming the kids hair and for easier grooming of my facial hair. I have a battery operated trimmer that just doesn&#x27;t stay charged well enough and this was a must. The cape is very cheap, I would recommend getting a higher quality cape if you are going to cut a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> no problems with the Wahl</li>
            <li> Great value to have in your hair cutting tool kit!</li>
            <li> Even better than expected (which is nice).  This is a top-notch clipper (like the one your barber might use).  Made in the good old USA too.  The kit comes with loads of different size clip-on guides for cutting different length hair.  There are even guides for trimming around the ears and eye brows.  You get two different combs, barber scissors, and a bit of blade lubricant and a tiny cleaning brush.  The instruction booklet is very understandable too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this device. It&#x27;s built nicely and I just works nicely. My son and I use it at home and it cuts hair like butter. Not as loud as the my old clippers.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair, doesn&#x27;t get too warm, and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> While functionally it is ok, but cosmetically the appearance is very rough. Yes, it will buzz your hair and that&#x27; is just about all it does.</li>
            <li> It was a defective piece. So, I am going to return it. It vibrates heavily when it runs, with a big noise.</li>
            <li> It does what it should with no fuss.</li>
            <li> Sturdy electric clippers that does as promised, reasonable price.  Recommended.  Good for between haircuts neatening and trims that don&#x27;t look as if done in prison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for about 3 years. It&#x27;s astounding. it comes with a lot of different clips and the case is great. I cut my hair every two weeks and as brush it after every use. maybe drop a bit of oil once every three months, and its in great condition.</li>
            <li> I still use it ad&#x27;s it works great</li>
            <li> just works really well ... smooth and quiet...</li>
            <li> seems like great quality clipper. very strong.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $15 for someone to use a #8 guide all over my head, So I decided I would try it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought this clipper set, opened it up once it got here, and buzzed my head. The clippers worked well, felt nice and sturdy, and held the guide securely. Without the guide I was able to trim up around my ears and side burns, and then I was done! about 10 minutes later my hair was cut, and the clippers had already almost payed for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else in the kit felt well made, and you really get everything you need to give someone a basic hair cut.</li>
            <li> This Wahl Clipper is great!  I use it to cut my hair myself and it does that quickly and easily.  It&#x27;s very quiet too.  I was initially worried because other comments talked about the noise and vibration; but I figured, it&#x27;s a hair clipper, what do you expect?  However, I experienced none of those problems.  I did notice my number 2 doesn&#x27;t fit as snug as the other pieces, you can&#x27;t tell by looking or feeling it though.  This does cause an extra vibration noise, which I only notice because the clipper is so quiet.  It cuts just as well as the others and, naturally, the noise disappears as soon as it&#x27;s against your head.  I also chose this product because I wanted a hard plastic case, not a soft bag. You just throw the pieces in the case, they don&#x27;t have specific places to clip in or be placed.  The case is big enough to easily fit all the pieces without having to worry about enough room to close it, but it&#x27;s still quite small for easy storage.  Also, everything is sturdy to where I don&#x27;t have any worry about things breaking anytime soon; but, only time will tell for that.  So far, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Blades are not as sharp as my old whal which lasted me 15 years hair cut every 1 to 2 weeks.  I like that it is much quieter though.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers! Ever since I bought these I have not gone to Supercuts; I am able to maintain my short hair length all the time; whereas before I needed to visit Supercuts regularly; I use the # 12 comb on my whole head every day to maintain the 1.5\\&quot; length that I like; they are very quite and inconspicuous. With these clippers I am set for life without ever having to visit Supercuts again! I have been clipping my whole head with these clippers everyday since I bought them to maintain my 11/2\\&quot; length. Does anyone else do this? I wonder if there are any negative consequences to cklipping your hair daily; could it cause hai loss or improve hair growth? If anyone knows I&#x27;d highly appreciate your advice. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after being stood up for a haircut appointment and vowing to myself that I would never put up with those scam artists again--how hard is it really to cut hair? Since then, I&#x27;ve given myself around ten pretty decent haircuts (that is to say, this thing has paid for itself ten times over). I use the 3 setting for the back and sides and the 8 for the top, and then I let the top grow out for a few of months while cutting the back and sides with the 3 about monthly. It&#x27;s also useful for trimming my beard as well as hair in other locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, it is a bit heavy, which isn&#x27;t a problem for a strong guy like me, but I could see how it might be for a smaller, weaker person. Also, I could stand for it to have a little more power especially considering the fact that it works off of the wall outlet. It does also tend to catch hair between the blades, but this is easily cleaned out with the included brush. All in all, it&#x27;s a fine product that has held up well with frequent use.</li>
            <li> Works well, a little noisy, but a good buy.  The case it came in is useful.  The cape is flimsy, but who cares.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this haircut kit for my husband three years ago. Every time he uses that he remarks that it was the best gift ever. He is not a barber and yet has saved probably $1000 in giving himself haircut at home. If this item quit working tomorrow I would still be very very happy with my purchase and would replace it in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> I have used this set for many years now, and typically every 2 years I get a new set (I cut my hair every week... Military)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past set I didn&#x27;t need to replace, but I did because in my last move some of the guards disappeared. I figured it&#x27;d be easier to just get a whole new set then to replace individual guards.  My last set was 2+ years old, and I never oiled them and they were still kicking just fine. They aren&#x27;t too loud and cut really well, no tugs, or rips. Save yourself 15 bucks a week and cut your own hair! These more then pay for themselves.  Very solid product here.</li>
            <li> Gave myself about 40 hair cuts over two years.  Saved a ton of money. 24.99 / 40 &#x3D; .62 so 62 cents per hair cut instead of 10-20$.... I dropped it one time.  After that it was extremely loud, although it still worked for six more months. I was always afraid it would stop working half way through. Because of that I with held two stars. Decent product..</li>
            <li> Blade rusted after just a few use</li>
            <li> Works great, gave myself a hair cut when it came in and it works great.  Look forward to using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Great Hair Cut Kit,&lt;br /&gt;I took it for personal use and I was not expecting so much accessories in it.</li>
            <li> Could be better. I wish it cut better then again I haven&#x27;t paid top dollar for these clippers. you get what you paid for with these.</li>
            <li> Great pair of clippers.  Give a nice even cut and they are not loud at all which some reviews led me to believe.</li>
            <li> So noisy. It cannot be accepted. I don&#x27;t recomend this.</li>
            <li> Lighter than my old Wahl.  Quieter and smoother.  Assume it will work as well as the old one.  The old one still works fine. Just wanted a spare.</li>
            <li> This works a lot better then I imagined !! Saves me an expensive trip to the barber !!  Thanks !!!</li>
            <li> Works great! A lot better than the ones i get from walmart or tj maxx. Has no problem cutting through thick hair unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> Been paying $20 including tip to barber every 4-5 weeks, but when my wife and I had our first baby it became very hard for me to find time to go to he barber shop as my wife works odd hrs and weekends. Which is typically when I would get my hair cut after work or a sat. morning. I found out one of my brother in laws cuts his own hair, same boat as me but he has 2 kids and NO FREE TIME!  So he suggested to watch some video&#x27;s on youtube on how to cut your own hair.  Hardest part is cutting the back and fading it. This will just take practice.  . I followed the instructions in the booklet and went with a 1 at lower part of head, then a 2 to blend it, then a 3 on the top. That was a bad idea. I do like the sides short and faded, but i like a little more on the top. Now my top of my head has only 1/2 inch of hair. Oh well it will grow back. Next time I will need a cut will be months from now. This clipper set will last for years and years saving me money and time! I would recommend these to anyone who wants to cut their own hair saving themsevles time and money.</li>
            <li> Lovely product use it for everything to trimming my beard to touching up between hair cuts</li>
            <li> A really excellent pair of clippers .</li>
            <li> I do very basic trimming work with it, but i&#x27;m surprised by the complaints about noise and vibration. It&#x27;s not loud and it has a relatively low vibration.  Worked great for what I needed. There was never any pulling on my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome home hair clippers!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years......WOW for $25, this is the best clipper you can buy.  I oiled it only once recently.  100% satisfied and had 0 problems.  I wanted something to replace the barber and this is it.  With so many different attachments, great looking design and quality.  Nothing less.  I will always buy a Wahl product from now on</li>
            <li> We use this about once a month and it works great. Cuts well and included more attachments then I will ever use!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer. It does what it is supposed to do with no problems. It is easy to use and very sharp. Some people might find it noisy, but not my husband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s professional one. Strong electricity is very powerful.I like it very much. My roommate have my hair cut. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The clipper is a bit too noisy and when turned on it jolts quite a bit.  It is medially sharp but it does the work.</li>
            <li> I bought this Wahl; which is a replacement for an identical set, which lasted about 7 or 8 years&#x3D;good enough. Inflation is still going on, the old set was about $7.00. With Amazon, deal was quick and easy, quick shipping time.</li>
            <li> Despite arriving covered in bits of hair, the clipper does its job.  So far it has lasted two haircuts.  The clipper without a guard on is rather quiet, but the guards seem to be loose, creating the loud noise that other reviews mention.</li>
            <li> These clippers are fantastic. They work exactly as advertised and I highly recommend them. I had no issues with these clippers whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These work great!!  Awesome price and do a great job at cutting hair.</li>
            <li> ok soooo. this is a really nice hair cutting machine...... especially for its price, its really cheap but it not only does the job but exceeds...  i have absolutely no problems with this product... also comes with an assortment of heads for the length and style for you hair.... and a nice pair of scissors perfect for trimming... i love this thing and im glad i bought it. its a must have.....</li>
            <li> We love the fact that with the Wahl Haircut Kit, it will pay for itself in just a few hair cuts!  It was the easiest to use and the haircut looks very Professional!!</li>
            <li> Had to replace my old Wahl ): which lasted at least 10 years. I recieved the sexier, shinier, includes every accessory you could ever possibly need (even a plastic cloak) plus a carrying case, younger brother. This would be a great gift for anyone who might be in cosmetology school. It&#x27;s a Wahl, so I&#x27;m guessing I will have a another 10 years of clipping and trimming bliss.</li>
            <li> This is like the best home haircutting kit! My husband hates going to the barber/hair salons and had been encouraging me to cut his hair for the last 4 years, I think so I finally got this product and gave him his first haircut at home. It was my first time and I did great! Will definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t cut a lot of hairs. I replaced my 10 year old Wahl clippers with these. Well, Wahl is not what it used to be. I only cut my husband&#x27;s hair every 6 weeks, so I don&#x27;t need industrial strength clippers. From the first time I used these, they only cut 50% of the hairs in one pass. Even after 3 passes there are a large number of hairs that escape uncut, with or without a guard. It was like someone sheared a flock of sheep with these clippers before they got to me. After trying to use them a few times I know I am not imagining things and have had to resort to using scissors for a low and tight trim. I have been cutting hair for 20 years and am so disappointed with this brand that used to be known for quality. These clippers are useless and I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I just got this clipper today. I gave myself a haircut and boy did I MESS UP. LOL&lt;br /&gt;ugh.. NEVER EVER CUT YOUR OWN HAIR. Anyway, these are great clippers. They&#x27;re a little heavy but other than that.. It&#x27;s a great overall clipper. 4/5 (:</li>
            <li> Excellent product&#x60;s, thats very complet and sale price. Ship very fast, packing good.Service well, products in conditions take care. Good luck</li>
            <li> I paid $25 for this hair trimmer and I really like it. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Item seems to well but it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as short as my previous Wahl trimmer did on setting one.</li>
            <li> Another product purchased and sent to my son at University in Puerto Rico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Prime is fabulous ... I just wonder how we survived before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had this exact model in our home but when the kids trot off to University you need more.  Both my boys use this and cut their own hair because they both like it fairly short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both appreciate the guides and given they are fairly picky about their appearance if it wasn&#x27;t doing the job we would know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> The clippers are great. Love the fact that Wahl replaced the cheap plastic attachments which accompanied my earlier kit. Great improvement with the new attachments which are stronger and not flimsy.</li>
            <li> We were excited to get these clippers but they were nothing what we expected based on the good reviews.  We oiled them as directed and upon the first attempt at hair cutting they pulled a ton of hair, it was extremely painful.  Then it would just stop cutting, the blades would lock in place and it would just stop cutting.  We got through the first hair cut (took a lot longer then expected) and cleaned it up maybe thinking it was something we did wrong, oiled it and put it away.  We took it out again to cut my sons hair, and while doing the back of his hair near the neck these clippers cut him, never have I had clippers cut someone before like these did.  Needless to say we put the clippers away and finished everything else with scissors.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Finally able to cut my own hair. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re looking to save $  by cutting your own hair</li>
            <li> My mom just cut my hair, and did an awesome job in just a few minutes with this kit!</li>
            <li> A great trimmer. Only wish there were longer guards included.</li>
            <li> Not very quiet. Works well but after a few uses, you hear a louder buzz while it&#x27;s not in motion but turned on.</li>
            <li> This is the same thing that your local barber/hairdresser/stylist uses,  Simple to use and built to last. Sizes 1-8 plus extras for specialized trimming around ears and for eyebrows as well as others. Lever on the side allows for additional adjustability, extending the length of the combs.</li>
            <li> Saves money at the barber and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very happy, nice build quality - far better than other similarly priced brands.</li>
            <li> Works great for me for two years and I am satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems, no hassle. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome money saver. I got this because I get a clean cut when I go to the barber and I figured why not save the money. This costs about the sake price as a visit to the barber. I started saving money the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s greatly and it&#x27;s not as heavy as other models in the market, my only concern is that after 15 or 20 minutes of use on my first try it started making a loud noise, i hope this doesn&#x27;t give me trouble in the future.</li>
            <li> This was my first pair of clippers and I was pleasantly surprised - the clippers are sturdy, and get the job done well.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto...!</li>
            <li> I bought this set about a year ago from my local Target. For the first few weeks, these clippers were great. I usually buzz my hair down to about 1/4 of an inch and, with these clippers, I was to able to get the job done evenly and efficiently. The only drawback was the loud rattling noise it made when I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the blades started to get dull after a few months of use. What used to take me 10 minutes, now takes 45 minutes as I have to repeat over the same spot several times to get satisfactory results. I partially blame myself for this because I neglected to oil my blades regularly. If you don&#x27;t oil your blades regularly, they will get dull over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to trash a product for what is probably my own mistake, so I&#x27;m giving it 3/5 stars. It gets 4/5 stars for the way it cuts hair (when new), but loses a star for its noisiness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this over a year ago and have used it over 30 times now. I have a buzz cut, so eventually I thought to myself that paying for a buzz cut is a waste of money since I&#x27;m a full time college student and don&#x27;t make much money because I only work part-time. We had a cheap pair of clippers before these, and what a difference there is in the quality of the Wahl clippers. I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far with them, and the unit itself is nice and sturdy. It cuts through hair perfectly and doesn&#x27;t pull it. I consider these a great investment because I&#x27;ve already saved over $300 by cutting my own hair. To put that in perspective, $300 is enough for 95 gallons of gas here.</li>
            <li> I bought this to save myself some money on haircuts for my husband and son.  It works great, even though I am clueless about cutting hair.  It comes with some simple instructions for cutting hair that I followed.  I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but these clippers will pay for themselves in two months.</li>
            <li> I really like the look and feel of these clippers. I am surprised that a product this well made could sell for such a low price and yet be made in the USA. They cut very smoothly. I give it 5 stars even though the the comb guides were all black and the numbers-corresponding to size- don&#x27;t jump out at you. I suggest marking numbers on all the guides with a white paint stick.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that minor complaint, I think it is a fine cutting kit.&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> it seems to work well, and because it is made in the USA and it works dad loved it for xmas, Everyone buy more Made in the USA stuff</li>
            <li> What can I say...it is a Wahl. Beautiful machine and slides thru the hair like butter! Has a ton of attachements! Good job Wahl on another great product at a low price!</li>
            <li> this is a nice set tools</li>
            <li> Motor stopped working during first use. Poor quality. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who has incredibly thick hair, and he absolutely loves it! It&#x27;s a pretty complete set and he seems to have all of the attachments that he needs in order to cut his hair. It came in a sturdy case and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Good so far, it seems like a heavy duty product. Also, the little booklet on how to cut your hair helped a lot!</li>
            <li> Great sharpness, doesnt snagg or pull hair</li>
            <li> The wife cuts my hair and the boys hair. Works great!</li>
            <li> just as described, promptly sent</li>
            <li> These work great. I don&#x27;t use the guides so don&#x27;t know about them but these give a great cut.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the one I had brought from India which wasn&#x27;t voltage compatible here in US. Immediately noticed the blades operate  more effectively against my scalp versus the battery operated clipper I had before. Totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Solid and works well. No complains</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  Sturdy and cuts easily.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit in order to cut my three year old son&#x27;s hair. He hates to go to the barber. I had never cut anyone&#x27;s hair before but I just read the manual and it was a snap! I definitely recommend (as does the manual) using the longest attachment to start. (Almost cut his bangs too short!) I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These clippers are great! I maintain four males in our household so have used them several times.  My old clippers (Wahl 12+ years)stopped working, so I bought conair clippers and was very disappointed in the quality.  I guess I was spoiled. These guards clip on and off just fine and it doesn&#x27;t pull even the thickest head of hair. I really like the tapered guards for \\&quot;edging\\&quot; and the case keeps everything together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so noisy that I just couldn&#x27;t stand it when it was closer to my ears.    Futhermore it&#x27;s too heavy for others who were cutting my hair to hold it for a reasonable time frame (say no more than 5 minutes). That&#x27;s simply not practical. I am returning the product after only two cuts.</li>
            <li> If use it for a long time, it will be hot.  You need change the bottom to make it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl clippers for many years. They are reliable, a great value and excellent for trimming my beard with the guard.</li>
            <li> This item is one of the best hair clipper sets I have ever purchased, because it has practically everthing one needs for a haircut. The clipper is well made and has a good balanced feel in the hands, because of it&#x27;s weight. The adjustment lever on the clipper functions easily and the clipper-blades do not pinch the skin or pull hair during the hair cutting process. I also like the accessories  clipper blade guides, blade cleaning brush, scissors, body-drape to capture shaved hair with clip fasteners, and clipper-blade oil lubricant  that comes with the kit to make it complete to get that freshly groom appearance that most women like on a man.</li>
            <li> bonjour, j´ai essayé cela fontionne bien c´est efficace dans le bon sens du terme   mais alors le bruit est insuportable on dirait un avion de chasse ou une F1 et tout  ça confinné dans une salle de bain salut les voisins dommage.</li>
            <li> When i bought this item for the price i thought it was going to be a cheap haircut kit ....boy was i wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product on a weekly basis and it still performing like it was brand new</li>
            <li> Use on my own head and beard once a week. The eyebrow trimmer is nice, but not short enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love my Wahl Haircut kit.  It was an amazing price, it shipped quickly and has helped me keep the boys in my house looking as handsome as ever without a lot of time and money.  Great product that I would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I previously had a better (to me) Wahl system that had more cutting teeth and could crop hair closer, but this is satisfactory.  The big plus to this one is all the extras that come with, if you intend to style hair.</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re looking for a good value hair clipper. The kit comes with a good variety of clipper attachments including some for shaving around ears and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I got this Wahl haircut kit to replace an old one that wasn&#x27;t working so well anymore. I am pleased with it. It does what I need it to do. I thought it might be a little lighter than the old one, but the razor is pretty heavy. It has a large selection of sizes of attachments, of which I use about 2 of them, but it&#x27;s nice to have options. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star review just because of it&#x27;s weight, I wish it was a little lighter, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Great haircutting set with many useful attachments.  Free to me after my second haircut (savings over paying for haircare). I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was leery of the type of quality that this set would have based on the low price, but it is fantastic.  Excellent quality, excellent value.  Sheers work great (and not at all too loud).  Multiple guard selections and even scissors are included.  This is one of those rare deals where I felt like I was ripping off the manufacturer.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The clippers themselves are fine, guide combs are plenty sturdy, the smaller sizes are a little flimsy. I didn&#x27;t how short the guide combs for over the ear cut, had to go all the way down to a 3/8 to even out my hair and I don&#x27;t like it that short. The sheet to help keep hair off of you is really think and cheap, almost like a crappy trash bag. would have liked more storage room in the case so it&#x27;s not all cluttered and just thrown in there.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair ok.  Does not irritate the skin with sharp points, does not get as hot as my old buzzer.  However, you have to go over the same spot 2-3 times to get a decent even cut with it.  Won&#x27;t get a close cut on the back of the neck.  I have had this for a few months and it still works, but I am shopping for a new buzzer now.</li>
            <li> After going through a couple cheaper brands/models, I decided to penny up and get a good trimmer again. This is a very nice piece with a solid heavy duty body. I don&#x27;t use the accessories but they&#x27;re what you would expect with a trimmer. Overall, I like it a lot and it should be the last one I have to buy!</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to cut and trim my husband and son&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s a solid little machine and does a great job. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the plastic barber&#x27;s cape. It was pretty chintzy and I just pitched it in the garbage. Other than that, I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> cuts beautifully. Well worth the price. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a similar product. The idea of a conplete kit makes it even better..</li>
            <li> I use this to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair. It is so good and we saved much money for hair cut.</li>
            <li> I like to leave my hair short, so I like to trim it every 2-3 weeks. These clippers gets the job done and saves me $20/month going to a barber shop. Also, they include a number of presets to cover all the different hair length for the back and sides.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it runs smoothly and feels like a robust piece of equipment that should perform well for years to come.</li>
            <li> Very good, thank you!!! I like it after using it, and it can give me a nice head!! But I cut too short, oh~oh</li>
            <li> Could cut my hair with ease.  Didn&#x27;t get clogged with too much hair like others.  May suggest the other version with a clipper setting greater than 1&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s just a preference but worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty simple, so I only use one guard. So this 24 piece somes with way more than I need but the clippers work well.</li>
            <li> it is not new machine. because i find some hair in the machine.... ......  place tell us this is second hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a christmas present. The different types of clips are handy. I like the extra stuff like the scissors, combs etc. It really is a haircut kit, even with the cape included. The buzzer is very loud, which was disappointing. I bought these clippers because come reviews said it was quiet or not as loud as other buzzers. It does the job and is an extremely powerful buzzer. I&#x27;d recommend it because it&#x27;s such a great price for all the items you get.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first cut with the Wahl Chrome Pro. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know something about hair grooming as I was at one time pursuing a career in hair styling for the film industry. Instead, I went into sound recording. But I still learned a lot about hair. The first thing you learn is that Wahl&#x27;s professional line of clippers in the top used brand of clippers by pros in the world. The second thing you learn is their reputation for quality and customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I felt pretty confident that I wanted a Wahl clipper set when I went looking for one. After doing lots of research, reading many of the reviews here at Amazon, and looking for the right price point and combination of features, etc., I decided on the Chrome Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s perfect for what I need it to do. My hair cuts (basically a modified buzz cut) were costing me twenty dollars each by the stylist I was going to. She is good, and a pro, but sheesh, 20 bucks just to use a clipper to buzz off my hair? So having experience in the business, I looked around for prices at various places. The absolute best price was right here at Amazon. More on that in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in opening up the kit (all of the many accessories are listed above) I removed the clipper from the kit, took the twisty tie off the cable, found the blade comb I wanted and immediately started clipping. No set up, no prep needed. I had washed my hair, let it dry, and combed it. To get the length I like, I already knew the comb numbers from past experience. Wahl, and all other hair experts recommend that you start with the comb that leaves the most hair on your head first. You can always work your way down quickly by using the next number comb (higher numbers leave more hair; the lower the number, the closer the cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my kind of cut, you do the sides and back first, around the ear next, and then finally the top. So I found a number four comb, clicked it onto the clipper, which is very easy, and then started in on one side of my hair. Using the Wahl clipper is so easy that with my kind of cut, I can do it all myself. A color booklet comes with the kit and is very easy to follow. Wahl also has DIY videos on YouTube to watch. You use the arch or rocking technique as you move the clipper up the side of the head, pulling the clipper away from the top as you finish your move. It is very easy and I was finished with both sides and the back in a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I found the Right and Left taper combs to cut around the ear. You start at the lower edge of hair on each side and cut in a circle around the ear all the way to the front. The Chrome Pro has a taper lever on the side and this adds a greater degree of adjustment as you cut. It will lower and raise the cutting blades in case a comb isn&#x27;t quite low enough but the next comb would be too tight. Great feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was done with both ears, I put the number six comb on the clipper (they change out instantly) and starting at the front of my hair, cut straight back at first as the hair fell off. The clipper and combs cut evenly and professional looking. I finished the top of my head from the back, moving from all directions over the swirl to ensure an even cut. After that was done, I took off the combs and with the help of a mirror, used the clipper to trim the side angles of the back and a straight line across the bottom. Easy as anything. The last thing you do is use the barber shears and styling comb to even out any cow licks and clean up around the ears. To finish off, a wetting of the hair and some Bed Head gel and I&#x27;m ready for town!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning the clipper with the enclosed brush, it was back into the carry case and under the sink. I&#x27;ll use this every week and my hair will stay looking great without growing long and then getting cut short again. My wife, who was doing my hair more recently, absolutely loved the cut and said she&#x27;s retired fromcutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to mention price here. I had spotted this same clipper at Sam&#x27;s Club for more money than Amazon. Add to that the local sales tax. This price point qualifies for free shipping. It said it would take five days to get here...it took two. So I saved $6.36 in shipping.

            <li> The Shaver is very well made! and the kit is very good even thought most pieces look cheap and light! But the machine itself looks very professional and very powerful!</li>
            <li> The clipper set is nice but I found it cheaper at Walmart. A little heavier and louder than I expected.</li>
            <li> Ordered the product with high dreams &amp; waited anxiously. On arrival, the product was nicely packed but the main Clipper Body had some scratch marks. Had to stay in one of the Asian Countries for job related work. Plugged in the Clipper fo 1st time &amp; gosh it made a deafning sound &amp; vibrated awfully. It was difficult to hold it in hand &amp; bear the noise, got real hot &amp; a weired smell started coming from it. Switched it off immediately. Then tried in another power socket, the same result. Brought an Adaptor which steps down Voltage from 240/220V to 120V, plugged it in but the thing still had the same issues. Tried again in another socket &amp; the thing just conked off, I could have been electrocuted or the whole Power supply could have been damaged.</li>
            <li> Its a nice haircut kit....... i dont know if its gona last me longer as i still havent used it..</li>
            <li> professional And High quality hair cutter, but a little bit heavy its perfect for hair shop not for daily use</li>
            <li> This is the heaviest of all the clippers I have ever owned, but it is also the best cutting pair. It doesn&#x27;t skip or miss anything. Very Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that once you set the cutting height adjustment lever you have to be very careful that you don&#x27;t accidently hit it and change the setting when you reposition your hands on the unit while cutting and trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Also the unit is extremely noisy when using the closest trimmer guide. Could just be a bad fit between the blade and that particular guide.</li>
            <li> better than I expected</li>
            <li> I have had several Wahl hair cutter Due to Replacing them from my kids Breaking them. This is by far the most powerful one and it comes with a very Nice case and comes with everything I need to do my own hair at home. I have thicker curly hair and this is powerful enough to cut right through it with out making there usual loud noise of Stop I cant Cut your Hair.</li>
            <li> No problem, cuts hair like a knife through butter. The various clips make it for a great home barber kit. It is great, love it.</li>
            <li> Tried it this morning, soft trim experience. I even used this to trim my beard with no nicks at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my boyfriend.  He just loved it and his best friend was even a bit on the jealous side because the one HE had wasn&#x27;t chrome. HA :) Well, it is easy to use ( I Cut my boyfriends hair) and it is super user friendly.  Not too heavy but heavy enough to be substantial and prove itself a worthy and useful.  The quality is there and the price is definitely right.  it comes with a whole pile of attachments. A great gift at a great price.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I did not know that cutting hair could be so easy.  This 24 piece set with instructions means you never have to go to the barber again.</li>
            <li> Quite a handful device</li>
            <li> When I first tried them, they had a couple of minor issues but after two or three uses they they smoothed out and work near perfect. Some of the extras that come with the clippers are pretty junkie.  The scissors included, were already broken when I opened the case.  I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars because of the cheap accessories..</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve purchased, blades keep sticking and end up sitting uneven with combed edge. Side lever that adjusts length moves the top part around at an angle. Leaving one side of the clippers cutting shorter than the other. Junk</li>
            <li> I have had this unit for two weeks now and have no complaints, it seems to be holding up better than other units I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> This is a STEAL. Great product for an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> My husband is military and we have to cut his hair constantly to keep it in regs. This product has lasted much longer than the Remington we purchased and gives much better cuts! I cut his hair weekly and it is just as good as the first haircut I did months ago! We have saved hundreds on haircuts so far.</li>
            <li> These are superior quality to mine old clippers.  They cut my hair in half the time.  I highly recommend these.  They are more professional than just home clippers.</li>
            <li> Came complete and fast,  and till this day still works gets its use each week with 3 boys in the house</li>
            <li> Perfect for cutting my beard</li>
            <li> My old kit finally died so when I saw this was one of the highest rated ones on Amazon I gave it a try. I used this for my son&#x27;s hair just a couple days ago and I was impressed by the amount of sizes for the clippers and also how sharpe the blades were. I found the clippers to be excellent and cut very easily. (The only piece I didn&#x27;t like was the ear peice that&#x27;s supposed to cut around the ears as I didn&#x27;t think it did much for my son.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed by the number of sizes and pieces that come in the kit and for the price. This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s a very nice set and works well for its designed purpose, but if you plan on cutting poodle hair with it (like I did), you may want to rethink it.  Plan on spending more like 3x this price, as this cutter just can&#x27;t do it well.  The hair is too thick and the cutter can&#x27;t get through it well.</li>
            <li> Excellent kit and best of all MADE IN THE USA! Received and anxiously gave myself a needed buzz-cut. Looks as good as a barber and was easy. A little awkward using two mirrors and left hand some but overall very easy and they cut hair effortlessly like a champ! Very well built and they feel substantial, not like some cheap Chinese junk. They will more than pay for themselves in just two haircuts and there was no waiting for a hair cut in my bathroom! haha  I set the shop-vac by the bathroom door and just sucked up the hair and took a shower and felt great like a fresh barber shop haircut. Lots of attachments, lengths, accessories if you need them. I just used the 1/8 inch guard, ear trimmer and eyebrow trimmer and it did a great job! Thank you Wahl for still manufacturing these in the USA!</li>
            <li> This razor is loud. It&#x27;s powerful but loud. My husband wanted one for shaving his head which he does two to three times a week. I thought he was going to take his head off when I first heard it. I asked him if he wanted me to return it but he says it does the job. lol I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again, though.</li>
            <li> I was able to cut my husbands hair without any issues which is great since I have no experience with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I first use them, its noise is too loud. I dissembled it and make some adjustments on the blades.&lt;br /&gt;The noise is gone.</li>
            <li> Absolutely liked the product. Unlike other clippers it doesn&#x27;t get stuck. The haircut is uniform without uneven trenches.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking out for a nice pair of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;The speed of delivery from amazon was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now cut my hair twice! The money savings are starting to pile up! My first haircut was not very good, the 2nd much better. I recommend NOT using the tapered ear pieces... it just cuts the hair in an odd way, and there is no way to fix it if you mess up. The trimmer is very solid and high quality.</li>
            <li> great for clean shaving and shaving your head!</li>
            <li> Powerful motor. I had to adjust mine because it made a sound. The blade has a sharp finish at the tips(be careful). Other than that the machine would suffice. Because of this poor blade the hair gest pulled if you want to make it less low to make fades and stuff. A better blade and it is a 5/5.</li>
            <li> The noise it makes is horrible. It&#x27;s not possible to use it in practice. You may get a nice haircut with it but you will definitely lose your hearing.</li>
            <li> I love these for the price.  What else can you say about hair clippers.  They have not broke yet and I&#x27;ve had them a while.</li>
            <li> Feels heavy in my hand telling me it&#x27;s quality built.  With a little bit of oil (included) doing my first haircut was no problem for the blade.  The included blade guides match what you&#x27;re used to at supercuts/sportclips/insert your salon. The hardest part is having the courage to cut your own hair.  Watching a few youtube videos helped guide me and this thing will definitely pay for itself (especially considering that a hair cut is $10-20 after tip plus gas to get there).  Over a year, that&#x27;s $100-200! Spending the less than $40 for this is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few years now.  Still going strong!</li>
            <li> Comes with lots of accessories. Powerful motor. Solidly built. I think it can really last a long time. Very happy about it.</li>
            <li> This product removes hair poorly, even at maximum power. I usually do a straight shave with no attachments, and after several passes using this product, barely any hair was removed. It was also very painful against my scalp, and caused some minor bleeding.</li>
            <li> This kit works for what I need.  It cuts evenly without snagging.  The guides are very helpful.  I wish the motor were a little more powerful,but it still does what I ask it to do.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Cuts through quickly ...strong design... use it for my head and face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wish it had more attachments for shorter hair though</li>
            <li> Very nice product and very well made.  Kit comes complete with many items in a convenient carry case for storage and travelling.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t expect to get a well made product. I mean, I thought it&#x27;s just the same as those clippers I bought for a price of 25 bucks which didn&#x27;t last that long. Like after 2 - 3 months of usage, it just don&#x27;t cut that well. Kinda pulls my hair and it sucks &#x27;cause it hurts. It&#x27;s like someones pulling your hair till it gets off your scalp. But this one is hella different. It cuts smoothly the blades are real sharp so be careful on giving a stroke on your head, just use the gauge 8 first then 7, 6 ,5 up to your desired length of hair. One time I used it, I accidentally cut my hair up to the scalp. My hair ended up like I got an alopecia with a big shaved patch on my head, so I trimmed everything like a bald headed man. Also, it&#x27;s self sharpening blade so I got no problem with it. I recommend this. You can&#x27;t go wrong with your 25 bucks. Worth it.</li>
            <li> love the clippers &amp; all the accessories.  Clippers glide right through the hair.  My boys have thick hair &amp; it has no trouble at all.  I have had clippers in the past that would pull their hair.  Not these.  Great price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> 23 y/o male who wanted to start cutting his own hair to control quality and try new cuts without paying every time i want try something new or just do a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> I needed a new haircut kit and this product more than meets my needs. It is easy to clean and maintain and gives a great haircut! It is a very good value for the money!</li>
            <li> This kit comes with a ton of pieces.  The combs are nice as there are a lot of different lengths to pick from.  I cut my husband&#x27;s hair for the first time with it and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair with Wahl clippers since my senior year in high school. Now that I have a son, I am cutting his hair with Wahl clippers. I only trust the Wahl brand for our hair cuts.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very nice to work with and the motor part is heavy which is nice as it doesnt feel like the normal plastic as others do. It does seem to miss alot of hairs though so i have to go over areas a few times. It does heat up alot as well so thats a drawback. Otherwise the case has alot of room inside of it and alot of attachments.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.  Was using a cordless.  After four years it kept getting slower and not taking a good charge.  Glad to get a new one.  It does the job in half the time, gets very close, plugs in, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging.  This Kit gives you such a large choice of attachments.  I also like the way it fits in my hand, and when I turn it on, I know it is heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine</li>
            <li> After a year of heavy use the machine still works pretty well. It&#x27;s a little vague but does the job well.</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of attachments. Its very quite and cuts very clean. Seems to be built very well and the price for what you get is very good.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this set at all for the money.  Comes with everything you need to get started and is priced right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about cutting my own hair. I&#x27;ve rarely had a barber or hair stylist cut my hair they way that looks good on me and I found (with lots of practice) I can do it myself. This Wahl kit comes with absolutely everything you need to cut hair. I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two complaints: 1. the case it comes in won&#x27;t close after you open everything up. There are no storage dividers in there, so everything just piles on. 2. The power switch on the trimmer is tiny and difficult to turn on and off with one hand.</li>
            <li> This Wahl clipper, unlike some of the cheaper ones found in other stores is made in the US and the quality difference is very apparent. The kit comes with 24-pieces featuring everything you need to cut hair at home. The clipper itself is of a decent weight and feels very durable and sturdily built with a powerful motor (a big difference between the ones made in China). It isn&#x27;t overly loud either, just your standard clipper buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it cuts hair smoothly with no snagging. The measurement clip-ons fit easily and hold well while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent quality hair clipper. I use it to maintain my undercut and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5</li>
            <li> That means it cuts really well.  No pulls &amp; I just bought so I can shave my own head. College student so money saving is my ninja sense</li>
            <li> These clippers are so sharp and beautiful to handle, they are a true dream.  I would definitely purchase these clippers again!</li>
            <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying out one from a family member.  I used it the first time to give my husband a haircut that would be easy to deal with while hospitalized.  He loved the cut and decided he wanted his hair to be that short.  He dislikes getting a cut from a barber of hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with numerous black, plastic attachments that clip onto the unit itself and each one has a number and the enclosed chart shows a photo of each with its corresponding number and narrative description of what each can be used for.  The thickest (and highest numbered) attachment will leave the hair longer as you glide the unit along the scalp and the head should be divided up into three sections with the neckline and ear area as one section or swath, the mid head the second swath, encircling the middle of the skull, and the top area the third section.  You start at the neckline moving up to the edge of the middle or second swath, and follow the directions.  There is a left and right ear attachment that you circle the ear with and it clips the hair as short as the rest of the hair.  It also has an eyebrow attachment but we use scissors and fine comb to take care of that area so I don&#x27;t know how well the eyebrow attachment works.  You will receive two, long, fine-toothed black plastic combs, clips to section off the three areas of the hair (if it is longer), oil to oil the blades every few times the unit it used, and a lot of attachments to vary the length of the clipped hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the Conair clippers and they are far inferior to this unit.  The blades are sharp and we didn&#x27;t need to blend the hair at the edges of the swath lines like the instructions state you may need to do.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair (buzz cuts) and this cuts beautifully and easily.  Plenty of attachments, scissors, etc.  I definitely would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I have never cut hair before except for facial hair. I decided to give it a shot after weighing the negative reviews against the positive ones and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I don&#x27;t know why people say that the guides were really brittle and any pressure will break it because they seem fine to me. The guides are not the best quality out there but they stay on just fine with a solid grip. My clippers were a little noisy right out of the box but after dropping some of the lube they supplied it turned out fine and it slices through hair like nothing. I&#x27;m not sure if the people who gave negative reviews got a lemon but mine is working fine. (only one haircut in) I hope it keeps working because it will save me a ton of money</li>
            <li> I should have bought these years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Got them because I was ready for a change. I generally will go a few years between hair cuts or get it cut once every month or two so I never was one to waste much on barbers. But now finding myself on a fixed income and deciding to wear my hair short for however long the mood strikes I decided at the price trying these made far more sense that paying half of what they cost for one hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set with many attachments so choosing what length you want to keep your hair is easy to do. Cutting my own hair was far easier than expected. I will admit I cut it a little shorter than originally planed but not as short as it could of been. So like anything else there is a learning curve involved&lt;br /&gt;The clippers themselves are made in the USA and have a quality feel to them. The attachments are like everything else these days and made in China which is fine because they do the job and outsourcing that while making what really counts here in the USA is why you can buy it at such a great price.&lt;br /&gt;i read reviews complaining about the scissors that come with this set being cheap Chinese crap. I found that though yes they do look cheap they are very sharp and work just as expected if not better. A decent pair of hair stylist scissors would cost many times the cost of this whole set!&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the so called book of instructions which is more like a small fold out poster with basic instructions and not a book. But again what you are paying for here is a really good hair clipper which would be well worth the price without all the extras.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - If you can afford hundreds of dollars a year (2x a month &#x3D; $30 X 12) getting your hair cut than do it because barbers got families to feed too. But if like me without money to throw away (it just grows back) or just looking to cut costs somewhere these are a great buy and will not only pay for themselves but also help you start saving money real fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing to keep in mind whether cutting your own hair or that of other family members there is a learning curve involved and the hair cuts may not come out perfect at first. But once you get the hang of it people won&#x27;t be able to tell if you did it yourself or paid for it.</li>
            <li> This clipper has already paid for itself.  My hair style is short and simple so I don&#x27;t need a degree from a Barber&#x27;s College to maintain it.  I&#x27;m amazed at how simple it is (no offense to the Barbers out there).  Instructions illustrate the basics of haircutting and from there it is a matter of practice.</li>
            <li> This thing is strong and comes with more attachment than you will ever need!!  An eyebrow trimmer sheath?  Cuts in 1 pass</li>
            <li> Great clippers and would buy again.</li>
            <li> First haircut last night, worked as expected. Included many attachments that come in a nice, compact case. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> If you know someone who needs/wants their hair cut frequently, this kit will save you many trips to the barber. The clipper is high quality with self-sharpening blades. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean. And the accessories, soooo many accessories. Cutting guide attachments for various lengths, angles, sides of head, eyebrows, around ears...combs, clips, scissors, and it all packs up inside a convenient and sturdy carrying case. We think it&#x27;s super awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now and have never had any problems.  I;m&lt;br /&gt;not an advanced user, but for the simple stuff it does what it is suppose&lt;br /&gt;to.  So thumbs up.</li>
            <li> cuts my hair saves me money</li>
            <li> Cheap and very inexpensive. It gives a pretty solid cut. I just started cutting my hair and these are perfect to start with. Many blade choices and the combs help too although one of the combs I received was a little bent...I like the product overall, glad I brought it.</li>
            <li> A good quality personal tool.</li>
            <li> Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. I bought these with the intention of cutting my own hair so that I could save money from here on out and let me tell you that these bad boys did not disappoint. They got the job done perfectly and neatly, I feel like an actual barber being able to cut my own hair. Love the versatility with all the different size guards and love the fact that they include a sheet to cover yourself in so that hair doesn&#x27;t get on you. 10/10 would get again</li>
            <li> Wonderful service, product and price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it and is now cutting his own hair. We save so much money not having his hair cut in a salon. He uses it on our son also. It&#x27;s great to have all the different accessories and also all the different sizes. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> seems well made, versatile settings..very sharp, good cutting..</li>
            <li> now i can give family members haircuts and have them looking like proffesional cuts! thanks for making this so easy!</li>
            <li> I bought this buzzer originally just to do some touch ups and trim my beard. I wound up watching some youtube videos and using them to give myself my own haircut (fade on sides, buzzed on top). The blades cut very well and are very easy to use. I&#x27;ve had the buzzer for about a year and a half, and I have never had a problem with it. As long as you keep it clean and provide some basic maintenance, you will be fine. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very nice clippers. I had clippers for my husband&#x27;s and  sons&#x27; haircuts years ago. This clipper is even nicer. i like the directions and pictures of how to get a good haircut. It makes it easier to wade into the project if you have a plan. I appreciated the included cleaning brush and oil for the clippers. The included scissors, comb and cape are not as high a quality as the clippers, but I already had good scissors. Some versions of Wahl clippers have color coded clipping height combs that snap onto the clipper. Color coded would be an asset for all the clipper sets. Mine are all black, and the size markings are embossed on the combs. It works, but not as easily. You will save the price of these clippers in just a few haircuts. You can do weekly touch ups and keep your family looking very well groomed all the time. Be brave and take the plunge.</li>
            <li> Purchased for the men in the household. Was received promptly and seems to be good quality. Useful for haircuts and beards. They are looking forward to cutting their own hair instead of paying to go to the barber/hair dresser and saving money.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my brother in law. He seems to be really happy with the huge variety of blades!</li>
            <li> Junk!  You should spend your money on a better quality clipper.  The quality of the blades are low ... really low!</li>
            <li> trims great just like at the barber when i was an ugly lil tike. trims every area, even those private areas.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I could clip hair by myself. It is really easy to use. You can benefit from variety of size.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but really seems like a great deal</li>
            <li> Still running strong, feels great in hand, very sturdy build</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; comes with many attachments- a few I&#x27;ll use but whatever is needed is there.&lt;br /&gt;Loved that it has a very practical case so that even the sloppiest person (the other person using this) puts it all back in the case!!! WOWIE WOW WOW...</li>
            <li> Works great, and am able to save a lot of money on husband&#x27;s haircuts. Good instructions inside to help you out and remind you what settings to use for different parts of the head.</li>
            <li> My wife now cuts my hair two times per month.  They work great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Exceeds expectations. Super easy to cut your own hair. Good quality.  Can not beat the price. I can&#x27;t believe I waited until my mid 40s to cut my own hair.  Maybe it is easy b/c I have less hair. None the less, good purchase.</li>
            <li> I have only used it one time as of now and I can say its very good.There are so many options available in terms of the clipper sizes and other accessories provided with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did the job for which I bought this very well.I hope it stays good for my next many cuts in coming months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definetly recommend a BUY on this item from WAHL.&lt;br /&gt;Very Good Build quality, feels heavy, many accessories and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;No danger of cuts or injuries at all (at least in the way I used it or the way it is supposed to be used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Good Buy.</li>
            <li> Very well made! My hair is on the thicker end and it still gives me a nice fade!</li>
            <li> A good piece at very low cost, but its very heavy and vibrates ​harder while using.</li>
            <li> It´s a great hair cut machine, very easy to use, and do a good hair cut. I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Wahl clippers before, so it came as no surprise to me that I loved this one as well. It cuts hair well and includes a lot of guides. In fact, the guides on this clipper attach a lot more solidly than they did on my old one. Admittedly, I pretty much just run the clippers over my head to buzz all my hair off, and only use guides to clean up my eye brows, but that doesn&#x27;t detract from how well these clippers do what they do.</li>
            <li> For the $30 I am so far happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I like:&lt;br /&gt;-it was fun cutting my own hair&lt;br /&gt;-No hassle waiting in shop and waiting for the one or two decent barbers.&lt;br /&gt;-The instructions&lt;br /&gt;-The accessories&lt;br /&gt;-the results&lt;br /&gt;-The case while cheap is functional for now.&lt;br /&gt;-The fact that I don&#x27;t have to spend money for someone to miss hair and not do the job right.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like:&lt;br /&gt;-that smelly  plastic cover that a barber would use to cover a person.  It really stank the house up and I thew it in the backyard to air out.&lt;br /&gt;-The lack of power but it did do the job and at $30 it is hard for me to complain about it.</li>
            <li> An adapter for around right and left ear - Eyebrows - beard. Makes it great for retired and hairy old man keep unsightly hair under control.</li>
            <li> Super quite,  cut really clean, I would give it 10 stars if I could. for the price its a steal.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves beards and hair and does not pull to cause hurt. I had a Remington and it was painful.</li>
            <li> I really love these clippers for doing men hair. I have been working a great clips for 10 plus years. These clippers are just as good the 80 dollars ones I buy without clipper guards. If you looking for good pair clippers for good price buy these ones.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE AND EASY TO USE...</li>
            <li> This thing looks good and it is precise. It is easy to cut my own hair and others hair with this kit.</li>
            <li> i wanted to get the best bargain for my buy and start giving myself haircuts this works well and has everything you need</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but the guards rattle a lot and do not stay on very well. but other then that they work well.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying $20 for hair cuts and bought this.  Its already paid for itself of course and my wife is actually getting real good at using it!</li>
            <li> 5 stars guys!!!!! I should probably knock off half a star because this awesome device showed me my future... I&#x27;m 26 in a relatively high stress environment. I was hoping and praying my luscious thick locks would turn attractively grey over time.... I was WRONG.... Due to my wonderful girlfriend botching my haircut I went for the shortest setting buzz. This is where I noticed that the right side of my head is bald further back than it should be. FML! Instead of getting grey hair I&#x27;m gonna turn into the creepy bald guy.</li>
            <li> This is our third Wahl haircutting system.  We just wear them out over the years, and not just one, more like  10 plus!!  It has many choices, and is just great quality.</li>
            <li> My husband decided to go really short with his hair and loves it. Buying this product he now cuts his own hair and is saving us money every month. Product has already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Got it and works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this to cut my husbands and son&#x27;s hair; to save $$$....it broke the 2nd time we used it...motor just ka-put! super disappointed...</li>
            <li> A great home-grooming system !!</li>
            <li> Great for trimming hair but not for beards! The blades are VERY sharp so don&#x27;t try to use this without a guard or you&#x27;ll get nicks and pink spots on your face :) There are gentler ones for beard trimming and for that I recommend a ConAir model. However, this is the clear winner when it comes to trimming hair and getting the right length. Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face! Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> One of the clips had teeth broken</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazeing. I skimped out and bought a cheap set of clippers don&#x27;t do that 25 bux for these is a steal! These cut great!</li>
            <li> Your hair better be BONE dry before you attempt to use these or you&#x27;ll be cleaning it out every pass (longer cutting teeth would help alleviate this).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok. They are durable and will cut hair without pulling. My only grief with these is they don&#x27;t get quite as close as other clippers I&#x27;ve tried by wahl. I thought I purchased a different set! But that&#x27;s my fault. But to be honest, they get close ENOUGH, and have enough guards to pull off whatever you need them to do. a very solid value.</li>
            <li> Works great. Never pulls. It&#x27;s a great clippers for the price. Although i&#x27;ve never personally used a more expensive one, I don&#x27;t see a need for a better clippers.</li>
            <li> This haircut kit makes for a good trimming machine whether you are looking to trim your hair or facial hair as well. It comes with a variety of trimming clips to adjust the right length you are seeking. Aside this, the trimmer is elegantly constructed of fine materials giving it that sharp look. Before buying this product I heard many people complain about the noise this machine produces, but I can assure you this product makes no less of a noice than any regular trimmer. The only con I can see with this product is that this is more of a trimming kit than haircut kit, but can still be used to cut your hair if you are looking to trim it only and not cut it with scissors. Over all, this is a great product and you won&#x27;t go wrong with it. You will certainly find some use for this machine.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a matter of weeks and already it has stopped working.  I was just finishing up my son&#x27;s second haircut when it suddenly quit.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> These Clippers cut as good as professional clippers that cost hundreds of dollars...Just get these and you will be happy..Over a year and these clippers are still cutting my hair and everyone in da fam just as good as new...Best purchase I ever made!!</li>
            <li> i used it only once and will use it again on sunday, but for using it for the first time, it cuts and trims very well. the operation is smooth, not loud, and the vibration is minimal. i did have the same kit 3 years ago and after dropping it twice, i needed to replace it. the only thing i would point out is do not loose the oil and the brush. those two tools will help last the buzzer for a long time.</li>
            <li> the clippers themselves are good enough,i suppose,but the guards are terribly built!!&lt;br /&gt;they are sharp,and hurt when they snag your skin,[and they will ! &#x27;~&#x27; ],plus,they dont fit tightly enough,and they make so much noise when you try to use the clippers with one of the guards on,that it reminds me of my old pager,set to vibrate,on a glass coffee table,so you have to hold your finger on the guard at all times to keep it quiet,or it will drive you crazy.</li>
            <li> - Full haircut kit, has everything you would need for home haircut needs (check the description to be sure it has everything YOU would want though!)&lt;br /&gt;- Noticed the weight of the Wahl vs the Conair plastic one I had been using for a while. This is a SOLID unit.&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts hair easily and evenly. Very powerful so the slower I went the better results, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same spot 10 times like my cheaper model.&lt;br /&gt;- Attachements are easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Very pleased, I expect this product to last quite a while (and I cut my hair about twice a week using no attachments at all)&lt;br /&gt;- Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat for this unit, I would guess it&#x27;s a few bucks more in a store.</li>
            <li> These clippers powered right through course, curly hair without a problem. I was skeptical whether they would work because of the low price, but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Been using this to cut my and my son&#x27;s hair for over two years now.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for my Pomeranian&#x27;s hair, not for a human&#x27;s hair, and these clippers are amazing!  They perform like professional clippers costing 4-5 times as much money!  The motor does not overheat easily like so many other clippers I&#x27;ve had tends to do.  It&#x27;s quiet so it doesn&#x27;t scare my dog, and everything works well and quickly.  Now that I have a piece that I attach to my deck&#x27;s stairs to attach a double-looped choker to, to hold my dog in place and prevent him from sitting his bottom down, I can get his lion cut done in no time!  I have very sensitive hands thanks to rheumatoid arthritis, and these clippers do not hurt me to use unless I&#x27;m having a real flare, and when that happens, I cannot even hold cotton candy without hurting, so it&#x27;s no reflection on these clippers at all!</li>
            <li> Clippers worked out well and I&#x27;m glad I bought them.  I have just started cutting my own hair and used the self cut system as well</li>
            <li> We decided to stop wasting so much money at in-and-out barbers. I still prefer traditional barbershops but those are hard to come by. So when we are low on cash, my wife uses this to cut my hair. It&#x27;s already paid itself off in just two haircuts.</li>
            <li> I just cut my kid&#x27;s hair with this clipper set. It is not loud. It did not snag. The scissors that come with the kit aren&#x27;t that great. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old clippers that stopped working so well. There are great clippers and cut much better than my old ones did when they were new. it cutting better make my cuts easier and faster. I can quickly do my entire head and not worry about going over the same spot so many times.</li>
            <li> I am happy my purchase, excellent product, and satisfies my job, my order arrived on time and in perfect condition! many very happy thanks</li>
            <li> Defective... pulled hair out vs cutting. Returned</li>
            <li> This replaces a cordless clipper kit I got also in the Wahl brand. This has a beefy feel to it compared to most other corded clippers I have used in the past. Such as the Conair brand where the entire plastic body broke leaving the motor exposed. The only one that we have that comes close to being a well made clipper would be the old worn out 1960&#x27;s model year Oster brand that was truly made in USA. This Wahl clipper also says it&#x27;s made in USA which is a big plus. It cuts fine hair with ease and without clogging. So far I am satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Cut my hair the day it came. Worked perfectly. Looks great. Way quieter than my conair.</li>
            <li> Love it. Cut through like a hot knife on butter. I used it twice and every dollars have already paid back.</li>
            <li> Worth your money many times over.... 2 haircuts with this will break even.... Then it&#x27;s money in the bank every time you are using this for cutting hair vs paying it at the local barbershop.....&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy &amp; slightly on the heavier side but that gives it a solid feel.  Cutting hair is a cinch with the numbered clipper combs.</li>
            <li> There is another set by the same maker with an additional trimmer clipper for the same price at COSTCO.  Better buy.</li>
            <li> very good deserves this prise.</li>
            <li> excellent seller recommend</li>
            <li> My grandson loves his gift.  It gives him a smooth and easy cut/shave</li>
            <li> Great piece of equipment. Product name should be Plastic Pro, however. Was so disappointed that the large &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; piece was thin, hollow plastic. If you couldn&#x27;t do metal at this price, at least use a more solid and quality plastic. And don&#x27;t call it chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still 4 stars because the internals and blade are perfection.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting my hair cut by a stylist at $50 per month.  She suggested that I just get a clipper and have my girl friend do my hair.  I did that and the first haircut more than paid for this clipper.</li>
            <li> I used a rechargeable Remington trimmer for a few years to trim my hair, this was a fantastic upgrade</li>
            <li> My husband uses this often and loves the ease of using it. Good quality for the price. Recommended.</li>
            <li> The designers for this did a piss-poor job in designing a blade that does not clog immediately.  I tried to trim my lab with this and it kept jamming with hair every stroke!</li>
            <li> Great price, cuts well, but the unit itself feels a little ... cheap? I guess it is cheap (!) but the device rattles when turned on unless you grip it really tight. Oh and, be careful with the clipper attachments, they also feel rather malleable!  A trivial complaint it would seem but it does make me wonder as to this clipper&#x27;s longevity... All in all, pretty satisfied though.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> I got so tired of battery powered clippers that can&#x27;t hold a charge. These work perfect for pretty much any use. They&#x27;re a bit bulky if you want to do facial trimming but can get the job done.  They&#x27;re also heavier than I expected but I think that is a good thing. Better materials and high quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just me, but the Wahl line of clippers tends to confuse me.  Sometimes I literally cannot figure out what the difference is between certain models, but I selected these over the Home Pro model because with the Amazon coupon there was only a 4 dollar difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I&#x27;m concerned the Chrome Pro clippers work like a charm.  I have pretty thick hair, and these cut through it like butter.  No jamming, or hair pulling, or bogging down of the clippers.  They aren&#x27;t the quietest clippers I&#x27;m sure, but they aren&#x27;t loud enough that I would complain or make a big deal about it... even my 5 year old didn&#x27;t seem to mind them buzzing around his ears.  They seem a bit heavy, and I am pretty sure the \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; cover is painted plastic.. but its the internal components that I am concerned about.. not the cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dig the scissors, probably will never use the cheap feeling apron, don&#x27;t have much of a need for more than 3 of the guides, and feel that the combs are decent quality.  Overall, I am very happy with this product for the price I paid.  The price went up about 10 bucks over night though, which is a bummer.. but I am excited that I got my purchase in as I don&#x27;t feel they are quite worth the new higher price.</li>
            <li> Great product powerful and sharp , a good selection of tools , a little Heavy , but well built my third set of clippers and by far the best .</li>
            <li> Bought it July 22 and use it every week or so. Does a great job trimming my hair. My freind came over and used it also when he saw the great job it did on my hair. Thinking about charging him next time. J/K! Good machine and worth it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much was included with the product.  It was all put in a nice box that makes it easy to store.  I powered up the clippers and yeow, what a noise.  They were so loud that you could probably hear them 2 houses away.  I was close to returning them but thought I would do a little searching on Google first. It turns out there is an adjustment screw on the side to limit the power or travel (not sure which) of the blades.  I backed it off about 1/4 turn and they now sound like normal clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cut cleanly without any pulling and the wide variety of guides makes a haircut a breeze.  I did not find the guides flimsy as others mentioned in the reviews.  I don&#x27;t see why they need to be any heavier.  The included apron is marginally effective, I have fine hair it is stuck to the apron like glue so storing it sans hair is rather difficult.  They included scissors but are pretty cheap, of course a good pair would cost more than the whole kit so what do you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the unit should have been adjusted at the factory and there was nothing specific in the literature about what to do if the clippers are loud. I took a star off for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a great value and works for cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li> This kit has great instructions and many pieces for different lengths. Easy to use by amatuers like myself, easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to cut hair at home.</li>
            <li> My Roommate and I invested in these to save money on haircuts in college and these have been awesome! So these make a great gift for college kids!&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use and come with many attachments as pictures! It comes with a haircut apron thing that you are supposed to wear and that wasnt the highest quality so we got rid of the apron, but no complaints on the actual clippers! They cut very even and the chrome looks pretty cool and we get compliments on it!</li>
            <li> HOLY COW I AM IMPRESSED. This replaced and old one of a different brand. This cutter is like a hot knife going through butter. It is impressive how much of a higher quality cut this unit provides. HIGHLY recommend. Good clip on pieces, too.</li>
            <li> you can buy with your eyes closed, the model is nice, came in the allotted time, I have no problems. recommended</li>
            <li> This product works great and is easy to uae.  My wife used #3,4,5 to cut my hair twice and it looked professionally done.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The razor is very powerful and many hair length selections provided, all the stuff inside are of great quality. But it is very easy to cut your hair shorter than you want, be careful.</li>
            <li> Decided to quit paying a barber and buy one of these instead.  I no longer try to style my hair and became content with the idea of doing a buzz-cut.  Kit comes with many different attachments and gives many options.  My wife cuts my hair in about 5 minutes, so cheaper and faster than a trip to the barber.  Only used it 3 times so far, not sure how long it will last.  Don&#x27;t really care as it has paid for itself after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has all the pieces you need for home use. Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Product was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> This is great for cutting my own hair and my friends hair as well. Definitely worth the money. A+ product!</li>
            <li> I usually went to super cuts every few months and sometimes (like the summer) I just had her give me a buzz cut. But at around $14 a pop, with the tip I can use this twice and it&#x27;s paid for. It&#x27;s quiet, works very well and I can use it for my beard too.</li>
            <li> I like that there are instructions with this haircut kit.  I&#x27;ve used it on both my husband and my son--and they were both happy.  It is saving us money!!</li>
            <li> Losing your hair? Sick of the barber trying to sell you hair thickening products? DO you have a fur sweater?  If you answered yes to any of these, then these are for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great machine, not too loud.</li>
            <li> We have just used this once, but it felt nice in my hand and cut great!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product it more than I had expected I had looked at the same thing in Walmart and got this for less money</li>
            <li> Great clippers .. They do the trick for a great price.. Paid for themselves</li>
            <li> We had a cheap haircut kit that we bought at Walmart and it didn&#x27;t last very long.  We bought this kit at a great sale price on Amazon and it works great and seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer to replace another Wahl that I&#x27;d had for 20years &amp; my expectations are high for this trimmer!  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 trims so far on my husband &amp; son &amp; it&#x27;s met all our needs.  Quiet, solid trimmer with more guides than you&#x27;ll ever need!  Fast shipping via Prime &amp; packaged securely.</li>
            <li> Still fairly new but it works great so far. Much better than the older version I replaced it with and a lot less noisy.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair very well was very excited about the outcome and many different options to cutting hair overall good quality</li>
            <li> This was a gift and it&#x27;s a fantastic set and a great price and quality. I&#x27;m sure he will get several years of use out of it. We&#x27;ve gone through quite a few clipper sets but this one is of much better quality. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> High quality. Beyond my expectations. Everything that I could imagine needing (even wanting) with hair clippers. Doesn&#x27;t hurt when cutting and doesn&#x27;t slow down for anything. Feels sturdy. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The clippers work well and have a solid feel. The attachments make trimming easy, especially the ones for tapering. This item will pay for itself in two months.</li>
            <li> Usually, Amazon does an excellent job of shipping. I received this product in a box with no padding or packaging. Just the razor in its own packaging, which was not enough to protect it well, banging around when I picked up the box. Also the receipt in the box was ripped in half and not complete. This was supposed to be a Valentine&#x27;s gift for my boyfriend, so I didn&#x27;t want to open it up to see if it was damaged. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> All the parts appear to be of good quality, buzzer works great so far. Very happy with all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review after some use.</li>
            <li> It helped me a lot to get my hair cut at home. Gave the same perfection as I get from a professional barber. Nice item as described.</li>
            <li> This was my first time attempting to cut my own hair. After reading the tips cutting my own hair was very simple along with a handheld mirror. Im also really happy with the way it looks. The device itself is solid and weighted nicely. Comes with plenty of attachments and extras. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Love it. Super strong motor, easy to use and will help me avoid having to go to the salon to touch up my undercut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cape and accessories that come extra are cheap. But the clips and the actually clippers are great.</li>
            <li> loved it looks amazing and works smoothly!&lt;br /&gt;has everything a barber has scissor,clips,and etc xD</li>
            <li> For the price it is an effective hair trimmer.  The guides provide an range of length cuts up to 1 inch.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a clean cut, you have to keep going over the same spot a few times. The last wahl I bought it did the same thing that was 25 yrs. ago. Some things never change.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, I would buy it again</li>
            <li> i am very happy for the price and very good quality</li>
            <li> In general, Wahl products are disappointing and survive, IMHO, based on price point.  My Wahl ceased to hold a charge after 3-4 months.  Now it is no longer cordless.  Quite disappointing.  The cutters also are mediocre.  Anybody have any quality alternative?</li>
            <li> These seem to be very low quality!  They get way too hot to even hold. I bought these because the blades on my old ones seemed to be dulling but the blades on these seem to be just as dull as the old ones. They are even made by the same company. I&#x27;ll be moving on to a different company for my next ones.</li>
            <li> This clipper is barbershop quality. You couldn&#x27;t get this high of quality for this low of a price when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them to cut my own hair and I would buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low star reviews are posted by people who either did not realize you need to oil clippers to maintain their quality or had problems with shipping (and shouldn&#x27;t be posting on product reviews about it).</li>
            <li> I bought this item on a Sunday, and it arrived Monday (In California) this seller definitely did a superb job on the shipping speed action and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier!, thank you!, please keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On terms of the item&#x27;s functionality, I love it, I used it for a hair cut that was kind of long on a male, and it worked flawlessly, no hair pulling, not sticking of any kind, it was so easy to use and had no problems whatsoever. I can&#x27;t say enough of it, just buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S make sure you buy this from the seller that I bought it from, they will take care of you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I had an el cheapo unit for about 5 years until I finally decided to get a decent unit. This thing cuts hair like no one&#x27;s business! Can&#x27;t believe I was so cheap for so long :( No problems or issues at all. The manual states what to do if you have noise issues like some have written about.</li>
            <li> It works great and trims perfectly ..14 more word required is stupid and not needed to  make a good review</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s been cutting my hair at home for years now and we recently replaced our tired old set of clippers with this new kit. The motor is nice and smooth, the clippers cut cleanly, and all the attachments you could ask for are included. If you&#x27;re serious about home hair cutting, I&#x27;d suggest you add a nice pair of professional grade scissors and a few nice combs to this kit as the included pair are rather cheap. But if you&#x27;re looking for a good set of clippers, look no further.</li>
            <li> Used for approximately 2 months, only twice a week, and it no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor still works, but the blade has ceased to move back-and-forth.  Wanted to return but had to include some original packaging I no longer had.  Also, they would not refund shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful product and experience, will not be buying from Wahl again.</li>
            <li> I got this because i wanted to start cutting my husband&#x27;s hair, okay this thing has everything you wish you had; i didn know it came with clippers and blade oil and everything, you cant find anything better than that for the price!</li>
            <li> Bought these based on other reviews. For the price, absolutely wonderful. I&#x27;ve used it twice and cuts like butter. The attachments and instructions are easy to use and understand. But the included shears and cape leave a little to be desired. I&#x27;ll end up purchasing a better set of shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way the attachments fit. Didn&#x27;t do a very good job of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> THis thing here can cut some hair.  The other day I snuck up on both my mother and sister and gave them a trim.  WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  I expect this to hold up for a long time.    Update: A few months in and it&#x27;s been a hassle-free purchase.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, sturdy, long lasting do it yourself kit for your monthly grooming needs, this is just what you need. I&#x27;ve been using it for over six months and the experience so far has been consistently good.</li>
            <li> Good product works well. Included accessories appropriate</li>
            <li> Feel heavy duty. better than the light plastic models.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted his hair all shaved off and these do the job.  They are so easy to use, and so far, don&#x27;t get too hot to hold onto, like so many of the older ones did.  I will enjoy using them for many years, as they seem to be quality made.  My husband could even shave his hair himself if he wanted to, they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I continue to use these a year later. Never had an issue, it continues to live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product delivery very very good, thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and every time he uses it he tells me how much he loves it!</li>
            <li> Muy buena vaidad de peines y de calidad, la maquina tiene un corte exacto y preciso, excelente para esos cortes de cabello que requieren buenos acabados.</li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like about this are the combs.  Something about these combs they are hard to grasp hair easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use Wahls reputation is earned.  A real money saver too!  Going to the barber costs a lotta money, but with the Wahl it&#x27;s an easy at home solution.</li>
            <li> Will never have to pay for a haircut that I don&#x27;t even like again!  Very happy I made the bold decision to purchase this. Love the product and it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Had these for about 2 years now, never a problem. Just make sure you keep the clippers clean and oiled, and you&#x27;re golden. never an ounce of resistance, always a very crisp and very even cut.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only used it twice now (how often do you really need a haircut?), but it works great!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this product to cut my hair. It does not give me a very close shave when I want the hair on my head to be very short. The blade does not seem to be very sharp when I try to use it.</li>
            <li> This product worked seamlessly with my first haircut, at this point I&#x27;m very satisfied. Just gave myself a 4-8 buzz and the product included hair cutting instructions that were very helpful.  For the price, this is a great offer.</li>
            <li> All the attachments you ever need and a comfortable hair cut. Highly recommend it and saves me a ton of money every month.</li>
            <li> I had this product for at least 4 years.  I used it to cut my own hair over the years and it has worked great.  I&#x27;m here shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> I have used it 4 times, and is working great so far. I have got my money&#x27;s worth already :)</li>
            <li> This set is really nice!! So much better than last Wahl we bought. Last one didn&#x27;t work when we got it, but probably would not have lasted if it did!!&lt;br /&gt;This one is the one you buy to last for years to come. Its a heavy duty well made set, with all the attachments you could need.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast as well. It came 2 days sooner than we were expecting it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i purchased this (the old one died out probably about 6-7 months in, it got rusty because it got wet) Thats the only complaint i have with these clippers is that if you get them wet they can rust really easily! But if you keep them dry or dry them off right after you use them they will last a long time! They&#x27;ve saved me literally hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to have a trimmer in the house, instead of taking my son to the barber. I don&#x27;t know if they clean the clippers very well and don&#x27;t want him exposed to ring worm, etc. Besides, I do a nice job cutting his hair and wanted to replace the Wahl clippers I misplaced a few months back. I like the fact it comes in it&#x27;s own case; has instructions on cutting hair properly; it has a bunch of guide combs; scissors; cutting cape; 2 black combs; a small brush and oil for cleaning and maintaining the clippers. The clippers are a nice hefty size but they&#x27;re comfortable and I had no problem holding them and cutting with them. The blades are sharp, so I took my time cutting the hair to avoid pinches or discomfort. I was able to cut my son&#x27;s hair in a very low haircut and shaped  the lines around his head, nicely. The sound isn&#x27;t loud or bothersome. If I wanted to bald my son&#x27;s head, these clippers would do the job. It does a nice job cutting hair and I&#x27;m very pleased about that. But the case and all the extras in this kit makes it a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and reliable source. Works perfect and does the job. I would recommend this product anybody looking for cheap clippers with great quality.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like my hair is going to be long any time soon, more due to genetics than these clippers, but this set is perfect for keeping groomed. Sturdy, powerful clippers with a selection of guards, scissors, combs and other accessories. It&#x27;s got everything a guy could need to keep his head in shape.</li>
            <li> We ordered this item because of the great price and good reviews. Pleased with it so far. I have cut my hair once and use it to trim my beard stubble every week or so. It works very nicely for both. I don&#x27;t find it to be especially loud or heavy, contrary to what some reviewers said. Goes through my head hair VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> Works at desired.  We use this to avoid paying for buzz cuts that my wife can now do just a proficiently as a barber</li>
            <li> Bought this to groom my hairball of a cat. When it arrived I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it is for the money...and it comes with everything you need from blade oil to a smock!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Wow- bought this 3 years ago and forgot to leave a review. I have been using it atleast monthly since then. It cost me about $28 at the time, and has saved me tons of money on haircuts. Is very high powered and can cut through thick hair (I have very coarse hair)- it buzz&#x27;s right through that stuff.</li>
            <li> Am up in years and was getting tired of paying some one to cut my hair. Got a good deal on this unit and after 2 hair cuts it has paid for itself . Don&#x27;t want to put Barbers out of business. But you got to save where you can.</li>
            <li> Love how it came with so many accessories and different sized clips. This was definitely worth the price. I have recommended this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I needed my own clippers and have used Wahl before, great choice! Recommend for those that want the freedom of their own haircut</li>
            <li> i  like  itn  and it cuts hair very good  and close and  clean  and it comes with every thing  you  need</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty and have used them for quite some time now. They have done a good job and I would recommend to my barber if I had one any more! Use for beard and hair and they have about any attachment for anything else you could ever want.</li>
            <li> I generally just sport a buzzcut so paying $30 a month to a barber to buzz my hair with clippers doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense. Enter this kit - it&#x27;s pretty easy to use and does the job. I may not look like Brad Pitt, but it lets me do what the barber does and the whole kit costs less than a haircut. Works for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good little haircutter, but not amazing. it is heavy and bulky, and is not cordless (we should&#x27;ve paid more attention before buying it). It doesn&#x27;t work really well either...our cheap one from walmart works a lot better and is cordless.</li>
            <li> Had an Uber-sturdy Oster clipper for about 15 years until it burned out.  Tried to replace it with a Remington that sucked, and finally found the Oster&#x27;s match with this Wahl.  Great quality, feels sturdy.  Sharp blades...I can see this clipper lasting me 15 years like the Oster did.</li>
            <li> I must have recieved a defective product, because it doesn&#x27;t cut.  Worst product I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.  Spend more money and get a better one that does what it&#x27;s made to do, this one went right in the trash can where it belongs.</li>
            <li> Works as well as expected. Nothing special but is great for what it is. Would reccomend it to any one</li>
            <li> I have my daughter trim me up.&lt;br /&gt;I would do it myself, but I am limited in my ability to perceive my entire head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think She and the clippers do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Especially compared to the way I cut anything, after having a few drinks too many!</li>
            <li> My husband loved it. Item was as described. He is now groomed perfectly. Works well for hair trimming and beard maintenance.</li>
            <li> We needed a new razor for my husband and my sons haircuts. I did a lot of research and decided this was the best deal with the best reviews. I&#x27;m glad we got it. It&#x27;s easy to hold with the grip, it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, and with all the comb choices you can create the haircut you want. Plus on amazon this was 20$ cheaper than any other retailer!!! It also has a handy case. It&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
            <li> The clippers themselves work great. I am giving it low stars because every single guider was broken into pieces when I received it.</li>
            <li> Have had these clippers for a few months now and still just as sharp as day one,great product highly recommended</li>
            <li> My husband used it only a few times and the motor stopped working. Not worth repairing so had to buy a different model,</li>
            <li> This is the best hair kit for the price...ever! We love this and are already saving money by&lt;br /&gt; not having to go the salon!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works as described but they need a lot of maintenance. Clean the clipper blades after every use, and oil them when they get noisy. You have to brush the blades a lot while using. The weight is mostly near the blades and the tapering down the handle makes it awkward to grip sometimes. If the weight of the clippers were more evenly disbursed, they would be easier to handle for at-home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34;, because the price was great at time of purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. Its easy to use and worked perfectly. I liked that it came with lots of attachments and it gave a really clean cut.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use for my son&#x27;s haircut.</li>
            <li> I can now cut my own hair without paying a barber $ 15 or $20 dollars to do it. Now of course the end result is a far less quality cut. And I do mean far less. But practice makes perfect and I&#x27;m getting better at. If you enjoy things like stepping outside in public wait a few days after cutting your own hair. Cause how you see your hair in the mirror under a 60 watt light bulb is infinite difference how it looks under the beams of sunlight trust me. It&#x27;s like every flaw is magnified a 100 fold. Save yourself the embarrassment. But the clippers themselves are on point. Not too noisey cuts smooth and comes with a lot of guards for various hair lengths. My advice don&#x27;t cut hair without guard if you&#x27;re not a professional. Will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> All was perfect............Thank you for your answear&#x27;s time. the cut machine is very very good...One more time Thank you and see you</li>
            <li> Works but OMG is it loud!!!!!!!!! Bought this giving the product benefit of the doubt, but it is SUPER LOUD!. I may need earplugs to use this! Also pulls a bit.</li>
            <li> Has a nice hard case but its all just thrown in the case.</li>
            <li> These have worked great. We use them to buzz my husband and oldest son and they are holding up. My son has hear that is very think and course so we needed something good.</li>
            <li> This clipper is built very sturdy and came with a bunch of different sizes for cutting hair. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a clipper on a budget.</li>
            <li> Works great, just what we were looking for in a hair clippers.</li>
            <li> I have had this clipper for just under 2 months and it has failed! The clipper will cut on and off by itself and if it does this while you are trying to cut hair it can be a bit painful. I would not recommend this product to anyone. So, Amazon will not take this back and if I want to get it fixed I will have to pay for the shipping to the manufacturer and the return postage which is about $5 short of the original cost. What a junk product!!</li>
            <li> This is very high quality and works so well. My husband loves it and so do I... his hair looks great!</li>
            <li> Just received this biotch today. Chopped my mullet off. Old lady was happy. Wahl makes gr8 stuff. Always have. Had one one on active duty lost to an ex wife. If they are made in the Usa then hellyeah. USA USA USA!.</li>
            <li> This clipper set rocks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off let me clear the air on some confusion. Yes, this comes with a cape. The cape is made from a very thin plastic, much like a trash can liner. After one use of the cape I threw it out because alot of the hair was stuck to it. I was not going to try and clean it or shake it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With free shipping I have already got my money back. I have had 2 hair cuts from my wife. My wife who has ZERO hair cutting experience was able to open this package and follow the instructions with ease.She had a little issue with the side burns but she later watched a video online and now she gives me hair cuts just like Supercuts did, but It doesnt cost me $20 with tip anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one little thing I wish is that it had a longer cord. I am not sure how long this one is, maybe 5 feet? but I just wish it was like 10 or 15 feet. Other than that, you have absolutely every single blade type you could ever dream of in this case.</li>
            <li> It ran twice only and they don&#x27;t accept devolution!</li>
            <li> The actual clippers work nicely but it&#x27;s not worth what I paid for this set. For example, the cape is so flimsy that you&#x27;d think it could be a garbage bag. I&#x27;ve bought better Wahl kits in the past.</li>
            <li> Good shipping :D thanks the machine is beutifull</li>
            <li> Bought this and works great.....recommend this one</li>
            <li> Great clippers even came with the new .5 guard</li>
            <li> I got it a few days ago, and so far it has work great, the way it cuts everything its good!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, cut hair fast.  Motor is nothing like the older one&#x27;s, this one has power and cuts&lt;br /&gt;hair, no matter how dense, with no problems.  Remember, it does not come with the smaller detailing trimmer.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, thought its a dual power.</li>
            <li> In a way, a 3 is not fair. It&#x27;s a quality product. It&#x27;s just too big and too heavy for how I use it. I cut my own hair, so being light and maneuverable is a big plus. I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the durability of a couple of the battery trimmers, but I do love how light and maneuverable they are. I can&#x27;t seem to give this one a 4, but if it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, you&#x27;ll probably give it a 5. Shipping and all of that stuff was good. No problems.</li>
            <li> In use and very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I wanted a set that would just run straight through without jamming or pulling hair. Well these things are awesome! Great set, comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Well built, sturdy, no shortage of attachments, arrived on time. Wish I had ordered it earlier.</li>
            <li> It exceeds my expectation.  Awesome piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I have used them once only and they worked very well.  I hope these last awhile as I am tired or replacing hair cutting razors.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very effective and not too loud.</li>
            <li> Seems to work all right.  After a handful of uses I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Very good clipper with an abundance of accessories.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t follow any of the instructions that came with it but cutting my friend&#x27;s hair turned out great. Using only the supplies it came with (comb, scissors and clippers) I got excellent results.</li>
            <li> Yup, just got it today.  72 hours after I ordered it!  FREE super saver shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the product;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve just used it today...I cut all my hair to one quarter inch--I&#x27;m going with that style nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sofar, it runs quiet.  Does the job.  No pulling.  The main cutter seems to be made of metal instead of plastiic.  Lots of extra accessories.  This is about all there is to say right now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the one star reviews...if something like that happens I&#x27;ll drop back here and change my review.  For now--everything is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See Yea!</li>
            <li> A Great Clipper! It is well made, and works perfectly! I highly recommend it, and the price makes it a real bargain!</li>
            <li> everything about this Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit is amazing. clippers work really good .I purchased this because I want to shave my head at least once every two weeks, I want well shaved completely and this one works well on me. the NOT fun part is.. my girlfriend don&#x27;t want my head shaved. So this ended up sitting in our closet. hoping one day to use it again for shaving my head. I love this clippers but I love my girlfriend the most.lol..</li>
            <li> The on-off switch has way too much resistance, and it randomly turns off during use unless I hold the switch in a certain way which makes using it that much more cumbersome. Also, it sometimes gets incredibly noisy and shakes, even when the clipper head is oiled and completely free of hair. The outside feels sturdy but the inside is delicate as a flower. Maybe the fact that I had to press the on-off switch with both hands to get it to go put some strain on the inner components that made it behave that way. It&#x27;s possible I got a dud, but this thing was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great for beard trimming, durable and have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and is exactly what I was expecting. Also works very well.</li>
            <li> Use it for college and works great comes with all the clipping lengths just sucks it doesnt have sideburn trimmers but those arent expensive</li>
            <li> ...a bit too heavy...  and loud !</li>
            <li> Pro: -The price -Some useful attachments -Durable storage case -Adjustable blade (zero gap can be done) -A T-Blade can be use to replace the blade -Cutting my hair a #3 all around and then getting a line-up/shape-up from my barber does save me some money. :)  Con: -It was loud, at first. To fix the problem TURN OFF the clipper and turn the power screw clockwise until it stops. Don&#x27;t force the plastic screw too much or else you may break the plastic screw. Then, turn it on and turn the plastic screw counter-clockwise until the noise is reduce. This definitely helped me. Now it sounds like a hair clipper from a barbershop.  By the way, the power screw moves the white plastic underneath the blade. Turning the power screw too much counter-clockwise can misaligned the blades. Check out this video for an idea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;R7QdJ2QLpy4  Durability is questionable. I wouldn&#x27;t use this, if I were a barber.</li>
            <li> great but a co worker found this set for even less at bed bath beyond</li>
            <li> I dont even wont these product for free. Send something good.</li>
            <li> When my old Conair died, which I&#x27;ve had for 20 years, I purchased another at Walmart. Garbage, as were all the others sold in retail stores.  When I received this, I loved it so much that I purchased a spare.</li>
            <li> I just received this item, tried it for the first time - its so noisy that really too much ! the noise it makes is really too high to bear !&lt;br /&gt;on contrast i own the WAHL GROOM PRO, it is very silent and no noise !&lt;br /&gt;The WAHL 79524 - 2501 is really big dissapointment !</li>
            <li> Quiet and smooth, lots of extras</li>
            <li> Worst piece of thing you can ever buy...Worked the first time &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;...Complete dud the second time use...started making loud noise.  Holding on to the thing hurts my hand...Would not recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Wahl clippers over 25 years ago and they are still working flawlessly (though I had to add some electrical tape to the cord after years of overflexing).  The blade is still sharp and still gives a flawless cut.  Only one guard needed replacement in that time frame (#1 guard) since it was used everytime.  I bought the new set for myself, but decided to give it to my son who was headed to college.  It&#x27;s working great for him and may end up being a source of income for him.  I just bought a similar set from Costco, but still Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be stupid for me to buy anything else. . .</li>
            <li> I have been very surprised as how well these clippers have lasted. I learned how to cut my own hair and now I save myself a load of money!  Update: I&#x27;ve just realized how much money these clippers have saved me and they definitely payed themselves off. I did the math and after owning these clippers for two years now, I have been able to save $960 not including what I tip out to the barbers. And I have learned how to fade my own hair.</li>
            <li> When my boyfriend or roommate need a trim, I use this. Works great and love the long cord. The kit comes with everything!</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy to get these professional clippers for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 5 kids and myself with expected results. I used to use a cordless one but the corded provides constant power and is not a hinderance. The attachments and plastic cloth provided are great. I use it all and my kids love it. I am finally the barber I always wants to be!</li>
            <li> Just threw it away.  Didn&#x27;t last 6 months, and was poor from the beginning.  This is the second I&#x27;ve bought since 2012.  The first one actually worked quite well, which is why I ordered a second one, when the original was dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one, or if they&#x27;ve changed what these are made out of, but this motor never seemed right.  It seemed about half as strong as the first one, could barely cut through hair after 2 months, and by the end was pulling hair out of my beard.</li>
            <li> Perfect, my wife cuts my hair at home and paid for it with two haircuts.</li>
            <li> Works really well and comes with almost everything you would need. The one thing it doesn&#x27;t have is a little spray bottle for water. The other thing that I wish it would have had is an organized container for all the pieces it comes with. It comes in a box with no pockets to keep things organized in. Other than that, the actual product works really well!</li>
            <li> My stylist wife has owned a set of these clippers since we were married almost ten years ago.  She liked these even better than her nice salon set that had broken.  She determined that these were finally getting dull, so I decided to buy her the same pair again as a gift -- since they&#x27;ve lasted so long, and are quite inexpensive.  Here&#x27;s the catch (which I think is actually a good thing), once she had her new set, I took the old, dull clippers apart and figured I&#x27;d try sharpening them myself.  Since they had been decommissioned, it wouldn&#x27;t matter if it didn&#x27;t work out too well.  I followed some online instructions to carefully lap the blades on a nice, flat honing stone, and then oiled and put them back together.  The blades&#x27; faces now had almost a mirror polish on them -- rather than the factory finish that showed some machine marks.  I have some experience with metal work, so I&#x27;m not saying I just plunked them on my DIY workbench and did the job, but it really wasn&#x27;t hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the old, sharpened clippers work better than the new ones I just bought.  They&#x27;re so quiet, and cut really well.  My wife refuses to use the new set until I pull them apart and sharpen the blades the same way.  I&#x27;m impressed that a set of clippers that is frankly quite inexpensive was actually serviceable.  I&#x27;m an even bigger fan now, although I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever need to buy another set in my life.</li>
            <li> my first clipper had some problems with scissors part and noise, but after complaining amazon sent me the new one with one day free shipping&lt;br /&gt;It seems, clipper is powerful, but this five star is for customer service,- yesterday night I complained and today the replacement has already been delivered</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought 3 sets of this, each broken down after 2 month.  I will never buy Wahl product ever again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this if you live or are going to use this product in Australia. our electricity will fry this thing in minutes!!</li>
            <li> My usual hair cut at a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; place was around 10 bucks or so every month.  After getting this I was able stop going to the barbershop, and save  that 10 bucks or so month..  quick math 10*12 &#x3D; 120 a year.  After 2 years, I&#x27;ve saved 240 bucks by not going to the barber to get a haircut I don&#x27;t even like.  Simply said, every one needs one of these things.  Lets all put the barber out of business..</li>
            <li> I didnt want to spend too much money on new clippers and These clippers were priced very well.....unfortunately that&#x27;s about the only thing that&#x27;s good about them. Out of the box the clippers look nice and feel light and comfortable. However, the power cord seems to be made of a smaller diameter cord than my previous Wahl clippers and it almost looks like it doesn&#x27;t belong. IT LOOKS CHEAP.. Also, even though the clippers look nice and feel comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t carry over into the actual job they are meant to do. My hair is always VERY SHORT, like buzzed bald short.  I buzz my head once a week and decided to use these clippers on Friday nite after work. THESE CLIPPERS ARE BAD. My short hair had patches and looked uneven. After about 20min. the clippers started getting warm and weren&#x27;t really doing much so I gave up and got out my old clippers to finish the job.....YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR...and I definelty wouldn&#x27;t pay for these again. the only reason I gave it two stars is because it arrived on time and in new condition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my hair buzzed with a #2 guard for the past year.  I finally got tired of paying a barber $20 to do something so simple.  After a little online research I found that most people said Wahl makes the best clippers.  So I bought this kit and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  Don&#x27;t expect some cheap, made in China, piece of light weight plastic with an under powered motor.  This thing is heavy, powerful and feels built to last.  At first I was kind of nervous, but once I started cutting I realized it&#x27;s almost impossible to mess up.  My first time cutting my own hair looked just as good as when the barber did it.  It&#x27;s already paid itself off and then some.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Definitely professional heavy duty grade clipper...looks and feels like what the barber uses.  Numerous attachments fit about any hair situation.  Takes some practice, take it slow.  Two haircuts and it is paid for.</li>
            <li> Wahl has no equal when it comes to trimmers!! They are reliable, professional tools. Well made and precise. Love this product&lt;br /&gt;and the case it came in. Thanks Wahl !!</li>
            <li> The only reason it got 4 instead of 5 is that it did not come with a 1 &amp; 1/2 guide which is what length i usually cut my hair.</li>
            <li> Totally smart buy.  Pays for itself, good for cutting your own hair or having someone do it for you.  It isn&#x27;t cheaply made.  My wife accidentally shaved off too much, yep...it works.</li>
            <li> it was loud as a vibrator, and started to smoke, and almsot didn&#x27;t cut anything (and i have a japanese hair)</li>
            <li> Good quality clippers especially foe the price</li>
            <li> Perfect kit, bought for husband, he loves it!</li>
            <li> Received this package with some damage ~ The box itself that holds the razor and all its accessories is not intact, and some of the attachments broke, but I&#x27;m not really upset since the only ones I intend to use are intact and the razor itself works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and effective. Definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Great product- use it for my regular free haircut (by my wife); does a good job and is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! Had my last one for almost 20 years! This one is even better! Love it and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wielded by confident hands, this capable piece of machinery is equally adept should you decide to point it north or due south. Feeling a bit daffy? Then you&#x27;re in for a wild ride. The choice is yours. From one handsome man to another - this thing will help keep you that way while keeping your shekels right where they belong: riding safely on your hip. *not for domesticated animals or livestock.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.  Quietest shaver with a lot of attachments.  Made in USA...even better.</li>
            <li> I had my last set of wahl clippers for 7 years and never had to oil the blades, and they only broke because I dropped them on tile.  They saved me over $1,000 on hair cuts.  Here&#x27;s hoping these last as long.</li>
            <li> really great combo! haha</li>
            <li> Excellent kit, has everything you need. I bough these to make the transition to cutting my own hair and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions.. cant go wrong..  shaves very well.. even cut.. has already paid for itself .. yaaaay..lol..nice and solid construction.. made in the USA</li>
            <li> This set is great. Exactly what I needed. Works perfectly. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this. I looked around and this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Wahl Chrome Pro 24 piece haircut kit and am very pleased.  Comfortable to hold and easy to control.  Offers good cutting edges, accurate and precise.  Would recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Very Happy Customer. I am actually able to cut my own hair. Not tugging or pulling of the hair. I use it to keep my beard at 3/8&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works great, feels good while holding it, very precise and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using mine for a whole year and it still works perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It works easily and fast. It cuts completely, so there&#x27;s no need for repeated strokes. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great for the price, it&#x27;s really about an 18 piece set... about 6 of the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; items are useless... What kind of guy uses a buzzer and needs two hair clips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts hair, has a few snags, does not work on facial hair too well, and is much larger than what I had first expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an old (5yrs) Wahl facial trimmer that has some rust and still works great for the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s great for its price, if you want no snags, then buy those $150 buzzers.</li>
            <li> The clippers do the job they are made to do. However they do feel like they are cheaply made. If you hold them &#x27;wrong&#x27; they make a lot of noise with the insides grinding against something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several pairs of hair trimmers but these are well-made and built to last!  Cutting hair at homes saves a lot of money and these clippers will likely pay for themselves, only after a couple of haircuts.  Check here for more videos and photos that I have posted http://goo.gl/xuUikP .  These clippers come in a nice hard plastic storage case and include a variety of guards, brushes, scissors, etc.  I felt that it was a good deal and would definitely buy again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for 45 years.  Think of all the money I have saved.  The clippers we have used were at least that old and about worn out.  I figured I could use some of that money I saved to buy my wife a new set of clippers.  She is pleased with them and so I am pleased with them.  They are quite versatile and have several attachments, but the scissors and comb that come with it are worthless.</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair cut but in between hair cuts, I usually trim the sides and back of my hair. This device is excellent for trimming hair. Perfect for someone who wants to buzz or shave their head.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer. Quiet and gives a clean cut. Quality feel. Would definitely recimmend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Way more attachments than I will ever need.</li>
            <li> I feel like a home hair-cutting pro.  Nice weight, very easy to use, and all of the accessories are great.  This is the 3rd clipper set I&#x27;ve tried in a year and I&#x27;m very happy with the quality.  Fantastic value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for awhile now and they work good.</li>
            <li> I could not decide which clippers to purchase, so I went cheap and bought these. Worst case, I could return them. No way are they going back. The only disappointment was the included cape. It was like a grocery store bag with little ties attached. It broke on the first use, but the clippers and attachments more than made up for that minor disappointment.</li>
            <li> I must say I am impressed with my new clippers. They cut really close to the scalp. They are also well built in America.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great and the price was good too. We have saved lots of money on my Husband and Sons hair. It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My 21/2 year old son will not sit for a scissors hair cut so we decided to start doing on our own with a clippers set. This was the perfect one! Came with everything we could have needed and is of a wonderful quality! Very impressed and pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally one prone to exaggeration, but in this case, there is no way to describe this product other than \\&quot;garbage\\&quot;. The razor cuts about a quarter inch wide swath through my hair. Yes, one quarter inch. I use cutters like these to shave my head, a process that typically takes about five minutes. It took me over half an hour to accomplish it with these. They simply cut a path so narrow through the hair that it defies belief. Because of that one fact alone, nothing else about this kit matters. The heads it provides for cutting don&#x27;t matter. The brush doesn&#x27;t matter. The scissors don&#x27;t matter. The razor itself is so pathetically narrow that these cutters are essentially unusable for anything. I cannot emphasize enough how offensively bad this is. As a final note, this razor can&#x27;t even get very close to the scalp. Even at the closest setting, it leaves behind about an eighth inch of hair, which is pretty terrible. Avoid at all costs.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers! there are easy to handle plus it cuts so close to the scalp, just the way i like. I will difinately recommend this product to my friends. The seller was also prompt on service. Overall i had a great experience.</li>
            <li> Works very well mistakenly. Order two but worked out fine cause my roommate like it.got here on time and packed fine ad well.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this, I have given my husband haircuts instead of sending him to the barber and saved so much! The different-sized blade guards work just fine, and I liked how it it comes with a manual showing how to cut hair. The cape isn&#x27;t terrific but that can be dealt with; the scissors work nicely and the finished haircut is quite nice! Operation is pleasant, with nicely-fitting blade guards and minimal shaking. The motor isn&#x27;t too loud, either. I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet, cuts like a pro. No issues as reported by others. I also like the variety of lengths of the attachments.</li>
            <li> I really like how these cut and also how they look and feel.  If they last long, and it seems like they will, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  EDIT:  Some of the clipper attachments chatter because they don&#x27;t fit on tight enough. Had to dock a star.  Update: Buzzed my head for 3 years now with them and they still work like normal, hope I&#x27;m not jinxing myself but if so I will order these again.</li>
            <li> I get professional results when cutting my hair. I have used other clippers but they did not work as well as this hair cutting kit.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers and do as advertised.  They cut hair!  I have my wife cut my hair because at $16-$20 a pop, this will be a large money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint, these have a very strong vibration which causes a loud noise when operating.  Its unpleasant as I am getting my hair cut but its not a deal breaker for me.  Some others mentioned it but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  That&#x27;s why the 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a good set.  Only drawback is that it&#x27;s obviously not built like the one I bought 15 years ago and have used all those years.  The scissors are tiny and cheap - don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll use them - but the clippers work well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I am not a hair stylest, but with this product I can give my husband a pretty good looking hair cut.</li>
            <li> I have always used Wahl clippers.  The only thing I dont like about them is the plastic guards.  They tend to slip off sometimes.</li>
            <li> It worked as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;No nicks and cuts. Good haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Good guide for a novice for how to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is good.&lt;br /&gt;Received wo any damage.</li>
            <li> It was great and it works great it dosent heat up or stop workin no nothing. It cuts hair really godd and had no troble with it:)</li>
            <li> Just got it today and was excited to try it, so plugged it in. The wire instantly melted and caught fire.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a very old Wahl brand trimmer.  My husband and 23 year old son had used the former for years.  It was a great and long lasting product but WOW! are we sorry that we waited so long to replace the old one.  This trimmer is more compact, runs quieter and is so easy to use.  This trimmer made quick work of the husband&#x27;s thick hair and there wasn&#x27;t a peep about &#x27;pulling&#x27; or &#x27;catching&#x27;.  The set comes with a ton of accessory pieces that are nice to have but we probably won&#x27;t get much use out of since my guys prefer the &#x27;shaved to the scalp&#x27; look.  The plastic cape WILL get a lot of use - how wonderful that no one will need to dirty a bath towel to catch hair.</li>
            <li> After spending $30 on haircuts here in New York, I decided it was time for me to try cutting my own hair.  After seeing great reviews for this set on Amazon, I went with it.  I&#x27;m not disappointed!  The clippers worked great!  They were very smooth, and all the attachments worked nicely and easily.  Thanks to this set, I didn&#x27;t butcher my haircut!  I would recommend getting an alternate set of hair clippers as I struggled with these when my hair was wet.  Dry was fine, though.  Also, if you like to have your hair thinned, you will need to get some thinning shears, as they aren&#x27;t included in this set.</li>
            <li> Pulls the hair as your trying to cut. You have to go over the hair several times and even then it leaves lots of strays. Its so dull that it leaves lines in the hair no matter what you do. I hate this thing.</li>
            <li> Well... its good... not great. It looks good but doesn&#x27;t feel really durable.. time will tell</li>
            <li> With this I cut my own hair and never pay for haircuts. never pulls at hair and has yet to have an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl units for many decades and it seems if you take a little time to clean and oil them they will last a very long time. I have two, one was my uncle&#x27;s  ( he was a professional barber) and it is ancient but still works like a charm. If you want to save money as well as get a decent haircut then get one of these.</li>
            <li> Get it. You wont be let down.</li>
            <li> Upon the recommendation of a friend who has had Wahl Clippers , I ordered these. They preformed well, are very quiet, and came with plenty of accessories and combs for different lengths. They are not heavy to hold while using them.&lt;br /&gt;I have given only two haircuts so far but I am very pleased with the way they worked and if they hold up as well as my friends have, I should have them for years to come.</li>
            <li> I dropped the one I had for 10 years on a cement floor ..... I wasn&#x27;t shocked that I broke it.  Wahl has always been a GREAT product so I bought another one.</li>
            <li> This is such a great hair trimmer.  I have used it twice on first my dad, then my boyfriend.  They both have very different hair types, it this cut their hair great!  I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of a hair trimmer (such a good price too)!</li>
            <li> These clippers work great.  No hair getting caught in the teeth and being pulled, no slowing down on lots of hair.  Easy to work and clean.  Comes with more attachments than I will ever use.  And only costs the price of two hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Perfect clipper for me! Have wanted to cut my own hair for a while now &amp; this clipper fits the bill perfectly. Has numerous attachments, cape to put on your shoulders, is very quiet to operate; couldn&#x27;t be more pleased &amp; was a bargain at this price. Will prob take me a few times to get the hang of it but overall, not bad. Comes in a handy lockable folding case as well.</li>
            <li> The Razor was very heavy amd loud.  The razor pulled the hair instead of cutting it! I would not buy this one!</li>
            <li> We loved this product! With all the add ons it&#x27;s always just what we need to trim all the boys hair</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband to cut his beard and it work perfect. Come with a nice case full of blade covers and accessories like scissors and hair clips and even a cape (The cape is awful lol it&#x27;s a white garbage bag)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very sturdy, chromed, big and heavy clipper. Works very well. Very sharp and effective.</li>
            <li> This set has just about everything you need and then some when it comes to cutting or shaving hair.  Plenty of guards, a pair of scissors, hair clips, combs, everything but the barber is included in this kit and the price was better than we had expected.  The clippers themselves are a step above the base level clippers we expected, not quite up to par with the more expensive clippers, but very close to that end of the quality spectrum than the poorer quality side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this set easily for anyone needing a hair cutting kit, especially families like ours where you&#x27;re cutting hair for multiple people.</li>
            <li> I have been buzzing my husband&#x27;s hair for many years.  We had a Wahl product in the past and were quite pleased with it as it was sturdy, reliable and it lasted a long time.  We attempted our second cut with the new Wahl today and it was a disaster.  The product did not want to cut after the first few small sweeps.  It was no longer making the zigzag motion that does the cutting.  My husband attempted to adjust it (each time getting one more swipe in before it died), and then to disassemble and repair it, without luck.  We are not eligible for Amazon refund because the return time has expired and it is not in new condition.  We threw out the paperwork (our bad- learn from us!) because it was mostly instructing on how to cut hair.  This is not the dependable item of the past.  Look elsewhere!!</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for years and the Wahl cuts my hair better then any other I have used!</li>
            <li> Very good economic application，Stay in the body is very good.，The quality is very good，I like it so much。next time .</li>
            <li> well worth every cent. The last WAhl cutters I had lasted alomst 20 years. It was time for a new one and this set is awesome. Quiet and cuts clean and quick. The chrome addition came so many extras.</li>
            <li> unit feels solid. exactly what I wanted. enclosure case has a small hole in it &amp; is a bit tight on keeping all pieces in it. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my sons hair and also for my beard which was a huge beard. these work great had almost a year and no problems and comes with plenty of guards</li>
            <li> love it. that&#x27;s it! use it every month to cut my husband&#x27; hair. easy to use and the result comes out perfect!</li>
            <li> This set came highly recommended on multiple sites.  Use for my husband and 3 yo boy.  I don&#x27;t know how to do anything fancy yet, but the set comes with EVERYTHING.  It operates nicely and the cord doesn&#x27;t bother me (read: it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to spend more for cordless for a monthly haircut).  We&#x27;ll def save money by doing at home and hopefully I&#x27;ll get more skills with time.  Check out YouTube if you do purchase, there&#x27;s a few easy to follow videos with nice tips, especially when cutting kids&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> other reviews said it was noisy.  this is true -- because the outer case was all plastic (lightweight plastic at that).  It was not put together as well as it should have been, so it shook and made a racket.  If you hold it just right, you can get it to be fairly quiet.  Outside of that, it cuts well.  I have know problems with anything but the housing.</li>
            <li> We got this clipper for the price and reviews. Since the first haircut, the guide comb that we used was rattling so bad that my wife decided to send it back, it got to be pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> Great price, works at the price point!</li>
            <li> Price is excellent for the product.  I use it on myself and the kids and works wonderfully.  Shaves smooth and comes with all the size attachments that you will need.  Add a little oil occasionally and you won&#x27;t need to buy another for many years.</li>
            <li> First use with 2 boys went well.  No issues or complaints from the kids.</li>
            <li> After having a cheap remington vacuum clipper set for several years, I decided to find a good sturdy clipper set. The vacuum worked well the clipping head was very cheap and proved to be quite inconsistent and painful. I figured the new one would be solid as a clipper and i&#x27;ll deal with the inconvenience of the missing vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after some debate, i settled on this set and have been quite happy with the performance so far. No more pulling hair out as you attempted to cut it. These things rock. yeah, there&#x27;s a mess to clean up afterward, but these things don&#x27;t get bogged down, cut consistently, and don&#x27;t pull people&#x27;s hari out. Very, VERY happy so far!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my previous Wahl which lasted 15 years. This Wahl is excellent. A little heavier than my previous one but I wanted a sturdier one vs a less expensive plastic model. Very pleased with it. Easy to use. Lots of attachments. It just simply works very well.</li>
            <li> super powerful compared to my old Remington. i&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;ll take off too much hair! but definitely a quality buy</li>
            <li> Excelente maquina con todos sus accesorios y llego super rapido</li>
            <li> Had my first one for over 10 years.  This replaced it, same great quality for a cheaper prices clipper.  I use it to cut my boys&#x27; hair all the time.  Plenty of accessories too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful! :D As soon as it came in the mail I tried it out. I purchased this to use for some fur I am working with. It works wonderfully! :) Make sure to oil the blades before each use to lengthen the blade&#x27;s life for sure. It&#x27;s not really that loud either. After I finished using it, I use FastBlast, that air in the can that&#x27;s used to clean keyboard to remove the fine hair pieces from the blade and guards. Looks like I never even used it!</li>
            <li> Used it 3 times, doesn&#x27;t cut now. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Works well, I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;2) Good price for quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) It sticks when turning it on / off&lt;br /&gt;I had to oil the on/off switch after a while because it stuck so much. I wish the switch was more like a traditional on/off or some other design that was easier to do.&lt;br /&gt;2) Don&#x27;t drop it on tile, the metal snaps easily. Mine broke when it slipped off the counter. I bought anther of the same due to quality/price ratio</li>
            <li> Very nice. This should cost more than it does at the moment!!&lt;br /&gt;If you need a machine for yourself and are not a professional. GET THIS ONE!</li>
            <li> Great unit.  A lot better than the one I had!!</li>
            <li> Great product. It has everything (probably too much) that I need to cut my hair and trim my beard. I did have to get a toothbrush to clean off the hair from the teeth and soforth. The small brush included is just not large enough. Plenty of selections when it comes to sizes and taper clips. The clipper itself is easy to hold onto and guide. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to cut my husband&#x27;s and brothers&#x27; hair at home.  This cuts so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t pull out their hair.  It feels really sturdy and I&#x27;m sure this will last a long time.  Great investment for the long run.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and sleek, this clipper set can handle the shaggiest mop top in no time with absolutely no snagging. It seems to be great quality and is fairly quiet to use.</li>
            <li> Works perfect! Have used it for beard trimming and hair cuts and it couldn&#x27;t be better! Has everything you need to do any job possible. Love it!</li>
            <li> For my birthday last year I got the Wahl 79300-400. Long story short it was absolutely horrible. Always left lines in my hair. The trimmer itself was not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; grade and the attachments weren&#x27;t working as they should have either. For about $5 more, this trimmer IS PROFESSIONAL QUALITY! I just had my first haircut with it and the difference between the 79524-2501 and the 79300-400 is NIGHT AND DAY. I have restored faith in Wahl trimmers after getting this one.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to pay the extra money, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quiet, very sharp, like it alot!</li>
            <li> Ive always been a short hair kinda guy, I just dont like messing with it and for years I paid $15 including tip to have my head shaved. I finally got some brains and bought these, I can shave as often as I want and these have paid for themselves after the second use. They are comfortable to hold and easy to use. I&#x27;m even to the point where I can do it myself without even looking in the mirror, though I do have my wife check over once im done just to make sure...</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time last week and to my surprise, got exactly what I expected from a hair trimmer. I&#x27;ve used a couple of other products before but this one tops them all.</li>
            <li> I am VERY particular about some of the things I buy - cliippers is one of them. I was very hesitant to buy this online because I couldn&#x27;t try it and it was less expensive than other clippers which brought me to believe that the quality was worse.  However, I&#x27;d highly recommend this set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers themselves are durable from metal and work very well! They&#x27;re easy to clean and all of the accessories are very helpful and useful.</li>
            <li> the weight of the haircutter insprires confidence...i have cut my own hair with this thing twice now and even my old retired usmc boss likes the results...and he usually doesn&#x27;t like anything i do</li>
            <li> This thing has power, precision, and a perfect price point.  I&#x27;m thrilled with this product.  Though I originally bought it for my beard, I now use it to trim my hair.  That it&#x27;s corded instead of cordless is a HUGE plus to me, as I hate replacing earth-trashing batteries and using the trimmer when the charge is low.  Keeping it plugged in means this thing does it&#x27;s job solidly and without the battery waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military, and I bought these to cut my hair and some of my friends&#x27; to save money.  After about 6 months of weekly use, its finally starting to see some wear and tear.  Probably needs a new head or something.  The green 0.5 guard would be very nice, but it has a little trouble staying attached to the clippers and makes a funny noise because it rattles a bit.  The main issue with it is the fact that the slider that adjusts the teeth does not lock in place, so it makes it a little tough to properly fade with.  But overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the buy and it helped me to save hundreds of dollars for my friends and I.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe this was only 20 bucks - Made in USA (Heart of Illinois on the Rock River) Works Fantastic! Have had my brother buzz my head about a 1/2 dozen times or so, awesome!</li>
            <li> Cuts my husbands hair great! I&#x27;m no hair dresser but its easy to use and my husband even has cut his own hair.</li>
            <li> Me and my better half are not hairstylists or professional in any way shape or form.  So we&#x27;re not going to bark and scream on how these are better than other brands.  I&#x27;m just going to tell you based on the average joe shmoe use.  So far, these have been excellent.  I wear my hair rather short without much style, almost a military cut, just with a little flair.  My better half has never cut hair before, so the first time was an adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing comes packaged nicely, even with a cape, but was most useful was a pamphlet for her to read through that described techniques and a few example haircuts.  Again, we aren&#x27;t experts that are going to criticize technique, so we found them helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time was shaky, just due to her not knowing how to do it.  We let her play and test out different things until it was apparent we were going to have to buzz it all down to one length.  I&#x27;m fine with that as my hair grows rather fast.  Not 3 weeks later, time for another trim.  She used the ear guard and blended the rest up.  With each use its obvious she&#x27;s getting better and understanding how to approach it better.  I expect a few more times and she&#x27;ll be comfortable and a at home pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that want to save money, this is a really easy way to do it.  Have patience, understand your first might not be a success, but just laugh and keep it up.  You&#x27;ll not regret it.</li>
            <li> It work fine and i find it good.  It need more comb number and I recommended it any one who use for personal use.</li>
            <li> I live in Europe but purchased this from US. It turned out that the device is designed only for 110 volt and 60 hertz electricity.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased a transformer from 220V / 50 Hz to 110 V / 60 Hz and turned on the hair cutter. It is extremely noisy and vibrating - it deafens my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People from Europe - be aware that if you buy this hair cutter from US, you will have issue with the electrical characteristics - this one is designed for 110 volt and 60 hertz electricity. Currently I am not sure if the noise and vibrations are due to the transformation of the electricity or there is some issue with the hair cutting device.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my friend for his birthday and loved it! Excellent product. Brand New!! I asked him if the sound is too loud and he said not at all.</li>
            <li> This product works well.  This was the first time I have cut my own hair beyond just doing some trimming.  It works great and will save me a lot of money by not going to the haircutting store.  I was a bit worried about the reviews saying the combs were weak and fell off easy.  I have no issues with the combs coming off and they seem plenty sturdy to me.</li>
            <li> Mainly use for very short haircut, close to skin. Too much vibration on the hand. Getting warm very quick. Its not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
            <li> Owned two cheaper clippers that did not last ... but this one looks to be the ticket.  It came with lots of accessories.  The manual adjustment for the blade height makes getting great results a snap.  Zero problems.  Zero concerns.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shaver get the job done excellently</li>
            <li> My husband got this haircutter in the beginning of March and he had used it three times and now a little over one month it is already broken and it is not possible to return it. Why would Wahl make this thing looks so sturdy and it turns out to be just a heavy piece of trash. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Just a quick review: - good cutting hair clippers that can give you a haircut just as good as at the barbershop if done by the right person.&lt;br /&gt;-They do get a bit hot, but Ive never used any others so i&#x27;ts tough to compare, and the person who cut my hair is a novice. She took a long time cut my hair and had the clippers on for about 45 minutes. Maybe that was the reason.&lt;br /&gt;-The included kit is pretty standard but very good nonetheless. Everything you need to get a pretty standard fade gentleman style.&lt;br /&gt;-They work as I expected them to. The quality on the picture is very approximate of the quality of the clippers themselves. They have a pretty sleek look and you can get  a really sleek haircut out of these.&lt;br /&gt;-Not sure if they will last though? The quality of the materials and the clean sound of the motor makes it seems like they will.</li>
            <li> I have another wahl hair trimmer an ive been happy with them.  Works good, comes with lots of stuff in the kit, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and work well.</li>
            <li> Good razor. Cuts hair very efficiently and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit loud but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the plastic parts do not fit too easily in the carrying case.</li>
            <li> Has yet to catch my hair and cuts really well! Only con so far is that it gets hot quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Burnt out after couple months of use</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend good overall, however one of the components was melted. It&#x27;s not a piece he is likely to use and he needed the clipper as soon as he got it. Other than that the set was is perfect working condition and is a good replacement for his old one.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a starter kit for school and that&#x27;s the standards that it meets. Not as strong as I would like, but I love the guards and case it comes with!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, price, and shipping. Works great! Thanks.</li>
            <li> for the price I think its a good pair of hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Product is great, well build. My usage is very simple: I bought it to keep my haircut to the lowest (meaning the limit between shaving my head completely and having a little millimeters of hair, military style), and it gets the job done perfectly. For those wanting a different hair style than mine, worry not, it comes with a bunch of accessories. My only gripe with it, is that power cord is not as long as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> These clippers are awesome! They cut smooth and even. Had no problems experimenting on my 2 year son, lol</li>
            <li> Good,  just used a few time got it paid for already</li>
            <li> Well made and much better that the Norelco brand that it replaced. I mainly use it to trim my beard and it works perfect for that purpose.</li>
            <li> After I began using this clipper I noticed that it&#x27;s quite loud.. It&#x27;s one year passed since I bought it and now it&#x27;s horribly loud, also alot of vibration.</li>
            <li> When I need a haircut, I can even get one at home now. This clipper works great and is really easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> broken within 5 minutes of opening package. Motor still works but doesn&#x27;t seem to connect to blade. Probably just an oddball defected unit but still very annoying.</li>
            <li> so i Got this product with really good reviews , but when i used it ,it started making weird loud sound which is unbearable . Anyways tried to fix it per instructions by screwdriver but it never did and it does not have any return policy .I love buying stuff on amazon since i m prime member but i can say this is the worst product i bought on amazon !!!!!</li>
            <li> I used a Philips Norelco dedicated &amp;#34;beard and mustache&amp;#34; trimmer for several years until it died one day. Looking for a replacement, I found this gem and chose it because it got good reviews and the price was right. These clippers feel very solid and obliterate hair, meaning they perform their designated function, which I can honestly say the Norelco stuggled with sometimes. The guards are cheap-ish plastic, but I only use guards 2 and lower and have had no problem whatsoever, even after changing them out many times. This might become an issue for someone who uses larger guards, as the guards may bend, especially if the user presses down really hard on them (but then that person&#x27;s probably not doing it right). Yes they&#x27;re loud, but what clippers aren&#x27;t? Especially for this price. They definitely aren&#x27;t for shaving without using a guard; the unit is loud because the blades are sharp and moving very fast and would love to chew up soft flesh if given the opportunity. A great item for beard maintenance, though!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, I have always had thick hair. I have NOT always had a razor that could cut my hair.  Most of the time, I have to constantly oil and brush my razors so they don&#x27;t lock and pull my hair.  I oiled this beauty and shaved off all of my hair on my head with ease, comfort, no pain, and not stopping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product has made me a Wahl customer for life.  Best Haircut Kit I have ever owned and used!</li>
            <li> I bought this to give my family haircuts since we need to save money! It is my first clipper but I like it. I gave my son a rather uneven haircut but second times a charm! It was my own fault, of course. It comes with a small bottle of oil, scissors, combs, and a whole bunch of attachments. Just make sure you use a larger attachment if you don&#x27;t want to shave off your kid&#x27;s side burn!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with these. Affordable and gives a great haircut. It comes with a generous amount of pieces including mustache guard. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these as Christmas presents for my daughters who have small boys. Arrived very quickly. Hopefully they will work just as advertised. Will save them lots of money.</li>
            <li> I works good for the price</li>
            <li> So we have a couple of standard poodles (the big ones). My wife got an Andis dog clipper like the groomers use so she could groom the dogs herself. Well, that was the only clippers we had so....yeah. She cleaned the blade off with alcohol and strapped me down to the chair. I feel sorry for the dogs. This \\&quot;professional\\&quot; Andis clipper blade pretty much yanked the hair out of my head. In between my wailing and moaning she&#x27;d say, \\&quot;Sorry\\&quot;...bzzzz...yank!&lt;br /&gt;True story...and a sad one (stop laughing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright! Well, that was it! I told her we are going to get a HUMAN CLIPPER right now and I don&#x27;t care the cost! Fortunately, this Wahl clipper kit was very reasonably priced for what you get (and far cry less expensive than our $180 dog hair pullers, I mean, clippers). All the good reviews prompted me to select this one and I&#x27;m glad I did. It cuts as smooth as a hot knife through soft butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 2 hair clips for victims with longer hair, 2 combs, scissors, 13 blades, a maintenance kit (brush/screwdriver and oil), a blade cover, a hard plastic case, and a plastic apron. First off, the plastic apron is nothing more than a kitchen garbage bag in the shape of an apron...seriously. Toss it out! It builds up so much static electricity that it literally attracts the hair to you ON BOTH SIDES and covers you with the clippings. I got a real apron instead. One of the [[ASIN:B007ROCZVY Salon Sundry Professional Hair Salon Nylon Cape with Snap Closure - 50\\&quot; x 60\\&quot;]]&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the cleaning brush works great for for the blade but the screwdriver end is a bit flimsy for adjusting the blade power (see the instruction manual). I used a real flat head screwdriver for that. Everything else in the kit seems to be high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the unique and, perhaps, more helpful accessories are the Left and Right side taper combs (I don&#x27;t think my wife&#x27;s ever even looked at those yet--she&#x27;s still doing it the hard way), the ear guard (you can cut the hair evenly over your ears without getting \\&quot;white walls\\&quot;), and the eyebrow guard. You know...for the older, bushy eyebrow gals--and guys--not that I&#x27;m one of those ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some great videos on doing clipper cuts on YouTube. There&#x27;s a good one made by a military guy who shows men how to cut their own hair with the clippers (something most of us military guys have had to do more than once). If you&#x27;re super cheap, like me--or you don&#x27;t have someone to cut your hair, doing it yourself with this kit is a super easy. The guide combs do it all for you! Comes with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife says it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to hold (the clippers, I mean). Made in the USA--like me.air evenly over your ears without getting \\&quot;white walls\\&quot;), and the eyebrow guard.

            <li> Bought this for my son who plays university football..being in university is hectic enough, tack on football and one needs roller skates and wings to get things done..haircuts are not always easy to attain so this kit enables him to do it himself and keep his hair short for under his helmet..he said it is the best he has used..great price and delivery</li>
            <li> Its lighter than my old clippers and lot sharper</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift. My boyfriend is very happy with it. He is able to use it very fast. It is very accurate and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken, then I had tio pay the return shipping.  I am not at all happy with this purchase.  I bought a pair that were cordless, much better.</li>
            <li> Best value I&#x27;ve found.  Works much better than other units I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> It is great thank you sooo much</li>
            <li> I used this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. I am not a hair stylist and have never cut hair before, but the guides are really easy to use. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Nice quality product.</li>
            <li> I got this set to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s a real money saver. Buy it once and after two haircuts at home, it&#x27;s paid for itself. I have had this product for about a year now and the blade on the shaver is still very sharp. All the pieces are well made and I think the 24 piece is great for simple male haircuts, I don&#x27;t see why you would need anything more. Really impressed with and thankful for this money saver!</li>
            <li> I buzz cut my own hair and also use this to trim my beard (nothing fancy). Works exactly as intended, good price, and has lasted a number of years now with no sign of wearing out. Just keep it dry and its more than worth it.</li>
            <li> it works great  really does the job easy and fast. love it, love it. It saves us so much money</li>
            <li> very good kit for a hair cut at home. however the user manual is not that extensive so that a new user can use it straightaway. So take precautions while using it for the first time. review the videos on you tube before you are off to start.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this kit. I&#x27;m baffled by the lesser reviews here. Read the manual first. It will tell you to oil the clippers and adjust them. Do that and away you go. Cuts perfectly. Plenty of comb guides. My wife gives me barber-quality hair cuts. Can&#x27;t tell I haven&#x27;t been to my old barber.</li>
            <li> Ease to use. Difersnt kind of styles strobg motor and heavy constrccion , brand name. Wahl I recommend to anybody</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and I like it.</li>
            <li> Wahl 79524-2501 has a lot of sizes for clipping and trimming hair&lt;br /&gt;combs plus nice scissors. I think made very well for these days.&lt;br /&gt;wolff44</li>
            <li> This is my first set of clippers so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to but, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Everything I needed.</li>
            <li> been using wahl  products for along time and will continue to they&#x27;re great id recommend them to any one.  THANKS !!!</li>
            <li> Good starters machine !</li>
            <li> Works Great. Bought for my mother who really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> This clipper makes it so easy to cut my own hair. It only takes me about 15 minutes and about 5 minutes clean up time. I&#x27;m saving money and getting a better cut than I was often getting at the budget hair salons. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and had really no trouble learning to use it. I watched several You Tube videos before trying it myself. Of course, you&#x27;ve got to like wearing your hair short. I do wish though that Wahl would make some more attachments in just a little longer lengths. I&#x27;d like my hair just a little longer than I can do with this. The longest attachment I&#x27;ve found is 1 1/2 inches. I had to buy that one separately. The longest in the box was 1 inch. I&#x27;d like another quarter to half inch. But still, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> cuts really well, very sharp, comes with tools with the machine, very handy, design is nice aswell, i recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works well. Was expecting a trimmer but  perfect for trimming down. Not lining up your mustache, beard, or hairline.</li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl that I used for my husband and son. It was 34 years old - It was time to replace it and I chose the Chrome Pro - I knew that Wahl would have a good product - I am very pleased with this item.  It came with a storage case and many accessories. Great product, looks like it will hold up to frequent use.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a good, solid hair cutter.</li>
            <li> This is truly a complete hair grooming kit!  It covered all bases.  All the tips for the clipper were included as well as scissors, cape, clips, combs, oil and cleaning brush, and a great case to hold it all in, neat and tidy!  If you have a man with facial hair or like to cut hair at home, than this is the kit for you.  And Wahl is a name you can trust.  The other 2 Wahl products we own have been in use for over 20 years.  And both are still in good running order.</li>
            <li> Buy these! (ra-ma-da-ma-dama).  I purchased these because my old 25 year-old clippers finally conked out.  I needed a new set of clippers.  Based on the good previous reviews of these Wahl clippers, I decided to try them (ra-ma-da-ma-dama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  These are much better than my old clippers.  They are solid, they feel like professional clippers.  They come with many useful attachments  (ra-ma-da-ma-dama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved using these clippers so much that I couldn&#x27;t stop!  I tried ALL of the attachments, and then I kept on cutting without any attachments. Now I will have to wait several more weeks before I can use them again - because there is nothing left to cut.  My friends now call me HAIRY KRISHNA - I&#x27;m not quite sure what that means (ra-ma-da-ma-dama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I just kicked off my sandals and wanted to let you know that you should buy these clippers (ra-ma-da-ma-dama)!  We need more HAIRY KRISHNAS in the world (ra-ma-da-ma-dama)!</li>
            <li> Saw some reviews saying this was a lightweight model, and may not last, so I was hesitant. NOT SO. This clipper comes with all the attachents you could need, and if you have some favorites from another clipper then save them cause they&#x27;ll probably fit this clipper too. It is not battery powered so having to leave it plugged in while using acan be a bit of a restriction, however it is powerful. It actually bucks in your hand when you power it up. I think people could use it on horses without a problem and can see no possible head of human hair that this clipper could not handle for years. For the price, it&#x27;s the best deal out there.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these sets in the last year after the my Son dropped, and broke the still perfectly good 40 year old Wahl trimmer I had all those years. Once I bought the first new one my daughter wanted one to cut her dogs hair with. Then my Son wanted his own. At least now I have a chance of not ever having to buy another one for me. Wahl makes a great product and this is a great set for a Great Price.</li>
            <li> Teeth are quite sharp on these compared to previous Wahl clippers that I&#x27;ve owned. But I can tell this is a durable and consistent set.</li>
            <li> It was excellent. My boyfriend liked it.</li>
            <li> I owned it for about 2 years and still working fine.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy and noisy but it does what it suppose to do.  I like that it brings a lot of attachments and is still working.</li>
            <li> More than I expected for my money!</li>
            <li> These clippers are great for me. Adjustable. easy to handle. Gives a great haircut.</li>
            <li> Great product. I cut my hair using the &amp;#34;6 on the side, and #7 on top. It came out better than I thought. My advice: GO SLOWLY. DON&#x27;T RUSH. And watch the how to direction on the actual Wahl website. It;s their product, they know how to use it. Other online videos contradict each other so just go to the Wahl website directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made only one mistake. The ear tapering attachment will cut short unless you do it right way. I did it the wrong way so one ear looked a bit off to me but no one seemed to notice.</li>
            <li> These work great! The wife has yet to cut off one of my ears so that&#x27;s always a plus! Plenty of power...easy to use...nice selection of accesories. Kit box could be a bit larger or better designed but I didn&#x27;t buy them because of the box! Great product</li>
            <li> Works like a champ.  Powerful and sharp.  Great for home haircuts.  Husband also uses it to trim his beard regularly and it makes the job much faster than his usual beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Work just fine, and look really sleek. My clients like them, too.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job cutting hair, has good weight. Great prodcut.</li>
            <li> Going thru cancer trweatment and cannot get out for a haircut. My wife can trim my hair with no problems with a little practice.</li>
            <li> Havent paid for a haircut since i got this, one of my better amazon investments. Really good extensions but i wish the box was more organized to hold them thus i deduct one star. But the clipper works perfect.</li>
            <li> cuts well. has all the pieces there.  not too loud.</li>
            <li> Very very bed quality. Price comparison to very bed.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some flimsy plastic Chinese malarkey. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a serious pair of clippers. It&#x27;s got some weight to it. It&#x27;s pretty quiet compared to some other cheap ones I&#x27;ve used. It cuts great, usually I have to go over my hair a few times to get it down and this one did it in one pass. I like all the attachments, I&#x27;ve used three, the second shortest and the left and right behind-the-ear trimmers. The behind-the-ear trimmers are great.</li>
            <li> Very nice clippers, excellent price.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Husband needed new clippers. He cuts his own hair and trims his own beard. &amp;#34;Works great.&amp;#34; (His words)</li>
            <li> this thing works great.  was paying $10/cut.  Have used about 20 times and still working great.  More then got my monies worth.</li>
            <li> Excellent unit.  Nicely balanced and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had another pair of Wahl clippers from several years back and even like this pair better.  So easy to use, glides through the hair, gives a quick and great cut.  Very nice.  Comes with everything you need for a great cut.  My family liked it as well.</li>
            <li> Works well, except I can&#x27;t get a close enough shave on the neck when using the razor without an attachment, on it&#x27;s shortest setting.</li>
            <li> A hgh quality haircut kit great for giving yourself buzz cuts.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I am no professional when it comes to using this product but it is so easy to use it&#x27;s full proof. I use it on myself as well as my parents and even my little Terrier. The blade cuts very well and makes very precise edges. For this price, it is so worth getting. Shipping came right on time in perfect condition. This was a plus on price and quality, definitely recommend it whether you&#x27;re a beginner or a professional.</li>
            <li> The razor worked well for the first couple hair cuts but quickly stopped cutting effectively. It leaves clumps of hair and failed to leave clean lines when cutting the neck and ear areas. I replaced it after a year of use (maybe a dozen hair cuts), which is unfortunate as the previous Wahl I had purchased had been a workhorse for over a decade. The accessories it comes with are nice but not useful when the razor itself fails to cut hair.</li>
            <li> going strong just change blade</li>
            <li> Used it once was excessivly loud, started smoking and then failed to work, I want my money back</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gone to the barber in over a year! Awesome purchase. And now my girlfriend, best friends, and parents are great at cutting my hair now. WARNING best friends are not good at cutting hair, don&#x27;t be fooled by their confidence :)</li>
            <li> Great for beard grooming.</li>
            <li> Works great. No complaints.</li>
            <li> It is too loud for me!</li>
            <li> I like it and you cannot complain what you get for the price.  It is not too noisy and and it easy to use by yourself with the Comfort Grip.  I like all of the different Clipper Guide Combs that come with it</li>
            <li> It worked well for the first six months, but when I went to adjust the power screw (was using a lower wattage), it stopped cutting properly. Now it cuts unevenly and takes several passes to cut hair. I cannot seem to get it adjusted back to where it was and it vibrates like crazy. I do like that it has a variety of guards to choose from, but I was hoping it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Thank you, I recommend a good supplier</li>
            <li> This weighty trimmer feels far more expensive than it actually is.  It oozes quality, and is very easy to clean.  I&#x27;m not sure how appropriate this product would be if I was a professional hairdresser and expected to earn my living with it, but for DIY haircuts at home it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> very poor instrument; was not even working, was making a loud noise. I am not sure if this should be sold as hair clipper.</li>
            <li> This worked great for a buzz cut and paid for itself with the first cut at home instead of a salon.</li>
            <li> cuts right through my long hair without a need for a 2nd pass through.  great construction and build quality</li>
            <li> For the price ... amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for a low price. My partner and I use this set to trim our hair every two weeks. The guides click in place rather than sliding, which I find eliminates accidental changes in the height of the guide. The motor is strong and runs smoothly.</li>
            <li> Saving us $$ by shaving my husband&#x27;s hair down vs. going to the barber! Great product</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly out of the box. It also came with it&#x27;s own set of oil for the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it and worked fine.</li>
            <li> I bought these same clippers 4 years ago and absolutely loved them - gave a 5 star review at the time.  They had finally started to jam after 4 years of use - I was definitely happy with the lifespan!  Of course, I bought the same clippers again since I was so happy with the previous set.    I carefully followed the instructions for oiling the blade, but the new set jammed several times on the first use.  It is borderline worthless.  I&#x27;m actually going to switch back to the old set, which I&#x27;m glad I kept, and maybe keep the new set as a backup.  Or just throw it away and look for something else.  Amazon shipped this item completely loose in a box, with no padding or air cushioning of any kind.  There&#x27;s no way to prove that this shipping method caused internal damage to the clippers, but having worked with clippers for 20 years, I know you can&#x27;t be very rough with them.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in what I received, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to poor quality or poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I dont usually rave about a product! These clippers are awesome! Got them for cutting hubbys hair. I have been investigating them for a few months before I purchased. They have a cord so be aware they are not cordless.. Nevertheless, they are heavy, sturdy and did a fantastic job. Wahl is a good name and they deliver a good product. Comes with attachments a plenty! Now I have only one negative comment about this.. The case. The case is hollow and everything is just kind of thrown in there... But the clippers are worth the chaos!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic hair shaving toolkit, it has every thing I needed and saved me a lot of money, it is easy to use and I was able to shave my hair by my self with it, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got these for my hubby.  I love the case.  It is much quieter than our last set of clippers.  It comes with everything you need.  It cuts and trims really well.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for the money.  I bought this for my son and he has been more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li> After using the product only once, I find that it is not cutting and tends to snag the hair.  Tried oiling it but to no avail.  Thought it would provide the necessary lining up which is pivitol for my husband&#x27;s hair cuts but the outcome is negative. I am very disappointed in this product.  Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a freshmen in college and it is great for getting a quick haircut.  It flows well and i heard a lot about it.</li>
            <li> I tried to cut my friend&#x27;s hair with this. This sure is heavy and will have a hard time if you aren&#x27;t used to cutting it for a long time. I am not a pro at cutting hair at all so I cannot judge how it works.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this great mchine in terms of hair cutting. It also comes with a nice plastic storage. This machine works well and not too shaky to handle.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here, everything works as it should. A VERY nice clippers kit for the price- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the kit and clippers but the included scissors broke after only a few hair cuts.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic hair cutting kit. It comes with instructions and makes it easy to cut your own little boys hair.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice and it already broke. Very loud. Worked well when it was working but broke down way too quickly, I take good care of things I owe and I&#x27;m not happy with how its already useless. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> The other reviews prompted me to do buy this. But it was blunder buying this. The trimmer works with battery only. It gives a jolt when you switch it on....Heavy enough and noisy...seems you are running a big power house motor.....Scissors quality was also not good.....</li>
            <li> Great price and really easy to follow instructions. It has all ready paid for itself by doing two h/c! Now, I just really need to practice!</li>
            <li> I have paid for the $80 set but i just love how this one is so much cheaper and great quality... i dont like the oil upkeep either so i buy this set, treat it like garbage, and in 2-4 years when its had enough, i get another one for the price of 1 normal haircut at the barber</li>
            <li> Works very well and seems to have all of the attachments I will need. I already saved the cost by cutting my and my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Had it six weeks and it&#x27;s already making a weird LOUD vibrating noise and it hurts to trim close. It yanks hair not trims it, did that from day one.&lt;br /&gt;Too cheap, I need to replace already.</li>
            <li> received quickly, well packaged, affordable, does a great job on my hair, deserves 5 stars</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my bf for valentines day. I absolutely love his hair at 1/8 and this does the job. Replaced his 10+yr old Wahl trimmer and he was in love with everything you get in the package.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  The only drawback is that the comb set is all plastic so after a while I may need to replace the combs I use the most.  The plastic guide combs notwithstanding, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of these clippers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipment! Works great</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, very good quality. The plastic drape was not much help. But I use something else. Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> These clippers do not shave well. I have to pass over the same area several times to get the job done. I shave my husbands head without the guard.  I do not recommend these.</li>
            <li> Works great, has good power. Great value.</li>
            <li> Have used it three times. This is a great product, however it would have been better if it came with a cleaning brush, a tool to change the blades and the oil required to use on the product.</li>
            <li> so far, so good.  past problems with similar devices occurred after months of use.  we will see what happens</li>
            <li> it was good. it was very good, it was it was trust me it was very good. it was. bye</li>
            <li> I have being able to save some money on haircuts and became a master of this great tool! also it has a nice weight and it is easy to operate.</li>
            <li> I looking for 220 volt and the search appear for it but when it arrive I saw it is 110 volt.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in USA now it is good and I fill it is strong.</li>
            <li> I will give it to a friend as a present. She might use it to cut her little child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Love this set! I have never cut hair before with clippers. I wish the actual set came with a DVD to watch but you can look on YouTube for cutting suggestions. It takes a few times to get used to cutting so make sure that you don&#x27;t have some party to attend and need to look your best when you first start out! I&#x27;m now saving money on the husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s cuts!</li>
            <li> They are exactly what was described.  One of the best things is how the description matches the product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Brought this almost 5 months back, works perfectly. Heavier than what I had expected</li>
            <li> No surprises.  Trimmer works well and comes with a good selection of attachments and a nice carrying case.  Meets all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my husband because he likes to cut his own hair.  This is the 2nd set of &amp;#34;wahl&amp;#34; hair clippers for us and they last for years as long as you maintain them and oil them as needed.</li>
            <li> The clippers arrived extremely fast and packaged well. Upon opening, everything was well organized and the clipper was firm and heavy (not some cheap crap quality product). I used it instantly on myself and was blown away with how easy it was. For those of you pondering whether to buy this or not,  do it. ITS AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Yay to never having to pay for another haircut for my son, husband or father. This item paid for itself the very first day I had it.</li>
            <li> Best haircut I ever had!!! Awesome!!! Highly Recommend!!! Used it twice already, and on the entire family. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very noisy.. Vibrates a lot as well.. Would not recommend..</li>
            <li> This haircut kit has paid for itself more than 20 times. I paid about $20 for it so after 2 haircuts it already paid itself off. You get better at cutting your own hair every time you do so and I&#x27;ve gotten to a point where people ask me where I get my haircuts because I do a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I had with this clipper is that the guards come off a lot. To fix this I glued two small strips of magnets to the bottom of the plastic guard, and with that, it magnetizes to the metal head of the clipper. Not a perfect solution but it got the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because a i needed a clipper to cut my corporal hair. And this one is great for this application. It even has things that i will never use. Buy it eyes close. Package arrived in perfect conditions and very fast.</li>
            <li> I let my girlfriend use this on me and it was her first time ever cutting hair.  She did an excellent job and the product works great.</li>
            <li> I call this the monster because it has been the only clipper that can get through my hair without breaking a sweat. Comes with decent packaging and a good assortment of accessories and has solid construction. Yet like a monster, this thing is very loud. Not a huge issue for me but it is so much louder than my other clippers that I need to drop it down to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Very nice, heavy duty, lots of attachments.  I feel like a real barber.  lol  Now, if I just had the talent.&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  Go to a beauty supply store and buy a REAL cape.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to start giving my husband haircuts.  It&#x27;s very straight forward and comes with nice directions to get you started (although I suggest you watch lots of YouTube videos!).  Clippers are very sharp and glide right through the hair.  I only gave it 4 stars because the scissors aren&#x27;t the best quality, which I half expected anyway in a kit at this price.  Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> Damn good clippers!!! Can&#x27;t beat the price and they work outstanding. I have bought plenty of clippers in my lifetime and these are 1 of the best for price and function!</li>
            <li> The item is very bad, very loud voice gives me a headache that i dont use it anymore, dont buy</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s much better than my pair of conair trimmers. The only complaint I have is that is still doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like it too.</li>
            <li> Great Quality for what you are paying for .</li>
            <li> I ordered this so I could give my son and husband hair cuts at home.  It arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started.  My husband was a little reluctant at first but sat in the chair.  less then 30 minutes later both boys were done and loving their hair cuts.  I am so glad I decided to take a chance and try it.  With this one use they have already paid for themselves with what we will save each month on haircuts!</li>
            <li> This new Wahl clipper replaced a Wahl clipper which was given to us new in about 1961.  How is that for reliability.  I love the new clipper and attachments, and I am confident it will be give me excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> I like the clipper and it worked well. The only thing i noticed was that the plug did not fit in my bathroom socket so i have to use it outside.</li>
            <li> Not what he wanted, but it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> This set has worked incredibly for me. did not cost much and i have really thick hair so makes my life that much easier when I do not have to worry about it failing on me when cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> Clippers are very sharp and glide right through the hair&lt;br /&gt;This kit has everything you need for cutting hair at home&lt;br /&gt;We save so much money not having his hair cut in a salon&lt;br /&gt;Cut very easy hair&lt;br /&gt;great brand. great product, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair several times, so it&#x27;s paid for itself already. Good quality, plenty of guards. Comes in nice plastic case for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: (10/24/2014)&lt;br /&gt;Have used for over a year with zero problems. I cut my own hair probably every 2-3 weeks. Great investment, good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a beard trimmer. The past purchases have been for a cordless unit an all of the previous units died after a year  or two. I got tired of the batteries dying. This unit trims faster and I don&#x27;t mind plugging it into electricity for use. So far it is a great  trimmer and will continue to use it. Works fast and efficient.  Not sure what to do with the other trim heads, but I will hang on to them for some future use.</li>
            <li> The kit is great. Everything you need to get your hairstyle in shape. Beginners manual included with instructions for your first hair cutting. Simply great.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Chrome Pro\\&quot; is just marketing-speak, this product is not made of chrome. I found the construction to be distinctly shoddier than the black plastic Wahl clippers that I purchased 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the mechanism for adjusting the metal clipper guard was not quite right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning mine. I&#x27;m sure Wahl still makes good clippers, but it is clear that they are cutting corners on their cheaper models.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> great razor and fast shipping. I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Delivered product was exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Better than my last pair.&lt;br /&gt;So far they work very well, they cut through medium and fine hair like butter. They have a nice weight and the multiple guides come on and off very easily and that makes my hair cuts faster. I will update this review if I do someone&#x27;s thick locks and have problems but so far I am very satisfied with this clipper set.</li>
            <li> A fine product at a great price. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it feels and cuts like a professional tool. I was a little leery because of the low price, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, storage kit is sturdy and secure</li>
            <li> What a great product! For a young male looking to cut his his own hair, these do just that! Product pays for itself in 1-2 uses! Such a smooth trimmer, easly quietest trimmers that I have owned! With prime it was at my house in  1 1/2 days! You will be satisfied!</li>
            <li> Fantastic set. More pieces than what I need. Though it would be nice to have a short instruction manual on how to use the left and right ear pieces. Hate to figure it out by experimenting on someone&#x27;s hair or even my own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for quite some time and it&#x27;s still as sharp as the first day I got it.  You really need to clean it well after each use and oil it after to keep it running smooth.  Its&#x27; easy to use with a lot of attachments and beats going to the barber.</li>
            <li> Great product, everything I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have owned a Wahl cordless &amp; loved it.  I recently purchased this Wahl &amp; sadly, it has not lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Good clipper set with lots of accessories.  Pleased with the purchase and package arrived quickly and in very good shape.</li>
            <li> These are an amazing deal. I&#x27;ve been buying clippers since the 80&#x27;s, and this by far is the best set I&#x27;ve ever owned. I actually found these when I was reading reviews from another set, and that set was twice the price yet the reviewer said these were better. I never tried the other set, but with what I&#x27;ve got, this is the sturdiest, strongest, and most accurate set I&#x27;ve got for $25. I was willing to pay twice as much for a set this good, and glad I came across the review that referred to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head with a #1 clip, and with these clipper I only do one pass. It cuts so clean, that I no longer have random lines on my head, and shaving takes half the time. I should have bought these a looong time ago.</li>
            <li> works great, relaible, durable, you gotta get a wahl, works easy and no hassle! simple to use and has all the tools</li>
            <li> it was GREAT with all the attachment I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Looking into saving money on haircuts, I bought this for my wife to cut my hair.  Plent of attachments, Clippers seem solid and reliable.  Really great find.  Just a couple drawbacks,  1.  I would get a separate small trimmer for the neck, ears, etc. as this one hurts on skin.  2.  The shears are a little chintzy.  i&#x27;d recommend getting a pair elsewhere.  Lots of good attachments and the instructions are very well written and concise, with pictures and diagrams.</li>
            <li> I have used this once so far to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. It is heavier than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I was able to move along more quickly because it cut more efficiently. The plastic cover is pretty flimsy and it could use a brush for cleaning off the tools afterwards, but luckily I had these left over from my last haircutting kit. The scissors aren&#x27;t great, but they are decent enough for a kit like this.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, what you get is great for the price. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> very well made.  A little heavy, but can deal with that for the better quality.</li>
            <li> The large variety of comb sizes is wonderful but the blade really isn&#x27;t sharp enough. It works in a pinch but unfortunately the ends of the hair appear fizzy.</li>
            <li> Great clippers for at home haircuts. I have used others and they work okay too, but this is made of higher quality plastic than the other value brands. I would recommend buying.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a corded clipper for use while I was in Japan.  As the voltage there is about 10% less than in the US (100V vs 110V), I wanted a powerful clipper to start as I was going to lose about 10% in efficiency.  Tried the product once I arrived in Japan and it worked beautifully.  Lots of power.  Noise was not an issue.  No charging to hassle with and the price is right.</li>
            <li> These clippers are incredibly smooth. I&#x27;ve only used these twice so far, but my experience with them have been positive. After reading a few reviews I found that as long as the clippers are oiled then it should work well; this has been true for the two times that I have used it. I&#x27;m not sure how often is too often for oiling, but perhaps the third time I&#x27;ll try not oiling them and see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Both times I&#x27;ve used this I could barely even feel my hair being cut.</li>
            <li> 5 stars simply because it works exactly as it should. Maintenance isn&#x27;t too difficult, nor is operating the device. It came with everything I could need to do a head shave plus the extra bits to spruce up the look.</li>
            <li> This is good for what it is.. a cheap trimmer. My only complaint is the noise and the way it jolts a bit when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> And I was right.  Yeah buddy, if you have an easy shave (I&#x27;m a simple buzz cut every time) than this is way wiser than spending $15 a haircut.</li>
            <li> Wahl has always made great products and these are no exception. A good strong cutterhead with every attachment a man could ask for, all for a really good price. The cord is nice and long, the trimmers are relatively quiet, and it all comes in a nice carry container made of hard plastic that helps keep the product relatively organized. I recommend you try the Wahl brand and more specifically, these clippers and for the price I am sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The trimmer missed many areas.  My old Oster works much better.  Unfortunately, I missed the return window by two days.</li>
            <li> It says you cna use these for your pets my puppy is a Morkie and it is a nice clean cut! doesn&#x27;t tangle up in the blade perfect! would recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband talked me into buying this and trying to save money by cutting his hair. I was a little nervous at first, but they are SO EASY to use! They come with a nice instruction set. I have now cut his hair 3 times and we feel that it has paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I have used these style clippers for the last 20 or so years.  Up there with the best I have used.  Seem to cut fast (duration of haircut) yet don&#x27;t get any tugs.  Have a bunch of accessories that come with, but I&#x27;m a simple man and haven&#x27;t even bothered exploring them so far.  The main unit, one comb, scissors, brush, and cape is all I need.  Only worry is the shiny gray part seems to feel a little slippery and I sometimes fear that I will drop it (which is how my last unit broke) but you could always rough up that spot for more grip if need be.</li>
            <li> Still learning how to use it.  My dog doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, which is great.  Now I do it at home and don&#x27;t have to make an expensive appointment.</li>
            <li> Excellent, cuts great.</li>
            <li> Good clippers.  No complaints&lt;br /&gt;buy it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but it work very well for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut all 3 of my boys&#x27; hair twice now and its worked great every time!</li>
            <li> This product pays for itself after one haircut.  Runs quietly and cuts as smooth as butter.  Goes well with Andis Blade Care Plus.</li>
            <li> excellent home clipper.  works great with out snagging or pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers 2 years old and still working great.</li>
            <li> works great, i use it on my husband and son. has the extra trimmer parts that I need. well made product</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular but works fine.</li>
            <li> Great product! Not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> Works perfect for cutting my 3 year old sons hair. After two haircuts it has paid for itself v/s $12 a cut at the barbershop</li>
            <li> Could not shave my pubes well but I have a killer buzz cut now.</li>
            <li> Broke the day I got it</li>
            <li> Great for trimming hair but not for beards! The blades are VERY sharp so don&#x27;t try to use this without a guard or you&#x27;ll get nicks and pink spots on your face :)  There are gentler ones for beard trimming and for that I recommend a ConAir model. However, this is the clear winner when it comes to trimming hair and getting the right length. Unfortunately I bought it for beard trimming, and the clips and power of the instrument is far too great for clipping hair on your face! Look elsewhere for beard trimming, but if you&#x27;re cutting hair on your heard, this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, cuts very smooth.</li>
            <li> As I said, the accessories and the shaver looks cheap but works OK, has a lot of accessories. Very easy to cut your own hair</li>
            <li> Wahl makes it better.  The only criticism is the inclusion of a very flimsy drape.  Clipper and attachment are fine.</li>
            <li> Eh, the head is made of cheap plastic and mine was defective upon arrival. It&#x27;s a Wahl so this was rare I am sure but just to be sure I returned it and bought one at local store that I could verify was in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I purchased identical to this is very very quiet and light. The case is crappy and the accessories are nice to have but I am concerned about their longevity. CHEAP PLASTIC ACCESSORIES</li>
            <li> I recieved the clippers earlier thab the original arrival date. Once I opened them I was happy! It was perfect and came with everything I needed.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I had a problem with was the #4 guard is a little loose and it makes a really loud buzzing noise. Other than that I really enjoy the product</li>
            <li> The best brand and the best results, I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates quality and efficiency. This will fulfill it&#x27;s duty without complains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my son&#x27;s hair a few times with it.  I&#x27;m not sure but it seems like it needed to be adjusted or turned up or something.  I hope that it doesn&#x27;t go out.  Being in Bush Alaska makes me the primary hair cutter of the family.  I need something that will last a long time.  It hasn&#x27;t broke yet but it seemed like it was straining to keep up with the second hair cut.</li>
            <li> I just started cutting my own hair and these clippers made it really easy.</li>
            <li> its lovely with a low noise and clean cut ability,its for sure a product i will always recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair really good but when you use the extensions for hair length they are really really loud.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it. It&#x27;s easy to use and have a lot things to use.</li>
            <li> Great clipper set. I searched and read reviews for weeks before settling on this set and it was just what I wanted/needed. Use it once a month year round and it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> The package barely came today and I immediately used the machine for the first time to cut my hair and it started to overheat and started to smell.  I quickly put it back in the package and returned it. Now I&#x27;m patiently waiting for my money to be fully refund. NEVER BUYING THINGS FROM HIM EVER AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Does the job and comes with a fair amount of guard selections. Wahl has been a reliable brand for me.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery clipper works great well worth the money. After one haircut they paid for themselves already. No more making appointments for haircuts when I get time I get a haircut. Plus the 25 bucks for the haircut every week goes right to the savings account.</li>
            <li> I only have this product for 2 months and I am fairly satisfied. It&#x27;s a little noisy and I think that&#x27;s the only flaw but in general it&#x27;s working fine. Considering its price I think it&#x27;s a good deal... :D</li>
            <li> Nice sharp blade. I use this mainly for side burns.</li>
            <li> Amazing at home hair-cutting set.  It has everything anyone could possibly need to cut hair on their own EXCEPT an instructional video.  If it had a video, it would be perfect.  Thankfully, we have youtube.</li>
            <li> These clippers feel heavy and work great.  The only issue I have is that the case feels flimsy/cheap and there are no slots or compartments to store all of the accessories in.  You pretty much just throw them all in the case in a jumbled mess and hope for the best!</li>
            <li> I use this weekly! Very easy to use and it&#x27;s quite.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well every time.</li>
            <li> I bought this Wahl haircut kit to continue to give haircuts to my husband and boys at home.  I was replacing my old cutters because they were missing a lot of hairs (no matter how many times I went over the section) so I figured it was time to replace.  Well, this set is not doing any better (not any worse either)  I was dissappointed it did not come with the small one that I used for around the ears and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe my problems with it are user error since I have been cutting their hair at home now for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> Three months, six haircuts, and already not functional. I ignored some of the negative reviews, I should have listened. I have had better luck with Wahl in the past, but I will likely not buy from them again.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly which describes the provider. Instructions in Spanish. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> product broke on 3th month, don&#x60;t buy it</li>
            <li> Great quality. Have been using it for about 3 months now and very happy with them</li>
            <li> I really like this machine. It has everything you need except for one thing; half increment clips, or whatever they&#x27;re called. You only have numbers 1-8, but no 1 1/2 and so on.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers...makes cutting hair a breeze.  Solid quality...expected nothing less from Wahl.</li>
            <li> this is excellent. It replaced the one I dropped and it broke. I had the first one for years.</li>
            <li> Thank you outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  Price was good, still have it working after a beating it takes from our family.  Does what is says it will do.</li>
            <li> too loud. made alot of noise. each time i turn it on to use i had to turn it off back. way to loud.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers. They do the job and the grip is nice to hold. Only use them to cut my child&#x27;s hair every so often (in between haircuts or when it becomes unruly).</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home haircuts.</li>
            <li> These are great to cut my son&#x27;s hair.  Our barber stopped coming to the house to cut his hair, so I now do it.&lt;br /&gt;Watched a tutorial on You Tube, and off we went... Great product.</li>
            <li> My husband gives himself a flat top every 3 weeks using clippers.  His old clippers finally bit the dust so after reading reviews, decided on this one.  He is very pleased with them and all the accessories that come with them AND his hair looks great! :)</li>
            <li> Its very noisy !!! Bought an 220 to 120 v adapter and still very noisy , awful noise . Dont reccomend this product to anyone !!!</li>
            <li> The trimmer blades are very sharp. Although it vibrates too much for my taste and sometime you may need to turn it off and on to set up proper functionality.&lt;br /&gt;The items are what you can expect to shave and trim in a variety of sizes and designs.</li>
            <li> I think this one was the best buy at the time. It feels like a solid tool. I like that it comes with all the different size clips.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I usually get buzz cuts and didn&#x27;t want to have to pay $10 a haircut any more. So I did a good amount of research and found out that this model is one of the best especially for the price. I shopped around and to no surprise amazon had it at the lowest price. I received in decent time and to no surprise it works great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save money. It pays it self off in only 4 uses.</li>
            <li> Every 2 weeks I use this thing! Saves me a fortune on going to a barber shop to get a buzz cut! Size 1 or nothing! Wouldn&#x27;t trust any other brand! My dad has the exact same one which made me want to get my own.</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  I use it on my 3 year old son and he doesn&#x27;t complain and it cuts so fast.  I gave it four stars because I do not like the plastic attachments that come with it.  I wish they were metal like the Oster Professional but the Oster is &gt;$120 so I settled for this.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> No complaints to date, very good quality, and the price was unbelievable....Surpisingly good clipper for the price! Surpisingly good clipper for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair clipper and seems better than the old one I have been using for two years. less missed hairs than similar priced conair I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Great product.  As advertised.</li>
            <li> works great for all types of haircuts.  has all the necessary hair clips for any type of stylish cuts.  i really love the case, fits everything and easy to store once not in use</li>
            <li> Quite good through it seems not really new when it comes, the package has broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut my hair well, very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you need to follow the instruction firmly, or you need may have a bad hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine is so effective, where it comes, no hair left there.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace a Conair haircut kit that was starting to get old.  I use electric trimmer to cut my own hair, generally by using a 2 on the sides, 4 on top, and a 3 in between.  The first unit I received had a loud buzzing noise and misaligned blades that produced an uneven haircut, so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement.  The current one is aligned correctly, though it still seems like the motor is on the cusp of being loud at some point in the future.  I have no idea what causes that.  I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it does what it says and it comes at a great price, though I can&#x27;t say I wouldn&#x27;t prefer a new Conair if I had to make the purchase over again.</li>
            <li> Had to buy this new Wahl cutter due to Hurricane Sandy. After the storm i used the old Wahl once. Worked fine but second time it was problematic. Not surprised though; it did get flooded. Point is it shows how strong Wahl cutters are. They fight to the end. Not much to say about this new Wahl cutter. Quality all the way! Props Wahl!</li>
            <li> To start: I&#x27;m not cheap. I just don&#x27;t see the point in spending money I don&#x27;t need to. This haircut kit was one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made in a long time. After cutting my own hair just three times it had already paid for itself, and that&#x27;s assuming a fairly cheap haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other systems in the past that got extremely hot after a few minutes of use and would be very uncomfortable on my neck, and others that pulled hairs out when they got caught in the blades. This system isn&#x27;t like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Be VERY CAREFUL when using the ear trimming guides! The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t angle the buzzer enough and the opposite side buzzed a small section out of my hair. I learned my lesson and like using them now, but I&#x27;m much more careful now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For the best-looking haircut (for a guy with short hair) don&#x27;t be afraid to use the scissors on the top, and don&#x27;t worry about making it PERFECTLY even. (If you want it perfectly even, use the buzzer with a guide) I&#x27;ve found that the slightly uneven look is much more attractive than just using a buzz guide and doing the whole thing that way. It takes some practice and a little more time, but looks much better (IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Get some other kind of detail buzzer for the back of your neck. Even the sideburn trimmer on an electric razor works well. Also, get someone else to do the back of your neck. I tried doing it myself recently, and although it didn&#x27;t turn out TERRIBLE, it was terribly difficult and would have been better with some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming a hair cut every 6 weeks (my usual) at about $10 after tip (at a really cheap place in a college town), this little kit saves me about $87/year - enough to pay for my Amazon Prime membership (which already pays for itself, btw). AND it&#x27;s just about the best system I was able to find out there. HESITATE NO MORE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for a low price. If you do haircut twice, then you have automatically made this product for free.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it all the time and it is very sturdy and high quality. For the price and what you get, this is a steal of a deal! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive clippers as they are not better, just a different brand. I have not oiled this in over two months and it  still runs perfectly</li>
            <li> This haircut kit is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and DON&#x27;T have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Better than my cordless Conair.  It cuts faster and more efficiently. Feels more heavy duty than the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have is that the plastic hair guides are not as sturdy as the Conair&#x27;s.  One of the tooth on the number 5 guide was broken when I received it.  It&#x27;s a good thing that my Conair guides are interchangeable.  I&#x27;ll be using those instead of the Wahl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works very well, from a great and reliable brand.  Good size clippers in terms of weight and fitting in your hand.  24 piece kit really covers every cut you would need.</li>
            <li> Good product looks like it was quality made</li>
            <li> The great product and high recommendation</li>
            <li> Nice professional type kit even for home use. Loved it from the first time I used it. Lightweight &amp; fits in my hand just right.</li>
            <li> The clippers of course are the  reason for the purchase and they are fine.  Good quality, work great and no problem.  The cape feels and looks as if made from saran wrap.  Better off to leave out of kit than create the feel of junk.  Product is good and I am pleased.  The cape just cheapens a good kit.</li>
            <li> As many other reviews have stated already, it leaves a lot of hair behind even after many passes.  All the guide combs are made out of plastic, most of them are warped and not straight, looks like it was exposed to heat and was deformed.</li>
            <li> Ordered mine mid-sept 2014 and it&#x27;s still going strong. No issues yet</li>
            <li> What a great investment. For the price of 1 to 2 haircuts, you can purchase this 24 piece haircut kit. Works great. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;A great way to save your family money!!</li>
            <li> Great look and bargain!</li>
            <li> Great gift at an excellent price.  My two men, husband and son, love it!</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s not a bad set up. One of the attachments shakes a bit. You get what you pay for...it&#x27;s okay for occasional trims and cuts. You may want to go to a professional first and get a good shape for your head and follow up with the trims from the Wahl. May save you some money.</li>
            <li> I am a former Cosmetologist and enjoy the Wahl cutter. I have used Whal for 24 years in my profession and never had an issue</li>
            <li> My wife used to be a professional hair dresser and has cut my hair since we were married (many years ago).  We bought this set to replace some of her professional clippers that have worn out.  We were both surprised at how well this kit worked - definitely professional quality!!!</li>
            <li> These are one of the best purchases I have made recently. I was tired of paying someone $20 to cut my hair with clippers. Girlfriend, with no prior background in cutting men&#x27;s hair, uses them like a pro and saves us $20 every month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed how sturdy the clippers felt when I first opened the box. For the price, I thought they would be a little bit cheaper in quality. I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Very well made and a bargain at twice the cost!</li>
            <li> The clipper is bit more cheaply built than the last one with lighter weight plastic housing, a smaller slide switch rather than heavy duty rocker style switch, and the new power cord is a standard flat electric cord rather than the old heavy duty round cord. But then, what isn&#x27;t more cheaply built nowadays? It also is slightly louder than the Wahl clipper I previously owned for 15 years, probably due to the lighter weight housing. But all this was simply a minor disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;  The clipper is lighter than the old one and cuts well which is, after all, its purpose. It came with a full set of attachments and the kit was reasonably priced; so it qualifies as a very good deal. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Everything that comes in the box is useful for personal use or in a barbershop. I highly recommend this product if you are on a budget and need something that can definitely handle any job you can throw at it. I personally use it on myself and i can tell that it does the same job that something twice its price can do exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power is good for long or short hair, the grip is very nice, and the scissors that come with it are very sharp, to my surprise. The only thing i would complain about is the case is durable but sorta crappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 for home use.</li>
            <li> Wahl is a great quality haircut kit.  I can now cut my husband&#x27;s hair quickly and easier than ever before.</li>
            <li> The blades are well fit and sharp.  No hair pulling.  Easy to use. Unit exceeds my expectations. Just need to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Nice set of clippers.  We&#x27;ve used Wahl for a long time and I cut my hubby&#x27;s hair about every 3 weeks Very high and tight.  They seem to last for about a year or so but for the price, that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because the other ones I owned just didn&#x27;t get the job done. My fiance has thick hair and these cut through his hair wonderfully. They didn&#x27;t tug or pull hair which was what I was looking for when I bought them.</li>
            <li> A man&#x27;s haircut is anywhere from $12-$15 a pop, every two weeks. Maybe more if you go somewhere really nice. That adds up! So when my husband asked me to cut his hair at home to save money, I was all for it. Originally we had bought a higher end Con-Air brand. Too soon after purchasing, the power went downhill and the blades seemed dulled. Obviously it cut like s---. I had been eyeing this model so when Amazon had one of their awesome daily deals on Wahl I didn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it. What a difference! It cuts beautifully. Lots of power, sharp blades. It comes with a lot of accessories but I can&#x27;t say I have used all of them. The scissors it comes with are dull and cheap, the comb teeth are too big (for short hair), and the plastic garbage bag used as a barber cape is a joke. BUT the actual clippers, the most important part, works really well. The combs clip on easily and the side gauge slides effortlessly. Very easy to use. It looks nice too with a chrome finish. Highly recommend. This is great for home use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Wahl clipper prior to this one, both worked great. The last one I purchased several years ago, worked wonderfully, and recently died. Considering I spent only $25-30 on it, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to last forever, so I was very happy with that purchase. This one, however, is garbage. It misses or pulls hair. I oiled it as the directions said to. After a few uses, I can&#x27;t take it anymore. I had to go to a barber after each haircut attempt. It&#x27;s not only painful to use, it also leaves long patches of hair. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I sent this to a good friend of mine for his birthday. I called to check up on it and see how it was holding up and&lt;br /&gt;he said he enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> This kit has everything you need for cutting hair at home.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times cutting my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair and it works great.  My son is only a year old and I like how quiet the clipper is.  I was worried it would scare him, but it didn&#x27;t...it actually made him giggle (I think the vibration tickled his head).  I also thought it would be hard to learn to use the clipper, but it comes with a small &#x27;how to&#x27; booklet that helped (but I also practiced on my husband before taking it to my son&#x27;s head :)).  This should help us save time and money!</li>
            <li> Use it to shave the dogs - works like a charm. Doesn&#x27;t overheat, isn&#x27;t noisy and it doesn&#x27;t make them nervous (the noise).</li>
            <li> Bought the clipper for our new dog that has long, curly hair.  After using for quite awhile, it got warm and I turned it off.  But after 10 minutes or so, it was fine.  Having never groomed a dog before, I was hesitant but it worked well and the dog looks great!</li>
            <li> The snap ons do not really follow the depth cut that I expected. I used it on my beard and it made an uneven mess. Had to use a sissors to straighten it up.</li>
            <li> I use these once a week at least and they work great very good design can cut all lengths of hair</li>
            <li> At first I started using this machine and it felt professional made of great quality great feel and not loud at all, However within 10 minutes the body of the machine started getting extremely hot. My hand started getting dark pink red! Sadly I had to send it right back...</li>
            <li> HONESTLY, these clippers, despite the glowing reviews of people who say they cut like butter, DON&#x27;T cut like butter. I wish they did, as it takes too many passes to complete my own haircut, ESPECIALLY when using the 3/4 guard on the top of my head. What&#x27;s even more unfortunate is that I don&#x27;t currently have a three-way mirror and poor lighting in my bathroom, requiring many passes on the back of my head to get it even. It works better than my dying pair and it looks nice, BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AS WELL AS PEOPLE SAY. Get a ceramic-bladed set; these types of clippers tend to perform better on cutting in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cheap/Sexy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Cheap(low-quality)/Metal blade/Takes twice as long to cut my hair and much more patience</li>
            <li> I read all of the other reviews looking for a replacement piece for the VIdal Sassoon clippers I had. I have had them for over 10 years and wanted to keep them. However, no blades could be found and I didn&#x27;t want to buy something if I didn&#x27;t know it would fit. These had replacement blades available so I got them. So far so good. It came in a nice carrying case with plenty of attachments to go with it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this all the time for his kinky beard and it keeps him looking so fresh and so clean clean!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd kit ordered, but not the same company.&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job and no complaints so far.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for the performance and price.</li>
            <li> It has everything I need to have a clean hear cut. The price is also decent, so in all this is a good product, I like it.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Conair unit with this one. These clippers are better made than my old set, and they cut very smoothly. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a real keeper of a trimmer.  The convenient storage case is excellent.  So many different guards give you lots of choices as well.</li>
            <li> Worked great one time for a buzz cut, then the blades misaligned and the motor burned out as a result. Could have been user error, but mechanical error played a part.</li>
