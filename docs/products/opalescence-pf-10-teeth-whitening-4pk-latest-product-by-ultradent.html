            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this whitener!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Arrived safely and promptly!</li>
            <li>Worked just fine, happy with price.</li>
            <li>So if your looking for an effective and fast way to whiten your teeth, this is the best solution out there!</li>
            <li>The results were astounding.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the concentration % but that product worked effectively.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor has a nice scent to it, not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive and this product is perfect for whitening.</li>
            <li>If your gums are sensitive, 10% is the perfect strength.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time bleaching--I used 15% trays for about 8 days and noticed great results.</li>
            <li>I used 1/2 syringe for the top and bottom</li>
            <li>(3) IMPORTANT!</li>
            <li>My dentist was so pleased with the results that my before and after pictures have been used at dental conferences.</li>
            <li>I love this whitener.  </li>
            <li>You should also be sure you don&#x27;t have cuts on your gums.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you have no cavities.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to avoid Soda or Coffee since that will stain your teeth.</li>
            <li>Hello, I absoultely love this product.</li>
            <li>One day I woke up with pain on most of the teeth</li>
            <li>What more could I want?</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it promptly and safely.</li>
            <li>When I ran out and contacted my dentist, they told me that they switched to Opalescence because they felt it was a better product --</li>
            <li>Literally, the MOST intense pain that I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>gel itself definitely does a good job (actually, a great job)</li>
            <li>When I woke up, the pain was even more agonizing.</li>
            <li>Whitened my teeth much better that the Opalescence that the dentist gave me.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased because the company was selling the product with $24 and the shipping was $35.</li>
            <li>Love being able to buy this product online..</li>
            <li>They have a stronger product that I am sure would do the job.  </li>
            <li>I think the 10% product may be OK for maintenance once you have your teeth whitened.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and if you buy it from a dentist office you can be sure it has not been refilled with something unsafe.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to those who want a quick good result for cheap.</li>
            <li>I found the 10% to take more days to effectively whiten your teeth, but it is probably good for those with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>So I guess it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Product a good idea for first timer users to determine your sensitivity level</li>
            <li>Works fast, has a pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if it were used more consistently it would produce even better results.  </li>
            <li>(1) Go easy on the gel.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a lower strength version than the one I used from my dentist&#x27;s office yet it noticeably brightened my lightly coffee stained teeth in one treatment without pain afterwards.</li>
            <li>The gel is to lightly cover your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go light and bought the 10% concentration to use overnight for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I was using the 5% before, and for me the 10% is even better because I only need about 2 nights, 3 maximum, for a really good whitening job, then can go months with just a one-night tune-up now and then.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it arrived super quick (within 2 days of ordering) &lt;</li>
            <li>Overall I give this a 4/5 as it is very light and easy to use, however the concentration isn&#x27;t as effective as one would imagine.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is better to buy from dentist at higher price or a reliable source rather than this company that provides a useless/defected but cheap product.</li>
            <li>When trying this product for the first time do not use more than directed.  </li>
            <li>My experience with Opalescence over the past 3 years has always been excellent.  </li>
            <li>I just used this product last week and its good.  </li>
            <li>It is mess free, easy to install in the tray, tastes pleasant, and although I had been warned that some people have sensitivity to the product, I have had no problems.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly and there were no issues.</li>
            <li>I probably would buy a lot more of it and use it more regularly.</li>
            <li>Now if I could only find that fluoride toothpaste cheaper on-line that my dentist is charging $25 a tube for I would really be one happy camper.</li>
            <li>However, it comes at a high price - pain, pain, and more pain.</li>
            <li>When I used Nupro Gold I could tell a difference in the shade of my teeth the very first day.  </li>
            <li>so I was only able to use two, but I paid for four!</li>
            <li>I really like Opalescence because it does a good job in a relatively short time.  </li>
            <li>All in all everything was worth it.</li>
            <li>If you use this product be sure to space out the treatments to avoid getting sensitive and sore gums--effective a getting coffee stains out.</li>
            <li>smile.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product especially how much it lightened my husband&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>and i have used opalescence PF about 4 times, and we get bright but natural looking white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;sometimes</li>
            <li>so one syringe gave me a total of 2 top and bottom applications.  </li>
            <li>I had a bit of sensitivity the first night</li>
            <li>, tho can&#x27;t remember if I did shorter stints at first to get used to them.    </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re willing to go through some pain for white teeth, more power to you.</li>
            <li>;)   </li>
            <li>they should take better care of their customers and spend the extra 50 cents to send their products in a box!!!</li>
            <li>It definitely tastes better than Nupro (not that I eat it</li>
            <li>I noticed results after the first overnight use.</li>
            <li>I had sensitivity at first two days than its gone.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the same as my dentist charges much more for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather let my teeth yellow. : )</li>
            <li>Priced reasonably!</li>
            <li>Stop it right away when you don&#x27;t feel very well.</li>
            <li>I will not lie, if you have very sensitive teeth, this may not be worth it to you since it hurts A LOT.</li>
            <li>Ocassionaly, I felt pain in my nerve as if someone is poking a large needle to my gums.</li>
            <li>Then when you put the tray into your mouth, gently push on each \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; so that the tray/gel sticks to your tooth.</li>
            <li>+ I worry about safety of whitening, too, tho know that because of concerns about chlorination -- that hydrogen peroxide is MUCH safer than the chlorine that&#x27;s in all sorts of bleach.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This 10% teeth whitening product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I get the 35% and use that for much shorter periods of time.</li>
            <li>Really brightens my teeth wo a lot of sensitivity</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses it and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very soon after order was placed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satistisfied.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t because I really need it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really whiten like I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>My dentist said 10% for 30 minutes would be sufficient, &amp; I did as she said, but when I finished the pack, I did not think my teeth were that much whiter.  </li>
            <li>I chose 10% to start off light, and work my way up if necessary, and to avoid tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Ready for this?</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, product works very well</li>
            <li>This product is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than it would be through my dentist.</li>
            <li>Gums were sensitive during the first application, but fine with all subsequent applications.</li>
            <li>I originally bought a 35% strength product only to find my gums weren&#x27;t made of leather.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased whitening products through my dentist and it cost hundreds for the molding and initial product.</li>
            <li>I experienced very little sensitivity, which started in the 2nd week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Opalescence has many different concentrations to choose from low to high.</li>
            <li>I cant devote enough time to wear the 10% long enough to do any good.</li>
            <li>This  &amp;#34;10% product was not strong enough to really do a good job whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have custom trays.</li>
            <li>If you use too much your teeth may be sensative to hot/cold, more is not necessarily better.  </li>
            <li>I unscrewed the needle top off because that seemed like a waste of product, and dotted the tray on the gum line.</li>
            <li>For just a few more bucks I get FOUR from.</li>
            <li>Typically I sleep with the retainer and gel in at night, but have put it in during the day when around the house for a few hours and that works great too.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Denise from East Islip, New York</li>
            <li>It read 35% - jeez, hire new packing folks.</li>
            <li>my custom made whitening trays from my dentist which allows me to skip my crowned teeth and just concentrate on my very old teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product I was getting from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Complete poop!</li>
            <li>I recommend starting with 10% first.  </li>
            <li>I already owned dentist-made custom molds from years ago, so I have white teeth for $5, and enough left for 6 more applications.</li>
            <li>I used the lowest power because my teeth are pretty white.  </li>
            <li>If you have stained or not so white teeth, I would try a higher percentage.</li>
            <li>The only good news was that I only wasted $15 by buying here instead of the $40 that my dentist charges.</li>
            <li>After tray/gel come out, immediately brush your teeth with a non-flouride toothpaste (we&#x27;ve got little kids, so that was easy).</li>
            <li>No longer live in Downtown Chicago, but I still use this product suggested by my old dentist there.</li>
            <li>The product and packaging is small and convenient, where you can easily put new syringes away.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my sensitive teeth which is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li>However, this seller clearly makes their profit on the shipping costs.</li>
            <li>but I can definitely say Opalescense 10% worked MUCH faster.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when that happened with this product.</li>
            <li>My teeth did indeed feel alittle sensitive but</li>
            <li>I was charged nearly $10 for shipping this product which is way out of line given the product size and weight.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, but this product didn&#x27;t cause a problem.</li>
            <li>Same as what the dentist sells but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and the 10% works for me to maintain the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use an entire syringe for a top and bottom application (a little goes a long way and if you use too much a lot of the product will just ooze out of your whitening tray).  </li>
            <li>Currently, I am stuck with 8 unused surringes, so I&#x27;m seriously considering my own proposal.</li>
            <li>They are very thin and super comfortable.</li>
            <li>The 10% concentration is a little weak (good for sensitive teeth) and I needed to used all four tubes.  </li>
            <li>One of the four tubes were broken and had to be thrown out, but, other than that everything else was good.</li>
            <li>I like this super low dosage, it results in less sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I would stop using it, but my teeth are not whitening evenly - only the bottoms (part near the gumline is darker.)     </li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t so sensitive the next day.</li>
            <li>First, it didn&#x27;t work and second the content of the last syringe was almost dry.</li>
            <li>If you want 1 hr or less treatments, buy a higher percent.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only applied it 5 times and you totally see the difference.</li>
            <li>Just  know that prior to using this or any whitening gel you should rinse with a fluoride rinse twice daily and brush with a sensitive toothpaste 2 weeks before using.  </li>
            <li>I ordered to large boxes of Crest White Strips that are each at least 4 times as large as this one package of whitening gel.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have at e dentist office for less than a third of the price.  </li>
            <li>This is half of the price your dentist will sell this product to you and it is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Dry your teeth off with a washcloth, apply a line of gel about mid-way between the bottom and top of teeth indention in your tray, place tray in mouth, press down firmly to make gel spread and leave on for one hour or even overnight.</li>
            <li>but sometimes there may be a little too much in the tray).    </li>

            <li> Be sure you have no cavities.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to avoid Soda or Coffee since that will stain your teeth.</li>
            <li> Hello, I absoultely love this product.</li>
            <li> One day I woke up with pain on most of the teeth</li>
            <li> What more could I want?</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it promptly and safely.</li>
            <li> When I ran out and contacted my dentist, they told me that they switched to Opalescence because they felt it was a better product --</li>
            <li> Literally, the MOST intense pain that I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> gel itself definitely does a good job (actually, a great job)</li>
            <li> When I woke up, the pain was even more agonizing.</li>
            <li> Whitened my teeth much better that the Opalescence that the dentist gave me.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased because the company was selling the product with $24 and the shipping was $35.</li>
            <li> Love being able to buy this product online..</li>
            <li> They have a stronger product that I am sure would do the job.  </li>
            <li> I think the 10% product may be OK for maintenance once you have your teeth whitened.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and if you buy it from a dentist office you can be sure it has not been refilled with something unsafe.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to those who want a quick good result for cheap.</li>
            <li> I found the 10% to take more days to effectively whiten your teeth, but it is probably good for those with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> So I guess it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Product a good idea for first timer users to determine your sensitivity level</li>
            <li> Works fast, has a pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if it were used more consistently it would produce even better results.  </li>
            <li> (1) Go easy on the gel.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a lower strength version than the one I used from my dentist&#x27;s office yet it noticeably brightened my lightly coffee stained teeth in one treatment without pain afterwards.</li>
            <li> The gel is to lightly cover your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go light and bought the 10% concentration to use overnight for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I was using the 5% before, and for me the 10% is even better because I only need about 2 nights, 3 maximum, for a really good whitening job, then can go months with just a one-night tune-up now and then.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it arrived super quick (within 2 days of ordering) &lt;</li>
            <li> Overall I give this a 4/5 as it is very light and easy to use, however the concentration isn&#x27;t as effective as one would imagine.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is better to buy from dentist at higher price or a reliable source rather than this company that provides a useless/defected but cheap product.</li>
            <li> When trying this product for the first time do not use more than directed.  </li>
            <li> My experience with Opalescence over the past 3 years has always been excellent.  </li>
            <li> I just used this product last week and its good.  </li>
            <li> It is mess free, easy to install in the tray, tastes pleasant, and although I had been warned that some people have sensitivity to the product, I have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly and there were no issues.</li>
            <li> I probably would buy a lot more of it and use it more regularly.</li>
            <li> Now if I could only find that fluoride toothpaste cheaper on-line that my dentist is charging $25 a tube for I would really be one happy camper.</li>
            <li> However, it comes at a high price - pain, pain, and more pain.</li>
            <li> When I used Nupro Gold I could tell a difference in the shade of my teeth the very first day.  </li>
            <li> so I was only able to use two, but I paid for four!</li>
            <li> I really like Opalescence because it does a good job in a relatively short time.  </li>
            <li> All in all everything was worth it.</li>
            <li> If you use this product be sure to space out the treatments to avoid getting sensitive and sore gums--effective a getting coffee stains out.</li>
            <li> smile.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product especially how much it lightened my husband&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> and i have used opalescence PF about 4 times, and we get bright but natural looking white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;sometimes</li>
            <li> so one syringe gave me a total of 2 top and bottom applications.  </li>
            <li> I had a bit of sensitivity the first night</li>
            <li> , tho can&#x27;t remember if I did shorter stints at first to get used to them.    </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re willing to go through some pain for white teeth, more power to you.</li>
            <li> ;)   </li>
            <li> they should take better care of their customers and spend the extra 50 cents to send their products in a box!!!</li>
            <li> It definitely tastes better than Nupro (not that I eat it</li>
            <li> I noticed results after the first overnight use.</li>
            <li> I had sensitivity at first two days than its gone.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the same as my dentist charges much more for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather let my teeth yellow. : )</li>
            <li> Priced reasonably!</li>
            <li> Stop it right away when you don&#x27;t feel very well.</li>
            <li> I will not lie, if you have very sensitive teeth, this may not be worth it to you since it hurts A LOT.</li>
            <li> Ocassionaly, I felt pain in my nerve as if someone is poking a large needle to my gums.</li>
            <li> Then when you put the tray into your mouth, gently push on each \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; so that the tray/gel sticks to your tooth.</li>
            <li> + I worry about safety of whitening, too, tho know that because of concerns about chlorination -- that hydrogen peroxide is MUCH safer than the chlorine that&#x27;s in all sorts of bleach.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This 10% teeth whitening product works very well.  </li>
            <li> I get the 35% and use that for much shorter periods of time.</li>
            <li> Really brightens my teeth wo a lot of sensitivity</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses it and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very soon after order was placed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satistisfied.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t because I really need it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really whiten like I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> My dentist said 10% for 30 minutes would be sufficient, &amp; I did as she said, but when I finished the pack, I did not think my teeth were that much whiter.  </li>
            <li> I chose 10% to start off light, and work my way up if necessary, and to avoid tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Ready for this?</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, product works very well</li>
            <li> This product is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than it would be through my dentist.</li>
            <li> Gums were sensitive during the first application, but fine with all subsequent applications.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a 35% strength product only to find my gums weren&#x27;t made of leather.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased whitening products through my dentist and it cost hundreds for the molding and initial product.</li>
            <li> I experienced very little sensitivity, which started in the 2nd week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opalescence has many different concentrations to choose from low to high.</li>
            <li> I cant devote enough time to wear the 10% long enough to do any good.</li>
            <li> This  &amp;#34;10% product was not strong enough to really do a good job whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have custom trays.</li>
            <li> If you use too much your teeth may be sensative to hot/cold, more is not necessarily better.  </li>
            <li> I unscrewed the needle top off because that seemed like a waste of product, and dotted the tray on the gum line.</li>
            <li> For just a few more bucks I get FOUR from.</li>
            <li> Typically I sleep with the retainer and gel in at night, but have put it in during the day when around the house for a few hours and that works great too.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Denise from East Islip, New York</li>
            <li> It read 35% - jeez, hire new packing folks.</li>
            <li> my custom made whitening trays from my dentist which allows me to skip my crowned teeth and just concentrate on my very old teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product I was getting from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> Complete poop!</li>
            <li> I recommend starting with 10% first.  </li>
            <li> I already owned dentist-made custom molds from years ago, so I have white teeth for $5, and enough left for 6 more applications.</li>
            <li> I used the lowest power because my teeth are pretty white.  </li>
            <li> If you have stained or not so white teeth, I would try a higher percentage.</li>
            <li> The only good news was that I only wasted $15 by buying here instead of the $40 that my dentist charges.</li>
            <li> After tray/gel come out, immediately brush your teeth with a non-flouride toothpaste (we&#x27;ve got little kids, so that was easy).</li>
            <li> No longer live in Downtown Chicago, but I still use this product suggested by my old dentist there.</li>
            <li> The product and packaging is small and convenient, where you can easily put new syringes away.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my sensitive teeth which is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li> However, this seller clearly makes their profit on the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> but I can definitely say Opalescense 10% worked MUCH faster.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when that happened with this product.</li>
            <li> My teeth did indeed feel alittle sensitive but</li>
            <li> I was charged nearly $10 for shipping this product which is way out of line given the product size and weight.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, but this product didn&#x27;t cause a problem.</li>
            <li> Same as what the dentist sells but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and the 10% works for me to maintain the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use an entire syringe for a top and bottom application (a little goes a long way and if you use too much a lot of the product will just ooze out of your whitening tray).  </li>
            <li> Currently, I am stuck with 8 unused surringes, so I&#x27;m seriously considering my own proposal.</li>
            <li> They are very thin and super comfortable.</li>
            <li> The 10% concentration is a little weak (good for sensitive teeth) and I needed to used all four tubes.  </li>
            <li> One of the four tubes were broken and had to be thrown out, but, other than that everything else was good.</li>
            <li> I like this super low dosage, it results in less sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I would stop using it, but my teeth are not whitening evenly - only the bottoms (part near the gumline is darker.)     </li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t so sensitive the next day.</li>
            <li> First, it didn&#x27;t work and second the content of the last syringe was almost dry.</li>
            <li> If you want 1 hr or less treatments, buy a higher percent.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only applied it 5 times and you totally see the difference.</li>
            <li> Just  know that prior to using this or any whitening gel you should rinse with a fluoride rinse twice daily and brush with a sensitive toothpaste 2 weeks before using.  </li>
            <li> I ordered to large boxes of Crest White Strips that are each at least 4 times as large as this one package of whitening gel.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have at e dentist office for less than a third of the price.  </li>
            <li> This is half of the price your dentist will sell this product to you and it is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Dry your teeth off with a washcloth, apply a line of gel about mid-way between the bottom and top of teeth indention in your tray, place tray in mouth, press down firmly to make gel spread and leave on for one hour or even overnight.</li>
            <li> but sometimes there may be a little too much in the tray).    </li>
            <li> have semi-sensitive teeth - really nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> You actually place these thin trays in very hot water and then mold them to your mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very very sensitive after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> So he told me he was going to whiten my teeth, later he took molds of my teeth and gave me a single 20% gel applicant.</li>
            <li> The two boxes of white strips was under $4 total (for both boxes) as compared to nearly $10 for one small package from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, even with this one sometimes I only do every other night (for only maybe 3 or 4 hours a night), otherwise I get tooth pain.</li>
            <li> (2) Don&#x27;t leave &#x27;em on too long.</li>
            <li> Came 1 day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> you can leave it on, but it does dry out your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a drastic difference personaly, but after a single use, I always get a comment from somebody that my teeth look</li>
            <li> Drinking cold/hot liquids after the sessions was a bit hard since my teeth were quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> I suggest people to be careful when they use it.  </li>
            <li> Not much sensitivity either.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected and it was cheaper on-line.</li>
            <li> works over a period of careful use&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think you are only supposed to use it for a few minutes</li>
            <li> the end of two weeks, I used 3 syringes and noticed only a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> Be warned,  you may try a 10 or 15 % because it will make your teeth sensitive to cold or hot things for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Other hints/insights:       </li>
            <li> I tried this product, but it got my teeth feel uncomfortable for the first couple days</li>
            <li> ( I used this every other day).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are 20% peroxide, which may explain the extreme discomfort.</li>
            <li> I applied opalescence every other night to prevent gum irritation and tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the 15% - my dentist dropped me down to 15 from 20 because I went back after the first night with stabbing pain in one of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product from Amazon for a long time however when I carefully take the TIP off to use the product and start to push the syringe to release the liquefied fluid very slowly from the tube the round cover comes apart.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> It was too late to send back.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it ruins the tube.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;re-mineralizes\\&quot; the teeth, which might seal them again and/or cut down on the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I went down two shades within two weeks time.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the 15% (or less) will hurt less.</li>
            <li> This is half the price.</li>
            <li> I had little to no pain.</li>
            <li> it can sting your gums a little bit, so follow the instructions on application.</li>
            <li> If it burns or stings when you put it on and doesnt go away within a few minutes</li>
            <li> Wasted sleep wearing this junk on my teeth- when it didnt even do the job.</li>
            <li> two of the them were broken in the middle...</li>
            <li> One small dot -- a little dab will do ya --</li>
            <li> Working properly and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I needed to use it again to reach same level of brightness but it was worth it to avoid that terrible sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The process is a little annoying as gunky stuff is applied to your teeth using the previously made dental molds, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used the teeth whitening kits that are sold in stores and they worked</li>
            <li> I have used Opalescence in the past.</li>
            <li> but I now have to use very carefully in small doses.</li>
            <li> My teeth are hard to whiten.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I hardly knew I had it on.</li>
            <li> but it will take at least a week to see an improvement that is even.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t inform about the shipping cost until the item was shipped and was to late to do something.</li>
            <li> This product works well and is much less expensive than buying it from the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> By the way, if you don&#x27;t like bulky teeth trays try Watts Dental Wdsuper6 Thin Teeth Whitening Trays.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s weird, I wear the trays overnight and am awakened by a stab around 7 or 8 am.)</li>
            <li> Because he finds it difficult to sleep with it overnight, he uses it about an hour a day - still works wonders.</li>
            <li> Stabbing has not gone away</li>
            <li> It recurs somewhat during the day randomly, and is also bad when the teeth are exposed to cold.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 stabbing pains in the time it took me to write this.</li>
            <li> Maybe my teeth were not that bad</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just for me, but I had a very bad experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I have at e dentist office for less than a third of the price.  Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good product. This is the second time I have bought it. My teeth are very sensitive and this product is perfect for whitening.</li>
            <li> My teeth are hard to whiten.  I really like Opalescence because it does a good job in a relatively short time.  I was using the 5% before, and for me the 10% is even better because I only need about 2 nights, 3 maximum, for a really good whitening job, then can go months with just a one-night tune-up now and then.  So it&#x27;s lasting me even longer.  Good product!</li>
            <li> The process is a little annoying as gunky stuff is applied to your teeth using the previously made dental molds, but it really works.  I&#x27;d purchased my initial supply when I had the molds made at my dentist&#x27;s office, so this was a refill.  Same name brand product for 50%less.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it arrived super quick (within 2 days of ordering) &lt;br /&gt;It works best the longer you can leave it on, but it does dry out your mouth.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Love this product!  In the past I&#x27;ve used the teeth whitening kits that are sold in stores and they worked but I can definitely say Opalescense 10% worked MUCH faster.  What would take 5 applications to do with what is sold in stores only takes 1 application with this product. You don&#x27;t have to use an entire syringe for a top and bottom application (a little goes a long way and if you use too much a lot of the product will just ooze out of your whitening tray).  I used 1/2 syringe for the top and bottom so one syringe gave me a total of 2 top and bottom applications.  Dry your teeth off with a washcloth, apply a line of gel about mid-way between the bottom and top of teeth indention in your tray, place tray in mouth, press down firmly to make gel spread and leave on for one hour or even overnight. Even with what is sold in stores I experienced a bit of sensitivity so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when that happened with this product. I had a bit of sensitivity the first night and then none the next. I will be ordering this again.  By the way, if you don&#x27;t like bulky teeth trays try Watts Dental Wdsuper6 Thin Teeth Whitening Trays.  You actually place these thin trays in very hot water and then mold them to your mouth. They are very thin and super comfortable.</li>
            <li> No longer live in Downtown Chicago, but I still use this product suggested by my old dentist there. I had none of the problems others report, but perhaps that&#x27;s because my dentist said to:    (1) Go easy on the gel. One small dot -- a little dab will do ya -- on each \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; impression in your tight-fitting tray. Then when you put the tray into your mouth, gently push on each \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; so that the tray/gel sticks to your tooth. Too much means the gel oozes up and hits your gums, which DOES make them white and sore.    (2) Don&#x27;t leave &#x27;em on too long. I did 30 minutes I think -- watched a TV show -- and could do that maybe twice a day, tho can&#x27;t remember if I did shorter stints at first to get used to them.    (3) IMPORTANT! After tray/gel come out, immediately brush your teeth with a non-flouride toothpaste (we&#x27;ve got little kids, so that was easy). My dentist says that it \\&quot;re-mineralizes\\&quot; the teeth, which might seal them again and/or cut down on the sensitivity. Has to be NON-flouride toothpaste, tho.    (4) Other hints/insights:       + Store unused/extra syringes in the fridge to make &#x27;em last longer. It should take a while to go thru four of these, and room temps can cut the potency.       + I worry about safety of whitening, too, tho know that because of concerns about chlorination -- that hydrogen peroxide is MUCH safer than the chlorine that&#x27;s in all sorts of bleach.</li>
            <li> First, it didn&#x27;t work and second the content of the last syringe was almost dry. I have used Opalescence in the past.What BRIGHTERSMILE is selling is totally different with what I got from my dentist in terms of whitening effectiveness. In my opinion it is better to buy from dentist at higher price or a reliable source rather than this company that provides a useless/defected but cheap product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opalescence for about 5 years. My dentist was so pleased with the results that my before and after pictures have been used at dental conferences.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product I was getting from my dentist.  It came quickly and there were no issues.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, but it got my teeth feel uncomfortable for the first couple days ( I used this every other day).  Up to the third time, I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  My teeth feel very very sensitive after a few hours.  Maybe it is just for me, but I had a very bad experience with this product.  I suggest people to be careful when they use it.  Stop it right away when you don&#x27;t feel very well.</li>
            <li> I love this whitener.  It&#x27;s the one my dentist recommended and it works very well.  Be warned,  you may try a 10 or 15 % because it will make your teeth sensitive to cold or hot things for a few days.  You should also be sure you don&#x27;t have cuts on your gums.  Be sure you have no cavities.  You dont want any of the gel to hit those nerves. OUCH!!!! If it burns or stings when you put it on and doesnt go away within a few minutes you probably have a cut, burn and you should rinse it off and try again the next day or you should just try a 10% or 15% whitener.</li>
            <li> This is my first time bleaching--I used 15% trays for about 8 days and noticed great results. Just be sure to avoid Soda or Coffee since that will stain your teeth. I will not lie, if you have very sensitive teeth, this may not be worth it to you since it hurts A LOT. But if you&#x27;re willing to go through some pain for white teeth, more power to you. Ocassionaly, I felt pain in my nerve as if someone is poking a large needle to my gums. Drinking cold/hot liquids after the sessions was a bit hard since my teeth were quite sensitive. All in all everything was worth it. My teeth have never looked this white. Sometimes you have to pay a price for great results.</li>
            <li> Hello, I absoultely love this product. I recently went to Mexico and I was with a friend who is a dentist, we were at a cook out and we were talking and he noticed I had yellow teeth(according to my dad it looks like my teeth are \\&quot;smokers teeth\\&quot;). So he told me he was going to whiten my teeth, later he took molds of my teeth and gave me a single 20% gel applicant. He told me to apply to the mold and simply wear it over night. I did so and on the very next day, I saw the difference! My teeth did indeed feel alittle sensitive but nothing to get hung about. So far I&#x27;ve only applied it 5 times and you totally see the difference. I&#x27;ve been reading a few of the reviews about how this gives you intense pain, the solution is simply skip a treatment. One day I woke up with pain on most of the teeth and I called my friend and he said to simply skip that nights treatment, which I did and the next day I had little to no pain. So if your looking for an effective and fast way to whiten your teeth, this is the best solution out there!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing!! Wasted sleep wearing this junk on my teeth- when it didnt even do the job. Complete poop!</li>
            <li> I got what I wanted, at a great price, in a timely manner.  What more could I want?</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This 10% teeth whitening product works very well.  It is painless and you can see a difference after two nights applications.  It works well with my custom made whitening trays from my dentist which allows me to skip my crowned teeth and just concentrate on my very old teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a drastic difference personaly, but after a single use, I always get a comment from somebody that my teeth look \\&quot;so white!\\&quot;.  So I guess it works pretty good.  ;)   I only use one seringe of this stuff every month or so though.  I&#x27;m sure if it were used more consistently it would produce even better results.  If the price were lower I probably would buy a lot more of it and use it more regularly.</li>
            <li> This is a lower strength version than the one I used from my dentist&#x27;s office yet it noticeably brightened my lightly coffee stained teeth in one treatment without pain afterwards. I needed to use it again to reach same level of brightness but it was worth it to avoid that terrible sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Opalescence in the past and it&#x27;s what my dentist sold me the first time I whitened my teeth.  The 10% concentration is a little weak (good for sensitive teeth) and I needed to used all four tubes.  Next time I&#x27;ll try the stronger 15% solution.</li>
            <li> I cant devote enough time to wear the 10% long enough to do any good. I get the 35% and use that for much shorter periods of time.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist after Invisalign braces and teeth gradually became the desired white I was looking for without paying a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Really brightens my teeth wo a lot of sensitivity</li>
            <li> they sent the package in a an envelope when it should&#x27;ve been sent in a box.  by the time i received the package....the (envelope) was torn open and what i ordered was gone!  so bottom line i didn&#x27;t receive anything but an envelope.  they should take better care of their customers and spend the extra 50 cents to send their products in a box!!!</li>
            <li> Product a good idea for first timer users to determine your sensitivity level but it will take at least a week to see an improvement that is even. I would try the next strength if you can handle it and maybe just wear for a shorter length of time. Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> This is the product I recieved from my dentist, amazed at how well it worked.  When trying this product for the first time do not use more than directed.  The gel is to lightly cover your teeth.  If you use too much your teeth may be sensative to hot/cold, more is not necessarily better.  Typically I sleep with the retainer and gel in at night, but have put it in during the day when around the house for a few hours and that works great too.</li>
            <li> This is the best of all the teeth whitening products.  Works fast, has a pleasant taste.  The seller shipped it promptly and safely.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent teeth whitener.  Our whole family uses it and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I had been using Nupro Gold per my dentist office for about 5 years.  I have the custom trays my dentist office created. When I ran out and contacted my dentist, they told me that they switched to Opalescence because they felt it was a better product -- so, I jumped online to find a good price for it (my dentist office was charging like 50 bucks for 4 tubes).    I just used this product last week and its good.  When I used Nupro Gold I could tell a difference in the shade of my teeth the very first day.  With this product it took about two days.  It definitely tastes better than Nupro (not that I eat it but sometimes there may be a little too much in the tray).    It is gentle on my sensitive teeth which is definitely a plus.  You cant beat the price on Amazon.  All in all, this product gets two thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> Opalescense PF 20% Teeth Whitening is the Greatest Product.  It brings your teeth back to Pearly Whites.  I went down two shades within two weeks time.  I will use it always.  &lt;br /&gt;Denise from East Islip, New York</li>
            <li> OUCH! Literally, the MOST intense pain that I have ever experienced. As irrational as it may sound, I&#x27;d trade for a broken arm at times when the pain was beyond excruciating.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The gel itself definitely does a good job (actually, a great job) whitening your teeth - no question. However, it comes at a high price - pain, pain, and more pain. Initially, I was under the impression that the pain would go away. When I woke up, the pain was even more agonizing. No, wait... I didn&#x27;t have to wake up! I never fell asleep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have semi-sensitive teeth - really nothing out of the ordinary. I would not recommend this product, UNLESS you plan on taking some sort of a pain killer prior to its use. That, or some morphine - I am NOT kidding. Currently, I am stuck with 8 unused surringes, so I&#x27;m seriously considering my own proposal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are 20% peroxide, which may explain the extreme discomfort. Perhaps the 15% (or less) will hurt less. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Works great and is very good value for the money</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the product or the price. However, this seller clearly makes their profit on the shipping costs. I was charged nearly $10 for shipping this product which is way out of line given the product size and weight. I ordered to large boxes of Crest White Strips that are each at least 4 times as large as this one package of whitening gel. The two boxes of white strips was under $4 total (for both boxes) as compared to nearly $10 for one small package from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller about their shipping fees...they never responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, however, I would look elsewhere for a company to purchase from.</li>
            <li> Whitened my teeth much better that the Opalescence that the dentist gave me.  Easier to apply at night than to find time during the day to use.  Not much sensitivity either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this whitener! I have tried 2 others before I was told (by my friend, a dental assistant) to use this! I used it for three hours (1 hour a day) and I was complemented on my \\&quot;white\\&quot; teeth!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was recommended by my dentist and I use it with my invisilign retainer. I noticed results after the first overnight use. Gums were sensitive during the first application, but fine with all subsequent applications. I applied opalescence every other night to prevent gum irritation and tooth sensitivity. The product arrived very soon after order was placed. This is the best tooth whitening product that I have used. Great buy for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> My experience with Opalescence over the past 3 years has always been excellent.  Easy to use and I&#x27;m very satistisfied.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected and it was cheaper on-line.</li>
            <li> This product works well and is much less expensive than buying it from the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I did 6 bleaching procedures and the result is impressing for the buck. I recommend this to those who want a quick good result for cheap.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased because the company was selling the product with $24 and the shipping was $35. I wasn&#x27;t inform about the shipping cost until the item was shipped and was to late to do something. I could refuse the package when arrived but i didn&#x27;t because I really need it.</li>
            <li> Works good. Two uses and my teeth are visibly whiter.  Need a mold from your dentist to use it.</li>
            <li> Love being able to buy this product online..saved quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really whiten like I thought it would.  But it may have been because of the way I used it.  I kept it on for 30 minutes, not overnight as recommended in the instructions since it was only 10%.  My dentist said 10% for 30 minutes would be sufficient, &amp; I did as she said, but when I finished the pack, I did not think my teeth were that much whiter.  But I did like the product.  It didn&#x27;t burn or cause any discomfort &amp; I hardly knew I had it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the 15% - my dentist dropped me down to 15 from 20 because I went back after the first night with stabbing pain in one of my teeth. Stabbing has not gone away (it&#x27;s weird, I wear the trays overnight and am awakened by a stab around 7 or 8 am.) It recurs somewhat during the day randomly, and is also bad when the teeth are exposed to cold. I would stop using it, but my teeth are not whitening evenly - only the bottoms (part near the gumline is darker.)     I skipped a night after doing it 2 nights in a row, but tried it again last night and this morning - STAB. (That was after taking 1/2 a Vicodin as a precaution, last night.)    This is NOT WORTH IT. I have had 2 stabbing pains in the time it took me to write this.</li>
            <li> super !!! Working properly and less expensive.</li>
            <li> works over a period of careful use&lt;br /&gt;do not expect results instantly&lt;br /&gt;avoid staining foods while using&lt;br /&gt;my gf and i have used opalescence PF about 4 times, and we get bright but natural looking white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;sometimes it can sting your gums a little bit, so follow the instructions on application.</li>
            <li> This is half of the price your dentist will sell this product to you and it is exactly the same. I found the 10% to take more days to effectively whiten your teeth, but it is probably good for those with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. I have dental molds and put the gel in them. I think you are only supposed to use it for a few minutes but I leave it overnight. I have sparkly white teeth</li>
            <li> Worked just fine, happy with price. This is a win.</li>
            <li> I had my dentist make me custom trays and he recommended this product. I chose 10% to start off light, and work my way up if necessary, and to avoid tooth sensitivity. I unscrewed the needle top off because that seemed like a waste of product, and dotted the tray on the gum line. I slept on my back so no saliva could run into the tray. Maybe my teeth were not that bad so it only took one night. The results were astounding. I will make this a once a week habit.</li>
            <li> Works great and has a freshness date to assure product is not expired.  I use it in a custom made tray.  It is mess free, easy to install in the tray, tastes pleasant, and although I had been warned that some people have sensitivity to the product, I have had no problems.  I have used both the 10% and 15%.  I recommend starting with 10% first.  I will continue to order this product from this supplier.</li>
            <li> This worked well overnight. If you want 1 hr or less treatments, buy a higher percent.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. I used it in my custom trays every night, 8 hours a night and never saw a change at all. The only good news was that I only wasted $15 by buying here instead of the $40 that my dentist charges. Have ordered the 15% and will let you know how that works out.</li>
            <li> NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY ONLY AFTER 30 MINUTES MY TEETH WERE SCREAMING…..it just didn&#x27;t dawn on me to read the actual tube and if I did, I would have returned them immediately! Ready for this? It read 35% - jeez, hire new packing folks.</li>
            <li> Great for overnight bleaching</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, but this product didn&#x27;t cause a problem. After 3 two hour applications, my teeth are white. I already owned dentist-made custom molds from years ago, so I have white teeth for $5, and enough left for 6 more applications.</li>
            <li> two of the them were broken in the middle...so I was only able to use two, but I paid for four!</li>
            <li> Came 1 day earlier than expected. Great!</li>
            <li> If you use this product be sure to space out the treatments to avoid getting sensitive and sore gums--effective a getting coffee stains out.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested me to try opalescence gels with custom trays which I&#x27;ve worn overnight. I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 weeks and I got great results! I had sensitivity at first two days than its gone. I highly recommend this product if you have custom trays.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product!  Will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> This  &amp;#34;10% product was not strong enough to really do a good job whitening the teeth. They have a stronger product that I am sure would do the job.  I think the 10% product may be OK for maintenance once you have your teeth whitened.</li>
            <li> Works Excellent but should come with mouth piece so u can apply and leave on mouth for the time suggested</li>
            <li> i used to buy this from my dentist for $75! This is half the price. I can afford it. smile.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for whitening your teeth.  If your gums are sensitive, 10% is the perfect strength.  Stronger strengths can irritate your gums.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend who swears by it.  My friend also uses the Opalescence whitening toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this from my dentist for $10 per syringe.....Never Again! For just a few more bucks I get FOUR from.Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Just  know that prior to using this or any whitening gel you should rinse with a fluoride rinse twice daily and brush with a sensitive toothpaste 2 weeks before using.  It will help with any sensitivity you may have  and you can also continue to use throughout whitening process.</li>
            <li> I have used this product from my dentist and had no idea I could order it online.  It is a great product that yeilds great results.  I used the lowest power because my teeth are pretty white.  If you have stained or not so white teeth, I would try a higher percentage.</li>
            <li> It works great and it whitened my teeth pretty good  Great value for your money and it&#x27;s easy to use. I had some sensitivity issue but with a good toothpaste problem disappears.</li>
            <li> This definitely works but it gave me a migraine. Not the products fault but I now have to use very carefully in small doses.</li>
            <li> Same as what the dentist sells but much cheaper. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, product works very well</li>
            <li> Does not seem to make a big difference in whitening my teeth!</li>
            <li> The syringes were not sealed properly. By the time I used it... It was too late to send back. This product is not the real deal. I have used this product for years, and if you buy it from a dentist office you can be sure it has not been refilled with something unsafe. Rip off!!!</li>
            <li> Good price, works well.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product from Amazon for a long time however when I carefully take the TIP off to use the product and start to push the syringe to release the liquefied fluid very slowly from the tube the round cover comes apart.  Therefore, it ruins the tube.  One can’t get any liquid out of the tube because it spreads out gooey and it is destroyed.  This happens with both 10% and the 15% that I have been ordering.  I tried to contact you people for quite sometime regarding this matter with NO REPLY.</li>
            <li> One of the four tubes were broken and had to be thrown out, but, other than that everything else was good.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, and the 10% works for me to maintain the whiteness of my teeth.  It takes longer though so have patience if you have extremely yellow teeth.  If you don&#x27;t have alot of sensitivity, I would recommend 15 or 20%.</li>
            <li> Good product. Much cheaper than it would be through my dentist. The tubes are definitely smaller than the last time I ordered but oh well.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a 35% strength product only to find my gums weren&#x27;t made of leather.  Don&#x27;t let the 10% label dissuade you.  This gel does the job.  I think it&#x27;s the same as my dentist charges much more for.  After the second treatment, I saw an improvement and my gums were not burning at all.  Now if I could only find that fluoride toothpaste cheaper on-line that my dentist is charging $25 a tube for I would really be one happy camper.</li>
            <li> I like this strength. My teeth aren&#x27;t so sensitive the next day. This is a good product for me to use</li>
            <li> I originally purchased whitening products through my dentist and it cost hundreds for the molding and initial product. I used nite white and I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the concentration % but that product worked effectively. (When friends and colleagues comment on how white your teeth are, you know it works!) That was 9 years ago. Over the years, I did a touch up with nite white but decided to try another product the next time around. Based on good reviews, I purchased Opalescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opalescence has many different concentrations to choose from low to high. The product and packaging is small and convenient, where you can easily put new syringes away. The mint flavor has a nice scent to it, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been awhile since I used a whitening gel. I decided to go light and bought the 10% concentration to use overnight for two weeks. I tried my best to stick to the schedule but missed a day each week. I avoided foods (coffee/tea) that are known to stain teeth while using this product. I experienced very little sensitivity, which started in the 2nd week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of two weeks, I used 3 syringes and noticed only a very slight difference. I like the product overall and can see myself buying it again. For overnight use, I&#x27;d recommend trying the 15% concentration. Any concentration above that should follow the directions of timed use. Overall I give this a 4/5 as it is very light and easy to use, however the concentration isn&#x27;t as effective as one would imagine.</li>
            <li> the 10% is comfortable and whitens my teeth without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> This worked well for my husband and myself. I like this super low dosage, it results in less sensitivity. However, even with this one sometimes I only do every other night (for only maybe 3 or 4 hours a night), otherwise I get tooth pain.</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist ordered me to get.</li>
            <li> ego purchase.  I&#x27;d rather let my teeth yellow. : )</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product especially how much it lightened my husband&#x27;s teeth. Because he finds it difficult to sleep with it overnight, he uses it about an hour a day - still works wonders. Follow directions and your teeth will shine. I will definitely reorder. This product was recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li> Arrived safely and promptly! Priced reasonably!</li>
