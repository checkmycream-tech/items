            <li>Young Living Essential Oils are the Best...</li>
            <li>This Young Living Essential Lemon oil is great for so many uses.</li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it again.</li>
            <li>Only a drop or two will do for your dishwasher along with your own dishwashing detergent.  </li>
            <li>It smells really fresh.  </li>
            <li>Young Living does a great job with its essential oils.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great in water (which I am not thrilled about drinking).  </li>
            <li>Love this essential oil.</li>
            <li>But it served its purpose and it was very fragrant!</li>
            <li>I am glad you can finally get these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Other brands are watered down and all YL oils are very pure and made with the best quality.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this oil after my original bottle (directly from YL) ran out.  </li>
            <li>One bottle would last a pretty long time, so it is a good value.</li>
            <li>Those essential oils combined, have a fresh, clean scent that reminds me of pine-sol.</li>
            <li>This one is amazing but when looking for an essential oil company, look no further...</li>

            <li>I used to be a Young Living supplier, but the cost of membership is too high.  </li>

            <li>Pay the extra price for Young Living.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I do not think this is authentic!!! :(( DO NOT BUY! Only buy from a distributor directly!</li>
            <li> LOVE Young Living essential oils!</li>
            <li> This lemon oil is very natural.  Only a drop or two will do for your dishwasher along with your own dishwashing detergent.  It smells really fresh.  It can also be used to freshen the air or a drop in a glass of water.  (put oil in glass first, then add water)Many uses..</li>
            <li> Love it but ... The aroma is not as strong as we would like.</li>
            <li> I do not think it smells as good as Now&#x27;s Lemongrass. But the Now brand is not organic sadly.</li>
            <li> I love lemon! One can put a few drops in water for drinking too. and, a pure and lovely scent!</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil after my original bottle (directly from YL) ran out.  I am very disappointed as this is not authentic Young Living oil.  It was clearly not the same quality and was reflected in the taste.  Buyer beware...NOT AUTHENTIC!</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants to have a mellow lovely lemony smell - this one takes the cake! We diffuse it in the office to help relax people.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love these oils.Young Living oils are the only ones I will use.This one is very good and smells just like a lemon,the price is good too.I will be purchasing more as well.I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> many, many uses and good for your health!</li>
            <li> Like opening a lemon right off the tree every time I open the bottle.  I use this in my DYI cleaning solutions and the house smells amazing. Great for cooking, and in my water, but you must use a glass container if you put it in your drinking water. The oils will adhere to plastic..</li>
            <li> Since using this in my water I do not have back spasms anymore.  If that doesn&#x27;t tell you what a wonderful product this is then nothing will.</li>
            <li> I mainly drink this in water. It tastes really good, and helps to mask chlorine taste in non-filtered water when traveling etc. I usually use about 5-6 drops in my 25oz. Camelbak water bottle. One thing I should mention when using in plastic water bottles is that once you use it, the bottle will make the water taste like lemon for quite a while! One bottle would last a pretty long time, so it is a good value. I also, use it in a homemade surface cleaner. I mix 50/50 water and hydrogen peroxide in spray bottle and then add lemon, tea tree and lavender. Those essential oils combined, have a fresh, clean scent that reminds me of pine-sol.</li>
            <li> Cap is different than my other Young Living oils. There are what looks to be plier all around the lid. It doesn&#x27;t smell right either &amp; I can&#x27;t return it. Lesson learned on not ordering directly from Young Living :(</li>
            <li> This oil is a great health benefit according to my research, it may seem pricey but it will last a year at 3 drops per day.</li>
            <li> Received on time delivery.  Excellent product</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this oil.  I like to mix it with distilled water and Thieves oil in a spray bottle and use for cleaning the countertop and vanity.</li>
            <li> Young Living has the best essential oils!  This one is amazing but when looking for an essential oil company, look no further... Pay the extra price for Young Living.  You get way more for your money.  Other brands are watered down and all YL oils are very pure and made with the best quality.  If you like Lemon - by all means try my personal favs - peace &amp; calming, valor, gentle baby and purification.</li>
            <li> I love tea, mostly green, but with a drop of this lemon, it is superb.  The smell is simualating with the tea.</li>
            <li> This Young Living Essential Lemon oil is great for so many uses. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> good quality oil  from young living.&lt;br /&gt;i have used their oils for years and always found their potency higher and more efffective than cheaper brands. you will get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Waiting to see how well it works</li>
            <li> Third bottle ... what can I say?  It&#x27;s great in water (which I am not thrilled about drinking).  But add a couple drops of lemon and then it&#x27;s a pleasure.</li>
            <li> A brand I can trust.  I place one to two drops in ice water.  It helps me to drink the necessary amount of daily water and helps to boost my immune system.  Tastes good.</li>
            <li> Love this essential oil. Drink in my water all day long.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this bad boy. I just wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it again. I think Young Living is overpriced for the same quality or less as other brands. But it served its purpose and it was very fragrant! Great seller, fast shipping! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love lemon so this makes tea and water eve better.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended putting a drop in a glass of water and drink, but it has a sweetish flavor that I&#x27;m not fond of.</li>
            <li> The oils are highest grade and always amazed at how they do so many things for our bodies and mind.</li>
            <li> Very medicinal. I love to disperse it, I love putting it in water to drink all day.&lt;br /&gt;Try it !</li>
            <li> Young Living Essential Oils are the Best...I purchase from Amazon when I am in a hurry to get an oil I have run out of or is out of stock with the company.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Young Living supplier, but the cost of membership is too high.  I am glad you can finally get these on Amazon.  Young Living does a great job with its essential oils.  I use this in my coffee.  Also great in water.  You always have lemon on hand in a convenient package.</li>
            <li> This oil is great.  I use it to mix with YL Peppermint and YL Lavendar.  It&#x27;s a wonderful mix for allergies.</li>
            <li> Lemon is the oil I use most and Young Living makes the best oils. I drink it in water (DO NOT put it in plastic cups) and diffuse it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. OVER PRICED and non refundable. NEVER ORDERING FROM COMPANY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> the oil didn&#x27;t last long. Not sure if it was full when I got it. My last bottle from another supplier lasted 2 months. This only a week.</li>
            <li> Love Young Living lemon Essential Oil! I use it everyday in my water, and have lost inches!</li>
            <li> Love this lemon oil.  It was late being delivered, but really, really like this oil!</li>
