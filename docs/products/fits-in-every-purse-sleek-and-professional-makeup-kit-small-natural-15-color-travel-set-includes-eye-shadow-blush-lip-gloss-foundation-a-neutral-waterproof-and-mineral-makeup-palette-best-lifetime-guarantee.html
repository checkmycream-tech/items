            <li>I was glad to review when asked after I saw this promotion.</li>
            <li>I love that it gives you a couple of choices on colors.</li>
            <li>eye shadow varies from color to color in pigment, some are a lot better than others.  </li>

            <li>I love that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about all the colors of the lip gloss, but I have tried all of them and love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better size than most make-up bags.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a mirror, it makes touching up throughout the day/night</li>
            <li>I love this makeup palette, It is compact and fits in my purse.</li>
            <li>I love being able to carry it in my purse just in case I don&#x27;t have time to put on my makeup in the morning</li>
            <li>I love the compact size also when I am traveling</li>
            <li>so I am glad that there is a blush in this palette.</li>
            <li>The case is tiny and compact but the colors inside are perfect and they go on the well</li>
            <li>I was able to get this with a coupon during a promotional period and plan on buying another one for myself.</li>
            <li>I just love the colors in the gloss but did not like that</li>
            <li>I love to play around with colors and find flattering looks, so</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>so they are perfect for my skin complexion and love the mirror great for when running late</li>
            <li>Oh, it was nice getting the product as a promotional offer for a true review.</li>
            <li>I use the eye shadow, and the lip gloss, but warning: the blush and concealer are not brown skin friendly!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I was offered a promotional coupon to try it!</li>
            <li>This compact will be perfect for our upcoming beach vacation where we a very limited on space.</li>
            <li>They may look bright but they actually go on much lighter and with just a pinch of color.</li>
            <li>tan and dark skin will only be able to use the eye-shadow, which is a a beautiful matte/shimmer look, and the lip gloss, which is beautiful and plumps the lips, giving them that juicy Kylie Jenner look!</li>
            <li>Other than that, we are very happy with the kit.</li>
            <li>super easy!  </li>
            <li>The mirror in it makes it easy to apply your makeup.</li>
            <li>Fits easily in my purse.</li>
            <li>I can easily pack just this</li>
            <li>However, I let my tween daughter who has a cool skin tone play with it, and the colors were much more flattering on her.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the colors!</li>
            <li>The lip gloss seemed to soak in rather quickly, and leave more of a stain on my lips.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t dunk it, but if you have a mishap, and catch it quickly, you&#x27;re probably ok.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and easy to apply and they don&#x27;t irritate her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>little kit!&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect kit for your locker, purse or travel.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to carry a huge makeup case.</li>
            <li>This is great to have as a backup or extra makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m warm skinned toned, and didn&#x27;t find the shades very flattering on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It has a variety of colors to fit all my styles and moods.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the portability and functionality of this makeup palette.</li>
            <li>can just use the mirror for when in my vehicle to apply the makeup and the colors lasts all day where no reapplying and they smooth to apply on</li>
            <li>The powder goes on smooth and has a light coverage.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow goes on smooth and lasts all day (8 hours).</li>
            <li>There is also the variety available to contour, so that&#x27;s a bonus too.</li>
            <li>The mirror is a great size, not tiny at</li>
            <li>I have a 16 year old daughter who is learning about experimenting with makeup, so I&#x27;ve been looking for good quality but inexpensive stuff for her to try.</li>
            <li>Very nice colors especially the eyeshadows but no lipbrush or anything at all to put the lip gloss no brush for blush,  or the face powder?</li>
            <li>I was lucky to be able to pick this up during a promotion for review, but I truly believe that the kit is a tremendous value at its listed price.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I was able to try it first.</li>
            <li>How fun is this palette?!</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty though there are no blues which is what I wear most around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>So glad I picked this up during a promotional period as it is a great little addition to my on the go bag.</li>
            <li>Love this is a great little product.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend using a good primer first.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is also a nice size; I like that is is larger than most.</li>
            <li>This set would also me good for a teen just beginning to experiment with makeup - affordable &amp; all in one.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I love the color palette and the makeup lasts and stays put very well.  </li>
            <li>Occasional it will work good.</li>
            <li>received this item at a discounted price, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>there are so many choices of colors and so much in the palette, I have used it a couple times too.</li>
            <li>4.0 out of 5 stars I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the colors, March 24, 2015</li>
            <li>You have basically everything you need for a full face of makeup except for eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li>The colors are light and fresh.</li>
            <li>the lighter shade on the right is perfectly in line with what I usually buy.</li>
            <li>One of of the rings I like about the Fitproline Deluxe Makeup travel set is it&#x27;s sleek black case, the pressed powder drawer is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Great product, it is extremely convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li>The big mirror is great to get a whole look at your face.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive a coupon for this product.</li>
            <li>I look for good quality makeup with nice looking colors that will last the entire day.</li>
            <li>the fitproline deluxe makeup travel set is awesome love it love how it small and compact where fits perfectly in my purse and is small enough for when i go camping where i dont have to bring a bunch of little cases of makeup its all in one and</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty bright, especially the lipstick.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had a lip brush to apply with but using your finger is not bad since it&#x27;s a sheer color.</li>
            <li>When I look at the colors that are there, I see cool tones and warm tones but not necessarily neutrals as some have said.  </li>
            <li>This product offers a nice variety of colors that are pretty neutral.</li>
            <li>when I tried the eye shadows, they were very light and glided softly on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>This makeup Palette is a great little travel kit.  </li>
            <li>So far I have only used the lip gloss and eye shadow, but this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the different colors that I could chose from with the eye shadows and the lip glosses.  </li>
            <li>I have the option to use them with this palette, and find the colors to be complimentary to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase this during a promotion.  </li>
            <li>the colors are the right shade of colors</li>
            <li>I wish the manufacturer would make another set for medium to dark skin, because the concealer and blush for this one is only suitable for fair to olive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an expensive makeup kind of girl so when I saw this available with a coupon for my honest  </li>
            <li>The foundation shades would work well for touch ups, but not so much for full coverage makeup.</li>
            <li>but I would absolutely purchase this again at full price to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is not my thing so much, but is not bad.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this palette!</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors.</li>
            <li>Several shades of lip glosses are in the kit, which I appreciate as I don&#x27;t love a lot of colors on my lips.</li>
            <li>The powder comes in 2 different colors which makes it work for most skin tones.</li>
            <li>When I opened it I noticed right away that it had a cheap powdery scent that I have smelt before from other cheap makeup kits.  </li>
            <li>It all truly looked so much prettier on my daughter&#x27;s cool skin tones, but I admit, I tend to like high end makeup.</li>
            <li>The compact is a medium size and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>The different sections pull out easy.</li>
            <li>I can easily change my look without bringing my entire makeup bag.</li>
            <li>It has just about everything you need in one small compact and it is great for busy women.</li>
            <li>I will be bringing this compact, foundation, and mascara instead of my rather large makeup bag.</li>
            <li>It reminds me a lot of makeup kits sold at Ulta, they are not horrible but definitely not high</li>
            <li>This is a handy little make-up set.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice compact little case.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have time for much anyway.</li>
            <li>I really like that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li>I really like that the makeup stays on all day with no need to reapply.</li>
            <li>I really like the eyeshadow colors as they are smoky looking.</li>
            <li>She really likes how well it fits in her pocket book and that all the makeup is contained in one compact set.  </li>
            <li>The wife really loves this and the colors.  </li>
            <li>Overall a smooth application for all the make up.</li>
            <li>Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care too much for purples, but I do like the blues and browns.</li>
            <li>I received an email with makeup tips which were very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors and the ease of application.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that the case is waterproof.</li>
            <li>the only thing I woud add would be a brush kit that fits with it- the only applicator of any kind that came with</li>
            <li>It has a palette of nice everyday colors.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was worried at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to putting stuff on my lips since my lips dry out so easily and become chapped with certain products but this product has not dried out my lips nor made them chapped.</li>
            <li>That makes only half of them good colors for me.</li>
            <li>There are two squares of face powder that pull out from a tray under the main part of the box.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and stand out.  </li>
            <li>so I looked decent going somewhere.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend as a travel makeup solution.</li>
            <li>I love that the case is not 1 dimensional, and has a little pull out tray which houses additional powders.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as my main palette, simply because not all the colts are right for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size, not too big and not too small.  </li>
            <li>not only in that it doesn&#x27;t break easily, but it also doesn&#x27;t pop open in my purse or bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so</li>
            <li>She is a very natural beauty,  </li>
            <li>First, let me admit that I am NOT a big make-up wearer.  </li>
            <li>and my look was complete!</li>
            <li>It easily fits in my little pouch inside my purse.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant but for me too much so for daily use.</li>
            <li>If you like natural, soft colors like myself, I highly recommend this beauty palette.</li>
            <li>ended up giving this to my young niece, the colors are definitely brighter than a lot of older women prefer and the quality of the makeup isn&#x27;t very high.  </li>
            <li>The case is strong and made of heavy plastic.</li>
            <li>This little makeup palette is just super!</li>
            <li>She has somewhat sensitive skin and has no problems with this makeup.  </li>
            <li>You really need a facial primer as well when using the makeup in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>She has sensitive, acne-prone skin and this causes no irritation to her face.</li>
            <li>I bought this to put in a dance bag for my almost 4 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>review is from: Makeup Palette - Professional 15</li>
            <li>The lipgloss color is true to the color in the photo, and is also long lasting as well.</li>
            <li>The lip glosses are pretty and offer a nice pop of color, the foundation powders didn&#x27;t offer any coverage for me at all and fell heavily into lines and small wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>None of the make up is super dark unless you choose to apply it that way.  </li>
            <li>Color Travel Set - Includes Eye shadow, Blush, Lip gloss, Foundation - Sleek Small Natural Waterproof Cheap Neutral and Mineral Eye Makeup Palettes at any time and</li>
            <li>I always had my makeup loose inside my purse always making a mess and never being able to find what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The case is a nice, hard plastic, but it is small and lightweight enough to fit in a standard size purse.</li>
            <li>I like how this is compact all in one spot with a make up mirror and would fit into my small purse.</li>
            <li>A lot of my shadows are harsh and very dry, causing my eyelids to show more creases and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The make-up case comes in a hard plastic case about one-and-a-half times the size of a glasses case, and has a top lid that pops up to open a mirror, six lip glosses, a blush, and six eye shadow shades, and a bottom drawer that opens to display two shades of foundation powder.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to my friends who are constantly looking for new makeup to buy.</li>
            <li>She has been having so much fun experimenting with her own makeup (not mine) and it has not caused any bad reactions with her skin.</li>
            <li>I have an young teen daughter who has been begging for a makeup palette like this.</li>
            <li>It comes with 6 shadows, 6 lip gloss, 1 blush, and 2 powders, Porcelain for natural skin, and Ivory for very white skin.</li>
            <li>At department store beauty counters I have paid for one makeup product what I spent on this whole beauty on the go palette.</li>
            <li>I personally keep it in my bag for those times I unexpectedly need a touch up or just to apply a bit of color if I&#x27;ve left home without applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>I like this makeup palette because all that I need to apply makeup with is all in one small black elegant portable mirror compact.</li>
            <li>I prefer the neutral eye shadow colors, but I have also tried the pink and a little of the purple; the eye shadow is long lasting and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin (typically I buy the lightest or second lightest shade available for powders and foundations), and</li>

            <li> I love that it has a mirror, it makes touching up throughout the day/night</li>
            <li> I love this makeup palette, It is compact and fits in my purse.</li>

            <li> I love the compact size also when I am traveling</li>
            <li> so I am glad that there is a blush in this palette.</li>
            <li> The case is tiny and compact but the colors inside are perfect and they go on the well</li>
            <li> I was able to get this with a coupon during a promotional period and plan on buying another one for myself.</li>

            <li> so they are perfect for my skin complexion and love the mirror great for when running late</li>
            <li> Oh, it was nice getting the product as a promotional offer for a true review.</li>
            <li> I use the eye shadow, and the lip gloss, but warning: the blush and concealer are not brown skin friendly!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I was offered a promotional coupon to try it!</li>
            <li> This compact will be perfect for our upcoming beach vacation where we a very limited on space.</li>
            <li> They may look bright but they actually go on much lighter and with just a pinch of color.</li>
            <li> tan and dark skin will only be able to use the eye-shadow, which is a a beautiful matte/shimmer look, and the lip gloss, which is beautiful and plumps the lips, giving them that juicy Kylie Jenner look!</li>
            <li> Other than that, we are very happy with the kit.</li>
            <li> super easy!  </li>
            <li> The mirror in it makes it easy to apply your makeup.</li>
            <li> Fits easily in my purse.</li>
            <li> I can easily pack just this</li>
            <li> However, I let my tween daughter who has a cool skin tone play with it, and the colors were much more flattering on her.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the colors!</li>
            <li> The lip gloss seemed to soak in rather quickly, and leave more of a stain on my lips.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t dunk it, but if you have a mishap, and catch it quickly, you&#x27;re probably ok.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and easy to apply and they don&#x27;t irritate her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> little kit!&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect kit for your locker, purse or travel.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to carry a huge makeup case.</li>
            <li> This is great to have as a backup or extra makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m warm skinned toned, and didn&#x27;t find the shades very flattering on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It has a variety of colors to fit all my styles and moods.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the portability and functionality of this makeup palette.</li>
            <li> can just use the mirror for when in my vehicle to apply the makeup and the colors lasts all day where no reapplying and they smooth to apply on</li>
            <li> The powder goes on smooth and has a light coverage.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow goes on smooth and lasts all day (8 hours).</li>
            <li> There is also the variety available to contour, so that&#x27;s a bonus too.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a great size, not tiny at</li>
            <li> I have a 16 year old daughter who is learning about experimenting with makeup, so I&#x27;ve been looking for good quality but inexpensive stuff for her to try.</li>
            <li> Very nice colors especially the eyeshadows but no lipbrush or anything at all to put the lip gloss no brush for blush,  or the face powder?</li>
            <li> I was lucky to be able to pick this up during a promotion for review, but I truly believe that the kit is a tremendous value at its listed price.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I was able to try it first.</li>
            <li> How fun is this palette?!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty though there are no blues which is what I wear most around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> So glad I picked this up during a promotional period as it is a great little addition to my on the go bag.</li>
            <li> Love this is a great little product.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend using a good primer first.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is also a nice size; I like that is is larger than most.</li>
            <li> This set would also me good for a teen just beginning to experiment with makeup - affordable &amp; all in one.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I love the color palette and the makeup lasts and stays put very well.  </li>
            <li> Occasional it will work good.</li>
            <li> received this item at a discounted price, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> there are so many choices of colors and so much in the palette, I have used it a couple times too.</li>
            <li> 4.0 out of 5 stars I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the colors, March 24, 2015</li>
            <li> You have basically everything you need for a full face of makeup except for eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li> The colors are light and fresh.</li>
            <li> the lighter shade on the right is perfectly in line with what I usually buy.</li>
            <li> One of of the rings I like about the Fitproline Deluxe Makeup travel set is it&#x27;s sleek black case, the pressed powder drawer is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Great product, it is extremely convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> The big mirror is great to get a whole look at your face.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive a coupon for this product.</li>
            <li> I look for good quality makeup with nice looking colors that will last the entire day.</li>
            <li> the fitproline deluxe makeup travel set is awesome love it love how it small and compact where fits perfectly in my purse and is small enough for when i go camping where i dont have to bring a bunch of little cases of makeup its all in one and</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty bright, especially the lipstick.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had a lip brush to apply with but using your finger is not bad since it&#x27;s a sheer color.</li>
            <li> When I look at the colors that are there, I see cool tones and warm tones but not necessarily neutrals as some have said.  </li>
            <li> This product offers a nice variety of colors that are pretty neutral.</li>
            <li> when I tried the eye shadows, they were very light and glided softly on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> This makeup Palette is a great little travel kit.  </li>
            <li> So far I have only used the lip gloss and eye shadow, but this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the different colors that I could chose from with the eye shadows and the lip glosses.  </li>
            <li> I have the option to use them with this palette, and find the colors to be complimentary to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase this during a promotion.  </li>
            <li> the colors are the right shade of colors</li>
            <li> I wish the manufacturer would make another set for medium to dark skin, because the concealer and blush for this one is only suitable for fair to olive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expensive makeup kind of girl so when I saw this available with a coupon for my honest  </li>
            <li> The foundation shades would work well for touch ups, but not so much for full coverage makeup.</li>
            <li> but I would absolutely purchase this again at full price to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is not my thing so much, but is not bad.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this palette!</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors.</li>
            <li> Several shades of lip glosses are in the kit, which I appreciate as I don&#x27;t love a lot of colors on my lips.</li>
            <li> The powder comes in 2 different colors which makes it work for most skin tones.</li>
            <li> When I opened it I noticed right away that it had a cheap powdery scent that I have smelt before from other cheap makeup kits.  </li>
            <li> It all truly looked so much prettier on my daughter&#x27;s cool skin tones, but I admit, I tend to like high end makeup.</li>
            <li> The compact is a medium size and easy to open.  </li>
            <li> The different sections pull out easy.</li>
            <li> I can easily change my look without bringing my entire makeup bag.</li>
            <li> It has just about everything you need in one small compact and it is great for busy women.</li>
            <li> I will be bringing this compact, foundation, and mascara instead of my rather large makeup bag.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a lot of makeup kits sold at Ulta, they are not horrible but definitely not high</li>
            <li> This is a handy little make-up set.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice compact little case.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have time for much anyway.</li>
            <li> I really like that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li> I really like that the makeup stays on all day with no need to reapply.</li>
            <li> I really like the eyeshadow colors as they are smoky looking.</li>
            <li> She really likes how well it fits in her pocket book and that all the makeup is contained in one compact set.  </li>
            <li> The wife really loves this and the colors.  </li>
            <li> Overall a smooth application for all the make up.</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care too much for purples, but I do like the blues and browns.</li>
            <li> I received an email with makeup tips which were very helpful.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and the ease of application.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that the case is waterproof.</li>
            <li> the only thing I woud add would be a brush kit that fits with it- the only applicator of any kind that came with</li>
            <li> It has a palette of nice everyday colors.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was worried at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to putting stuff on my lips since my lips dry out so easily and become chapped with certain products but this product has not dried out my lips nor made them chapped.</li>
            <li> That makes only half of them good colors for me.</li>
            <li> There are two squares of face powder that pull out from a tray under the main part of the box.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and stand out.  </li>
            <li> so I looked decent going somewhere.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend as a travel makeup solution.</li>
            <li> I love that the case is not 1 dimensional, and has a little pull out tray which houses additional powders.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as my main palette, simply because not all the colts are right for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, not too big and not too small.  </li>
            <li> not only in that it doesn&#x27;t break easily, but it also doesn&#x27;t pop open in my purse or bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so</li>
            <li> She is a very natural beauty,  </li>
            <li> First, let me admit that I am NOT a big make-up wearer.  </li>
            <li> and my look was complete!</li>
            <li> It easily fits in my little pouch inside my purse.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant but for me too much so for daily use.</li>
            <li> If you like natural, soft colors like myself, I highly recommend this beauty palette.</li>
            <li> ended up giving this to my young niece, the colors are definitely brighter than a lot of older women prefer and the quality of the makeup isn&#x27;t very high.  </li>
            <li> The case is strong and made of heavy plastic.</li>
            <li> This little makeup palette is just super!</li>
            <li> She has somewhat sensitive skin and has no problems with this makeup.  </li>
            <li> You really need a facial primer as well when using the makeup in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> She has sensitive, acne-prone skin and this causes no irritation to her face.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in a dance bag for my almost 4 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> review is from: Makeup Palette - Professional 15</li>
            <li> The lipgloss color is true to the color in the photo, and is also long lasting as well.</li>

            <li> I have an young teen daughter who has been begging for a makeup palette like this. She is just learning how to use makeup and I felt like this would be the perfect way for her to experiment with a nice, quality compact that would travel well. The Easter Bunny left this in her Easter basket after I recieved a coupon for it. I was more than happy to review it and she is thrilled with it! It is a wonderful compact that has just about all your makeup needs- the only thing I woud add would be a brush kit that fits with it- the only applicator of any kind that came with it was an eyeshadow wand sponge. Being that there are six shades of lip glos and blush/powder in the base drawer, it would have made sense to include a powder puff and a lip gloss brush. Other than that, we are very happy with the kit. She has been having so much fun experimenting with her own makeup (not mine) and it has not caused any bad reactions with her skin.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little make-up set. This is great to have as a backup or extra makeup. I personally keep it in my bag for those times I unexpectedly need a touch up or just to apply a bit of color if I&#x27;ve left home without applying makeup.  Great colors that should work well for most. This set would also me good for a teen just beginning to experiment with makeup - affordable &amp; all in one.  The case is great, sleek &amp; compact as well. So glad I picked this up during a promotional period as it is a great little addition to my on the go bag.</li>
            <li> How fun is this palette?! I ordered this as part of a promotion and I use to work in cosmetics so I wanted to get my hands on it and test it out. First off the color choices are excellent. They may look bright but they actually go on much lighter and with just a pinch of color. The powders also are great for easy contouring of the cheeks or just to touch up a shine here and there. I prefer to use my own makeup brushes but on the go the ones that come with it are acceptable. This would be great for a girls night out in your handbag!</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the lip gloss and eye shadow, but this is a great product.  I love that it is compact so I can throw it in my purse and go!  I love the colors, purple is my favorite!  Overall this product has met my expectations!</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I use the eye shadow, and the lip gloss, but warning: the blush and concealer are not brown skin friendly! I am a caramel complexion. and the foundation and blush did not work for me at all. I wish the manufacturer would make another set for medium to dark skin, because the concealer and blush for this one is only suitable for fair to olive skin. tan and dark skin will only be able to use the eye-shadow, which is a a beautiful matte/shimmer look, and the lip gloss, which is beautiful and plumps the lips, giving them that juicy Kylie Jenner look! So I loved that! I look forward to more from this brand, I hope they make products for a wider variety of skin tones though!</li>
            <li> I have a 16 year old daughter who is learning about experimenting with makeup, so I&#x27;ve been looking for good quality but inexpensive stuff for her to try. When I was offered a promotional price to try this set I thought it would be perfect! It comes in a nice compact little case. All of the colors are great shades that will work on a variety of skin tones. She is very fair with brown hair and light eyes...she uses almost all of the shades here. The lip glosses are very subtle once you apply them, not bright like they look in the case, and not sticky like some glosses. It would be nice if it had a lip brush to apply with but using your finger is not bad since it&#x27;s a sheer color. This would be a great set to keep in your desk at work or to take in your carry-on on a plane.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of this Makeup Palette. I decided to try it to put in my suitcase to simplify my packing for going away on trips. The only thing that is missing is mascara, then it would be complete. It has a nice selection of colors and the case it comes in is a very nice size and quality. I was glad to review when asked after I saw this promotion.</li>
            <li> First, let me admit that I am NOT a big make-up wearer.  I am a stay-at-home-mom and spend my days covered in dirt, crayon, marker, food and/or whatever else my toddler is into that day.  I was looking for a compact makeup case to bring with me where ever I went,  so I wouldn&#x27;t have to bring a big makeup bag....because lets be honest- my purse IS a diaper bag and I don&#x27;t have time for much anyway. Then, I saw a promotional offer for this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  It has been everything I was hoping for in a compact. I love that it gives you a couple of choices on colors. None of the make up is super dark unless you choose to apply it that way.  The compact is a medium size and easy to open.  The mirror in it makes it easy to apply your makeup. The different sections pull out easy. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room. It&#x27;s perfect for on the go.  I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I look for good quality makeup with nice looking colors that will last the entire day. I don&#x27;t always have time to reapply my makeup during the day, so long lasting makeup is a must for me. With that being said, I am very happy with this makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow and blush are both high quality and apply easily and flawlessly. The eye shadow color palettes and blush/contour palettes offer a variety of beautiful colors to compliment any makeup look desired. I really like that the makeup stays on all day with no need to reapply. I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;The makeup comes in a convenient makeup kit. Included in this set are six eye shadows, six shiny lip gloss palettes, two tones of powder and a blush palette. The set also comes with a convenient mirror and eye shadow applicator. It is perfect for home or travel. This is a great makeup set at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this makeup at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This a handy travel make-up travel set. However, it is sort of big for my purse; it might not be big for yours. It measures roughly 5 1/4&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34; x 3/4&amp;#34;. The case is strong and made of heavy plastic. The colors are pretty bright, especially the lipstick. When using it, I did not notice any irritation or itching. The lipstick is glossy looking when on the lips. There&#x27;s a lot packed into that little box. I really like the eyeshadow colors as they are smoky looking. The lipstick is not my thing so much, but is not bad. There are two squares of face powder that pull out from a tray under the main part of the box. All in all, I like the set just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.*</li>
            <li> One of of the rings I like about the Fitproline Deluxe Makeup travel set is it&#x27;s sleek black case, the pressed powder drawer is a nice touch. It has a palette of nice everyday colors. The big mirror is great to get a whole look at your face. My one complaint is that there isn&#x27;t an  applicator for the lip gloss</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup palette for my daughter.  She really likes how well it fits in her pocket book and that all the makeup is contained in one compact set.  It come with an eyeshadow applicator which is double sided for the eye shadow and lip gloss I would assume.  The face powder slides out from its own tray underneath, but does not come with an applicator.  That being said, I love the color palette and the makeup lasts and stays put very well.  She has somewhat sensitive skin and has no problems with this makeup.  Overall, I feel that this set is great for on the go and would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Great product, though best use is for children when performing or for dress up. Colors are vibrant but for me too much so for daily use. Occasional it will work good. Container heavier and sturdier than it looks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup on a daily basis but when I do I stick to the more expensive brands.  Makeup is one of those items where you get what you pay for, cheap eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t contain enough pigments and tend to be poor.  I was given the opportunity to test out Fitprolines makeup kit and was hopeful that since it is a bit pricier, the quality would be higher.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this to my young niece, the colors are definitely brighter than a lot of older women prefer and the quality of the makeup isn&#x27;t very high.  When I opened it I noticed right away that it had a cheap powdery scent that I have smelt before from other cheap makeup kits.  It reminds me a lot of makeup kits sold at Ulta, they are not horrible but definitely not high quality.&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadow varies from color to color in pigment, some are a lot better than others.  I did have the issue that it tends to crease, I highly recommend using a good primer first.  The lip glosses are pretty and offer a nice pop of color, the foundation powders didn&#x27;t offer any coverage for me at all and fell heavily into lines and small wrinkles.  You really need a facial primer as well when using the makeup in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;All in all the kit is perfect for younger teens or even for girls to play dress up with.  It definitely isn&#x27;t for someone who is used to buying more expensive makeup brands.  The price should be about half of what it is listed for, if it was cheaper I would give the product an extra star.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted price, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The wife really loves this and the colors.  Colors are vibrant and stand out.  Very nice compact case and well built.  Very sleek design and is perfect to keep in your purse.  I love all the different colors. I can easily change my look without bringing my entire makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Great product, it is extremely convenient for traveling. I love the mirror and all of the colors. Would easily recommend to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> I was asked to review this make up palette as a promo deal but all opinions are my own!  Wonderful neutral color eye shadows to choose from. Will complement most skin tones. The case is definitely travel size. It easily fits in my little pouch inside my purse. Several shades of lip glosses are in the kit, which I appreciate as I don&#x27;t love a lot of colors on my lips. The blush had a coral undertone but blended on my cheeks perfectly. Overall a smooth application for all the make up. The promo also came with powder in two colors. A lighter and darker which with help as my skin changes during summer. And wasn&#x27;t at all cakey. It does come with an eye shadow applicator but I prefer my own brushes and sponges. I let my daughter take it and she loves it. The only thing I had to add was some mascara and my look was complete!</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery. I like this makeup palette because all that I need to apply makeup with is all in one small black elegant portable mirror compact. I love that it is waterproof. It comes with 6 shadows, 6 lip gloss, 1 blush, and 2 powders, Porcelain for natural skin, and Ivory for very white skin. I chose Porcelain. Fits easily in my purse. I always had my makeup loose inside my purse always making a mess and never being able to find what I was looking for. Now, I just take out the palette and use what I need to use in the moment and then put it back in my purse. I don&#x27;t like heavy makeup. My skin is very sensitive so when I tried the eye shadows, they were very light and glided softly on my eyelids. The compact comes with an applicator for the eye shadows.  I&#x27;m 63 years old and have a few wrinkles around my eyes. A lot of my shadows are harsh and very dry, causing my eyelids to show more creases and wrinkles. I don&#x27;t care too much for purples, but I do like the blues and browns. I wasn&#x27;t sure about all the colors of the lip gloss, but I have tried all of them and love them. They don&#x27;t last very long, but I can just reapply again. I only wished the compact had included a separate brush to apply lip gloss and a brush to apply the powder.  I have to use my finger or bring another small brush in my purse for lips and powder. I received an email with makeup tips which were very helpful. Great customer service. The price is really great. At department store beauty counters I have paid for one makeup product what I spent on this whole beauty on the go palette. I received this product as part of a promotion in exchange for my honest opinion. If you like natural, soft colors like myself, I highly recommend this beauty palette.</li>
            <li> This makeup Palette is a great little travel kit.  I&#x27;m not an expensive makeup kind of girl so when I saw this available with a coupon for my honest  I had to try it.  I was really surprised by the quality of this little kit when I opened the box.  It&#x27;s a good size, not too big and not too small.  Perfect for in my purse or bag on the go.  I really liked the different colors that I could chose from with the eye shadows and the lip glosses.  The only thing that would have made this kit a little nicer for me is if there were an application brush for the lip gloss and something to apply the powders and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and helpful review.  This review is 100% my own opinion of the item.</li>
            <li> I like how this is compact all in one spot with a make up mirror and would fit into my small purse. I&#x27;m warm skinned toned, and didn&#x27;t find the shades very flattering on my skin tone. However, I let my tween daughter who has a cool skin tone play with it, and the colors were much more flattering on her. The foundation shades would work well for touch ups, but not so much for full coverage makeup. The lip gloss seemed to soak in rather quickly, and leave more of a stain on my lips. It all truly looked so much prettier on my daughter&#x27;s cool skin tones, but I admit, I tend to like high end makeup. It&#x27;s actually a good variety of colors for the money, and my daughter is enjoying playing with the lip glosses. I got to review this as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, handy make-up palette.  It fits in your purse well to have with you on those long days when you may need a touch-up.  It&#x27;s a much better size than most make-up bags.  The colors are pretty though there are no blues which is what I wear most around my eyes.  When I look at the colors that are there, I see cool tones and warm tones but not necessarily neutrals as some have said.  The powders do seem to be neutral but not the lip colors, eye shadows or blushes.  That makes only half of them good colors for me.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this palette because I travel a lot and hate packing all my make-up. I can easily pack just this and it does everything for me! The quality of make-up is great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have very sensitive skin and was worried at first but this didn&#x27;t bother it at all.  The colors are perfect!</li>
            <li> I was stoked when I saw this product and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it and it did not disappoint!  The size is absolutely perfect to take it along with you.  It fits great in my purse!  It has a variety of colors to fit all my styles and moods.  I love that it has a mirror, it makes touching up throughout the day/night super easy!  I got this set during a promotional period but I would absolutely purchase this again at full price to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup palette, It is compact and fits in my purse. I love being able to carry it in my purse just in case I don&#x27;t have time to put on my makeup in the morning then I have the option to put it on any time during the day. The palette consists of 6 eye shadows, 6 lip glosses, 2 powders, and 1 blush. I wear A LOT of purples so this palette was perfect for me. I love the compact size also when I am traveling so I don&#x27;t have to carry a huge makeup case. This makeup palette allows me to carry it conveniently in my purse on a plane. With this makeup, it stays on for hours. I don&#x27;t have to constantly reapply my makeup throughout the day like I do with other makeups that I have used. I am obsessed with blush so I am glad that there is a blush in this palette. The powder comes in 2 different colors which makes it work for most skin tones. The lip gloss comes in various shades of reds and pinks and you can wear one application for hours. I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to putting stuff on my lips since my lips dry out so easily and become chapped with certain products but this product has not dried out my lips nor made them chapped. This is my go to makeup on the run. It always stays in my purse so unfortunately it only gets used when I am traveling or out and about but I plan on buying another one of these palettes to leave in my bathroom. I was lucky to receive a coupon for this product. I was so excited. I have recommended this product to my friends who are constantly looking for new makeup to buy. This is a must have if you wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the portability and functionality of this makeup palette. The case is a nice, hard plastic, but it is small and lightweight enough to fit in a standard size purse. I prefer the neutral eye shadow colors, but I have also tried the pink and a little of the purple; the eye shadow is long lasting and easy to apply. The lipgloss color is true to the color in the photo, and is also long lasting as well. I don&#x27;t wear powder or blush every day, but I like that I have the option to use them with this palette, and find the colors to be complimentary to my skin tone. The mirror is also a nice size; I like that is is larger than most. I would certainly recommend this palette!</li>
            <li> Love this is a great little product. It fits perfectly in my gym bag. I use it for after I leave the gym and I need to touch up my make up so I looked decent going somewhere. The case is tiny and compact but the colors inside are perfect and they go on the well and they stay on well.</li>
            <li> Yet one more beauty product confiscated from me by my 18 yo daughter! Fortunately I was able to try it first. I really like the colors and the ease of application. (Some kits require several applications.) My daughter always carries her makeup with her. Now, she leaves her regular makeup at home and carries just this kit for touchups during the day. She has sensitive, acne-prone skin and this causes no irritation to her face. The makeup itself is terrific - the eyeshadows are not heavy-dark, the lip glosses are not tacky. I was able to get this with a coupon during a promotional period and plan on buying another one for myself.</li>
            <li> Very nice colors especially the eyeshadows but no lipbrush or anything at all to put the lip gloss no brush for blush,  or the face powder? Are you supposed to use your fingers? There is only 1 eyeshadow sponge for 4 colors yet there are 6? For the price you would think it at least came with a tiny lip brush, 2 small eye shadow applicators and a small brush for blush and powder? Also this is a purple/ brown palette. Why isn&#x27;t there a shade of lip gloss to match? perhaps a nude or plum?</li>
            <li> the fitproline deluxe makeup travel set is awesome love it love how it small and compact where fits perfectly in my purse and is small enough for when i go camping where i dont have to bring a bunch of little cases of makeup its all in one and the colors are the right shade of colors cause i dont like dark colors so they are perfect for my skin complexion and love the mirror great for when running late can just use the mirror for when in my vehicle to apply the makeup and the colors lasts all day where no reapplying and they smooth to apply on</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in a dance bag for my almost 4 year old daughter.  It will be great for recitals.  I got it with a coupon so loved that too!  there are so many choices of colors and so much in the palette, I have used it a couple times too.</li>
            <li> This little makeup palette is just super! It has just about everything you need in one small compact and it is great for busy women. I was so excited when I was offered a promotional coupon to try it! The powder goes on smooth and has a light coverage. I still use foundation under it because, well, I&#x27;m over 30 and have some aging I&#x27;d like to hide. The eyeshadow goes on smooth and lasts all day (8 hours). I just love the colors in the gloss but did not like that I either have to use my finger to apply or carry a lip brush with me. This compact will be perfect for our upcoming beach vacation where we a very limited on space. I will be bringing this compact, foundation, and mascara instead of my rather large makeup bag.</li>
            <li> 4.0 out of 5 stars I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the colors, March 24, 2015&lt;br /&gt;By Fox&lt;br /&gt;Verified Purchase(What&#x27;s this?)&lt;br /&gt;This review is from: Makeup Palette - Professional 15 Color Travel Set - Includes Eye shadow, Blush, Lip gloss, Foundation - Sleek Small Natural Waterproof Cheap Neutral and Mineral Eye Makeup Palettes at any time and Halloween - Best Lifetime Guarantee (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I received that Makeup Palette-Professional 15 Color Travel Set a little over a week ago. I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the colors! You have basically everything you need for a full face of makeup except for eyeliner and mascara. You can put it on in the morning and not have to do any touch-ups, unless it is your lips of course. If you go out later you might want to do a touch up, but usually if you go out at night you do your make up a little different than what you would do when going out at night. Oh, it was nice getting the product as a promotional offer for a true review.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase this during a promotion.  The opinions are my own.  I bought this makeup palette to keep in my daughters dance class bag. It&#x27;s been perfect for her recital needs.  The colors are bright and easy to apply and they don&#x27;t irritate her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little palette. I love to play around with colors and find flattering looks, so when I saw this on sale for s discount, I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s great for touching up make up. I don&#x27;t use it as my main palette, simply because not all the colts are right for me. I love that the case is not 1 dimensional, and has a little pull out tray which houses additional powders. I also really like the fact that the case is waterproof. I wouldn&#x27;t dunk it, but if you have a mishap, and catch it quickly, you&#x27;re probably ok. This product offers a nice variety of colors that are pretty neutral. There is also the variety available to contour, so that&#x27;s a bonus too. Quite pleased with this palette, as I feel it&#x27;s great for touch ups and make up&lt;br /&gt;Beginners as well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for a friends daughter.  She is a very natural beauty,  but I wanted something small, that she can carry with her and take to college without taking up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;Great little kit!&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect kit for your locker, purse or travel.  Great color palette, It includes 6 shadows, 6 lip gloss, 1 blush, and 2 powders. Very nice variety of colors that would be great for a variety of skin colors.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased with a coupon, and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent travel make-up solution! I am so pleased with this item. The make-up case comes in a hard plastic case about one-and-a-half times the size of a glasses case, and has a top lid that pops up to open a mirror, six lip glosses, a blush, and six eye shadow shades, and a bottom drawer that opens to display two shades of foundation powder. I have pale skin (typically I buy the lightest or second lightest shade available for powders and foundations), and the lighter shade on the right is perfectly in line with what I usually buy. The one on the left I would estimate to be about two shades darker. I&#x27;ve actually gotten some use out of the foundation shade on the left too as an additional tone to blend with the brown eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The features about this make-up kit that put it a step above others I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;- The case is durable, not only in that it doesn&#x27;t break easily, but it also doesn&#x27;t pop open in my purse or bag.&lt;br /&gt;- There is a TON of variety in shades, especially considering that this is a travel case. There is a six-gloss color pallet ranging from reds/pinks to oranger shades, and the glosses carry a good deal of color. Similarly, the six shades of eye shadow cover grays, purples and browns, to complement almost any eye color.&lt;br /&gt;- There is enough room next to the eye shadow applicator to throw in a small eyeliner pencil of your choosing.&lt;br /&gt;- The eye shadow applicator is actually a really great one! It&#x27;s not flimsy and it has a nice blending sponge.&lt;br /&gt;- The mirror is a great size, not tiny at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only additional tool I use that is not included in the kit is a make-up brush or sponge, which you&#x27;d have to carry separately to apply the powder with. I was lucky to be able to pick this up during a promotion for review, but I truly believe that the kit is a tremendous value at its listed price. A great find! Highly recommend as a travel makeup solution.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to put inside your purse for touchups. The makeup is mineral make up which is a plus. The colors are light and fresh. I purchased this makeup kit from a promotion. I put it in my purse or clutch to apply touch ups. I am thinking about purchasing a set for my daughter and daughter in law as gifts. It is convenient, easy to apply, great colors that go on great and with a convenient mirror. Love it!</li>
