            <li>Nice price for good cologne</li>

            <li>The lid was not on secure so 1/4 of the product was in the sleeve!!</li>

            <li>We couldn&#x27;t get the top off without prying it off with tools!</li>
            <li>My boyfriends favorite!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how you can do this to the costumers...</li>
            <li>I dont agree with the companies CEO&#x27;s beliefs against &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; people (Google what the CEO has said) but this colonge smells amazing</li>
            <li>Nice product I love Abercrombie and good price its take time to receive in Brazil but its worth the unique smell so good!</li>
            <li>Not even the smell is right!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product worked well, really recommend is a good product an unbeatable price, I am happy for this purchase, if needed would buy same product</li>
            <li>women all love the smoothness and softness of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great cologne with a 3.4 oz option.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this larger bottle is that it sprays a wider spray, thus coating more evenly instead of concentrating the smell to one place.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Its my Favorite and appears to be a lot of peoples favorite.</li>

            <li>a really sexy smell that lasts 8-10 hours.</li>

            <li>Both are authentic.</li>
            <li>Everyone enjoys it because it&#x27;s a clean, amazing fragrance (that works).  </li>
            <li>well worth the price!!</li>
            <li>To much money for something that does not work good.</li>
            <li>Comes off as a bit strong to me.</li>
            <li>This is the best cologne on the market hands down.</li>
            <li>The transaction was smooth and easy...</li>
            <li>she was a huge jerk.</li>
            <li>great value for that product the only place i can purchase this is online.</li>
            <li>I can verify that this is a genuine Fierce cologne.</li>
            <li>He is putting cheap knock off cologne in a fierce bottle and charging you $60 for it.  </li>
            <li>Nice cologne at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The package was sealed and all looked great, except for the actual cologne.</li>
            <li>He seems to really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This was a smooth operation!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Get this cologne, I recommend going to the mall and getting it at an Abercrombie and Fitch, even at full price its a great deal for such a quality cologne!</li>
            <li>It does not stay on me all day, like the original.  </li>
            <li>Original product not a knock off.</li>
            <li>It is in fact authentic, so if you want the real thing at a fantastic price, buy from this seller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s currently one of the most popular scents for guys under 40.</li>
            <li>I love the scent so much on my husband</li>
            <li>I really like this product talk about women just love it and always comment it smells like a man is what I get.</li>
            <li>It arrived VERY quickly and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Unique fresh fragrance and lasts thru the day.</li>
            <li>I own like 20 different colognes and this Always gets the most attention ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li>quick \\&quot;D\\&quot; too.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for it, but the ladies love it.</li>
            <li>This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>He smelled soo good.&amp;#34; Invest in this bros, it&#x27;s well worth the cash.</li>
            <li>really was the original.</li>
            <li>Cologne with no smell, wasn&#x27;t real, I asked at the A&amp;F and they told me wasn&#x27;t original cologne.</li>
            <li>Not the right way to handle the product.</li>
            <li>and Here I come back to Amazon to keep him smelling Mighty fine.</li>
            <li>He is almost 50 and is hot, hot, hot!  </li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly, and was entact and not broken.</li>
            <li>I think I have enough of this stuff now to last me a great while:)&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>However, I was in contact with the seller prior to purchasing and was told it was guaranteed to be authentic.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I ever say this person who I gave my money to in real life I would kill them!</li>
            <li>I went to the store and paid about $10 more and got the actual product.</li>
            <li>but the price is more than the actual store</li>
            <li>However seeing all their hot posters in the store is a treat...</li>
            <li>but I can look that up online too ;)</li>
            <li>He has been using it since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time.</li>
            <li>This scent last all day long, and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Suitable for outdoors and active lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Was a significant price difference and smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li>but when we compared to the original we had it wasn&#x27;t exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Just a knock-off product sold at a pretty high price.</li>
            <li>very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>feel like a real</li>
            <li>and my girlfriend always comments about how much she loves it whenever I have it on.</li>
            <li>THIS COLOGNE IS VERY GOOD.ITS</li>
            <li>You really break even at this price if you were to get in the store.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery,good price,lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if this is the real cologne or not?</li>
            <li>Fast deliverly.</li>
            <li>I like to ensure I get the real thing and</li>
            <li>, it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>hope an answer very</li>
            <li>and my husband really loves it.</li>
            <li>It did not seem real.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Different sticker on front than original</li>
            <li>Very satisfied,would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It came 6 six days after it was shipped overseas and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell even if it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li>The cologne does not smell like it normally does, and fades way faster than normal.</li>
            <li>NUMEROUS COMPLIMENTARY RESPONSES.    </li>
            <li>Right now I have a very big concern with all of you because I do a lot of orders with Amazon and in this moment I can&#x27;t believe or recommend this site because of you.    </li>
            <li>My son loves his new cologne....</li>
            <li>I ordered a specific cologne and I received different one and not even original.</li>
            <li>and I remember wearing it for the first time in public.</li>
            <li>It does smell exactly the same as the store bought product.</li>
            <li>It is similar and has the right packaging, but it is definitely not the real Abercrombie and Fitch Fierce cologne.</li>
            <li>Prodoct is the same that you would buy in the store, although it was a bit off color which may just be that it is a pretty old bottle.  </li>
            <li>But by the time you pay for shipment it ends up being more or less the same, but you save the time to go to the store.</li>
            <li>Like this batch is old</li>
            <li>I decided to just buy this cologne directly from A&amp;E,</li>
            <li>Complete rip off.</li>
            <li>was a loud of laughing...    </li>
            <li>Random women kept asking me what it was and telling me how good I smell.</li>
            <li>literally-- got soo many compliments on it and continue too, its ridiculous and there has also&lt;</li>
            <li>I have the exact same cologne and was running low on it so decided to get this 3.4 oz bottle</li>
            <li>He gets the least bit low in the bottle and I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>, EVEN THE NAME WAS INCOMPLETE AND FALLING APPART, AND THE PICTURE IN THE BACK IN BOTH COLOGNES WAS DIFERENT COLOR, A CHEAP IMITATION!!</li>
            <li>&quot; cologne is one of the major reasons for this.</li>
            <li>It does not have the same fragrance and the color is yellow instead of clear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I own like 20 different colognes and this Always gets the most attention ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> quick \\&quot;D\\&quot; too.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for it, but the ladies love it.</li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> He smelled soo good.&amp;#34; Invest in this bros, it&#x27;s well worth the cash.</li>
            <li> really was the original.</li>
            <li> Cologne with no smell, wasn&#x27;t real, I asked at the A&amp;F and they told me wasn&#x27;t original cologne.</li>
            <li> Not the right way to handle the product.</li>
            <li> and Here I come back to Amazon to keep him smelling Mighty fine.</li>
            <li> He is almost 50 and is hot, hot, hot!  </li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly, and was entact and not broken.</li>
            <li> I think I have enough of this stuff now to last me a great while:)&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> However, I was in contact with the seller prior to purchasing and was told it was guaranteed to be authentic.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I ever say this person who I gave my money to in real life I would kill them!</li>
            <li> I went to the store and paid about $10 more and got the actual product.</li>
            <li> but the price is more than the actual store</li>
            <li> However seeing all their hot posters in the store is a treat...</li>
            <li> but I can look that up online too ;)</li>
            <li> He has been using it since it first came out.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time.</li>
            <li> This scent last all day long, and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Suitable for outdoors and active lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Was a significant price difference and smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li> but when we compared to the original we had it wasn&#x27;t exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Just a knock-off product sold at a pretty high price.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> feel like a real</li>
            <li> and my girlfriend always comments about how much she loves it whenever I have it on.</li>
            <li> THIS COLOGNE IS VERY GOOD.ITS</li>
            <li> You really break even at this price if you were to get in the store.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery,good price,lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is the real cologne or not?</li>
            <li> Fast deliverly.</li>
            <li> I like to ensure I get the real thing and</li>
            <li> , it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> hope an answer very</li>
            <li> and my husband really loves it.</li>
            <li> It did not seem real.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Different sticker on front than original</li>
            <li> Very satisfied,would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It came 6 six days after it was shipped overseas and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell even if it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> The cologne does not smell like it normally does, and fades way faster than normal.</li>
            <li> NUMEROUS COMPLIMENTARY RESPONSES.    </li>
            <li> Right now I have a very big concern with all of you because I do a lot of orders with Amazon and in this moment I can&#x27;t believe or recommend this site because of you.    </li>
            <li> My son loves his new cologne....</li>
            <li> I ordered a specific cologne and I received different one and not even original.</li>
            <li> and I remember wearing it for the first time in public.</li>
            <li> It does smell exactly the same as the store bought product.</li>
            <li> It is similar and has the right packaging, but it is definitely not the real Abercrombie and Fitch Fierce cologne.</li>
            <li> Prodoct is the same that you would buy in the store, although it was a bit off color which may just be that it is a pretty old bottle.  </li>
            <li> But by the time you pay for shipment it ends up being more or less the same, but you save the time to go to the store.</li>
            <li> Like this batch is old</li>
            <li> I decided to just buy this cologne directly from A&amp;E,</li>
            <li> Complete rip off.</li>
            <li> was a loud of laughing...    </li>
            <li> Random women kept asking me what it was and telling me how good I smell.</li>
            <li> literally-- got soo many compliments on it and continue too, its ridiculous and there has also&lt;</li>
            <li> I have the exact same cologne and was running low on it so decided to get this 3.4 oz bottle</li>
            <li> He gets the least bit low in the bottle and I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> , EVEN THE NAME WAS INCOMPLETE AND FALLING APPART, AND THE PICTURE IN THE BACK IN BOTH COLOGNES WAS DIFERENT COLOR, A CHEAP IMITATION!!</li>
            <li> &quot; cologne is one of the major reasons for this.</li>
            <li> It does not have the same fragrance and the color is yellow instead of clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this twice from fragrence and one is slightly yellow and the other is clear.</li>
            <li> VERY MASCULINE.A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> there were no major problems.</li>
            <li> It came with a somewhat leaky neck, and the liquid (which is supposed to be crystal clear) had a slight yellowing.</li>
            <li> This is a fake perfume that is completely different than the original one.</li>
            <li> I visit the Abercrombie store here in Puerto Rico and the Aroma is in the air few store far from this one.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, just too darn expensive!</li>
            <li> if you want all the pretty girls to like you, you have to smell like you belong in the game.</li>
            <li> I loose my money with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is everything I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Its expensive and it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not real.</li>
            <li> People need to careful.</li>
            <li> initially had some trouble with USPS who didn&#x27;t want to drop it off at my house when no one was at home to receive the package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This aroma is not the same, and felt it less than an a half of hour.</li>
            <li> This person should be banned from selling anything on amazon or any other site.  </li>
            <li> Was thinking maybe it was an imitation cologne but its</li>
            <li> I order a bottle, and this bottle smells like pinesol watered down.</li>
            <li> and it smells NOTHING like the other one!</li>
            <li> This product is weak, fragrance does not last last long &amp; is weak in smell.</li>
            <li> Beware of sellers who sell you knockoffs (this happened to me about a year and a half ago).</li>
            <li> it is an imitation!</li>
            <li> it is not original fragance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an a&amp;f for a few hundred miles away and opted for amazon rather then a&amp;f&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> you save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> This product is actually cheaper then buying it at Victoria Secret.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to get here, but Amazon and ExpressMegaDeals gave me just the type of service and quality of product that I&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
            <li> The packaging was legit but the actual cologne was fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> RUDE</li>
            <li> at least I know I am getting what I pay for.</li>
            <li> the goods arrived just a day late.</li>
            <li> cant believe I wasted $70 on a fake cologne, and how they can be allowed to sell this in the Abercrombie bottle, and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t stick for too long...</li>
            <li> Cologne is weak in strength compared to store brand and elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Sells fake products.</li>
            <li> and this product hasn&#x27;t the same image quality, bottle, printed name and even worst the fragrance.</li>
            <li> ExpressMegaDeals sells fake products(cologne),and they answered no questions.   </li>
            <li> It was a fake cologne, no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> and this product hasn&#x27;t the same image quality, bottle, printed name and even worst the fragrance.    </li>
            <li> Fake Product DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars instead of five for a silly reason.</li>
            <li> This is put in a bottle with fake stickers!</li>
            <li> Fake lid!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this is a knock off!</li>
            <li> This product was sold to me by \\&quot;Aroma-Cor\\&quot; and it is FAKE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bunch of fake crap in a bottle don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> A BAD DEAL&lt;br /&gt;FAKE</li>
            <li> I got mine at an Abercrombie and Fitch store, with a 20% off coupon so wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> If I got a bad bottle or what.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> it is very bad and expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> and I thought that the seller handled it terribly and told me that he did not want to sell to me because I wanted to know about the return policy.</li>
            <li> feel like a real idiot for buying this.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is everything I wanted and expected. great value for that product the only place i can purchase this is online.</li>
            <li> Smooth&lt;br /&gt;The women all love the smoothness and softness of the fragrance. This is the best cologne on the market hands down.</li>
            <li> Sells fake products. I ordered a specific cologne and I received different one and not even original. Stay away...very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
            <li> I can verify that this is a genuine Fierce cologne. Beware of sellers who sell you knockoffs (this happened to me about a year and a half ago). However, I was in contact with the seller prior to purchasing and was told it was guaranteed to be authentic. It is in fact authentic, so if you want the real thing at a fantastic price, buy from this seller. Hopefully the 3.4 oz will last me awhile, but when it&#x27;s time to get another, I know where I&#x27;m going.</li>
            <li> Ever wonder where that nauseating perfume-like smell is originating from in an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store and hits you the moment you walk through their doors? \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; cologne is one of the major reasons for this. So why all the 5 stars? Don&#x27;t believe everything you read. The only thing that is \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; about this stuff is its overpowering, incapacitating smell. I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as advertised. The transaction was smooth and easy...quick \\&quot;D\\&quot; too.   I wouldn&#x27;t begin to hesitate to buy anything else from this seller.</li>
            <li> great product and great purchase. Shipping took a bit but when it arrived it was well packaged and in perfect condition. Thanks for a great cologne with a 3.4 oz option.</li>
            <li> This is not what I was expecting to receive. This is a fake perfume that is completely different than the original one. I do not recommend to purchase this product through Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> it is not original fragance. it is an imitation!</li>
            <li> Love the smell even if it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bunch of fake crap in a bottle don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, and absolutely love it!  Everyone enjoys it because it&#x27;s a clean, amazing fragrance (that works).  When necessary, I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> This product is weak, fragrance does not last last long &amp; is weak in smell. To much money for something that does not work good.</li>
            <li> I emailed some questions to this seller and he/she was a huge jerk. I had some concerns about the product and I thought that the seller handled it terribly and told me that he did not want to sell to me because I wanted to know about the return policy. RUDE and that tells me that hey these might not be the real thing everyone!!!!!!! Beware of seller Ashislam.   I didn&#x27;t buy this item but just the way the questions were handled let me know not to buy this!</li>
            <li> I have 3 years using this cologne (Abercrombie Fierce)... and this product hasn&#x27;t the same image quality, bottle, printed name and even worst the fragrance. Carefull with this guy.</li>
            <li> Just the smell I was after!</li>
            <li> Cologne is weak in strength compared to store brand and elsewhere. Like this batch is old</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from ExpressMegaDeals and had it shipped to London.  It arrived VERY quickly and was exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s not easy to get here, but Amazon and ExpressMegaDeals gave me just the type of service and quality of product that I&#x27;ve come to expect. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have always loved the smell of fierce on my boyfriend! The best thing about this larger bottle is that it sprays a wider spray, thus coating more evenly instead of concentrating the smell to one place.</li>
            <li> Nice product I love Abercrombie and good price its take time to receive in Brazil but its worth the unique smell so good!</li>
            <li> I have worn Fierce for the last 4-5 years.  I have always purchased it from the store, however, this time I ordered it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says the manufacturer is Abercrombie, but not the seller.  I dont believe them.  This cologne does not smell the same.  It does not stay on me all day, like the original.  I have had co-workers even say that they dont smell it on me, like they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant believe I wasted $70 on a fake cologne, and how they can be allowed to sell this in the Abercrombie bottle, and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont buy this online, ever again !!!!</li>
            <li> ExpressMegaDeals sells fake products(cologne),and they answered no questions.   products writtern by Chinese.  YOU MUST NOT BUY FROM ExpressMegaDeals,if you&#x60;d not like to lose money!!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!!!  Great cologne one of my favorites!!  I will warn you though do not buy this from the seller ashislam!!!!  He is putting cheap knock off cologne in a fierce bottle and charging you $60 for it.  I filed a claim but have not heard back from Amazon either about it.  This person should be banned from selling anything on amazon or any other site.  DO NOT BUY FROM THEM YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!  After this 3 week ordeal (and it is still going) I decided to just buy this cologne directly from A&amp;E, at least I know I am getting what I pay for.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give this 1 star.... This is put in a bottle with fake stickers! Fake lid! Not even the smell is right!!! I want my money back! The lid was not on secure so 1/4 of the product was in the sleeve!! Why is Amazon allowing this?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I bought this without reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a real dope.&lt;br /&gt;I spray on 20 pumps and in a couple minutes I can&#x27;t smell anything.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a real idiot for buying this.&lt;br /&gt;If I ever say this person who I gave my money to in real life I would kill them!</li>
            <li> Nice cologne at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Just a knock-off product sold at a pretty high price. I went to the store and paid about $10 more and got the actual product. Do not be fooled!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an a&amp;f for a few hundred miles away and opted for amazon rather then a&amp;f&#x27;s site. Was a significant price difference and smells exactly the same. Was thinking maybe it was an imitation cologne but its not. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Best cologne EVER !!!! Too bad it doesn&#x27;t stick for too long...</li>
            <li> Every time my husband wears this cologne he gets TONS of compliments on the Who smells so go department. I love it. I tease him and tell him to never wear this cologne without his wife (me) Its my Favorite and appears to be a lot of peoples favorite. Its expensive and it worth every penny. He gets the least bit low in the bottle and I&#x27;m ordering more. He will say I better not wear this because the bottle is almost out and Here I come back to Amazon to keep him smelling Mighty fine.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best smelling cologne&#x27;s there is! simply love it over all the others out there! well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product worked well, really recommend is a good product an unbeatable price, I am happy for this purchase, if needed would buy same product</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this and my girlfriend always comments about how much she loves it whenever I have it on.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t get the top off without prying it off with tools! And once we did I wasn&#x27;t sure of it really was the original. Smelled like it but when we compared to the original we had it wasn&#x27;t exactly the same.</li>
            <li> My son loves this cologne, which has a lovely aroma, easy and unobtrusive, but very pleasant!  He always gets tons of compliments when he wears it!</li>
            <li> thank you so very much love it</li>
            <li> My dad loved his gift</li>
            <li> The cologne does not smell like it normally does, and fades way faster than normal. It came with a somewhat leaky neck, and the liquid (which is supposed to be crystal clear) had a slight yellowing. Perhaps an expired bottle. Save your money.</li>
            <li> smells great but the price is more than the actual store</li>
            <li> My son only wears Abercrombie Fierce.  Looking&lt;br /&gt;to buy him this for Christmas.  I was very pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> THIS COLOGNE IS VERY GOOD.ITS VERY MASCULINE.A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. NUMEROUS COMPLIMENTARY RESPONSES.    G</li>
            <li> My exgf bought me some of this stuff almost 6 or 7 years ago and I remember wearing it for the first time in public. Random women kept asking me what it was and telling me how good I smell. To this day, that continues to happen. So... buy it if you like it when that happens.</li>
            <li> It was a fake cologne, no fragrance at all. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> You really break even at this price if you were to get in the store.  IF you were to buy it from them online you save a few bucks.  For me...I rather pay about the same price online to save myself the hassle of going to the Mall to get it.  However seeing all their hot posters in the store is a treat...but I can look that up online too ;)</li>
            <li> I bought it knowing that there is not box but the bottle cap was not secured and I got it semi opened with an envelope saturated with cologne. Not the right way to handle the product. I did however receive it in a timely manor .</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it is a great product. smells great. didn&#x27;t have any complications out of it. the price was good.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, just too darn expensive!</li>
            <li> I visit the Abercrombie store here in Puerto Rico and the Aroma is in the air few store far from this one. This aroma is not the same, and felt it less than an a half of hour. I loose my money with this purchase. I m going to trying to return it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriends favorite! We used to purchase at the store, but they are not longer carrying it at all locations. This is a convenient and cheaper way to purchase!</li>
            <li> When I received the cologne I realized it was a knock off. If you are wondering how I know this is because I use to work at Abercrombie. The scent is close but not the same. Complete rip off. The packaging was legit but the actual cologne was fake.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly, and was entact and not broken. Just in time for my friends birthday.</li>
            <li> I have 4 years using this cologne (Abercrombie Fierce)... and this product hasn&#x27;t the same image quality, bottle, printed name and even worst the fragrance.    It&#x27;s amazing how you can do this to the costumers... It was a present from me to my brother and the feedback from him was a loud of laughing...    Right now I have a very big concern with all of you because I do a lot of orders with Amazon and in this moment I can&#x27;t believe or recommend this site because of you.    If you do nothing about this problem I will be writing reviews all the time to let the costumer know what about your service...      Waiting for a a satisfying answer... Juan Gonzalez</li>
            <li> fast delivery,good price,lots of compliments. Very satisfied,would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fantastic and is a great bargain here!  It&#x27;s currently one of the most popular scents for guys under 40.</li>
            <li> Love Love LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;(on him)</li>
            <li> It is similar and has the right packaging, but it is definitely not the real Abercrombie and Fitch Fierce cologne. It does not have the same fragrance and the color is yellow instead of clear. Sorry to say this is a knock off!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> This product was sold to me by \\&quot;Aroma-Cor\\&quot; and it is FAKE! I have the exact same cologne and was running low on it so decided to get this 3.4 oz bottle and it smells NOTHING like the other one!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne on my boyfriend. He loves it too. Purchased it for a gift for him. Great speed on shipping!! Would order again!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Cologne I bought for my boyfriend</li>
            <li> The package was sealed and all looked great, except for the actual cologne. For some reason it&#x27;s very obviously yellow. However, it does smell the same to me and others don&#x27;t notice a difference in the smell either. This is why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 out of 5.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price for the 100 ml ( 3,4 oz ) Fierce from Abercrombie on internet ...&lt;br /&gt;My package was initially refused by the hotel in NY where I wanted it delivered ..The seller, Molly, was very good ad sent it again an kept me in touch while doing so ..&lt;br /&gt;Very very happy ...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t send but 1 bottle. Ordered 2 pay for 2. Got the shaft. Cologne smell lasted a one minute after you put it on. Not the same as buying in the store. I would not recommend. Rip off!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my nephew at christmas. It&#x27;s a bit pricey and smells just ok to me. He seems to really enjoy it. Comes off as a bit strong to me.</li>
            <li> WHAT A BAD DEAL&lt;br /&gt;FAKE COLOGNE, EVEN THE NAME WAS INCOMPLETE AND FALLING APPART, AND THE PICTURE IN THE BACK IN BOTH COLOGNES WAS DIFERENT COLOR, A CHEAP IMITATION!!</li>
            <li> Fake Product DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is the real cologne or not? Smells like A&amp;F but doesnt stay and the logo isnt staight</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband at his request . But I get to enjoy it !  I will for sure purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good product. there were no major problems. the goods arrived just a day late. recommend it to everyone, both make purchases on amazon.com and the purchased product.</li>
            <li> Unique fresh fragrance and lasts thru the day. Suitable for outdoors and active lifestyle. One of my personal favorites...highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne spray.  He has been using it since it first came out.  Refuses to use anything else.</li>
            <li> There are problems with the delivery. I&#x27;ll never get my purchased item because it is stuck in customs. I don&#x27;t want more this order. I have conctacted the seller but the article is stopped in customs and I have no idea how to fill out forms.&lt;br /&gt;Paola</li>
            <li> My son loves his new cologne....can&#x27;t buy it in Greenville, N.C......glad we found it on your site.</li>
            <li> Product was received in timely manner.Great product quality.</li>
            <li> Nice price for good cologne</li>
            <li> I love this cologne on my husband.  He is almost 50 and is hot, hot, hot!  I think this is a basic one to have in your bathroom drawer guys...!</li>
            <li> This product is actually cheaper then buying it at Victoria Secret. But by the time you pay for shipment it ends up being more or less the same, but you save the time to go to the store.</li>
            <li> Oh so much I loved this perfume.Why?Everytime I use this especially where I am going ladies will ask me what perfume I do used.I tell them the truth.Though I don&#x27;t need to smell so great  cuz I have a wife now.But keeping this scent my love wife would always love it.</li>
            <li> I own like 20 different colognes and this Always gets the most attention ;)&lt;br /&gt;So one of my friend&#x27;s without benefits :P recommended it to me and holycrap&lt;br /&gt;I literally-- got soo many compliments on it and continue too, its ridiculous and there has also&lt;br /&gt;even been many times girls wouldn&#x27;t say anything as I walked by, but I would&lt;br /&gt;overhear them saying quietly &amp;#34;oh my god did you smell that guy that just walked&lt;br /&gt;by? He smelled soo good.&amp;#34; Invest in this bros, it&#x27;s well worth the cash.</li>
            <li> I has named this perfume as the Universal pheromone, no girl I have met dislikes its smell.</li>
            <li> Not real. Sprayer came off. Different sticker on front than original</li>
            <li> Fast deliverly. Packing, box and bottle seems the same as brick &amp; mortar store. Bought for son&#x27;s birthday. He is happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Abercrombie Fierce is without a doubt the best cologne out there. It is the scent when you walk into an Abercrombie and Fitch store at the mall, and is just stunning. You will get compliments every where you go, and you only need 2 sprays tops! This scent last all day long, and at a good price. I got mine at an Abercrombie and Fitch store, with a 20% off coupon so wasn&#x27;t too bad. I like to ensure I get the real thing and not a knock off cologne. Get this cologne, I recommend going to the mall and getting it at an Abercrombie and Fitch, even at full price its a great deal for such a quality cologne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure If I got a bad bottle or what. My friends wear fierce and it smells wonderful, so I order a bottle, and this bottle smells like pinesol watered down.</li>
            <li> now i smell like the picture looks... if you want all the pretty girls to like you, you have to smell like you belong in the game.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s was very nice and feels nice, it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> This lotion smells only an alcohol and water I don&#x27;t recommend this product with you and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously it is very bad and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;You have to give a solution of this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I emailed to seller already but they don&#x27;t answer me.&lt;br /&gt;If you want I can send it to you and you decided what I do?&lt;br /&gt;I hope an answer very soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I love the scent so much on my husband I spray some on a cotton ball and place under the seat in my truck!</li>
            <li> I dont agree with the companies CEO&#x27;s beliefs against &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; people (Google what the CEO has said) but this colonge smells amazing and my husband really loves it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because a friend of mine used to wear it and I figured I would give it a try and I love this smell...a really sexy smell that lasts 8-10 hours. It came 6 six days after it was shipped overseas and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Original product not a knock off. Twice the value as buying elsewhere. I get many compliments from random women when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It did not seem real. And I bought one from its store and see the difference. People need to careful. I buy lots of perfumes from Amazon. This was the first time.</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars instead of five for a silly reason. I don&#x27;t particularly care for it, but the ladies love it. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Prodoct is the same that you would buy in the store, although it was a bit off color which may just be that it is a pretty old bottle.  It does smell exactly the same as the store bought product.</li>
            <li> This was a smooth operation!&lt;br /&gt;I initially had some trouble with USPS who didn&#x27;t want to drop it off at my house when no one was at home to receive the package.&lt;br /&gt;I alerted the sellers who told me that regardless, they would make sure that I got my pakage. They were totally wonderful in their hands-on follow through throughout the process. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The scent lasts most of the day, and I get many compliments. I bought this twice from fragrence and one is slightly yellow and the other is clear. Both are authentic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and he was very happy with it. The size was priced great!! It arrived on time and everything was great.</li>
            <li> I think I have enough of this stuff now to last me a great while:)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a good shippment and a great deal on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason</li>
            <li> I really like this product talk about women just love it and always comment it smells like a man is what I get.</li>
            <li> Cologne with no smell, wasn&#x27;t real, I asked at the A&amp;F and they told me wasn&#x27;t original cologne. I contact and they said they will be redounding the money. Hopefully they will do.</li>
