            <li>I&#x27;ve been using since I lost most of my eyelashes and brows to radiation therapy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much better I feel.</li>
            <li>I love my eye lashes</li>
            <li>but i couldnot find it any more</li>
            <li>My eyelashes seem thicker and in better condition.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 3 more to stock up.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments .</li>
            <li>Like many women my age, my eyelashes have gotten shorter and more sparse over the years.</li>
            <li>and I have better eyelashes than when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>This is not an exaggeration, my eyelashes are probably more than 150% fuller and longer than before I started the treatment.</li>
            <li>Price is more affordable.  </li>
            <li>I have used Latisse in the past-this product is better.</li>
            <li>Fun!!</li>
            <li>I did not notice results immediately, but after a month I could see that my lashes had lengthened, and my eyebrows had filled in more.  </li>
            <li>(The eyebrows filled in more around the nose, than at the sides towards the temples.)  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>RapidLash is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I recieved the 3 tubes of RapidLash and so far very pleased...</li>
            <li>Originally the reason I chose RapidLash was because it would NOT change the color of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few eyelash growth serums, but RapidLash REALLY works with great results!  </li>
            <li>My lashes and brows became more and more sparse in the last five years.</li>
            <li>Wow , I&#x27;m so happy they grew back ...</li>
            <li>Now they seem to have it right, and I use it every night.  </li>
            <li>Yes this is one product that delivers exactly,and does exactly as promised,,,I would recommend this to all I know., and will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>I have read that it is more likely to sting if one puts it on the bottom lashes, as it is more likely to go into the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I only applied it to my top lashes, yet the bottom ones have grown longer too.  </li>
            <li>I was seeing improvement, I should have ordered more of this when I was running low.</li>
            <li>first.</li>
            <li>The formula must have changed ...when I first started using it, it made a couple of my lashes</li>
            <li>I don&#x60;t know why it is different from the first one which I used, if there are same products, it will be good.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try some mascara - just a single, very light coat.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see a huge improvement in the length at first, but I realized later it was because my lashes are somewhat finer at the tips and my camera didn&#x27;t capture the finer hairs.</li>
            <li>This should be used by anyone who wants thicker, fuller eyelashes and brows.</li>
            <li>I may not have hair (much) on my head but that can be covered.</li>
            <li>Now I have found Rapid lash here at a much cheaper price  than my pharmacy .</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say I really thought it was hopeless.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were practically non-existent, straight, brittle.</li>
            <li>They want to know if they are real</li>
            <li>Now, after 2.5 months, my lashes have lengthened further, and my eyebrows are even more filled in, but still less on the outer side.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, so my results may not be impressive to those of you who already have average or above average eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Then I used mascara and shadow but that did not look realistic.</li>

            <li>I have been using RapiLash for quite some time (probably a year or so), and I can clearly see the difference in the length and quantity of my lashes.  </li>

            <li>gave 4 starts rather than 5 as it did not fill in my eyebrows completely, but in fairness one cannot expect miracles.  </li>

            <li>The reviews of RapidLash were promising enough for me to try it out.</li>

            <li>I was curious, but didn&#x27;t really want to get a prescription, so I hunted online for OTC alternatives.</li>
            <li>I am old, and my lashes were falling out and looked short and stubby.  </li>

            <li> I could not believe how long they got in three months!  </li>
            <li> so long I had to trim them off so they wouldn&#x27;t hit my glasses!  </li>

            <li> Much less expensive than the prescription product but works more slowly also.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but vowed to be diligent and strict about using the product every day, per the instructions.</li>

            <li> This should be used by anyone who wants thicker, fuller eyelashes and brows. It definitely delivers! I&#x27;ve been using since I lost most of my eyelashes and brows to radiation therapy. I can&#x27;t tell you how much better I feel. I may not have hair (much) on my head but that can be covered. NO mascara will give you lashes that you don&#x27;t have and NO eyebrow pencil will look as natural without brows. I bought the 3-pack as a refill. Try this - you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I was using Revitalash and now they are not selling it anymore and me I paniced.. my eyelashes are short, and I dont like fake eyelashes.... I recieved the 3 tubes of RapidLash and so far very pleased... thank you for rescuing me and having a similar product...</li>
            <li> This product is awesome great buy I love my eye lashes this is definitely a must have if used corrcectly works wonders</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are spectacular since I use this product. i bought it at bed bath and beyond but i couldnot find it any more</li>
            <li> I had used a prescription product in the past and was amazed at the results.  I can see some results from using this product, but not nearly like I did with the other product.</li>

            <li> Yes this is one product that delivers exactly,and does exactly as promised,,,I would recommend this to all I know., and will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> It has only been a little less than 1 month of use, but I see a little difference. My eyelashes seem thicker and in better condition. I will continue to use them as long as I can see a change in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 2.5 months now.  I did not notice results immediately, but after a month I could see that my lashes had lengthened, and my eyebrows had filled in more.  (The eyebrows filled in more around the nose, than at the sides towards the temples.)  Now, after 2.5 months, my lashes have lengthened further, and my eyebrows are even more filled in, but still less on the outer side.&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any discomfort using this product.  It was easy to apply.  I have read that it is more likely to sting if one puts it on the bottom lashes, as it is more likely to go into the eyes.  I only applied it to my top lashes, yet the bottom ones have grown longer too.  I think that when asleep the product comes into contact with the bottom lashes as well.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 starts rather than 5 as it did not fill in my eyebrows completely, but in fairness one cannot expect miracles.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this for 3 months, then stopped for 6 months.  Now I am starting again because after six month my eyelashes went back to being short!  I could not believe how long they got in three months!  Fun!!</li>
            <li> This was working.  I saw a difference.  My only mistake was buying something cheaper when I ran out of my first order of this.  I just ordered 3 more to stock up.  It works if you use it every night like instructed.  I was using it for my eyebrows.  I am 45 years old and my eyebrows have been thinning.  I was seeing improvement, I should have ordered more of this when I was running low.</li>
            <li> Last year , on my left eye I had almost no lashes left !!! I bought the Rapid lash at a local pharmacy . Wow , I&#x27;m so happy they grew back ...fuller and longer . I have gotten many compliments . Now I have found Rapid lash here at a much cheaper price  than my pharmacy . I love this product !!!&lt;br /&gt;Joanne</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the prescription product but works more slowly also.  Seems to work if you use it daily...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman. Like many women my age, my eyelashes have gotten shorter and more sparse over the years. So short, in fact, that my eyelash curler could no longer grab my lashes. So sparse, that I actually got bald areas along my lashline that would take ages to grow back in. I&#x27;d all but given up on bothering with mascara, as there was little point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along came the eyelash serum commercials that promised lash growth. I was curious, but didn&#x27;t really want to get a prescription, so I hunted online for OTC alternatives. The reviews of RapidLash were promising enough for me to try it out. I was skeptical at first, but vowed to be diligent and strict about using the product every day, per the instructions. I documented the treatment with photos. Trust me when I say I really thought it was hopeless. My eyelashes were practically non-existent, straight, brittle. I really didn&#x27;t start to notice results until several weeks into the treatment. The change was quite subtle, and I felt like it was going to be a disappointment. But I kept at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months in, I could see from the photos that my lashes were filling in and getting plusher. They were even starting to curl. I couldn&#x27;t see a huge improvement in the length at first, but I realized later it was because my lashes are somewhat finer at the tips and my camera didn&#x27;t capture the finer hairs. I could feel the length with my fingertips, though. So I decided to try some mascara - just a single, very light coat. Holy cow, wow, wow, wow! I had eyelashes! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. 60 days in and I have better eyelashes than when I was a teenager. This is not an exaggeration, my eyelashes are probably more than 150% fuller and longer than before I started the treatment. I wish Amazon would still let us post product photos as proof of my results. I posted a photo link in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so my results may not be impressive to those of you who already have average or above average eyelashes. But if you&#x27;re like me, missing those eyelashes of your youth and hating the idea of false eyelashes, you should really give RapidLash a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note: You probably won&#x27;t see results right away. The treatment takes some time, as lashes grow quite slowly. Due to an immune issue, I have a lot of sensitivies. RapidLash does not bother my eyes or skin at all. It has not stained my very pale skin any perceptible amount, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using RapidLash, and I&#x27;ll post any future updates.But if you&#x27;re like me, missing those eyelashes of your youth and hating the idea of false eyelashes, you should really give RapidLash a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note: You probably won&#x27;t see results right away.

            <li> Very slight improvement.  Doesn&#x27;t even compare with Latisse</li>
            <li> Have been using for several years now!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!! Really works- give it a few weeks @ first. Lashes actually touch my sunglasses!!</li>
            <li> This product works exceedingly well for me. Been using it for 18 months.  I am old, and my lashes were falling out and looked short and stubby.  This product made them grow longer and thicker.  Love it!</li>
            <li> They sent me wrong product which is different brand and is not the same as the one in the picture. Cannot return ;(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it is wonderful!  My lashes and brows became more and more sparse in the last five years. I tried using mascara on the brows but after a bit that wasn&#x27;t enough. Then I used mascara and shadow but that did not look realistic. My salon sold RapidLash so I thought I&#x27;d try it. Originally the reason I chose RapidLash was because it would NOT change the color of my eyes. Latisse DOES NOT make this promise.....RapidLash is easy to use. A couple of weeks after starting  RapidLash I could see the benefits.....I will stay with RapidLash!</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is doing what it is supposed to do because have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  Looking forward to the final time and finishing the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using RapiLash for quite some time (probably a year or so), and I can clearly see the difference in the length and quantity of my lashes.  I have also used other lash enhancing products such as SmartLash, but this one is better because it doesn&#x27;t sting like SmartLash.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are ticker and fuller. The only thing about this product is that you have to continue to use it or your eyelashes will return to the state they were in previously BUT when you think about it...you come out better continuing to buy this product than buying fake eyelashes and glue or paying to have them done every month.  I used this four yrs ago and stopped completly. This go arond, Im doing a full tube every night on lashes till empty and then 3 x a week. One tube lasts about two months when applied every night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t know why it is different from the first one which I used, if there are same products, it will be good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for over a year now.  The formula must have changed ...when I first started using it, it made a couple of my lashes so long I had to trim them off so they wouldn&#x27;t hit my glasses!  Then I got one that didn&#x27;t work at all.  Now they seem to have it right, and I use it every night.  Several friends noticed my long eyelashes and they have started using it too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I noticed a slight difference in my lashes within a week... (I don&#x27;t have much length on my lashes in general) and after 4 weeks they are definitely longer.</li>
            <li> Cant get enough of it</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as Latisse.  Price is more affordable.  Like Latisse you must continue to use daily.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past-this product is better. Thickened my lashes in addition to lengthening. I have used it for about 4 weeks and my closest friends have noticed and asked what is different. The price is another bonus!</li>
            <li> I always get comments and questions on my eyelashes by both men and women.  They want to know if they are real &amp; I always tell them RapidLash.</li>
