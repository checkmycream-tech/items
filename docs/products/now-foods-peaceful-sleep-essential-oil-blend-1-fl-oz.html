            <li>the scent is really pleasant in the room.</li>

            <li>and it is pleasant.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t think citrus is a good sleep time smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but can be overpowering.</li>
            <li>Good buy and</li>

            <li>smells so good.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus fragrance which is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is a nice citrus fragrance and I rub some on my wrist and under nose as I get into bed, but it does not act as a sedative but pleasant to smell while trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>Its a nice pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>An excellent product at a fair price delivered right on time.</li>

            <li>This oil smells amazing and helps me relax and fall asleep.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I came across the NOW blends and their amazing reviews that I decided to try them.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>Nice scent</li>
            <li>I like to make my own blends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as nice when you&#x27;re just diffusing during the day.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice citrus smell to it</li>
            <li>I used it to make homemade bath products and everyone loves the nice relaxing smell.</li>
            <li>Nice calming scent.</li>
            <li>A nice blended oil of Eucalyptus, rosemary, and lavender.  </li>
            <li>Came fast and very happy!</li>
            <li>Love it, the smell of this essential oil is really amazing great, will be buying from this company again, happy customer!</li>
            <li>this is the most wonderful smell, very relaxing</li>
            <li>Stronger citrus top note, but nice and relaxing.</li>
            <li>It works wonders, smells amazing and is my favorite relaxation oil made by any company.</li>
            <li>I liked the price for 1oz, and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>The customer service was great when my package got delivered and they even let me keep the replacement package free of charge even though the original showed up.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, strong scent of lavender and orange.</li>
            <li>, it also helps him sleep more restfully.</li>
            <li>Refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>We really enjoy this blend!</li>
            <li>Would be better to slice an orange.</li>
            <li>Love using this in my diffuser at night.</li>
            <li>Overall excellent product!</li>
            <li>iI wanted to love it</li>
            <li>They should reformulate to add more  lavendar.</li>
            <li>okay rather leaving a stain.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t seem to sleep any better.</li>
            <li>Most relaxing.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I use it for healing the skin more than I do for sleep.</li>
            <li>They are all fantastic products!</li>
            <li>Maybe okay for others, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>A mixture of Lavender and Sandalwood work better for me.</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>Maybe it will help others more.</li>
            <li>My son uses this for his night time routine. :-)</li>
            <li>Not what I expected...I don&#x27;t care for it...smells ok however</li>
            <li>This brand of essential oils is the best.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite blends of oil from Now Foods.</li>
            <li>(Aura Cacia is on subscribe and save :).  </li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE blend yet.</li>
            <li>Been buying Now brand of essential oils and very happy with them.</li>
            <li>Will probably buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I am using this for bed time and love it</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>Glad this blend isnt an overload of lavender like most &amp;#34;night time&amp;#34; stuff is.</li>
            <li>My family really enjoy it!</li>
            <li>love this, helps me sleep</li>
            <li>my baby, to sleep better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is more of a citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>I love the NOW brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>This smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I just love this blend and the citrusy scents in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had severe sleep problems for many years.</li>
            <li>is that I&#x27;ve been dreaming more often.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love This.</li>
            <li>Scent is ok.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Prefer more of a eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li>If you find Lavender or Sandalwood most helpful with sleep, you probably won&#x27;t like this blend.  </li>
            <li>I even enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li>and I swear it is the most refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>Simply a lovely smell.</li>
            <li>I was able to stop taking Benadryl at night to help me sleep.</li>
            <li>When I use in diffuser I add more lavender for a more pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product.</li>
            <li>Best prices are the NOW essential oils!</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of it for relaxing just before bed time too.</li>
            <li>I seem to fall asleep faster and sleep better each night</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a ton of EOs from Amazon, from many companies, and many from Now Foods.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;m sleeping any better, but what the hell, I like the smell. . .</li>
            <li>I am going to continue to use it nightly, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Best night&#x27;s sleep I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw that Now oils had a sleep blend!</li>
            <li>I have also had difficulties sleeping more than 6 hours a night but am now getting closer to my full 8 hours!</li>
            <li>and so far it has been great.</li>
            <li>This is great, being natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I Love the fresh citrus smell!</li>
            <li>but I feel like I get sleepy easily when i smell this.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing which of course is peaceful and relaxing.</li>
            <li>When I think peaceful sleep, I think lavender and chamomile and rose, not orange and peppermint.</li>
            <li>the aroma is more sweet than citrus;  just not for me</li>
            <li>sweet dreams :)</li>
            <li>I use this in the little Now brand diffuser and am very happy with the NOW products...including this one.</li>
            <li>Love the soothing smell of this peaceful sleep blend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>although this may not be a fix for his issues (yet) I have found that I feel much more relaxed as I doze off with a nice, softly scented mist floating through the air.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell of this.</li>
            <li>This oil is very relaxing and smells nice if you like lavender.</li>
            <li>and he sleeps so soundly.  </li>
            <li>Using for my daughter and it relaxes her and allows her to have a sound sleep.</li>
            <li>This oil will last a while, so it was a great price.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This is now my new favorite blend!</li>
            <li>These oils smell so lovely &amp; truly do help you sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li>and it takes 5 times more what I&#x27;d normally use just to have a very mild smell.</li>
            <li>So pure and just fantastic!&#x27;</li>
            <li>I think it must be the tangerine oil that gives it this light citrus that makes you feel so peaceful!</li>
            <li>It is orange and has stained some of her bed sheets but for a full nights sleep</li>
            <li>I love it, highly recommend getting some for diffusing if you have kids, or even for your self!</li>
            <li>I was buying this in Whole Foods and they stopped carrying it and added another NOW EO (Peace and Harmony) with Patchouli in it (not my thing) so on to Amazon I went searching for my favorite sleep oil.</li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried salt, magnesium (Peter Gilham&#x27;s Calcium plus Calm), electrolytes (Ultima) and that seems to help significantly.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just personal preference, but it isn&#x27;t appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>then we normally would :)</li>
            <li>Not as pleasant of a scent as I expected.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Peaceful Sleep blend from seller Jaurasee, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>Peaceful sleeping night after night!</li>
            <li>I would have liked a little more lavender.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a light citrusy aroma, and it&#x27;s very pleasing and calming.</li>
            <li>It seems to help calm the baby when sprayed on linens.  </li>
            <li>I fully believed in their benefits but, the cost of most essential oils was a huge deterrent.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>Smells like a freshly pealed orange.</li>
            <li>They are fresh and I will continue to use them as air freshener in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I like the Now Foods mental focus, and cheer up buttercup, but this one doesn&#x27;t smell as good.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever remember dreaming at night before using this product.</li>
            <li>spent a lot of time trying to research which brands of essential oils were the best quality, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>This oil helps me settle right in, calm my mind, and have a peaceful night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li>Smells very good, Very comparable to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I love Now products in general.  </li>
            <li>However, the citrus smell made me feel energized and awake instead of calm and peaceful.</li>
            <li>This is a nice blend for taking on vacations to improve sleep in a strange place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
            <li>It helps her calm down quicker and sleep more soundly.</li>
            <li>it works good in my little humidifier.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and relaxing at the same time.</li>
            <li>I bought the Now Foods Peaceful Sleep, Cheer Up Buttercup and Metal Focus all together.</li>
            <li>Exactly as listed.  </li>
            <li>I love all the essential oils that NOW makes.</li>
            <li>I actually use naturally lovable by NOW to help me sleep.</li>
            <li>I woke up the morning after my first use with a sore throat.  </li>
            <li>, I love Now essential oils</li>
            <li>I used the oil the first night I got it</li>
            <li>I use 10 drops almond oil and 10 drops Peaceful Sleep on each foot, put some footies on and I&#x27;m off to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this essential oil.</li>
            <li>Peaceful is the word.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this essential oil mixture.  </li>
            <li>The first night I rubbed it on her feet and toes</li>
            <li>I had used a different one, but can&#x27;t remember the name that was much better.  </li>
            <li>but we did sleep pretty well and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several types of sleeping blends,  and this on is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This oil really works!</li>
            <li>Have only used it once but love it.</li>
            <li>The first night, he fell asleep within 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is nice but not really relaxing like lavender.</li>
            <li>I love it, I am resisting buying ten of them at a time.</li>
            <li>The Peaceful Sleep does exactly that.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this Peaceful Sleep EO blend while looking for something I could diffuse in my bedroom at night.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products by Now Foods and liked them, so I chose to try their oils.</li>
            <li>I wake up feeling more refreshed than I have in a long time.</li>
            <li>Much prefer pure lavender.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain if it really induces &amp;#34;peaceful sleep&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend peaceful sleep, naturally lovable, and clear the air by now essential oils.</li>
            <li>After reading several positive reviews on this product, I was excited to add it to my stash.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li>Too much orange and tangerines for me.</li>
            <li>As to its ability to induce sleep, I do find it very relaxing but could not definitively say that it has helped me sleep.</li>
            <li>Made going to bed much easier, and I think it really helps.</li>
            <li>She states it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Really citrusy.</li>
            <li>This blend is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I find it very relaxing as do my kids</li>
            <li>The scent is very calming and works well as a room spray.</li>
            <li>This blend is VERY orange-y.  </li>
            <li>It really did not help me with sleep.  </li>
            <li>This has a very citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Very citrusy yet floral ...calming</li>
            <li>it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I feel like I sleep so much deeper when I put this on (in my diffuser) at night time -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil blend!</li>
            <li>I ordered it on a whim, really.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I was not expecting it to be yellow as I applied drops to my white pillowcase.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>It normally takes 2 hours!  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so much more affordable than other sleep blends I had looked in to.</li>
            <li>I have tried some other blends and been satisfied to very pleased, but this one was no good.</li>
            <li>The main scent of orange/citrus bothered my nose and throat.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely try more of the Now essential oils!</li>
            <li>I ordered this with crossed fingers and not extremely high hopes, other than knowing it would smell good.</li>
            <li>One night I was literally scared to go to bed as the twitching and cramping seemed to be at an all time high.  </li>
            <li>He is high needs</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly, and it was packaged extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i agree with the other reviewers in that this scent is WAY too strong.</li>
            <li>; normally can&#x27;t sleep without the TV turned on (which keeps me up).</li>
            <li>I normally have to take melatonin to go to sleep</li>
            <li>There are quite a few more oils in this than I thought there would be, but my guide says each oil is a &amp;#34;sleepy&amp;#34; oil.</li>
            <li>The one who normally stays up for hours was out in 10 mins.</li>
            <li>My daughter bought this for her new oil diffuser and neither of us were a fan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to &amp;#34;essential oils.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The Peaceful Sleep and Cheer up Buttercup have a yellow color that stained my humidifier.</li>
            <li>Went to a local health food store, explained my situation and the NOW Peaceful Sleep was decided on.  </li>
            <li>, it sounds like she&#x27;s being skinned alive!</li>
            <li>Was worried this may not really assist with a Peaceful sleep, but it really does.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised by the color.</li>
            <li>He is two months old</li>
            <li>I decided to try the NOW oils, and so far I have not had an issue.</li>
            <li>Use this oil on my 3-year old daughter to help her sleep at night.</li>
            <li>I have a 1 year old who refuses to sleep.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the regular lavender oil.</li>
            <li>I have a 2 &amp; 3 year old who never sit or sleep.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of Young Living oils as well</li>
            <li>I enjoy putting a few drops in my diffuser before bed.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old cannot fall asleep in the evenings.</li>
            <li>She screams so loud</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to smell like young living peace and calming.  </li>
            <li>I had heard so much about essential oils and their benefits.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I am completely hooked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent triple the amount on other oils and still love this brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it does not help get my son to sleep, it DOES calm him down.</li>
            <li>Although it smells nice, it definitely does not produce calming sensations due to the heavy citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the essential oil scene, but have found this to help lull me to sleep...</li>
            <li>Within the last year or so I developed Benign Fasciculation syndrome/nocturnal foot cramps.  </li>
            <li>I had been very relaxed when I put this in my diffuser at bed time, and within 20 minutes both my husband and I were wide awake and energized.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really help my 3 year old Autistic son fall asleep.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars only because there was a major delay in shipping the item to me.</li>
            <li>With my other EO&#x27;s I only need to add a couple of drops and I can smell it from across our large room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty subtle scent compared to others, but it is very relaxing if you&#x27;re actually in bed or going to bed.</li>
            <li>The first and only time I used it in my bedroom to help me sleep, it kept me up half of the night.</li>
            <li>but I put several drops in my diffuser and can barely smell the product.</li>
            <li>Odd scent but very calming.</li>
            <li>so getting him calm can be hard to do!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it is pleasant.  </li>

            <li> The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I came across the NOW blends and their amazing reviews that I decided to try them.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Nice scent</li>
            <li> I like to make my own blends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as nice when you&#x27;re just diffusing during the day.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice citrus smell to it</li>
            <li> I used it to make homemade bath products and everyone loves the nice relaxing smell.</li>
            <li> Nice calming scent.</li>
            <li> A nice blended oil of Eucalyptus, rosemary, and lavender.  </li>
            <li> Came fast and very happy!</li>
            <li> Love it, the smell of this essential oil is really amazing great, will be buying from this company again, happy customer!</li>
            <li> this is the most wonderful smell, very relaxing</li>
            <li> Stronger citrus top note, but nice and relaxing.</li>
            <li> It works wonders, smells amazing and is my favorite relaxation oil made by any company.</li>
            <li> I liked the price for 1oz, and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> The customer service was great when my package got delivered and they even let me keep the replacement package free of charge even though the original showed up.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, strong scent of lavender and orange.</li>
            <li> , it also helps him sleep more restfully.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> We really enjoy this blend!</li>
            <li> Would be better to slice an orange.</li>
            <li> Love using this in my diffuser at night.</li>
            <li> Overall excellent product!</li>
            <li> iI wanted to love it</li>
            <li> They should reformulate to add more  lavendar.</li>
            <li> okay rather leaving a stain.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t seem to sleep any better.</li>
            <li> Most relaxing.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it for healing the skin more than I do for sleep.</li>
            <li> They are all fantastic products!</li>
            <li> Maybe okay for others, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> A mixture of Lavender and Sandalwood work better for me.</li>
            <li> i love this</li>
            <li> Maybe it will help others more.</li>
            <li> My son uses this for his night time routine. :-)</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...I don&#x27;t care for it...smells ok however</li>
            <li> This brand of essential oils is the best.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite blends of oil from Now Foods.</li>
            <li> (Aura Cacia is on subscribe and save :).  </li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE blend yet.</li>
            <li> Been buying Now brand of essential oils and very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Will probably buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am using this for bed time and love it</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> Glad this blend isnt an overload of lavender like most &amp;#34;night time&amp;#34; stuff is.</li>
            <li> My family really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> love this, helps me sleep</li>
            <li> my baby, to sleep better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> I love that this is more of a citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> I love the NOW brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> This smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> but I just love this blend and the citrusy scents in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe sleep problems for many years.</li>
            <li> is that I&#x27;ve been dreaming more often.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love This.</li>
            <li> Scent is ok.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Prefer more of a eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li> If you find Lavender or Sandalwood most helpful with sleep, you probably won&#x27;t like this blend.  </li>
            <li> I even enjoy the smell!</li>
            <li> and I swear it is the most refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Simply a lovely smell.</li>
            <li> I was able to stop taking Benadryl at night to help me sleep.</li>
            <li> When I use in diffuser I add more lavender for a more pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> Best prices are the NOW essential oils!</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of it for relaxing just before bed time too.</li>
            <li> I seem to fall asleep faster and sleep better each night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a ton of EOs from Amazon, from many companies, and many from Now Foods.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;m sleeping any better, but what the hell, I like the smell. . .</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use it nightly, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Best night&#x27;s sleep I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw that Now oils had a sleep blend!</li>
            <li> I have also had difficulties sleeping more than 6 hours a night but am now getting closer to my full 8 hours!</li>
            <li> and so far it has been great.</li>
            <li> This is great, being natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I Love the fresh citrus smell!</li>
            <li> but I feel like I get sleepy easily when i smell this.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing which of course is peaceful and relaxing.</li>
            <li> When I think peaceful sleep, I think lavender and chamomile and rose, not orange and peppermint.</li>
            <li> the aroma is more sweet than citrus;  just not for me</li>
            <li> sweet dreams :)</li>
            <li> I use this in the little Now brand diffuser and am very happy with the NOW products...including this one.</li>
            <li> Love the soothing smell of this peaceful sleep blend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> although this may not be a fix for his issues (yet) I have found that I feel much more relaxed as I doze off with a nice, softly scented mist floating through the air.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell of this.</li>
            <li> This oil is very relaxing and smells nice if you like lavender.</li>
            <li> and he sleeps so soundly.  </li>
            <li> Using for my daughter and it relaxes her and allows her to have a sound sleep.</li>
            <li> This oil will last a while, so it was a great price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This is now my new favorite blend!</li>
            <li> These oils smell so lovely &amp; truly do help you sleep peacefully.</li>
            <li> and it takes 5 times more what I&#x27;d normally use just to have a very mild smell.</li>
            <li> So pure and just fantastic!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I think it must be the tangerine oil that gives it this light citrus that makes you feel so peaceful!</li>
            <li> It is orange and has stained some of her bed sheets but for a full nights sleep</li>
            <li> I love it, highly recommend getting some for diffusing if you have kids, or even for your self!</li>
            <li> I was buying this in Whole Foods and they stopped carrying it and added another NOW EO (Peace and Harmony) with Patchouli in it (not my thing) so on to Amazon I went searching for my favorite sleep oil.</li>
            <li> Not bad,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried salt, magnesium (Peter Gilham&#x27;s Calcium plus Calm), electrolytes (Ultima) and that seems to help significantly.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just personal preference, but it isn&#x27;t appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> then we normally would :)</li>
            <li> Not as pleasant of a scent as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Peaceful Sleep blend from seller Jaurasee, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Peaceful sleeping night after night!</li>
            <li> I would have liked a little more lavender.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a light citrusy aroma, and it&#x27;s very pleasing and calming.</li>
            <li> It seems to help calm the baby when sprayed on linens.  </li>
            <li> I fully believed in their benefits but, the cost of most essential oils was a huge deterrent.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> Smells like a freshly pealed orange.</li>
            <li> They are fresh and I will continue to use them as air freshener in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I like the Now Foods mental focus, and cheer up buttercup, but this one doesn&#x27;t smell as good.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever remember dreaming at night before using this product.</li>
            <li> spent a lot of time trying to research which brands of essential oils were the best quality, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> This oil helps me settle right in, calm my mind, and have a peaceful night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> Smells very good, Very comparable to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I love Now products in general.  </li>
            <li> However, the citrus smell made me feel energized and awake instead of calm and peaceful.</li>
            <li> This is a nice blend for taking on vacations to improve sleep in a strange place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
            <li> It helps her calm down quicker and sleep more soundly.</li>
            <li> it works good in my little humidifier.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and relaxing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I bought the Now Foods Peaceful Sleep, Cheer Up Buttercup and Metal Focus all together.</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed.  </li>
            <li> I love all the essential oils that NOW makes.</li>
            <li> I actually use naturally lovable by NOW to help me sleep.</li>
            <li> I woke up the morning after my first use with a sore throat.  </li>
            <li> , I love Now essential oils</li>
            <li> I used the oil the first night I got it</li>
            <li> I use 10 drops almond oil and 10 drops Peaceful Sleep on each foot, put some footies on and I&#x27;m off to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this essential oil.</li>
            <li> Peaceful is the word.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this essential oil mixture.  </li>
            <li> The first night I rubbed it on her feet and toes</li>
            <li> I had used a different one, but can&#x27;t remember the name that was much better.  </li>
            <li> but we did sleep pretty well and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of sleeping blends,  and this on is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This oil really works!</li>
            <li> Have only used it once but love it.</li>
            <li> The first night, he fell asleep within 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is nice but not really relaxing like lavender.</li>
            <li> I love it, I am resisting buying ten of them at a time.</li>
            <li> The Peaceful Sleep does exactly that.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this Peaceful Sleep EO blend while looking for something I could diffuse in my bedroom at night.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products by Now Foods and liked them, so I chose to try their oils.</li>
            <li> I wake up feeling more refreshed than I have in a long time.</li>
            <li> Much prefer pure lavender.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for certain if it really induces &amp;#34;peaceful sleep&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend peaceful sleep, naturally lovable, and clear the air by now essential oils.</li>
            <li> After reading several positive reviews on this product, I was excited to add it to my stash.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> Too much orange and tangerines for me.</li>
            <li> As to its ability to induce sleep, I do find it very relaxing but could not definitively say that it has helped me sleep.</li>
            <li> Made going to bed much easier, and I think it really helps.</li>
            <li> She states it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Really citrusy.</li>
            <li> This blend is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I find it very relaxing as do my kids</li>
            <li> The scent is very calming and works well as a room spray.</li>
            <li> This blend is VERY orange-y.  </li>
            <li> It really did not help me with sleep.  </li>
            <li> This has a very citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Very citrusy yet floral ...calming</li>
            <li> it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I feel like I sleep so much deeper when I put this on (in my diffuser) at night time -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil blend!</li>
            <li> I ordered it on a whim, really.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I was not expecting it to be yellow as I applied drops to my white pillowcase.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> It normally takes 2 hours!  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so much more affordable than other sleep blends I had looked in to.</li>
            <li> I have tried some other blends and been satisfied to very pleased, but this one was no good.</li>
            <li> The main scent of orange/citrus bothered my nose and throat.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely try more of the Now essential oils!</li>
            <li> I ordered this with crossed fingers and not extremely high hopes, other than knowing it would smell good.</li>
            <li> One night I was literally scared to go to bed as the twitching and cramping seemed to be at an all time high.  </li>
            <li> He is high needs</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly, and it was packaged extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i agree with the other reviewers in that this scent is WAY too strong.</li>
            <li> ; normally can&#x27;t sleep without the TV turned on (which keeps me up).</li>
            <li> I normally have to take melatonin to go to sleep</li>
            <li> There are quite a few more oils in this than I thought there would be, but my guide says each oil is a &amp;#34;sleepy&amp;#34; oil.</li>
            <li> The one who normally stays up for hours was out in 10 mins.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for her new oil diffuser and neither of us were a fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to &amp;#34;essential oils.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The Peaceful Sleep and Cheer up Buttercup have a yellow color that stained my humidifier.</li>
            <li> Went to a local health food store, explained my situation and the NOW Peaceful Sleep was decided on.  </li>
            <li> , it sounds like she&#x27;s being skinned alive!</li>
            <li> Was worried this may not really assist with a Peaceful sleep, but it really does.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised by the color.</li>
            <li> He is two months old</li>
            <li> I decided to try the NOW oils, and so far I have not had an issue.</li>
            <li> Use this oil on my 3-year old daughter to help her sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I have a 1 year old who refuses to sleep.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the regular lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I have a 2 &amp; 3 year old who never sit or sleep.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Young Living oils as well</li>
            <li> I enjoy putting a few drops in my diffuser before bed.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old cannot fall asleep in the evenings.</li>
            <li> She screams so loud</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to smell like young living peace and calming.  </li>
            <li> I had heard so much about essential oils and their benefits.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am completely hooked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent triple the amount on other oils and still love this brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it does not help get my son to sleep, it DOES calm him down.</li>
            <li> Although it smells nice, it definitely does not produce calming sensations due to the heavy citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the essential oil scene, but have found this to help lull me to sleep...</li>
            <li> Within the last year or so I developed Benign Fasciculation syndrome/nocturnal foot cramps.  </li>
            <li> I had been very relaxed when I put this in my diffuser at bed time, and within 20 minutes both my husband and I were wide awake and energized.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really help my 3 year old Autistic son fall asleep.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars only because there was a major delay in shipping the item to me.</li>
            <li> With my other EO&#x27;s I only need to add a couple of drops and I can smell it from across our large room.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty subtle scent compared to others, but it is very relaxing if you&#x27;re actually in bed or going to bed.</li>
            <li> The first and only time I used it in my bedroom to help me sleep, it kept me up half of the night.</li>
            <li> but I put several drops in my diffuser and can barely smell the product.</li>
            <li> Odd scent but very calming.</li>
            <li> so getting him calm can be hard to do!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually end up staying awake thinking about how much I dislike the odor.</li>
            <li> I put several drops on a dry dish cloth and throw it in the dryer in place of dryer sheets.</li>
            <li> Other essential oils offer identical ingredients in similar bottles at 15-20 bucks for 15 mL. No brainer for me on which one to choose</li>
            <li> I like them, they&#x27;re working well and plan to keep using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> That being said, I was hesitant for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the science behind the whole essential oil market, but I do know that this particular blend worked wonders for me and it is 30 mL for 10 bucks shipped...</li>
            <li> (just wakes up to eat) and the other two only got up once this week.</li>
            <li> There are so many differing opinions that it made it almost impossible to go on reviews alone.</li>
            <li> you for another quality product that doesnt bleed my wallet dry!</li>
            <li> I bought a sample, mixed it with some fragrance-free lotion, and would give my daughter a little massage every night before bed.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter is so hard to put to bed at night.</li>
            <li> I would be careful with this blend.  </li>
            <li> My husband was a  little skeptical and now he full notices the benefits as well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my daughter sleep better :(</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for those with trouble sleeping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if the combination of oils do not compliment each other.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s easier than carrying all of the other bottles.  </li>
            <li> The other oil I have purchased you can smell it as soon as you walk in the room.  </li>
            <li> I use it occasionally at home if someone is having a hard time sleeping</li>
            <li> I was expecting to mainly smell lavender, along with some notes of other scents, but I&#x27;m sorry to say this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other blends and always end up using this one again.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong at all.  </li>
            <li> (30 minutes or less)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this from Amazon from now on as it&#x27;s less than the store and delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m not really impressed with this particular fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes I&#x27;ll rub a little on my temples.</li>
            <li> Not at first but when it is in my new diffuser it slowly starts to smell very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I baught this for my daughter because she has trouble falling asleep and let me say that it truly does relax my daughter and I both.</li>
            <li> (we put a few drops in a tbsp of olive oil and just use a dab or two per foot).</li>
            <li> It predominantly has a citrus smell, so if you don&#x27;t like the heavy smell of tangerine/oranges, this is not the oil for you.</li>
            <li> Too heavy on orange and citrus.</li>
            <li> It works just like the reviews state knocks me out within 30 min of use and sleep like the dead.</li>
            <li> and we started adding a few drops to the humidifier.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in their bath water and a few drops in the diffuser and they are out like lights and sleep through the night.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my machines</li>
            <li> However, the oil arrived on time and without any leaks or problems, so I want to give it a few stars for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also been having trouble falling asleep and was never asleep before 1am.</li>
            <li> I like this blend although its smells of heavy citrus and does not seem calming to me.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops on my towel, yoga blanket...</li>
            <li> just plain stunk to both of us.</li>
            <li> My son has a really hard time winding down at night.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I was really hoping for it to work.</li>
            <li> It usually takes him up to an hour to fall asleep, and sometimes he is up twice a night.</li>
            <li> No more cramps/twitching.  </li>
            <li> Word of advice, start out small.</li>
            <li> Try a few drops instead of just pouring it all in!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it overpowering in small quantities.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the effectiveness on my kids</li>
            <li> The citrus smell was so overpowering that I could hardly smell anything else.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a very anxious person).</li>
            <li> This was a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I rub it on the bottoms of her feet, behind her ears and on her wrists.  </li>
            <li> I like using aromatherapy to help me sleep, but I get so tired of vanilla lavender blends.</li>
            <li> He has a difficult time falling asleep.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical.</li>
            <li> But I am not impressed with the smell at all.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, but it did seem to help.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> I started out with YL oils, but they are so very expensive.</li>
            <li> The twitching is very unsettling but the cramping is excruciating.  </li>
            <li> And with the very faint scent, I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad bottle or what,</li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of their products and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything- cutting electronics 2 hours before sleep, reading boring books at bedtime, melatonin...</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this blend.</li>
            <li> The smell is too awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good. The smell irritated me and caused a headache. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Loved it but the overpowering orange scent makes it to stimulating for sleep I use it for energy</li>
            <li> Smells very good, Very comparable to more expensive brands. Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> This oil smells amazing and helps me relax and fall asleep. Even my dogs fall asleep faster</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Refreshing and relaxing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I baught this for my daughter because she has trouble falling asleep and let me say that it truly does relax my daughter and I both. It smells so fresh. Will definitely buy again when we run out</li>
            <li> Great product! Very Happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Smells good wife bought it for me to help with my insomnia, but for some reason when I quit my stressful job my insomnia went away HA!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, but it works!</li>
            <li> My son has a really hard time winding down at night. It usually takes him up to an hour to fall asleep, and sometimes he is up twice a night. We started rubbing this on the bottoms of his feet before bed (we put a few drops in a tbsp of olive oil and just use a dab or two per foot). Not only does it help him fall asleep faster (30 minutes or less), it also helps him sleep more restfully. It&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> Smells like a freshly pealed orange. I would have liked a little more lavender. Nice scent but does not help sleep. I placed in the kitchen, perfect spot. Refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> An excellent product at a fair price delivered right on time. I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
            <li> I bought the Now Foods Peaceful Sleep, Cheer Up Buttercup and Metal Focus all together. The Peaceful Sleep and Cheer up Buttercup have a yellow color that stained my humidifier. They both smell similar with a citrus scent. They are fresh and I will continue to use them as air freshener in the diffuser. I am surprised by the color. I don&#x27;t think citrus is a good sleep time smell.  I won&#x27;t buy again. I like to make my own blends.</li>
            <li> We really enjoy this blend! My daughter uses it nighlt in her diffuser.</li>
            <li> Great smell &amp; relaxing!</li>
            <li> The first and only time I used it in my bedroom to help me sleep, it kept me up half of the night. The citrus smell was so overpowering that I could hardly smell anything else. This blend still smells wonderful but not for its intended use. I give it a 2-star rating instead of 1 because it keeps me invigorated in my office during the day. Maybe the seller would consider a name change to &amp;#34;Awake!&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> Stronger citrus top note, but nice and relaxing.</li>
            <li> All I got was an orange smelling room.  Would be better to slice an orange.</li>
            <li> Love using this in my diffuser at night. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Yummm I love this in my diffuser before bedtime!</li>
            <li> This oil smells heavenly. My fianc&amp;eacute; normally can&#x27;t sleep without the TV turned on (which keeps me up). Now that we use the luminescent diffuser in the bedroom at night, we both sleep like a rock. I normally have to take melatonin to go to sleep (I&#x27;m a very anxious person). This oil helps me settle right in, calm my mind, and have a peaceful night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> great alternative to YL peace and calming</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t work to help you fall asleep, I give it 3 stars because of the great smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil! It is very relaxing scent. It predominantly has a citrus smell, so if you don&#x27;t like the heavy smell of tangerine/oranges, this is not the oil for you. You can smell the undertones of the lavender as well. I use this oil in my OriGlam Aroma Oil Diffuser. Overall excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love it, the smell of this essential oil is really amazing great, will be buying from this company again, happy customer!</li>
            <li> iI wanted to love it but I dont. Too heavy on orange and citrus. Those are energizing not calming. Although it smells nice, it definitely does not produce calming sensations due to the heavy citrus scent. They should reformulate to add more  lavendar. Dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have sleeping issues so I saw this on line here I bought it and tried it. It works just like the reviews state knocks me out within 30 min of use and sleep like the dead.</li>
            <li> Too much orange and tangerines for me. Eh.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I was not expecting it to be yellow as I applied drops to my white pillowcase. I hope it washes out okay rather leaving a stain.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell of this. Diffused in the room of smaller children and they didn&#x27;t seem to sleep any better. Much prefer pure lavender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great smell but its not recommend it to use in the skin . The smell doesn&#x27;t stay longer.</li>
            <li> Most relaxing. Made homemade bath salts using this blend and I love it. I sleep like a baby after taking a bath using this .</li>
            <li> This is a great oil! I love all the essential oils that NOW makes. This oil is very relaxing and smells nice if you like lavender. It works well to heal damaged skin. It smells and looks like it is made predominately of lavender and orange. As to its ability to induce sleep, I do find it very relaxing but could not definitively say that it has helped me sleep. I use it for healing the skin more than I do for sleep. I actually use naturally lovable by NOW to help me sleep. It works wonders, smells amazing and is my favorite relaxation oil made by any company. I highly recommend peaceful sleep, naturally lovable, and clear the air by now essential oils. They are all fantastic products!</li>
            <li> The main scent of orange/citrus bothered my nose and throat.  I woke up the morning after my first use with a sore throat.  Maybe okay for others, but not for me.  A mixture of Lavender and Sandalwood work better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the smell.  But thats a me thing, I love Now essential oils so they get 4 star from me.</li>
            <li> i love this it helps both me and my daughter fall asleep quicker then we normally would :)</li>
            <li> Baby boy loves loves loves this.  He sleeps thru the night, not even joking! He is two months old and I put a drop on the tip of his blanket and in his Duux purifier and he sleeps so soundly.  Its as though he knows when he smells this, it is bedtime.  Sleeps 8 hours! Maybe I lucked out, but this will continue to be bought!</li>
            <li> Sleeping great these days!  Very enjoyable fragrance.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really help my 3 year old Autistic son fall asleep. He has a difficult time falling asleep. Maybe it will help others more. It has a citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice citrus fragrance and I rub some on my wrist and under nose as I get into bed, but it does not act as a sedative but pleasant to smell while trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T SLEEP WITHOUT IT ! I WOULD RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Smelled more pleasant than I thought. I started out with YL oils, but they are so very expensive. I decided to try the NOW oils, and so far I have not had an issue. There are quite a few more oils in this than I thought there would be, but my guide says each oil is a &amp;#34;sleepy&amp;#34; oil. My son uses this for his night time routine. :-) Made going to bed much easier, and I think it really helps.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, mostly like sweet orange</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma.  Present for daughter.  She states it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> i agree with the other reviewers in that this scent is WAY too strong. It&#x27;s very overwhelming and not at all calming. I never dated diffuse it. Returning was a breeze. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I used the oil the first night I got it and it worked....I slep through the night which I have not done in months Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like the Now Foods mental focus, and cheer up buttercup, but this one doesn&#x27;t smell as good. My friends don&#x27;t like it either. I usually end up staying awake thinking about how much I dislike the odor.</li>
            <li> I like this but it&#x27;s not very strong.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...I don&#x27;t care for it...smells ok however the peppermint oil and carrier oils are awesome!!</li>
            <li> Best night&#x27;s sleep I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  This brand of essential oils is the best.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite blends of oil from Now Foods. I use it in a diffuser by my bed almost every night. It has a nice, strong scent of lavender and orange. I&#x27;ve tried a few other blends and always end up using this one again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my daughter sleep better :( I don&#x27;t think anything will!</li>
            <li> Within the last year or so I developed Benign Fasciculation syndrome/nocturnal foot cramps.  The twitching is very unsettling but the cramping is excruciating.  I&#x27;ve tried salt, magnesium (Peter Gilham&#x27;s Calcium plus Calm), electrolytes (Ultima) and that seems to help significantly.  One night I was literally scared to go to bed as the twitching and cramping seemed to be at an all time high.  I googled essential oils that were calmatives and mixed a bunch with almond oil (Aura Cacia is on subscribe and save :).  Rubbed the mixture all over my feet, ankles, and put some socks on.  No more cramps/twitching.  Went away on a vacation and didn&#x27;t bring my mix with me.  Went to a local health food store, explained my situation and the NOW Peaceful Sleep was decided on.  I use 10 drops almond oil and 10 drops Peaceful Sleep on each foot, put some footies on and I&#x27;m off to sleep.  I&#x27;ll be buying this from Amazon from now on as it&#x27;s less than the store and delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but can be overpowering. Use sparingly. I like to dilute it with lavender. It&#x27;s wonderful like that.</li>
            <li> I use this EVER night in my diffuser.  This is my FAVORITE blend yet.</li>
            <li> Use this oil on my 3-year old daughter to help her sleep at night. Works great I rub it on the bottoms of her feet, behind her ears and on her wrists.  It helps her calm down quicker and sleep more soundly. I also defuse this in her vapor at night.  It is orange and has stained some of her bed sheets but for a full nights sleep I&#x27;ll make that sacrifice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of EO&#x27;s. After reading several positive reviews on this product, I was excited to add it to my stash. I am very disappointed with this blend. I don&#x27;t find it to smell that great and it takes 5 times more what I&#x27;d normally use just to have a very mild smell. I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad bottle or what, but I put several drops in my diffuser and can barely smell the product. With my other EO&#x27;s I only need to add a couple of drops and I can smell it from across our large room.</li>
            <li> Its a nice pleasant scent. Been buying Now brand of essential oils and very happy with them. Works well in the Now diffuser I also purchased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this essential oil. I&#x27;m new to the essential oil scene, but have found this to help lull me to sleep... which is what it&#x27;s intended for. Word of advice, start out small. Try a few drops instead of just pouring it all in! I don&#x27;t find it overpowering in small quantities. Definitely recommend the NOW Foods brand for quality and quantity for price!</li>
            <li> Was worried this may not really assist with a Peaceful sleep, but it really does.  Will probably buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I diffuse this oil every night in my children&#x27;s room, it helps them fall asleep and stay asleep.  I love it, highly recommend getting some for diffusing if you have kids, or even for your self!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty subtle scent compared to others, but it is very relaxing if you&#x27;re actually in bed or going to bed. It&#x27;s not as nice when you&#x27;re just diffusing during the day.</li>
            <li> Using for my daughter and it relaxes her and allows her to have a sound sleep.</li>
            <li> Good buy and it works good in my little humidifier. I like the scent...helps me get to sleep, being an insomniac.  This is great, being natural and easy to use. I will continue to buy your product. Thank you for working with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very potent smell of orange peel.</li>
            <li> Peaceful is the word. I am using this for bed time and love it</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this essential oil mixture.  It has a pleasant citrus flavor and I find myself inching closer and closer to the side of the bed at night so I can get closer the humidifyer that&#x27;s pumping out this delicious scent.  I can&#x27;t say for certain if it really induces &amp;#34;peaceful sleep&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li> My favorite. Glad this blend isnt an overload of lavender like most &amp;#34;night time&amp;#34; stuff is. Really citrusy. My family really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> this is the most wonderful smell, very relaxing</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical. I don&#x27;t know if it is placebo effect or what. I was getting woken up every two hours from my sons and daughter, so we started putting this on them. It worked phenomenally! My youngest (3 mths) sleeps 4 hours in a row now (just wakes up to eat) and the other two only got up once this week. We realized we forgot to put it on them that night. It does have a nice citrus smell to it and we started adding a few drops to the humidifier. Not sure about the science behind the whole essential oil market, but I do know that this particular blend worked wonders for me and it is 30 mL for 10 bucks shipped... Other essential oils offer identical ingredients in similar bottles at 15-20 bucks for 15 mL. No brainer for me on which one to choose</li>
            <li> love this, helps me sleep</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars only because there was a major delay in shipping the item to me. Otherwise, it is awesome. I have a 1 year old who refuses to sleep. Ever. This is helping. I am going to continue to use it nightly, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell all that great or relaxing-- but is good quality.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I don&#x27;t think it helped me, nor my baby, to sleep better. Too bad because I was really hoping for it to work.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it.  I think it&#x27;s been helping me drift off to sleep quite nicely!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amaaazing. I like using aromatherapy to help me sleep, but I get so tired of vanilla lavender blends. I love that this is more of a citrusy scent. I put it in the diffuser on my humidifier and sometimes I&#x27;ll rub a little on my temples. I wish they sold bigger bottles!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this smell doesn&#x27;t necessarily make me sleepy. When I think peaceful sleep, I think lavender and chamomile and rose, not orange and peppermint. But it&#x27;s still smells wonderful, so no complaints here!</li>
            <li> I ordered this months ago for my daughters diffuser. It smells amazing and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Great for bedtime with my son.  I have made a room spray with it and use it during his bedtime routine.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, but That may be my body not the oil</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my sleep issues. Tried diffusing and topical. Has a pleasant smell so kept using it anyway</li>
            <li> I love the NOW brand. I&#x27;ve spent triple the amount on other oils and still love this brand. This blend is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> The scent is off putting. I much prefer the regular lavender oil.</li>
            <li> My daughter was having night terrors and not sleeping through the night. The first night I rubbed it on her feet and toes she slept all night and continues to do so. We are so thankful for having something help her sleep all night.</li>
            <li> The smell is too awful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I had used a different one, but can&#x27;t remember the name that was much better.  I&#x27;ll use up this and then look around for something else - doubt i&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic! I have a 2 &amp; 3 year old who never sit or sleep. I put a few drops in their bath water and a few drops in the diffuser and they are out like lights and sleep through the night. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to bring with us on a trip to Croatia, especially with the time change and traveling with a toddler. We used it in a diffuser every night. It&#x27;s not the same as popping melatonin but we did sleep pretty well and the scent is really pleasant in the room. I use it occasionally at home if someone is having a hard time sleeping or we just want some relaxing aromatherapy in the evening.</li>
            <li> This is awesome it helps me sleep</li>
            <li> Product arrive on time with no problems.  It has a pleasant fragrance.  It has helped me relax a bit.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It smells great! I used it to make homemade bath products and everyone loves the nice relaxing smell.</li>
            <li> I was buying this in Whole Foods and they stopped carrying it and added another NOW EO (Peace and Harmony) with Patchouli in it (not my thing) so on to Amazon I went searching for my favorite sleep oil. I use a lot of Young Living oils as well but I just love this blend and the citrusy scents in it. I find it very relaxing as do my kids - I diffuse it in all three of our bedrooms at night. Love it!</li>
            <li> The scent immediately relaxes me and is very pleasant.  4my2dogs@sbcglobal</li>
            <li> Regardless is this works or not it smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve been trying to help my husband overcome insomnia so we are trying EVERY thing...although this may not be a fix for his issues (yet) I have found that I feel much more relaxed as I doze off with a nice, softly scented mist floating through the air. I use this in the little Now brand diffuser and am very happy with the NOW products...including this one.</li>
            <li> I rub this on my husband&#x27;s neck and shoulders every night. He loves the Orange fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not as pleasant of a scent as I expected.  I love Now products in general.  This was a little disappointing.  I prefer my simple lavender oil</li>
            <li> The scent is very calming and works well as a room spray. The customer service was great when my package got delivered and they even let me keep the replacement package free of charge even though the original showed up. Definitely recommend for those with trouble sleeping!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! It smells amazing which of course is peaceful and relaxing. I&#x27;ve tried several types of sleeping blends,  and this on is my favorite.</li>
            <li> the aroma is more sweet than citrus;  just not for me</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful combination of oils and is perfect for bedtime.</li>
            <li> This oil really works! I bought it for myself; however my teenage daughter has &amp;#34;stolen&amp;#34; it from me! Gonna have to purchase another bottle!!!! A+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using every night. It&#x27;s good smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe sleep problems for many years. The thing I noticed was after using this product is that I&#x27;ve been dreaming more often. I rarely ever remember dreaming at night before using this product. I use a cpap when I sleep , so before going to bed I put a few drops in my machines humidifier and so far it has been great.</li>
            <li> I tried this to help me fall asleep without any assistance from melatonin which makes me groggy. I had been very relaxed when I put this in my diffuser at bed time, and within 20 minutes both my husband and I were wide awake and energized. I&#x27;m hesitant to try at night again because I sure need my sleep!</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for her new oil diffuser and neither of us were a fan. I was expecting to mainly smell lavender, along with some notes of other scents, but I&#x27;m sorry to say this just plain stunk to both of us. It&#x27;s as if the combination of oils do not compliment each other. However, the oil arrived on time and without any leaks or problems, so I want to give it a few stars for that.</li>
            <li> Love the soothing smell of this peaceful sleep blend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Peaceful Sleep blend from seller Jaurasee, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It arrived very quickly, and it was packaged extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;I spent a lot of time trying to research which brands of essential oils were the best quality, but to no avail. There are so many differing opinions that it made it almost impossible to go on reviews alone. I have tried other products by Now Foods and liked them, so I chose to try their oils. I am glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used it as a room spray (4-5 drops per 1oz of water) and it smells heavenly! It has a light citrus fragrance which is very pleasant. This oil will last a while, so it was a great price. I will definitely try more of the Now essential oils!</li>
            <li> I like them, they&#x27;re working well and plan to keep using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> So great in the evening bath</li>
            <li> Mixed it with a carrier oil and rubbed it on my kids&#x27; feet before bed. They were all asleep within 15 mins. The one who normally stays up for hours was out in 10 mins. I&#x27;d also been having trouble falling asleep and was never asleep before 1am. I used it on my feet and was out by 10 and slept like a rock! The results have been about the same every night since!</li>
            <li> Love This. Have only used it once but love it.</li>
            <li> Scent is ok. Not my favorite. Prefer more of a eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li> Works great in diffuser.  Nice calming scent.</li>
            <li> I like this blend although its smells of heavy citrus and does not seem calming to me.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me for sleeping!</li>
            <li> Smells great. However, the citrus smell made me feel energized and awake instead of calm and peaceful. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Calming citrusy smell. I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I would be careful with this blend.  I find orange invigorating, and not calming.  This blend is VERY orange-y.  It really did not help me with sleep.  If you find Lavender or Sandalwood most helpful with sleep, you probably won&#x27;t like this blend.  If orange helps you sleep, then go for it.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. Not sure about the effectiveness on my kids but I&#x27;ll keep at it.</li>
            <li> Odd scent but very calming. Maybe it&#x27;s placebo but I feel like I get sleepy easily when i smell this.</li>
            <li> Works almost as well as a gin and tonic before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the scent and it is pleasant.  It is a relaxing scent.  I enjoy putting a few drops in my diffuser before bed.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old cannot fall asleep in the evenings. We have tried everything- cutting electronics 2 hours before sleep, reading boring books at bedtime, melatonin... I ordered this with crossed fingers and not extremely high hopes, other than knowing it would smell good. The first night, he fell asleep within 25 minutes. It normally takes 2 hours!  He now asks for this at night. We purchased an ultrasonic diffuser for his room to dispense the product. Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter is so hard to put to bed at night. She screams so loud, it sounds like she&#x27;s being skinned alive! A friend of mine that is a doTerra rep suggested a blend called Serenity. I bought a sample, mixed it with some fragrance-free lotion, and would give my daughter a little massage every night before bed. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, but it did seem to help. However, at $40 for .5 ounces, it wasn&#x27;t something I could afford to keep doing. I was so excited when I saw that Now oils had a sleep blend! I use a lot of their products and have never been disappointed. I even enjoy the smell! There&#x27;s a light citrusy aroma, and it&#x27;s very pleasing and calming. My daughter even asks for her &amp;#34;special lotion&amp;#34; before she goes to bed at night. And it&#x27;s so much more affordable than other sleep blends I had looked in to. Overall, I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This has a very citrus smell. It is nice but not really relaxing like lavender.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly , I use it in diffuser so me and my infant can unwind and sleep . Very citrusy yet floral ...calming</li>
            <li> The scent  just didn&#x27;t agree with me</li>
            <li> A nice blended oil of Eucalyptus, rosemary, and lavender.  I bought this because it&#x27;s easier than carrying all of the other bottles.  This is a nice blend for taking on vacations to improve sleep in a strange place.  Works in a humidifier as well.</li>
            <li> This smells so good!  I use it every night in my difuser in my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Peaceful sleeping night after night!</li>
            <li> smells so good. we diffuse it at night and also dilute it in a carrier oil and apply on the bottoms of our feet at night. sweet dreams :)</li>
            <li> I have seen no results</li>
            <li> Smells bad. Not at first but when it is in my new diffuser it slowly starts to smell very unpleasant. I will not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> This is now my new favorite blend! I love it, I am resisting buying ten of them at a time. I put this in the diffusers in all of our bedrooms and I swear it is the most refreshing scent. I think it must be the tangerine oil that gives it this light citrus that makes you feel so peaceful! Best scent ever!!</li>
            <li> I Love the fresh citrus smell!</li>
            <li> My favorite blend by NOW!</li>
            <li> Simply a lovely smell. I am hooked on aromatherapy. I put several drops on a dry dish cloth and throw it in the dryer in place of dryer sheets. I also put a few drops on my towel, yoga blanket...well, you get the idea!</li>
            <li> These oils smell so lovely &amp; truly do help you sleep peacefully. I was able to stop taking Benadryl at night to help me sleep. I use this oil in an AuraCacia Aromatherapy Room Diffuser (which can also be purchased inexpensively on Amazon)</li>
            <li> When I use in diffuser I add more lavender for a more pleasing scent. Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly. This blend works wonders. Awesome product and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! Amazing!! Best prices are the NOW essential oils! So pure and just fantastic!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to smell like young living peace and calming.  Not bad, but it&#x27;s only vaguely similar.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell - I literally tried it once in my diffuser and threw the rest away.  I have tried some other blends and been satisfied to very pleased, but this one was no good.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  It seems to help calm the baby when sprayed on linens.  I love the scent of it for relaxing just before bed time too.</li>
            <li> I use this in a diffuser every night. I seem to fall asleep faster and sleep better each night I use the diffuser with this oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to &amp;#34;essential oils.&amp;#34;  This is only my second bottle of essential oil that I have purchased.  I have to say I&#x27;m not really impressed with this particular fragrance.  It&#x27;s not very strong at all.  I can&#x27;t even smell it when I walk into my room and have my diffuser running.  The other oil I have purchased you can smell it as soon as you walk in the room.  I can smell it if I am laying in bed and it&#x27;s on my nightstand.  But I am not impressed with the smell at all.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just personal preference, but it isn&#x27;t appealing to me.  And with the very faint scent, I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I diffuse it and it is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful I use it in a now defuser, smells great for hours.love</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about essential oils and their benefits. That being said, I was hesitant for a long time. I fully believed in their benefits but, the cost of most essential oils was a huge deterrent. It wasn&#x27;t until I came across the NOW blends and their amazing reviews that I decided to try them. The Peaceful Sleep does exactly that. I feel like I sleep so much deeper when I put this on (in my diffuser) at night time - which is now every night. My husband was a  little skeptical and now he full notices the benefits as well. I wake up feeling more refreshed than I have in a long time. I have also had difficulties sleeping more than 6 hours a night but am now getting closer to my full 8 hours! Honestly, I am completely hooked. I have now bought a diffuser for my son&#x27;s room so that he may get these same benefits. I highly recommend this oil blend!</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this Peaceful Sleep EO blend while looking for something I could diffuse in my bedroom at night.  I&#x27;ve bought a ton of EOs from Amazon, from many companies, and many from Now Foods.  I ordered it on a whim, really.  I liked the price for 1oz, and I love the smell.  Can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;m sleeping any better, but what the hell, I like the smell. . .</li>
            <li> Great oil and it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;While it does not help get my son to sleep, it DOES calm him down. He is high needs so getting him calm can be hard to do!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this oil and brand to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for another quality product that doesnt bleed my wallet dry!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff use a defuser. Came fast and very happy!</li>
