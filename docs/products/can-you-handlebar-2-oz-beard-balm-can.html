            <li>It is definitely a great product but the smell is not that great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m this close to tossing these amazing oils into the trash except that, oh gosh, I CAN&#x27;T DO IT!</li>
            <li>Dang girl, get your OWN manly man if you want to indulge in follicle-fondling!&amp;#34; And the gentlemen are just as promiscuous!</li>

            <li>This stuff brushes right in, and keeps my beard happy all day.</li>
            <li>I have already used the original scent and the wisdom scent, and i loved them.</li>
            <li>and he said that he love it.</li>
            <li>Great scent and really softens up the beard.</li>
            <li>The brush with this product makes it even better.  </li>
            <li>I got this product for free for the exchange of my honest unbias review.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Satisfying.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>This one was his favorite though.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this beard balm.</li>
            <li>I love how it melts in my hands.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to others and will buy more for myself when I run out.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>And I did NOT write this review because they gave me a free sample like a lot of these reviews</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus/pine scent to it</li>
            <li>He said the oil was soft in a wax form and the brush turned in it with ease and didn&#x27;t have a lot of wax on it, he said it went on smooth and smelled good, but it was an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>Mom is determined for him to smell good and feel soft while he is home, on the road thats his problem.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes my hair so much softer as well!!!</li>
            <li>A great smelling dry oil that can be easily applied with a brush.</li>
            <li>this oil is super easy to use and cleared up my dryness.  </li>
            <li>The product is as good as ever, so easy to install especially with their brush.</li>
            <li>Damn beard-crack wins again!</li>
            <li>I works amazing leaving your beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This one, Initiative, is a sweet lemony scent, like lemon drop candy, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>He said the first application, he used too much and it was kind of gooky and super shiny.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong at first and lessens fairly quickly, but it does linger throughout the day.</li>
            <li>What kind of crafty ingredients do you use in your product that creates such an intoxicating response?</li>
            <li>you have a loyal customer here.</li>
            <li>This also isn&#x27;t like most other balms, the texture is actually really nice, and it liquifies with ease in your hands.</li>
            <li>only more well groomed!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the second beard oil I&#x27;ve tried, I like better how this comes as a paste, but it liquifies easily when you rub it between your hands before applying it.  </li>
            <li>It does soften my beard, and gives it a bit of hold to keep it looking better groomed, it tames those wild whiskers from sticking out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The folks at CanYouHandlebar were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any of you guys looking for something to give your beard a nice soft feel.</li>
            <li>He said it softened his beard right up</li>
            <li>The beard dry oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>Hearing a man ask my husband if he can &amp;#34;touch it&amp;#34; is, well, disturbing at best.</li>
            <li>His beard looks so much healthier!  </li>
            <li>My first impression was the smell....</li>
            <li>I had bought the regular Initiative beard oil, and really enjoyed the citrus smell of it, as well as the conditioning of my beard.</li>
            <li>It definitely gives it more of a shine and makes my beard look cleaner.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li>This new dry oil has the same great smell and treatment abilities.</li>
            <li>It is suppose to add sheen to the hair and doesn&#x27;t require a large amount to do so.  </li>
            <li>so much i wasn&#x27;t really considering ordering the initiative in case</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t like it as much, but it&#x27;s my favourite now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27; had previously tried honest amish and it was fine, but it took a long time to apply and i would find that i hadn&#x27;t fully smoothed it out in my hands so there would be chunks of oil in my beard during the day.</li>
            <li>I sent him the whole set</li>
            <li>It does make my beard feel much softer all day.</li>
            <li>It gives a light hold to keep some of the stray hairs at bay, but like all of the light balms that I have tried it doesn&#x27;t last extremely long.</li>
            <li>Thankfully the scent is more on the citrus side and less on the lavender since I don&#x27;t really like that smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s less messy and more portable as well which we love.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>Goes on really easy with a brush--no mess</li>
            <li>I received my CanYouHandle Beard Dry Oil for my husband and he tired it with his CanYouHandleBar brush, he said the combo was great.</li>
            <li>It gives his beard the natural oil feeling even after cleaning it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Made is beard softer instantly Would recommend this product for anyone that wants to take care of their beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>My daughter hates the smell and my girlfriend says it smells like old leather.</li>
            <li>You can apply it directly to your beard by using a Beard Oil Brush or your fingers.  </li>
            <li>People are suppose to use the least amount possible - less is more!  </li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> CanYouHandlebar Initiative Scented Beard Dry Oil 2 OZ</li>
            <li> CanYouHandlebar Initiative Scented Beard Dry Oil 2 OZ</li>
            <li> I was curious to try their dry oil balms</li>
            <li> I wanted it for my husband who has such a harsh goatee</li>
            <li> They call it a dry oil because a small amount of beeswax is added to make it a solid at room temperature.  </li>
            <li> I might put it on the roots in my part the blow dry it and give it a little fluff then on some of the ends</li>
            <li> We have a routine We put this in his beard in the morning and the other canyouhandlebar bottled oil in before he goes to bed.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering their other scents as well.</li>
            <li> I have also used it a few times when I style my hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you for helping tame my homeless mans, er..</li>
            <li> Literally no better product on the market to make a man feel like a man....</li>
            <li> No more scratchy kisses or cuddles!</li>
            <li> (he&#x27;s very hard to please).</li>
            <li> i mean my husbands beard!</li>
            <li> and she always thinks my beard smells bad.  </li>

            <li> The best beard balm I have tried!</li>
            <li> Ever since my husband has been using your beard oil, I can&#x27;t seem to get the ladies off of him! All they want to do is &amp;#34;touch it&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m like, :Dang girl, get your OWN manly man if you want to indulge in follicle-fondling!&amp;#34; And the gentlemen are just as promiscuous! Hearing a man ask my husband if he can &amp;#34;touch it&amp;#34; is, well, disturbing at best. What kind of crafty ingredients do you use in your product that creates such an intoxicating response? It&#x27;s like beard-crack. I&#x27;m this close to tossing these amazing oils into the trash except that, oh gosh, I CAN&#x27;T DO IT! I can&#x27;t help myself! I just want to touch it too! Damn beard-crack wins again!</li>
            <li> Goes on really easy with a brush--no mess</li>
            <li> Literally no better product on the market to make a man feel like a man....only more well groomed!  CanYouHandleBar is my only place to purchase products for my beard!</li>
            <li> This is the one. I have already used the original scent and the wisdom scent, and i loved them. I liked the wisdom scent so much i wasn&#x27;t really considering ordering the initiative in case i didn&#x27;t like it as much, but it&#x27;s my favourite now. The product is as good as ever, so easy to install especially with their brush. Oiling my beard is a no-mess event that takes 45 seconds of my morning routine. I&#x27; had previously tried honest amish and it was fine, but it took a long time to apply and i would find that i hadn&#x27;t fully smoothed it out in my hands so there would be chunks of oil in my beard during the day. This stuff brushes right in, and keeps my beard happy all day.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I works amazing leaving your beard soft and shiny. The scent is fruity smelling and sometimes smells like Fruit Loops. It is not over powering on the smell but still works great.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter&#x27;s father who has started growing out his beard and he said that he love it. It gives his beard the natural oil feeling even after cleaning it in the shower. And the smell is just intoxicating its so good. Like a lemon citrus smell. He was very happy. The product was recieved for an honest opinion thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent products. Can&#x27;t live without them. The beard dry oil is amazing. Just enough hold without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple weeks ago, have used it daily.  I like it.  It&#x27;s the second beard oil I&#x27;ve tried, I like better how this comes as a paste, but it liquifies easily when you rub it between your hands before applying it.  It does soften my beard, and gives it a bit of hold to keep it looking better groomed, it tames those wild whiskers from sticking out.  I will buy this again, actually want to try the different scents.  This one, Initiative, is a sweet lemony scent, like lemon drop candy, but not overpowering.  And I did NOT write this review because they gave me a free sample like a lot of these reviews seem to be, I bought this myself.</li>
            <li> Great scent and really softens up the beard.</li>
            <li> use. Made is beard softer instantly Would recommend this product for anyone that wants to take care of their beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> I received my CanYouHandle Beard Dry Oil for my husband and he tired it with his CanYouHandleBar brush, he said the combo was great. He said the oil was soft in a wax form and the brush turned in it with ease and didn&#x27;t have a lot of wax on it, he said it went on smooth and smelled good, but it was an overpowering smell. He said it softened his beard right up and it wasn&#x27;t rough or wild looking. He said it felt good on his skin to</li>
            <li> I got this for my hubby and he loves it!  CanYouHandlebar Initiative Scented Beard Dry Oil 2 OZ Can: Aromas of Lavendar, Bergamot and Citrus, No Added Colors, All Natural Beard Balm is a great product!!!  It adds shine as it dries!!!!  They call it a dry oil because a small amount of beeswax is added to make it a solid at room temperature.  His beard looks so much healthier!  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  I totally recommend this for any guy that has facial hair!!!</li>
            <li> this oil is super easy to use and cleared up my dryness.  Also my Girlfriend loves the Initiative smell and she always thinks my beard smells bad.  The brush with this product makes it even better.  CanyouHandlebar you have a loyal customer here.</li>
            <li> I received this to review...well my husband did and we&#x27;ve tried different beard oil on his luscious chin locks and this has to be one of our favorites. It smells awesome and goes on evenly and smoothly. It&#x27;s keeps his beard soft and manageable without being sticky or messy. Since it&#x27;s a solid oil and not a liquid it&#x27;s less messy and more portable as well which we love. We will definitely keep using this brand.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a great product but the smell is not that great.  My daughter hates the smell and my girlfriend says it smells like old leather. I will use this up and then get the unscented one.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick, smells great, works great and I shall definitely purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I was excites I got this product for free for the exchange of my honest unbias review. I wanted it for my husband who has such a harsh goatee I call him Brillo pad. My first impression was the smell....I absolutely love it. After 2 days of applications I can already tell a difference. Its like conditioner. Happy wife and repeat customer here :)</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Nice smell. Easy to use. Satisfying.</li>
            <li> CanYouHandlebar Initiative Scented Beard Dry Oil 2 OZ Can: Aromas of Lavendar, Bergamot and Citrus, No Added Colors, All Natural Beard Balm is a great product!!! I put this in my dads beard when he is home and my mom loves the smell of it! We have a routine We put this in his beard in the morning and the other canyouhandlebar bottled oil in before he goes to bed. Mom is determined for him to smell good and feel soft while he is home, on the road thats his problem. Mom is on hospice and of course she loves my dad either way. But really this stuff is great! It smells so go! I have also used it a few times when I style my hair. I might put it on the roots in my part the blow dry it and give it a little fluff then on some of the ends i can twist them and it looks so cute! Plus it makes my hair so much softer as well!!! I love it!!!!I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **  I&#x27;m not a beard guy, but my gramps is. I sent him the whole set and he likes it (he&#x27;s very hard to please). Use sparingly though. He said the first application, he used too much and it was kind of gooky and super shiny. This one was his favorite though.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to soften the hair, give this a try.  It is suppose to add sheen to the hair and doesn&#x27;t require a large amount to do so.  People are suppose to use the least amount possible - less is more!  You can apply it directly to your beard by using a Beard Oil Brush or your fingers.  Ingredients are minimal and natural:  Local Michigan Beeswax, USP Lanolin, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Shea butter, Vitamin E and Essential Oils.  It has a light citrus/pine scent to it that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folks at CanYouHandlebar were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.  Therefore, I agreed to provide honest feedback when posting my review.  Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this beard balm. I was curious to try their dry oil balms and it is different from the other balms I have tried. It starts out softer than some of the others that I have tried. It gives a light hold to keep some of the stray hairs at bay, but like all of the light balms that I have tried it doesn&#x27;t last extremely long. It does make my beard feel much softer all day. The best part about it is the smell. I love a good citrus smell and this smells awesome. To me, it smells like Lemon Head candy. The smell is strong at first and lessens fairly quickly, but it does linger throughout the day. I highly recommend this to any of you guys looking for something to give your beard a nice soft feel. I will be ordering their other scents as well.</li>
            <li> This oil smells so good! Everyone keeps complimenting the scent my beard gives off. Also it feels so good! I love how it melts in my hands. i will continue to buy this brand as long as I keep my beard, which is forever!</li>
            <li> I had bought the regular Initiative beard oil, and really enjoyed the citrus smell of it, as well as the conditioning of my beard. This new dry oil has the same great smell and treatment abilities. This also isn&#x27;t like most other balms, the texture is actually really nice, and it liquifies with ease in your hands. Really love the quality products Canyouhandlebar produces!</li>
            <li> When I saw this opportunity to test out this product I jumped at the chance! Being that its winter, my husband tends to ignore his razor for a while, and his beard gets a bit out of hand! I had him try this awesome smelling product, and my what a difference! No more scratchy kisses or cuddles! Thank you for helping tame my homeless mans, er..i mean my husbands beard!</li>
            <li> A great smelling dry oil that can be easily applied with a brush. Thankfully the scent is more on the citrus side and less on the lavender since I don&#x27;t really like that smell. It definitely gives it more of a shine and makes my beard look cleaner. I would recommend this product to others and will buy more for myself when I run out.</li>
