            <li>This is a hair product with more petroleum jelly than lanolin.</li>

            <li>Thsnk You for your fine</li>

            <li>In huge letters \\&quot;100%</li>

            <li>(you have to read the fine print about the \\&quot;100% Pure LANOLIN,\\&quot; where it says, \\&quot;compounded with.\\</li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed is Petrolatum-a bi-product of petroleum!  </li>

            <li>there is no per&#x3D;centage either of exactly how much lanolin is in the jar.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for pure Lanolin don not buy this product.</li>
            <li>This is NOT 100% pure lanolin.  </li>
            <li>This is not 100% pure lanolin.  </li>
            <li>Looking at the JAR LABEL, it says \\&quot;100% PURE LANOLIN.  </li>
            <li>To me, it means pure lanolin.</li>
            <li>SO IT IS NOT 100% PURE LANOLIN</li>
            <li>Ad says 100% pure lanolin.</li>
            <li>This is sold as 100% pure lanolin.  </li>
            <li>and it worked, but I had a headache for 3 days afterward because of the intense fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very deceptive and deceiving labeling.  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Should have read the reviews first (live and learn).  </li>
            <li>I wish I read the description and reviews more carefully!.</li>
            <li>The product is not bad, for what it is made of, but it is grossly misadvertised and the label itself is very misleading</li>
            <li>A blend of petroleum jelly ( mostly), lanolin, water (?), liquid paraffin, fragrance, and half a dozen other chemicals mostly unpronounceable.  </li>
            <li>Only after it arrived was I ABLE to read the tiny print on the label and saw that it was just \\&quot;compounded with 100% lanolin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in other reviews, this is by far more petroleum jelly than lanolin.  </li>
            <li>The HUGE 100% PURE LANOLIN text dwarfs the LITTLE BITTY wording that says \\&quot;FORMULATED</li>
            <li>Full disclosure, the seller gave a full refund and did not want it back, but I wasted weeks of shopping and waiting and have no lanolin yet.</li>
            <li>Not &amp;#34;100% Pure lanolin&amp;#34; , only compounded with it.</li>

            <li>Spread it on in a thin layer then run over it with a hair dryer on hot and the stuff sinks into the leather making it instantly softer and more pliable.  </li>
            <li>other than this flagrant deception, it works pretty good...but definitely NOT 100% lanolin.</li>
            <li>But it is not, it includes a little 100% pure lanolin in a petroleum product.  </li>
            <li>This is not a minor difference between the listing and the actual ingredients.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> not 100% lanolin, label is deceptive. in the fine print above the &#x27;100% lanolin&#x27; come-on, it says something like, &amp;#34;made with&amp;#34;....cannot read that &#x27;made with&#x27; jargon in the small photo provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was expecting 100% lanolin....there is no per&#x3D;centage either of exactly how much lanolin is in the jar. other than this flagrant deception, it works pretty good...but definitely NOT 100% lanolin. I would guess 5-10% lanolin at most.</li>
            <li> This product advertizes itself as 100 percent Lanolin. It is not. It has mineral oil and petrolatum in it.  If you are looking for pure Lanolin don not buy this product.</li>
            <li> The description of the product is \\&quot;Dax 100% Pure Lanolin Super Conditioner 14 oz. The product however, contains well less than 50% lanolin.  The product is not bad, for what it is made of, but it is grossly misadvertised and the label itself is very misleading (you have to read the fine print about the \\&quot;100% Pure LANOLIN,\\&quot; where it says, \\&quot;compounded with.\\&quot;  I was looking for real pure lanolin.</li>
            <li> I have been using DAX since I was 16 years old(I am now 52)I loved it then. It was the only hair product that would make my long, thick hair hold its curl and make it soft. I have noticed that the formula and consistency has changed. I&#x27;m not happy. Why mess with a good thing?  Reta from Buffalo</li>
            <li> It says RIGHT on the label...\\&quot;Compounded WITH, %100 Lanolin\\&quot;.  COMPOUNDED...duh.  Also, me daddy has used this all his life...he&#x27;s 85 now, and does not have ANY GRAY HAIR!  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s (I don&#x27;t use Dax) and I have MORE gray than him!</li>
            <li> This product is NOT 100% lanolin!  The first ingredient listed is Petrolatum-a bi-product of petroleum!  Also includes Paraffin.  I recommend anyone who chooses healthful products to buy something else.</li>
            <li> When you ask for a review of a product you never used and just received I have to wonder what you are wanting to review was it advertised correctly? (NO The Label indicates you are getting 100% Lanolin when you red the small print it says the lanolin used in this product is 100% lanolin maybe the water is not 100% the petrolatum is not 100% and the Mineral Oil is not 100%) Was the product received on time? YES Wasit packed to prevent damage in shipment? YES. Will it work for the purpose you intend to use it for? (I believe it will only time will tell) The answer on this product it is a good product for hair conditioning and yes I would recommend it It probaly is the only lanolin product made in USA since Alberto VO5 stopped using Lanolin in their products.</li>
            <li> Label is misleading.  It only contains 100% lanolin, and not a majority.  It feels like petroleum jelly.  Not as it appears.</li>
            <li> This item is deceptively advertised or perhaps mis-advertised!  This is NOT 100% pure lanolin.  This is a petroelum product with a bit of lanolin added.    I do not understand why this product is allowed to be advertised as such.  I am very disappointed in Amazon allowing this to remain listed.</li>
            <li> This smells like babies - like baby powder or something. I can&#x27;t stand smells so I gave it away as soon as I opened it.</li>
            <li> This is a hair product with more petroleum jelly than lanolin. The list of ingredients (in order) is petrolatum, lanolin, water, mineral oil, and fragrance.</li>
            <li> great service great timing love the product sent on time in great effort.  Thanks so much for this great service</li>
            <li> This product is more petrolum and fragrance than lanolin.  I used it on a sheepskin and it worked, but I had a headache for 3 days afterward because of the intense fragrance.  I am buying another product today so I can rewash and condition my sheepskin.</li>
            <li> I wish I read the description and reviews more carefully!. The label say \\&quot;100% pure lanolin\\&quot; in big type and \\&quot;compounded with\\&quot; in little blurry grey type. It&#x27;s mostly petroleum jelly with some water. Very disappointed and returning it. I can&#x27;t believe I just spent $8.80 on petroleum jelly!</li>
            <li> ...however, fine though it may be, it is rather deceptively labeled.  In huge letters \\&quot;100% Lanolin\\&quot;, in tiny letters \\&quot;Compounded with\\&quot;.  As mentioned in other reviews, this is by far more petroleum jelly than lanolin.  Even with that in mind, it might still have been useful to me as a leather preservative, had it not contained a generous quantity of furiously awful perfume.  The stink is intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is not 100% pure lanolin.  It contains lanolin and that is all. Very deceptive and deceiving labeling.  The labeling should be changed.</li>
            <li> Should have read the reviews first (live and learn).  Looking at the JAR LABEL, it says \\&quot;100% PURE LANOLIN.  To me, it means pure lanolin. Added to the insult is the perfume - ugh!</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;100% Pure lanolin&amp;#34; , only compounded with it. A blend of petroleum jelly ( mostly), lanolin, water (?), liquid paraffin, fragrance, and half a dozen other chemicals mostly unpronounceable.  Does not waterproof as well as lanolin, but does indeed smell better.</li>
            <li> 100% pure bull-puckie! This is not pure lanolin. This product is useless to me. A total waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> I was deceived by this ad and bought this junk.  This is outright false advertising.  I feel cheated.  The major ingredient is vaseline type petroleum jelly and what lanolin there is, is ALSO CUT WITH WATER AND MINERAL OIL!  SO IT IS NOT 100% PURE LANOLIN like I intended to purchase!!</li>
            <li> great for getting tangles out of my horses mane and tail.&lt;br /&gt;wish you sold it in the one gallon size.</li>
            <li> The product is not what it says it is in the Ad. I quote the listing here; \\&quot; Dax 100% Pure Lanolin Super Conditioner 14 oz.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The Ad says 100% pure lanolin. The picture has fine print on the jar that is fuzzy and almost impossible to read. When the product arrived, I was bowled over by the sickly sweet perfume smell, and the comparatively thin consistency. It did not have the thick and gooey consistency of 100% lanolin. I did not like it at all as it is NOT what it was purported to be in the ad - which I had compared to other 100% lanolin products. Only after it arrived was I ABLE to read the tiny print on the label and saw that it was just \\&quot;compounded with 100% lanolin\\&quot;. This is not a minor difference between the listing and the actual ingredients. I ordered 100% pure lanolin, and got a thin petrolatum-like product only slightly polluted by precious little lanolin at that. Full disclosure, the seller gave a full refund and did not want it back, but I wasted weeks of shopping and waiting and have no lanolin yet. I wanted them to provide the product they claimed to be selling.&lt;br /&gt;but this negative review not just about a \\&quot;bad product\\&quot; but also about my newly dented confidence in the online amazon shopping process. I have been taken, and then left with a quiet sorry and a refund as if my time and trust was worth too little to note.&lt;br /&gt;None of the other negative reviews note the full truth that that the OTC-LISTING is fully false even if the label is only surreptitiously false. Amazon.com should not be participating in this sort of blatant tom-foolery. I should not always have to read reviews to find out that a product listing is misleading.</li>
            <li> This is sold as 100% pure lanolin.  But it is not, it includes a little 100% pure lanolin in a petroleum product.  NOT THE SAME!</li>
            <li> I just started using DAX and I love it, it conditions my hair without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> Apply with a q-tip to the scalp.  Do not use on hair length unless you want limp hair.  If you do not use shampoo then it will take a bit of time to wear out.</li>
            <li> I did not read the reviews before I ordered this product.  The label says 100% lanolin conditioner. Petroleum is the 1st ingredient. Really?  what is it supposed to condition? very SORRY I order this. I feel like I got ripped off.</li>
            <li> I notice many comments stating that this product is not 100% lanolin.  Please carefully read the label again.  It indicates in small print on the front of the label that the product is \\&quot;compounded\\&quot; with 100% lanolin.  Or in other words the product is formulated with 100% lanolin in addition to other ingredients (petroleum, water, mineral oil and frangrance).</li>
            <li> The HUGE 100% PURE LANOLIN text dwarfs the LITTLE BITTY wording that says \\&quot;FORMULATED WITH\\&quot; before it. This stuff is mostly plain old petroleum jelly ... STAY AWAY !!! !!! !!!  I wish I had read before pulling the trigger on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how good it is for your hair but it makes a great conditioner for breaking in and maintaining baseball gloves. Spread it on in a thin layer then run over it with a hair dryer on hot and the stuff sinks into the leather making it instantly softer and more pliable.  Better and way less expensive than dedicated baseball glove conditioning creams and oils</li>
            <li> This is NOT pure lanolin. I wanted to use this for soap and I was sadly disappointed. Read carefully, kids!</li>
            <li> I had used this product for years off of grocery shelf hair products,&lt;br /&gt;was excited to find it on web site,I use it on my whole body.....&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me young.&lt;br /&gt;  Thsnk You for your fine product.&lt;br /&gt;  Jimmy Black.</li>
