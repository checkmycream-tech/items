            <li> the shipment was fast however the product was a little damage...</li>
            <li> Even when I scrunch my hair and use a diffuser, it comes out looking like soft natural waves and doesn&#x27;t look crunchy as I have noticed with other products and other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, some cheaper, some more expensive, but I always go back to this</li>
            <li> Then comb through and either blow dry or air dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sticky when I&#x27;m trying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Product is fine but the nozzle was broken because the shipping box was too small.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard to control how much foam comes out at a time, but you get a feel for it.  </li>
            <li> My Only complaint is that every time I order it they do not secure the cap on well and top piece gets a little broken still works, but I wish they would tape the cap on.....</li>
            <li> My hair dresser tells me there are quite a few people who are having an allergic reaction to White Ginger.</li>
            <li> As I expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> the set without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> Gives your hair volume and stay-power, without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It was dented and the plastic applicator was broken because the protective cap was loose in the box.  </li>
            <li> You put an amount about the size of a small egg in your hand and then rub your hands together to distribute it evenly on you hands, then into your hair.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> And its fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I makes a big difference in my hair and helps hold the style longer even in bad weather.</li>
            <li> I like the idea behind Paul Mitchell products and use others too.</li>
            <li> I have curl and thin hair</li>
            <li> One of the tops is broken because the product was not package well at all.  </li>

            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell Extra Body Sculpting Foam and Awapuhi Shampoo for at least 20 years and I loved it; now can no longer use them.  Paul Mitchell  added \\&quot;White Ginger\\&quot; and my scalp itches, burns and gets red welts.  My hair dresser tells me there are quite a few people who are having an allergic reaction to White Ginger.</li>
            <li> This product is great for adding a little body to your hair.  It is a little hard to control how much foam comes out at a time, but you get a feel for it.  You put an amount about the size of a small egg in your hand and then rub your hands together to distribute it evenly on you hands, then into your hair. Then comb through and either blow dry or air dry your hair.  A little goes a long ways. Does have some hold ability but that depends on your hair and probably weather conditions. I find I still have to spray a little hair spray to keep my fine hair in place. I like the idea behind Paul Mitchell products and use others too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sculpting foam for over almost 10 years.  I have tried other brands, some cheaper, some more expensive, but I always go back to this cause it works.  I have fine wavy hair and it gives it soft touchable body. Even when I scrunch my hair and use a diffuser, it comes out looking like soft natural waves and doesn&#x27;t look crunchy as I have noticed with other products and other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.  It takes a moment to expand once its sprayed.  It&#x27;s a bit sticky when I&#x27;m trying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> As I expected. I have curl and thin hair so I need volume and a product that hold my hair in a rainy weather.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  A little goes a long way.  Can&#x27;t seem to find this in any of my local stores so always buy on line.  Prices good too.  I use this for a curly look.  Comb it through my hair, fluf and go.</li>
            <li> The can didn&#x27;t fare well in the shipping process.  It was dented and the plastic applicator was broken because the protective cap was loose in the box.  I use this product all the time and if it had been better packaged there would be no complaints from me.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Product is fine but the nozzle was broken because the shipping box was too small.  Item is not returnable.  Not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Work great, just like at the salon. My Only complaint is that every time I order it they do not secure the cap on well and top piece gets a little broken still works, but I wish they would tape the cap on.....</li>
            <li> Works great to add body without making my husband&#x27;s hair hard to manage  as his hair is oily, thinning, and curly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sculpting foam for several years.  It does it right!</li>
            <li> the shipment was fast however the product was a little damage...the cap was damaged and also the nozzle of the product was destroyed---falling apart from the place it should be, which made me uneasy to use...</li>
            <li> Gives your hair volume and stay-power, without being too heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair (crunchy) as some foams do.  And its fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it has enough punch to give my hair lift .  It&#x27;s a great hair product.</li>
            <li> One of the tops is broken because the product was not package well at all.  I hope that I am a able to use it before it totally breaks off</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My salon uses this setting foam and so I&#x27;ve used this brand for&lt;br /&gt;awhile.  My hair requires lots of help and this product helps me&lt;br /&gt;hold the set without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many volumizing foams for my hair and none compared to this one.  Therefore, I purchased several bottles just in case they stop making it.  I makes a big difference in my hair and helps hold the style longer even in bad weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam for about 20 years.  It tames my frizzy-curly hair and smells delicious too!  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Good product and service</li>
    </ol>
