            <li>It adds thickness without clumping for the most part.</li>
            <li>Love the deign too.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara from Clinique.</li>
            <li>I love all clinique products.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is ok once it&#x27;s on, but for the brand and the price I wanted better than ok.</li>
            <li>For most bauty products I have favorite brands.  </li>
            <li>love clinique products what more can i say.</li>
            <li>i love this mascara.</li>
            <li>the only kind she likes and it looks great on her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with thin/small lashes and for me, the brush on this mascara holds WAY too much product.</li>
            <li>And, when I need it to come off at night before going to sleep, it easily washes off.</li>
            <li>When you make a mistake it comes off your face easily too, but lasts all</li>
            <li>It does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS</li>
            <li>It only gets 2 starts because it was a nice applicator brush, and did make a nice even coat.</li>
            <li>Goes on super smooth and its the perfect black.</li>
            <li>I was so glad because it was even better than the high impact.</li>
            <li>As beauty companies are coming up with new products that make lashes look better, thicker, more voluminous  </li>
            <li>so I was excited about this one because the brush design is one I&#x27;m familiar with and being thinner</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try a better brand for a change, and I&#x27;ve had other Clinique products that I loved.</li>
            <li>This has excellent separation and wont clump but even with three coats [dry in between], which is more than I have the patience for daily, it really isn&#x27;t very thickening/dramatic</li>
            <li>This mascara is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more natural look with length.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>It is intense, bold, volumizing and lengthening--all in one.  </li>
            <li>Their standard high impact mascara always looked nice</li>
            <li>Have replaced my regular Lancome with this one as I find it defines the lashes better.</li>
            <li>By the end of 10 hours I&#x27;d have more of it in the inside corners of my eyes than actually still on my eyelashes</li>
            <li>leave your lashes looking long, thick and beautiful!</li>
            <li>Certainly can&#x27;t provide a satisfactory review.  </li>
            <li>but I have fine, short lashes</li>
            <li>Too much product on the brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>thankyou so much .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real.....</li>
            <li>has about the same look as my old favorite [Tarte Lights Camera Flashes]</li>
            <li>Require to scrape the sides to reduce the amount of mascara,  however, on many of the initial uses needed to entirely wipe off the brush And reinsert.  </li>
            <li>It also does not come off easily with face wash and water as my other mascara does.</li>
            <li>I blind ordered this product after hearing great reviews.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you screw the cap on tight when you are done or it will dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone who needs separation or wants a basic rich black mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought for 38 yr old daughter...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking to my old stand-by.....</li>
            <li>So while it is not perfect, it is a good product worh giving it a try.</li>
            <li>and I really am trying to find something more dramatic.</li>
            <li>and they are 3 times as long and so much fuller.</li>
            <li>Well, other mascaras irritate my eyes and this one does or only mildly does on occasion sooo...</li>
            <li>However you need to be careful how much mascara you apply on the lower lashes.  </li>
            <li>I did not have too much product on the brush like other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li>I especially like that the black is so intense.</li>
            <li>It really gives to mu eyelashes extreme volume and stays there all day long.</li>

            <li> I use it in black color and my lashes really open up the eyes after macara application.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look very long!!</li>
            <li> This mascara will definitely make your lashes look long and thick.  </li>
            <li> This mascara washes off without running down your face.</li>
            <li> I usually like Clinique products, especially the mascara in the past.</li>

            <li> Not sure if it may have been a defective tube?</li>
            <li> the spider thick mascara look which this mascara provides.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, wasted quite a bit of product.  </li>
            <li> I mean, didn&#x27;t even look like I had anything on!</li>
            <li> Alas, it is not the case with mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I used three coats and it looks like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> I think this mascara provides an outdated look, when we kept layering and got that gunky looking effect.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I thought it would be terrible because I normally dislike this type of applicator brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive</li>
            <li> [Tarte is difficult to wash off and has a two sided brush which is a hassle]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this mascara flakes badly and was always working</li>

            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. It makes my lashes look very long!!</li>
            <li> It does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It&#x27;s too expensive but when it goes on - it stays on without producing &amp;#34;racoon&amp;#34; eyes. And, when I need it to come off at night before going to sleep, it easily washes off. Have replaced my regular Lancome with this one as I find it defines the lashes better.</li>
            <li> Too much product on the brush.  Require to scrape the sides to reduce the amount of mascara,  however, on many of the initial uses needed to entirely wipe off the brush And reinsert.  Needless to say, wasted quite a bit of product.  Certainly can&#x27;t provide a satisfactory review.  Waste of product, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing mascara over 50 years; and, without a doubt, this is the best ever.  It is intense, bold, volumizing and lengthening--all in one.  Finally, I have found the perfect mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jayne Waldridge&lt;br /&gt;Fleming Island, Florida</li>
            <li> This mascara does wonderful things for my lashes. I blind ordered this product after hearing great reviews. When I received it, I thought it would be terrible because I normally dislike this type of applicator brush. But it works like a charm. It brush coats all the lashes, top, bottom, and corners. I did not have too much product on the brush like other reviewers suggested. Be forewarned, this mascara NEEDS to be built up. One coat will look like your regular lashes were dyed black. I used three coats and it looks like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. No clumps, or flakes!</li>
            <li> This has excellent separation and wont clump but even with three coats [dry in between], which is more than I have the patience for daily, it really isn&#x27;t very thickening/dramatic which is what I had been hoping for. This mascara is my favorite so far. It applies smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and washes off easily. I especially like that the black is so intense. I have tried tons of mascara and none of them have been so deeply black.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who needs separation or wants a basic rich black mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It has about the same look as my old favorite [Tarte Lights Camera Flashes] but Clinique is richer-black and only takes one step to apply. [Tarte is difficult to wash off and has a two sided brush which is a hassle]&lt;br /&gt;I like it but I have fine, short lashes and I really am trying to find something more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It works well and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Yes! This is the perfect makeup accessory. I absolutely love this stuff! I can&#x27;t use anything else. Found this after being recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> Some May like the spider thick mascara look which this mascara provides. I prefer a more natural look with length. It also does not come off easily with face wash and water as my other mascara does. I think this mascara provides an outdated look, when we kept layering and got that gunky looking effect.</li>
            <li> Its like wearing falsies without all the trouble! Goes on super smooth and its the perfect black. When you make a mistake it comes off your face easily too, but lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con: it flakes if you touch it</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It adds thickness without clumping for the most part. Make sure that you screw the cap on tight when you are done or it will dry out quickly. Is it worth the money? Well, other mascaras irritate my eyes and this one does or only mildly does on occasion sooo...The jury is still out.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really good. It really gives to mu eyelashes extreme volume and stays there all day long. Love the deign too. I am really satisfied :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara. I was previously using clinique high impact mascara but my husband got this one for me when I ran out. I was so glad because it was even better than the high impact. I have THEE shortest eyelashes but 2-3 coats of this and they are 3 times as long and so much fuller. No clumping or spidery look. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara from Clinique. No clumps, great texture and nice wand.</li>

            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try a better brand for a change, and I&#x27;ve had other Clinique products that I loved. Unfortunately, this mascara flakes badly and was always working it&#x27;s way into my eyes. By the end of 10 hours I&#x27;d have more of it in the inside corners of my eyes than actually still on my eyelashes (or so it would seem). It only gets 2 starts because it was a nice applicator brush, and did make a nice even coat.</li>

As beauty companies are coming up with new products that make lashes look better, thicker, more voluminous  I keep searching for the brand that will make me completely happy.  Clinique is trusted brand so I gave them a try.  This mascara will definitely make your lashes look long and thick.  I use it in black color and my lashes really open up the eyes after macara application.  However you need to be careful how much mascara you apply on the lower lashes.  Product has ability to smudge by the end of the day.  So while it is not perfect, it is a good product worh giving it a try.</li>
            <li> great color applies nicely would purchase again.  thankyou so much . love clinique products what more can i say. excellent</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mascara I ever had!!!! It makes my eyes looks like a doll. Don&#x27;t hesitate: this is it!!!</li>
            <li> my all time favorite mascara!!!! leave your lashes looking long, thick and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I usually like Clinique products, especially the mascara in the past. Their standard high impact mascara always looked nice so I was excited about this one because the brush design is one I&#x27;m familiar with and being thinner it always made my lashes look longer. I applied this and it did nothing! I mean, didn&#x27;t even look like I had anything on! No curling, volumizing, etc. Turned my lashes limp and clumpy. Not sure if it may have been a defective tube? I attempted to return the product but the seller has a &amp;#34;no return&amp;#34; policy. Bummer, I wasted so much money. Now, I have to try and sell it somewhere else. I&#x27;m sticking to my old stand-by..... Benefit They&#x27;re Real.....best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I  RECMMEND  THIS  PRODUCT  TO  ANYONE  WITH  ALLERGY  PROBLEMS.  THIS  IS  THE  ONLY  MASCARA  I  HAVE  EVER  USED.  FABULOUS</li>
            <li> i love this mascara. makes my eye lashes huge! but i unfortunately think it makes my eye lids itchy :(</li>
