    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It now works perfectly!</li>
            <li>They are superb cutters.</li>
            <li>Has saved hundreds in &#x27;haircut&#x27; charges, and it is the best cut for him.  </li>
            <li>(of course the oil doesn&#x27;t smell very good and you must wash hair after as it leaves the smell in the hair)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was always happy with it</li>
            <li>Word to the wise, Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>I believe it is a good investment</li>
            <li>My first one lasted flawlessly for 12 years for 2 people using it.</li>
            <li>You may not get a perfect hair cut with this machine at first</li>
            <li>people are always amazed when they hear that I cut my own hair and some had said that they now cut their own hair.  </li>
            <li>This new one now works perfectly.</li>
            <li>We use this product with a good strong Shop-Vac, and I think this helps it cut better, too.  </li>
            <li>Right now it works great again.</li>
            <li>: works better than the flowb</li>
            <li>cuts my hair faster, easier, and better</li>
            <li>so I end up better cut than the flowb**.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Directions could be better</li>
            <li>Many design improvements</li>
            <li>They said to oil it more.</li>
            <li>works ok  for my pets trimming</li>
            <li>A child could have designed this better.</li>
            <li>My husband has used this product for many years and he couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>They love the savings when on a college student budget.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a pretty good product and glad we made the purchase as our kids have an easier time getting a cut from this than with clippers.</li>
            <li>Easy to store away</li>
            <li>, I could probably buy a good, new bicycle with the money.   </li>
            <li>also gives me a better and more consistent haircut than the hair professionals have done...</li>
            <li>Just wash your hair after one of those sessions and all will be fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for those who just want a simple hair cut and aren&#x27;t fussy about style.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this thinking it would be an easy, clean way to cut his hair at home.</li>
            <li>so I cannot speak to how well it works for that, but my boys and I like how quick and easy we can cut our hair and keep it looking neat.  </li>
            <li>You will still need to somebody to clean up your neckline and around your ears.</li>
            <li>I love being able to cut my hair(and beard) with no mess</li>
            <li>I returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>get a quick touchup when ever that special day comes along and my full haircut takes me about 5 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li>more even, easier to adjust length for: top, sides, back, &amp; around</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very many hair cuts.</li>
            <li>that if you get too much oil on the blades (easy to do with the provided oil)</li>
            <li>I was able to cut my own hair in less than five minutes.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, don&#x27;t even go there, if you have fine or straight hair</li>
            <li>After talking with some friends, one mentioned they use this product on their own kid for the same reason.</li>
            <li>Maybe this one needs more oiling than my old one.</li>
            <li>you want to cut your own long hair, go to YouTube,</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 12-15 years.</li>
            <li>I must say my first attempt did not end vary</li>
            <li>My 2nd robocut got dropped on the tile one too many times (also my bad).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 10 years before falling apart.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it quit working.</li>
            <li>This is the third version of the Robocut that I have bought in many years.</li>
            <li>Results are consistent, unlike having cuts done at the salon/barber shop.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several replacement blades from the support line as well because, as you can imagine, the Robocut works better and gives you a cleaner haircut with a nice sharp blade.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one of these in 1993 and have not had to have any other kind of haircut since.</li>
            <li>The same gentlemen always answers and is very polite and helps me with my problem and in most cases sent me a replacement part under warranty.  </li>
            <li>No mess to clean up</li>
            <li>Unless the person that usually cuts your hair needs a good belly laugh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a bit more oil the first few times, apparently the cutter needed more braking in than my old one which lasted 12 years.</li>
            <li>Use an accurate oil dispenser such as 3 In One Oil</li>
            <li>This is absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>really like these hair cutters.</li>
            <li>This haircutter does this very well.  </li>
            <li>I finally disassembled the unit and ran the power supply cord in a more direct fashion to the motor.</li>
            <li>It works well, but tends to lightly grab my hair if I wait way too long for a haircut.</li>
            <li>so we like to keep a short, cool, neat haircut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing an older model that I have used for about 18 years</li>
            <li>No adapter for older Electroluxes, I had to improvise.</li>
            <li>their were air leaks where the adaptors connected, no vacuum to lift hair , I was able to tape around the connectors to get a vacuum</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>you can always cut more and after a few times you will get it dialed in, you can do it</li>
            <li>This one has done 4 or 5 haircuts for me and is still working like new.  </li>
            <li>I will probably purchase another and just hope it lasts longer but do not have confidence in this new model.</li>
            <li>For some reason the case eventually broke, so I bought this new one.</li>
            <li>When not under warranty, I have always bought a new one for they are inexpensive compared to the cost of salon haircuts + time, tips, and gas.  </li>
            <li>a lot of girls on there have it down to a fine art.</li>
            <li>~2,200 so far; and then don&#x27;t get me started on all the hours saved on getting a faster robocut, not having to drive to &amp; from,</li>
            <li>Loud, no problems for kids though&lt;</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d banked $15 for each haircut I&#x27;ve given myself with my old Robocut</li>
            <li>It is extremely loud.</li>
            <li>On a couple of occasions, I have had a small part break and had to call the easy to remember 1(888)HAIRCUT support line.  </li>
            <li>The concept is good but it lasted less than a year before failure.  </li>
            <li>It definitely makes it so there is no clippings mess to clean up</li>
            <li>However, when my old one finally broke I purchased this one in 2012.</li>
            <li>longhair cat threatened to disown me if I got near him, it didn&#x27;t work on the dog, and when I tried it on the Ends (TGFT) of my long hair.â€¦</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super dull.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s super dull.</li>
            <li> It clogged during the first cut- jammed with hair from the blades to appx 4&amp;#34; down the hose where the power cord (it runs up the hose) is knotted to keep a connector from pulling apart.</li>
            <li> Does not hook up to vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> I went through 2 or 3 robocuts and I would say they are garbage because they dont last very long.  </li>

            <li> I have never used on long hair</li>
            <li> Finally it worked less well than I expected, but I do use it from time to time.</li>
            <li> After going to get my hair cut a few times making appointments and after a few long waiting room I thought enough is enough.  </li>
            <li> product is lousy and isn&#x27;t worth the  money.</li>
            <li> The hose did not fit our vacuum, he had to use the shop vac instead.</li>
            <li> I know I have personally used at least three over the years, and I bought each of my two boys one when they went off to college.  </li>
            <li> Having the cord run down the outside of the hose is no less inconvenient than it being on the inside.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 in recent months and within 2 time of use it has burned out, and I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> So get your hair cut the way you like take a few measurements  </li>
            <li> The Robocut pays for itself in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> and it will be paying for itself in a few months,</li>
            <li> It clipped the long hair, but very slowly.</li>
            <li> It could not handle my dogs heavy undercoat!</li>
            <li> I get the impression I am speaking to the owner of the small company when I call this line rather than some help desk person in another country.  </li>
            <li> If you would like to save money cutting your hair, definitely get the Flowbee, I have had two of these also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to late to return it, so it&#x27;s going in the trash; I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least five Robocuts over the years.  </li>
            <li> My kids have a difficult time getting a haircut due to the hair landing on their skin and making them itchy.</li>
            <li> This model needs to be a lot less expensive to risk the iffy quality these days.</li>
            <li> will buy another one if this one fails in a few years.</li>
            <li> ** has a bit of trouble pulling up thicker hair and cutting; my son who had been using the flowb</li>
            <li> Build quality seems to be thin plastic</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt but it is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I did use the wrong oil once which caused the plastic to crack on my 1st robocut (my bad).</li>
            <li> The blade on this thing is the worst!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing an older model that I have used for about 18 years I was always happy with it</li>
            <li> This is absolute garbage. I have purchased two and they both cracked at on the shaft where the blades spin. I tried contacting haircut.com regarding the second one and they never wrote back. If you would like to save money cutting your hair, definitely get the Flowbee, I have had two of these also. The first one lasted 12-15 years.</li>
            <li> Compared to the flow bee this is a defected piece of equipment. I have bought 2 in recent months and within 2 time of use it has burned out, and I have thin hair. The hair .com product is lousy and isn&#x27;t worth the  money. Word to the wise, Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> In 2002 I was at my cousins house when he told me that he had cut not only his hair but his three sons hair for years using a Flowbee.  For a time I watched him use it before one day trying it myself.  I must say my first attempt did not end vary well but thankfully I had an understanding hair stylist helped me out.  After going to get my hair cut a few times making appointments and after a few long waiting room I thought enough is enough.  After some research I decided on the RoboCut instead of the Flowbee in 2004 I had it shipped to my house.  Now I cut my hair whenever it is covenant for me get a quick touchup when ever that special day comes along and my full haircut takes me about 5 to 10 minutes people are always amazed when they hear that I cut my own hair and some had said that they now cut their own hair.  So get your hair cut the way you like take a few measurements  start long you can always cut more and after a few times you will get it dialed in, you can do it itâ€™s not that hard.&lt;br /&gt;Tj</li>
            <li> Fyi: works better than the flowb** for me.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts more even, easier to adjust length for: top, sides, back, &amp; around ears.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts my hair faster, easier, and better so I end up better cut than the flowb**.&lt;br /&gt;It also gives me a better and more consistent haircut than the hair professionals have done... for me.&lt;br /&gt;This newest model seems a bit sturdier than the last 2 purchased over the last 20 years, so lasting 10 years each is still excellent.&lt;br /&gt;At 15 bucks a cut every ~1.5 mo. it&#x27;s saved ~2,200 so far; and then don&#x27;t get me started on all the hours saved on getting a faster robocut, not having to drive to &amp; from, waiting, hair washing, etc. at the hair professionals.&lt;br /&gt;Never had to do any maintenance or sharpen the blades. I did use the wrong oil once which caused the plastic to crack on my 1st robocut (my bad). My 2nd robocut got dropped on the tile one too many times (also my bad).&lt;br /&gt;The flowb** has a bit of trouble pulling up thicker hair and cutting; my son who had been using the flowb** for several months had to stop using the flowb** mid-haircut on his last cut and switch back over to the robocut.&lt;br /&gt;My brother in-law has only used the flowb**, also for 20 years or so too, but he does cut his hair every week.</li>
            <li> It could not handle my dogs heavy undercoat! It clipped the long hair, but very slowly. I returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Had this for a couple months, it is a clone of the robocut I replaced.  I went through 2 or 3 robocuts and I would say they are garbage because they dont last very long.  This one has done 4 or 5 haircuts for me and is still working like new.  Hopefully this wont quit spinning like the robocuts did.  I would say this one is a buy but if it dies like the robocuts did I will update my review and remove the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> My kids have a difficult time getting a haircut due to the hair landing on their skin and making them itchy. After talking with some friends, one mentioned they use this product on their own kid for the same reason. After receiving the product and following the directions were cut our oldest sons hair with ease. No fuss and no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- No mess to clean up&lt;br /&gt;- Multiple shrouds for different hair cut lengths&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to store away&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with everything needed in box including a pet shroud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Loud, no problems for kids though&lt;br /&gt;- Must be oiled every 5 minutes according to directions (of course the oil doesn&#x27;t smell very good and you must wash hair after as it leaves the smell in the hair)&lt;br /&gt;- Build quality seems to be thin plastic so hopefully it will last.&lt;br /&gt;- Directions could be better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a pretty good product and glad we made the purchase as our kids have an easier time getting a cut from this than with clippers.</li>
            <li> their were air leaks where the adaptors connected, no vacuum to lift hair , I was able to tape around the connectors to get a vacuum</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these in 1993 and have not had to have any other kind of haircut since. However, when my old one finally broke I purchased this one in 2012. Many design improvements but the motor died in the drawer between cuts. I corresponded with them for parts got a response then nothing. I will probably purchase another and just hope it lasts longer but do not have confidence in this new model. If it had not died, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. If the company had given me a repair option, 4 stars but for now not so reliable.  Since my initial review I was contacted an received necessary replacement parts so will change to 4 stars.   I love being able to cut my hair(and beard) with no mess, it five minutes any time I want. I wish I&#x27;d banked $15 for each haircut I&#x27;ve given myself with my old Robocut, I could probably buy a good, new bicycle with the money.   This model needs to be a lot less expensive to risk the iffy quality these days.</li>
            <li> The concept is good but it lasted less than a year before failure.  This is the second one I have purchased.  The first one lasted about 10 years before falling apart.</li>
            <li> Update: I just changed this to 5 stars. It now works perfectly! I used a bit more oil the first few times, apparently the cutter needed more braking in than my old one which lasted 12 years. This new one now works perfectly. These trimmers pay for themselves almost immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these hair cutters. They are superb cutters. My first one lasted flawlessly for 12 years for 2 people using it. For some reason the case eventually broke, so I bought this new one. The first time I used it, it quit working. I contacted them and got an immediate response. They said to oil it more. I did that and it started back up immediately. Maybe this one needs more oiling than my old one. Right now it works great again. If things go well, I will come back later and make this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the third version of the Robocut that I have bought in many years. It works well, but tends to lightly grab my hair if I wait way too long for a haircut. It doesn&#x27;t hurt but it is uncomfortable. The Robocut pays for itself in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that if you get too much oil on the blades (easy to do with the provided oil) your hair will probably come out o a bit oily. Just wash your hair after one of those sessions and all will be fine. Use an accurate oil dispenser such as 3 In One Oil and this should be avoided. I only oil mine every 3 months. You will still need to somebody to clean up your neckline and around your ears. For those reasons it receives a 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another one if this one fails in a few years.</li>
            <li> works ok  for my pets trimming</li>
            <li> No adapter for older Electroluxes, I had to improvise. It clogged during the first cut- jammed with hair from the blades to appx 4&amp;#34; down the hose where the power cord (it runs up the hose) is knotted to keep a connector from pulling apart. A child could have designed this better. I finally disassembled the unit and ran the power supply cord in a more direct fashion to the motor. Having the cord run down the outside of the hose is no less inconvenient than it being on the inside. Finally it worked less well than I expected, but I do use it from time to time. I do NOT recommend doing what I had to do to make this thing work!</li>
            <li> Did not do what it said it would. Does not hook up to vacuum cleaner. Returned it !</li>
            <li> Save your money. Unless the person that usually cuts your hair needs a good belly laugh.&lt;br /&gt;My longhair cat threatened to disown me if I got near him, it didn&#x27;t work on the dog, and when I tried it on the Ends (TGFT) of my long hair.â€¦&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, don&#x27;t even go there, if you have fine or straight hair anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to cut your own long hair, go to YouTube, a lot of girls on there have it down to a fine art.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for many years and he couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Has saved hundreds in &#x27;haircut&#x27; charges, and it is the best cut for him.  Results are consistent, unlike having cuts done at the salon/barber shop.</li>
            <li> As soon as this device arrived I started using it.  I was able to cut my own hair in less than five minutes.  I believe it is a good investment and it will be paying for itself in a few months, after that I&#x27;ll be saving $20 - $30.  I definitely recommend this product to everyone who is struggling in this economy and also for those who want to save money.  You may not get a perfect hair cut with this machine at first but I believe that after enough practice you may get the desired results.  This is a great product for those who just want a simple hair cut and aren&#x27;t fussy about style.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this thinking it would be an easy, clean way to cut his hair at home. Well..... 1. The hose did not fit our vacuum, he had to use the shop vac instead. 2. It is extremely loud. 3. He used it twice, and when he went to use it for the third time, it would not turn on. It&#x27;s to late to return it, so it&#x27;s going in the trash; I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least five Robocuts over the years.  I know I have personally used at least three over the years, and I bought each of my two boys one when they went off to college.  With three males in the household, we have saved hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, in haircut costs.  My boys and I like to run so we like to keep a short, cool, neat haircut.  This haircutter does this very well.  I have never used on long hair so I cannot speak to how well it works for that, but my boys and I like how quick and easy we can cut our hair and keep it looking neat.  My boys college roommates have even borrowed their Robocuts.  They love the savings when on a college student budget.  On a couple of occasions, I have had a small part break and had to call the easy to remember 1(888)HAIRCUT support line.  I get the impression I am speaking to the owner of the small company when I call this line rather than some help desk person in another country.  The same gentlemen always answers and is very polite and helps me with my problem and in most cases sent me a replacement part under warranty.  When not under warranty, I have always bought a new one for they are inexpensive compared to the cost of salon haircuts + time, tips, and gas.  I have ordered several replacement blades from the support line as well because, as you can imagine, the Robocut works better and gives you a cleaner haircut with a nice sharp blade.  We use this product with a good strong Shop-Vac, and I think this helps it cut better, too.  It definitely makes it so there is no clippings mess to clean up which is another bonus of this haircutter.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very many hair cuts. Motor freezes up</li>
            <li> Boo! The blade on this thing is the worst! It&#x27;s super dull. I tried using it once and ended up just throwing it away as it simply would not cut my dog&#x27;s hair.</li>
