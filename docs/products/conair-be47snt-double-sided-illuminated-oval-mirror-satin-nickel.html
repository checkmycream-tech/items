            <li>The magnifying side is great.  </li>
            <li>Both mirrors are of a good size.  </li>
            <li>To compensate, I will try and get myself fairly close to the mirror before flipping it over to the magnified side.  </li>
            <li>I received this mirror as a gift and absolutely loved it because I had been wanting one for a while</li>
            <li>This is a well-made and well-finished mirror with good optics.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in good order and worked well but was just not what the person receiving the gift wanted.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift and the person loved it.</li>
            <li>The size is really good.</li>
            <li>I remember a couple of reviews stating that the light wasn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this mirror.</li>
            <li>Embellishments could make the mirror more attractive as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The light and magnification make this an ideal tool for plucking even the finest, smallest eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad to have this mirror and recommend it.</li>
            <li>This mirror is very attractive and the level of magnification is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this mirror!  </li>
            <li>and it makes my morning routine much more successful.</li>
            <li>Light works great.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice finish that matches the rest of my bathroom.</li>
            <li>and she is thrilled.  </li>
            <li>The satin nickel is nice looking</li>
            <li>Perfect size of mirror, and magnification is great especially with the lighting.</li>
            <li>New mirror works great and the wife is happy.</li>
            <li>It is attractive and looks very nice on my new vanity.</li>
            <li>Needed a mirror and lamp for my new vanity, and this seemed like the perfect idea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size for the bathroom and the magnification is super.  </li>
            <li>It tips over very easily.  .  .</li>
            <li>Also a really good nightlight / ambient light to turn on in the bathroom when I just need to grab something out of the vanity during the night &amp; don&#x27;t want to turn the strong bright overhead lights on.</li>
            <li>Provides good strong light, but not too bright, for tweezing my eyebrows &amp; applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>And it looks and feels more expenive than it is, which is always nice.</li>
            <li>The light is not as bright as I&#x27;d like but still usable.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>The light is bright and you are able to replace the bulb.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and have a nice quality.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>It is a good height, it pivots to enable you to use it in various positions, and it is attractive on the counter.  </li>
            <li>I respectfully disagree.  </li>
            <li>Although the light could be more effective, for the price, the product performs well.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Love it &amp; would buy again.</li>
            <li>Adjustable brightness would be much better.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a more scientific way to explain that</li>
            <li>The clarity is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love the satin nickel color.</li>
            <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t get so warm and it wasn&#x27;t cheap, but everything else is great, including the magnification and the clear cord.</li>
            <li>I can use it more easily while standing without having a mounted mirror.</li>
            <li>The lighting is great and the mirror is clear and without distortion.  </li>
            <li>This is a good size, doesn&#x27;t magnify so much that Grandma can&#x27;t tell what she is looking at, and shipped with no problems.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted, has great light, and is the right size.  </li>
            <li>Is for real, you can improve your beauty with this simple accessory, good light, big size, and best of all good magnifier, i can see every pore of my face.</li>
            <li>It provides a good light (not glaring) for makeup and you can clearly see details on your face....</li>
            <li>This mirror is fabulous,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>I agree with the reviewer who noted that the light is somewhat warm colored, leaving you wondering whether your makeup looks OK in natural light.</li>
            <li>The description was precisely what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this was just an anomaly and the next one works great.</li>
            <li>That said it&#x27;s great for doing my make up in the low lighting of my college dorm</li>
            <li>Two sided mirror (regular and magnified) works great.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this makeup light because I just finished a bathroom renovation.  </li>
            <li>I would like for it to let off a little more light, but the size, style, and magnification are all great for what I need it for.</li>
            <li>A ground fault interrupter receptacle is easily purchased at a local hardware store or elsewhere within Amazon and is a good investment for your bathroom - even if you don&#x27;t decide on buying this mirror.</li>
            <li>Good illuminations and bulb can easily be replaced with any standard candelabra type.</li>
            <li>This was the second Vanity mirror I had bought for my wife, the first one was almost $100 and was no way near as good as this one, great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li>Yes the light is kind of dim</li>
            <li>I have mine on a dressing table that is next to a north facing window, and I have a lamp that I use for bright light.</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t super bright, but it&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality product at a good price.</li>
            <li>She loved it till the on/off switch stopped working after only about 4-5 uses.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t super bright, but when using it for makeup, I use other light sources in addition anyway.</li>
            <li>This mirror is awesome, may need a little extra light tho!</li>
            <li>This is a great little mirror.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use this mirror everyday.</li>
            <li>The brushed nickel matches perfectly with the other fixtures.</li>
            <li>I also like that i can set this on a table and since it&#x27;s tall it is just right</li>
            <li>This mirror is meant for you to get RIGHT UP to it.</li>
            <li>Fits in perfectly with my bath decor, and I can see to get that last little touch up.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself could be a little larger but all in all it is absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t too bright or too dull.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nicely made and I really like that it has the two different magnifications.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is dim compared to &amp;#34;makeup mirrors&amp;#34; I have used in the past, but what it does that is great</li>
            <li>I like this mirror very much and am hoping that when i replace the bulb with Reveal chandelier bulbs the illumination will improve.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>It works exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li>My wife has used this daily now, for a year and is quite satisfied with the function and form</li>
            <li>The mirror works exactly as anticipated.  </li>
            <li>First one I have owned, and can&#x27;t imagine leaving the house without having one.  </li>
            <li>I use it for plucking my eyebrows {love it especially for this purpose, I get every hair!}, and applying makeup.</li>
            <li>She actually likes it better</li>
            <li>The most used setting is DAYLIGHT and that is the last setting on the dial.  </li>
            <li>If the first setting on the dial was DAYLIGHT</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>You can be sure that it would last.</li>
            <li>tall enough, bright enough.. can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>The pricing of this mirror easily beats many mirrors of equal quality and features sold locally where Iive at 3 times the price.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is very well.  </li>
            <li>The illumination and the magnification functions work very well.  </li>
            <li>is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Very unpleased &amp; upset.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
            <li>is that it illuminates your face evenly, with no shadows, which is very helpful for makeup application.</li>
            <li>really magnifies well and helps me pluck those stray hairs that i miss with just the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>With this mirrow i learn to do my makeup as a professional !!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also sturdy, so I am not disappointed with something being cheap and light and built poorly.  </li>
            <li>My mom also said it had much better magnification and brightness than other mirrors she&#x27;d seen or used.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is not as strong as that of other mirrors I have had, but is strong enough.  </li>
            <li>This mirror looks nice and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble deciding between this and one without light - given the feedback about how dim the light is.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without my mirror!</li>
            <li>Contrary to the picture, the illumination color is more white than yellow and the illumination occurs on both sides.  </li>
            <li>The reviews scared me because they said the light is too dim, but after looking around all of these type of mirrors had the same comments.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I looked at a few others but they all seemed interchangeable/comparable so mostly decided on price.  </li>
            <li>I would only use this on its own if I were gonig somewhere dark like a nightclub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using this for a few months and still love it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, if this hadn&#x27;t broken I&#x27;d probably be writing a much more complimentary review.  </li>
            <li>Great price compared to other models in the stores that were at least $100.</li>
            <li>In the product description it stated that it has touch activated power so you can adjust the light setting without putting your makeup down.</li>
            <li>This makeup mirror sits on my vanity under a wall light that has 4 bright lights that point down onto the vanity and still this makeup mirror is not bright enough.  </li>
            <li>perhaps too clearly.</li>
            <li>This is clearly going to break the dial setting.  </li>
            <li>She really likes the lighted mirror and the different magnifications.</li>
            <li>Looks nice on the bathroom counter, in the corner behind the faucet.</li>
            <li>We have a new mirror in route now and I will update this review if any further problems occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this issue, the mirror seemed well made and did what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>TIP:  to those people that said that this was like putting on makeup by candle light, and complained that the light was too poor, you aren&#x27;t getting close enough to the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it, although these are not major issues to me at the moment, are: it is a bit thick in width, the lighting could be brighter and whiter, and it has to be plugged for the light to work.</li>
            <li>I was a little certain on the lighting since it cannot be adjusted</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good illuminations and bulb can easily be replaced with any standard candelabra type.</li>
            <li> This was the second Vanity mirror I had bought for my wife, the first one was almost $100 and was no way near as good as this one, great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> Yes the light is kind of dim</li>
            <li> I have mine on a dressing table that is next to a north facing window, and I have a lamp that I use for bright light.</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t super bright, but it&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality product at a good price.</li>
            <li> She loved it till the on/off switch stopped working after only about 4-5 uses.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t super bright, but when using it for makeup, I use other light sources in addition anyway.</li>
            <li> This mirror is awesome, may need a little extra light tho!</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use this mirror everyday.</li>
            <li> The brushed nickel matches perfectly with the other fixtures.</li>
            <li> I also like that i can set this on a table and since it&#x27;s tall it is just right</li>
            <li> This mirror is meant for you to get RIGHT UP to it.</li>
            <li> Fits in perfectly with my bath decor, and I can see to get that last little touch up.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself could be a little larger but all in all it is absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t too bright or too dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nicely made and I really like that it has the two different magnifications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is dim compared to &amp;#34;makeup mirrors&amp;#34; I have used in the past, but what it does that is great</li>
            <li> I like this mirror very much and am hoping that when i replace the bulb with Reveal chandelier bulbs the illumination will improve.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> It works exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used this daily now, for a year and is quite satisfied with the function and form</li>
            <li> The mirror works exactly as anticipated.  </li>
            <li> First one I have owned, and can&#x27;t imagine leaving the house without having one.  </li>
            <li> I use it for plucking my eyebrows {love it especially for this purpose, I get every hair!}, and applying makeup.</li>
            <li> She actually likes it better</li>
            <li> The most used setting is DAYLIGHT and that is the last setting on the dial.  </li>
            <li> If the first setting on the dial was DAYLIGHT</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> You can be sure that it would last.</li>
            <li> tall enough, bright enough.. can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The pricing of this mirror easily beats many mirrors of equal quality and features sold locally where Iive at 3 times the price.  </li>
            <li> The magnification is very well.  </li>
            <li> The illumination and the magnification functions work very well.  </li>
            <li> is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Very unpleased &amp; upset.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
            <li> is that it illuminates your face evenly, with no shadows, which is very helpful for makeup application.</li>
            <li> really magnifies well and helps me pluck those stray hairs that i miss with just the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> With this mirrow i learn to do my makeup as a professional !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also sturdy, so I am not disappointed with something being cheap and light and built poorly.  </li>
            <li> My mom also said it had much better magnification and brightness than other mirrors she&#x27;d seen or used.  </li>
            <li> The magnification is not as strong as that of other mirrors I have had, but is strong enough.  </li>
            <li> This mirror looks nice and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble deciding between this and one without light - given the feedback about how dim the light is.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without my mirror!</li>
            <li> Contrary to the picture, the illumination color is more white than yellow and the illumination occurs on both sides.  </li>
            <li> The reviews scared me because they said the light is too dim, but after looking around all of these type of mirrors had the same comments.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I looked at a few others but they all seemed interchangeable/comparable so mostly decided on price.  </li>
            <li> I would only use this on its own if I were gonig somewhere dark like a nightclub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months and still love it.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, if this hadn&#x27;t broken I&#x27;d probably be writing a much more complimentary review.  </li>
            <li> Great price compared to other models in the stores that were at least $100.</li>
            <li> In the product description it stated that it has touch activated power so you can adjust the light setting without putting your makeup down.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror sits on my vanity under a wall light that has 4 bright lights that point down onto the vanity and still this makeup mirror is not bright enough.  </li>
            <li> perhaps too clearly.</li>
            <li> This is clearly going to break the dial setting.  </li>
            <li> She really likes the lighted mirror and the different magnifications.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on the bathroom counter, in the corner behind the faucet.</li>
            <li> We have a new mirror in route now and I will update this review if any further problems occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this issue, the mirror seemed well made and did what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> TIP:  to those people that said that this was like putting on makeup by candle light, and complained that the light was too poor, you aren&#x27;t getting close enough to the mirror.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it, although these are not major issues to me at the moment, are: it is a bit thick in width, the lighting could be brighter and whiter, and it has to be plugged for the light to work.</li>
            <li> I was a little certain on the lighting since it cannot be adjusted</li>
            <li> I like that the button in right on the base of the mirror so that it is easy to turn on and off.  </li>
            <li> It appears to have been due to a short of some sorts inside the mirror.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative is a personal one for me, and something for you to think about if you suffer migraines or even occasional headaches.  </li>
            <li> If you are attempting to use this mirror as your sole light source, yes you will be sorely disappointed; however, if you have even moderate additional lighting in the room, I believe the lighting it provides to be just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and unfortunately the light stopped working after less than a month.  </li>
            <li> Not really portable.</li>
            <li> Love the extra plug on the base.</li>
            <li> but when we received it, the magnification was too extreme.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> , I do like the other features that it has.</li>
            <li> I have touched every place on the base and the light stays the same.</li>
            <li> it brightens a dark room.  </li>
            <li> It is elegant on my dressing table and the on-off switch at the base</li>
            <li> Getting used to the oval mirror took a little getting used to (my other was round).</li>
            <li> not bright enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing (and terrifying) to see your skin that closely.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> The illumination is not to harsh.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and hasn&#x27;t had one complaint about this magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with false description of this item.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with the mirror</li>
            <li> I have wrote the seller, letting them know my disappointment</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I  am very disappointed that the product description states this</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife loves it and hasn&#x27;t had one complaint about this magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Looked all over for reviews of lighted vanity mirrors.  Wanted to get something to help my Grandma, who has vision problems.  This is a good size, doesn&#x27;t magnify so much that Grandma can&#x27;t tell what she is looking at, and shipped with no problems.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror. Works perfectly for my needs and doesnt take up alot of space. Fits in perfectly with my bath decor, and I can see to get that last little touch up. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Its good for the cost! The light is bright and you are able to replace the bulb. It has a nice finish that matches the rest of my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This mirror looks nice and takes up very little space. It provides a good light (not glaring) for makeup and you can clearly see details on your face....perhaps too clearly.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  I don&#x27;t know how I did my makeup before.  I use the magnifying side and my makeup turns out beautifully!</li>
            <li> This mirror is fabulous,  I was a little certain on the lighting since it cannot be adjusted but it&#x27;s perfect.  The mirror itself could be a little larger but all in all it is absolutely perfect.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had this mirror and have used it daily for about a month.  It works exactly as represented.  It is a good height, it pivots to enable you to use it in various positions, and it is attractive on the counter.  Both mirrors are of a good size.  I remember a couple of reviews stating that the light wasn&#x27;t very good.  I respectfully disagree.  If you are attempting to use this mirror as your sole light source, yes you will be sorely disappointed; however, if you have even moderate additional lighting in the room, I believe the lighting it provides to be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is a personal one for me, and something for you to think about if you suffer migraines or even occasional headaches.  Do not try to look at yourself in the magnified side unless you are already close enough to the mirror to be in focus.  Otherwise, you may suffer headaches.  To compensate, I will try and get myself fairly close to the mirror before flipping it over to the magnified side.  Again, just a personal problem, but I thought I&#x27;d share the warning nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality product at a good price.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this daily now, for a year and is quite satisfied with the function and form</li>
            <li> Although the light could be more effective, for the price, the product performs well. And it looks and feels more expenive than it is, which is always nice.</li>
            <li> Looks great.  Light works great.  The magnification is very well.  It has a 110V socket for electricity, which is a plus.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t get so warm and it wasn&#x27;t cheap, but everything else is great, including the magnification and the clear cord.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this mirror. The illumination and the magnification functions work very well.  It is attractive and looks very nice on my new vanity.</li>
            <li> This is great to keep your brows in check.  It works wonders. It&#x27;s amazing (and terrifying) to see your skin that closely.</li>
            <li> With this mirrow i learn to do my makeup as a professional !!! Is for real, you can improve your beauty with this simple accessory, good light, big size, and best of all good magnifier, i can see every pore of my face. it is a MUST HAVE on your vanity set or bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!  tall enough, bright enough.. can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The mirror works exactly as anticipated.  The lighting is great and the mirror is clear and without distortion.  Getting used to the oval mirror took a little getting used to (my other was round).</li>
            <li> I was trying to recreate the mirror and lighting I recently had at the Hyatt and it doesn&#x27;t quite make it, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very attractive and the level of magnification is just right for me.  I like the oval shape.  I actually like to set the mirror on a 6-8 inch additional stand. I can use it more easily while standing without having a mounted mirror.</li>
            <li> I love this.  First one I have owned, and can&#x27;t imagine leaving the house without having one.  It&#x27;s well made and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror very much and am hoping that when i replace the bulb with Reveal chandelier bulbs the illumination will improve.  I agree with the reviewer who noted that the light is somewhat warm colored, leaving you wondering whether your makeup looks OK in natural light. The magnification is not as strong as that of other mirrors I have had, but is strong enough.  It is elegant on my dressing table and the on-off switch at the base is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I received this mirror as a gift and absolutely loved it because I had been wanting one for a while and it does the job! I use it for plucking my eyebrows {love it especially for this purpose, I get every hair!}, and applying makeup. I like that it has magnification and anti-fog glass.The only issue I have with it, although these are not major issues to me at the moment, are: it is a bit thick in width, the lighting could be brighter and whiter, and it has to be plugged for the light to work. Embellishments could make the mirror more attractive as well.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without my mirror!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife as a present and she is thrilled.  This is a well-made and well-finished mirror with good optics.  Contrary to the picture, the illumination color is more white than yellow and the illumination occurs on both sides.  The pricing of this mirror easily beats many mirrors of equal quality and features sold locally where Iive at 3 times the price.  The only potential downside in considering this mirror might be if your bathroom does not have a ground fault interrupter plug-in designed to immediately trip a breaker should there be a short, or if the mirror accidentally fall into a bath or sink with water (which could cause electrocution).  Because it is often used in a bathroom and may be beside a sink or bathtub left plugged in, if it is placed on an unstable surface or it is bumped, it could be a potential hazard.  A ground fault interrupter receptacle is easily purchased at a local hardware store or elsewhere within Amazon and is a good investment for your bathroom - even if you don&#x27;t decide on buying this mirror.</li>
            <li> The product is great but when we received it, the magnification was too extreme. There was nothing wrong with the mirror but it had to be returned. We actually needed a 5X magnification and this product was a 7X. It arrived in good order and worked well but was just not what the person receiving the gift wanted.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Satin Nickel for my wife for Christmas but received the bronze.  She actually likes it better so we are keeping it.  She really likes the lighted mirror and the different magnifications.</li>
            <li> I just received my mirror which is not a Satin Nickel Finish as advertised or as on my invoice, but they shipped me one with a chrome finish! I am not happy with false description of this item. I had searched for a satin nickel finish! I have wrote the seller, letting them know my disappointment and I do not plan I doing any business again with them. Do not be deceived in the description. Came in a box shipped from the Big Store that starts with a &amp;#34;W&amp;#34;. I could have bought this myself &amp; bought the correct one. Very unpleased &amp; upset. This was a gift!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  It&#x27;s a great size for the bathroom and the magnification is super.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is an added plus for our bathroom sink. The description was precisely what we were looking for. It is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> This mirror was a great buy! It&#x27;s really nicely made and I really like that it has the two different magnifications. The lighting is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a lighted mirror for years now, and finally purchased this.  It is exactly what I wanted, has great light, and is the right size.  It&#x27;s also sturdy, so I am not disappointed with something being cheap and light and built poorly.  I did add a suction cup 10x magnification mirror to this as I need that for putting on morning eyeliner.  I also like that i can set this on a table and since it&#x27;s tall it is just right and I don&#x27;t have to slouch to see into a mirror.  TIP:  to those people that said that this was like putting on makeup by candle light, and complained that the light was too poor, you aren&#x27;t getting close enough to the mirror.  This mirror is meant for you to get RIGHT UP to it.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use this mirror everyday. Love the extra plug on the base. Also a really good nightlight / ambient light to turn on in the bathroom when I just need to grab something out of the vanity during the night &amp; don&#x27;t want to turn the strong bright overhead lights on. Provides good strong light, but not too bright, for tweezing my eyebrows &amp; applying my makeup. Love it &amp; would buy again. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years &amp; have not had to replace the bulb yet.</li>
            <li> I can see my reflection in it _and_ it brightens a dark room.  I looked at a few others but they all seemed interchangeable/comparable so mostly decided on price.  It was cheaper at time of purchase than the one I found at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond so I returned that one.  It was a gift.</li>
            <li> The reviews scared me because they said the light is too dim, but after looking around all of these type of mirrors had the same comments. Yes the light is kind of dim but it still works great.</li>
            <li> It tips over very easily.  .  .</li>
            <li> It does what it says. The light is not as bright as I&#x27;d like but still usable. Adjustable brightness would be much better. Not really portable. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror. I use it everyday to apply my makeup. I would definitely recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with makeup application and to see stray hairs etc.  The satin nickel is nice looking and I like that it is double sided for different uses. I like that the button in right on the base of the mirror so that it is easy to turn on and off.  The illumination is not to harsh. Now that I am in my 50&#x27;s and my eyesight isn&#x27;t like it use to be, this is a must have item.</li>
            <li> not bright enough but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> This was the second Vanity mirror I had bought for my wife, the first one was almost $100 and was no way near as good as this one, great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect size of mirror, and magnification is great especially with the lighting. The brushed nickel matches perfectly with the other fixtures. Great price compared to other models in the stores that were at least $100.</li>
            <li> Needed a mirror and lamp for my new vanity, and this seemed like the perfect idea. I would like for it to let off a little more light, but the size, style, and magnification are all great for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and unfortunately the light stopped working after less than a month.  It appears to have been due to a short of some sorts inside the mirror.  When it stopped working it also tripped the Ground Fault Interrupter (GFI) breaker on the bathroom outlet that it was plugged into.  Thankfully Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policies and service allowed me to return it with no issue.  We have a new mirror in route now and I will update this review if any further problems occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this issue, the mirror seemed well made and did what it&#x27;s supposed to.  My mom also said it had much better magnification and brightness than other mirrors she&#x27;d seen or used.  With any magnifying mirror the lighting becomes critical because as the reflection is magnified you need that brightness to actually see the details.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a more scientific way to explain that but hopefully it make sense.  Anyway, if this hadn&#x27;t broken I&#x27;d probably be writing a much more complimentary review.  Hopefully this was just an anomaly and the next one works great.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! Awesome product, great size, great service!  Excellent quality.  I absolutely would recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble deciding between this and one without light - given the feedback about how dim the light is. In the end, I went with this one and am happy I did.  I have mine on a dressing table that is next to a north facing window, and I have a lamp that I use for bright light. I would only use this on its own if I were gonig somewhere dark like a nightclub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is dim compared to &amp;#34;makeup mirrors&amp;#34; I have used in the past, but what it does that is great is that it illuminates your face evenly, with no shadows, which is very helpful for makeup application. The light and magnification make this an ideal tool for plucking even the finest, smallest eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad to have this mirror and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is awesome, may need a little extra light tho!</li>
            <li> Great mirror for the price  BUT  the dial for each setting is on backwards.  The most used setting is DAYLIGHT and that is the last setting on the dial.  This means that every day I am clicking thru 4 settings twice.  This is clearly going to break the dial setting.  Made in China of course.  If the first setting on the dial was DAYLIGHT the mirror was be a 5 STAR rating.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly as shown. I wear glasses to see up close so I use the magnified side. It helps me put my makeup on evenly. The liight works well. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I like this lighted mirror a lot. The light isn&#x27;t super bright, but it&#x27;s enough. I like that it is only 7x larger on the magnified side of the mirror. No need to see pores closer than that! Anyway it&#x27;s great for make up, eyebrow plucking, and anything else you need to do up close.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and the person loved it. It works wonderfully. I would definitely repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> I can see every pore on my face. This is sometimes a blessing and sometimes a wake up call. That said it&#x27;s great for doing my make up in the low lighting of my college dorm and it makes my morning routine much more successful.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife.  Two sided mirror (regular and magnified) works great.  Good illuminations and bulb can easily be replaced with any standard candelabra type.</li>
            <li> The size is really good. Looks nice on the bathroom counter, in the corner behind the faucet. The clarity is outstanding. In the magnified side, I can see every pore and nothing is distorted at all. The light isn&#x27;t too bright or too dull.</li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup light because I just finished a bathroom renovation.  The reason I bought this mirror was because my fixtures are brushed satin nickel and it would match them. In the product description it stated that it has touch activated power so you can adjust the light setting without putting your makeup down. Well, it doesn&#x27;t. I have touched every place on the base and the light stays the same. Needless to say, I  am very disappointed that the product description states this and that is what sold me on purchasing this. This makeup mirror sits on my vanity under a wall light that has 4 bright lights that point down onto the vanity and still this makeup mirror is not bright enough.  Other than that, I do like the other features that it has.</li>
            <li> I would recommended this double side mirror. I love the satin nickel color. It is easy to use, and have a nice quality. You can be sure that it would last.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months and still love it.  The magnifying side is great.  The light isn&#x27;t super bright, but when using it for makeup, I use other light sources in addition anyway.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife for Christmas.  She loved it till the on/off switch stopped working after only about 4-5 uses.  Returned to Amazon and received replacement. New mirror works great and the wife is happy.</li>
            <li> really magnifies well and helps me pluck those stray hairs that i miss with just the bathroom mirror. it&#x27;s also great for applying eye makeup!</li>
