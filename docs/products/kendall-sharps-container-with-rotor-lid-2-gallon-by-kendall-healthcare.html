            <li>It&#x27;s a sharps container, what more can I say.  </li>
            <li>This is cheap and effective way to get rid of sharps.  </li>
            <li>came real quick ...</li>
            <li>Love the container, thank you</li>
            <li>Bought this product for my Lovenox daily injections and it is perfect!</li>
            <li>Keeps needles out of garbage cans and kids safe.</li>
            <li>and I just leave it on top of the counter for easy disposal.</li>
            <li>Love it!  very large, in expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have to order 10 more to fit what i need to dispose of</li>
            <li>Good price, does what it is supposed to and doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
            <li>Fits my auto injector pens, and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to get full anytime soon!</li>
            <li>Do you stuff them into ice cream buckets where children could easily mistake the syringes for butter brickle?</li>
            <li>easy to close when full.no chance of accidental closing.</li>
            <li>It holds a lot and is easy to store.  </li>

            <li>Great arrived in one piece and is the right size, Thanks Kendall Healthcare</li>
            <li>perfect for sharp objects!</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>i use about 6-7 syringes a day and this will easily hold 2 months worth, maybe even more.</li>
            <li>The Kendall Sharps Container is hugely convenient.</li>
            <li>This container works perfectly to fit my needs.  </li>
            <li>Great deal, actually bought this to use at a party for everyone to put their used jello shot syringes in.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t fit my husband&#x27;s Humira shot.  </li>
            <li>They are a  secure way to dispose of your needles and syringes used on a farm to vaccinate the animals.</li>
            <li>Their charges are much more reasonable!</li>
            <li>I originally got some 2 quart sized ones</li>
            <li>Will easily hold a years worth of syringes and lancets.  </li>
            <li>I use insulin needles 3x per day, plus a couple of daily doses of Lovenox, which comes with a fairly bulky needle.</li>
            <li>Have not used lid ongoing but will use once container full (no kids in home).</li>
            <li>The kendall sharps container is good , but they need to make it bigger.</li>
            <li>This sharps container was just what I needed and there is plenty of room to discard the used syringes and it will take some time before the sharps container is full.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as pictured and easy to use.</li>
            <li>contacted the seller quickly remedied any and all delivery problems.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and arrived without damage or defect.</li>
            <li>Big and perfect for insulin pen needles, lancets, and regular needles alike.</li>
            <li>Very good product, very sturdy, lid locks on tightly.</li>
            <li>A nice STURDY container, that looks like it will last the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>It is not 2 gallons worth.</li>
            <li>Nice, big, sturdy sharps container.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the moeny, I have to take 2 injections, so I have alot of needles to dispose of.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>Just right for easy,safe use.</li>
            <li>Very large capacity.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended specially for safety reasons and where kids are around or even pets.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as pictured and exactly what was needed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid the more for a smaller container than I did for this.  </li>
            <li>Really holds a lot and economical.</li>
            <li>This container was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>We used to pay more for similar items to dental supply companies.</li>
            <li>IT is exactly like it looked like in the picture.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described on Amazons website.</li>
            <li>its exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>but it can always store it in a higher area out of reach of the children / pets.</li>
            <li>Personal sharps disposal had not been on my radar so this is a relief to own once I developed an awareness of the need for this equipment.  </li>
            <li>No mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon make obtaining a larger size easy.</li>
            <li>Large opening for deposits.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact yet holds a large number of Auto-inject Pens.</li>
            <li>It is very large and although my plans were to use this until a liquid laundry soap container was available (permissible in Ohio), it will take a long time to fill this</li>
            <li>It will be fine for users who just have lancets and injections, but for larger items like the Mio, its going to be a pain to use.</li>
            <li>2 gallons sounds huge, but actually fits on the counter ledge between the kitchen and living room.</li>
            <li>This one lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>and I think for the reasonable cost I&#x27;ll just buy another.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t fill up so fast.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really to say about it.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even knocked it over a couple of times but the whole lid stayed on and the rotor for the opening stayed shut.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for months and just got the very bottom covered.</li>
            <li>Really like the rotor lid too.</li>
            <li>I really like the sharps container.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, durable.</li>
            <li>It also came earlier than originally stated.</li>
            <li>I have somewhere safe for the sharp items to go when I am done with them.</li>
            <li>huge, exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>They arrived early and were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>They immediately replaced it with a new one!</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t find a decent size one.</li>
            <li>I leave the top open until it&#x27;s time to turn the container in to our local cancer clinic for disposal, and then it seals nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also a nice big size with an opening large enough for bigger needles and not just insulin needles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend- Repeat customer.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>my brother and i r both diabetics,and this container is so huge we can both put our needles and lancets in it with plenty of room to spare much cheaper using this than going to store to have to purchase one every other month or so.</li>
            <li>but TWO whole gallons of hazardous medical waste in your home or office.</li>
            <li>Very large size that will last me throughout my pregnancy!</li>
            <li>I like that I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one as often.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t  really sure how big a two gallon container was but this is plenty big enough to last me for awhile and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this exact container numerous times.</li>
            <li>these are very good for large groups of people working,i use these at Sturgis for the crew, it costs less to dispose of one big one rather than a bunch of small ones for such an event</li>
            <li>The other reviewer was correct in saying there is no handle, but I won&#x27;t be moving it until full.</li>
            <li>large enough for insulin needles and is not so bulky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly large so it&#x27;ll be a while before I actually fill it and have to tape it up and dispose of it</li>
            <li>(So does trying to fling the needles to the far corners of the container).</li>
            <li>Professional Grade.</li>
            <li>meets the standard required at much lower price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only issue I really had was the shipping since the tape came off and the box arrived opened.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very convenient way to despose of your syringes properly.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>The little models just fill up too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Some sharps containers only have an opening large enough for a syringe or pen needle.  </li>
            <li>Locally, only small ones are available.  </li>
            <li>Just what I expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Walgreens or other drug stores.</li>
            <li>little smaller than I expected, easy to snap on lid.</li>
            <li>A little larger than I needed, but the price was right.</li>

            <li> A nice STURDY container, that looks like it will last the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> It is not 2 gallons worth.</li>
            <li> Nice, big, sturdy sharps container.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the moeny, I have to take 2 injections, so I have alot of needles to dispose of.</li>
            <li> Just the right size.</li>
            <li> Just right for easy,safe use.</li>
            <li> Very large capacity.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended specially for safety reasons and where kids are around or even pets.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as pictured and exactly what was needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid the more for a smaller container than I did for this.  </li>
            <li> Really holds a lot and economical.</li>
            <li> This container was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> We used to pay more for similar items to dental supply companies.</li>
            <li> IT is exactly like it looked like in the picture.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described on Amazons website.</li>
            <li> its exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> but it can always store it in a higher area out of reach of the children / pets.</li>
            <li> Personal sharps disposal had not been on my radar so this is a relief to own once I developed an awareness of the need for this equipment.  </li>
            <li> No mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon make obtaining a larger size easy.</li>
            <li> Large opening for deposits.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact yet holds a large number of Auto-inject Pens.</li>
            <li> It is very large and although my plans were to use this until a liquid laundry soap container was available (permissible in Ohio), it will take a long time to fill this</li>
            <li> It will be fine for users who just have lancets and injections, but for larger items like the Mio, its going to be a pain to use.</li>
            <li> 2 gallons sounds huge, but actually fits on the counter ledge between the kitchen and living room.</li>
            <li> This one lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> and I think for the reasonable cost I&#x27;ll just buy another.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t fill up so fast.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really to say about it.</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even knocked it over a couple of times but the whole lid stayed on and the rotor for the opening stayed shut.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months and just got the very bottom covered.</li>
            <li> Really like the rotor lid too.</li>
            <li> I really like the sharps container.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy, durable.</li>
            <li> It also came earlier than originally stated.</li>
            <li> I have somewhere safe for the sharp items to go when I am done with them.</li>
            <li> huge, exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> They arrived early and were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> They immediately replaced it with a new one!</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t find a decent size one.</li>
            <li> I leave the top open until it&#x27;s time to turn the container in to our local cancer clinic for disposal, and then it seals nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also a nice big size with an opening large enough for bigger needles and not just insulin needles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend- Repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> my brother and i r both diabetics,and this container is so huge we can both put our needles and lancets in it with plenty of room to spare much cheaper using this than going to store to have to purchase one every other month or so.</li>
            <li> but TWO whole gallons of hazardous medical waste in your home or office.</li>
            <li> Very large size that will last me throughout my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I like that I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one as often.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t  really sure how big a two gallon container was but this is plenty big enough to last me for awhile and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this exact container numerous times.</li>
            <li> these are very good for large groups of people working,i use these at Sturgis for the crew, it costs less to dispose of one big one rather than a bunch of small ones for such an event</li>
            <li> The other reviewer was correct in saying there is no handle, but I won&#x27;t be moving it until full.</li>
            <li> large enough for insulin needles and is not so bulky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly large so it&#x27;ll be a while before I actually fill it and have to tape it up and dispose of it</li>
            <li> (So does trying to fling the needles to the far corners of the container).</li>
            <li> Professional Grade.</li>
            <li> meets the standard required at much lower price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only issue I really had was the shipping since the tape came off and the box arrived opened.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very convenient way to despose of your syringes properly.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> The little models just fill up too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Some sharps containers only have an opening large enough for a syringe or pen needle.  </li>
            <li> Locally, only small ones are available.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Walgreens or other drug stores.</li>
            <li> little smaller than I expected, easy to snap on lid.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I needed, but the price was right.</li>
            <li> If you buy a smaller one that removes the pen needles without the sleeve and then transfer them to the 2 Gallon model, it will last a long time before disposing.</li>
            <li> Larger then I thought it would be, will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> It will last a LONG LONG time.</li>
            <li> If your State requires those units, take a trip to a State that allows your containers to be deposited with your local police or recycle center.  </li>
            <li> The discarded injection pen is probably 8 inches long of so.</li>
            <li> Would like to see an opening that spans the width of the long dimension; although shaking it cures the issue.</li>
            <li> 2 gallons goes a long way.</li>
            <li> sturdy, secure container, appears to hold approximately 150-160 enoxaparin sodium 40mg syringes (single-use, slightly bulky syringes equipped with plastic shield that snaps out over needle after use).</li>
            <li> theres not really much of a safety mechanism on it which is a little dissapointing as i have a 9 year old in the house.</li>
            <li> These sharp containers are just what the Doctor ordered, except the public can now purchase them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was a little larger than I pictured; I am not willing to take this container to recycle, so I use it to store over the months, then offload into a smaller container to carry to our recycling center.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big - the size of a little trash can.  </li>
            <li> It can be closed to prevent anyone from getting into it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used to paying 8X as much for those containers with &amp;#34;free return shipping&amp;#34; and what a farce that plan is.  </li>
            <li> not much to say about it.</li>
            <li> Is your significant other sick of constantly getting tested for hepatitis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too big not to small.</li>
            <li> (local waste management company charges $50 bucks for a unit that&#x27;s less than half this size).</li>
            <li> one thing that is a shortcoming (although not enough to ding it) is that the round opening leads to a slightly uneven distribution inside the container.</li>
            <li> I ordered large sharps containers (2 gallon) because I&#x27;m tired of bringing small containers into the pharmacy so often.</li>
            <li> It took me a few minutes to get it un jammed.</li>
            <li> Kendall Sharps Container with Rotor Lid - 2 Gallon model is a testament to biohazard waste disposal.</li>
            <li> And it will not fit the Mini med Mios unless you take the saftey cover off.</li>
            <li> I will not need another for a few years.</li>
            <li> Its not huge, I don&#x27;t know why people embelish.</li>
            <li> The door is sometimes difficult to open and close, though with a little persistence it has always yielded.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on a Tuesday late in the evening.</li>
            <li> I got tired of throwing syringe disposal containers out every few weeks.</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s a big ugly box.</li>
            <li> Are you tired of cramming used insulin syringes in the drawer of your nightstand?</li>
            <li> so this thing is useless.  </li>
            <li> so I could despose my used syringes since it is illegal to throw them in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Bad design as well.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I self-inject a blood thinner medication daily.  This container works perfectly to fit my needs.  It can be closed to prevent anyone from getting into it.</li>
            <li> Are you tired of cramming used insulin syringes in the drawer of your nightstand? Do you stuff them into ice cream buckets where children could easily mistake the syringes for butter brickle? Is your significant other sick of constantly getting tested for hepatitis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This. Is. The. Bucket. For. You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kendall Sharps Container with Rotor Lid - 2 Gallon model is a testament to biohazard waste disposal. It safely stores not just one gallon... but TWO whole gallons of hazardous medical waste in your home or office. I ordered multiple bins just so I can stuff all my syringes into them and build a morbid biohazard pyramid.</li>
            <li> Serves my purpose perfectly</li>
            <li> excellent container. large enough for insulin needles and is not so bulky. highly recommended specially for safety reasons and where kids are around or even pets.</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s a big ugly box. It does the job though and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great deal, actually bought this to use at a party for everyone to put their used jello shot syringes in. It went along with the them of the party... my niece&#x27;s graduation party, she&#x27;s a doctor now.</li>
            <li> good size container for my husband</li>
            <li> Big enough to handle 8 months of once a day shots for me.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> smaller than the picture appears. I would have to order 10 more to fit what i need to dispose of</li>
            <li> I would have rather had one with a handle like in the photo, for ease of use, the one I got is just a tall square looking trash can, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sharps container, what more can I say.  A little larger than I needed, but the price was right.</li>
            <li> De rigeur item if you use medical &amp;#34;sharps.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Fits my auto injector pens, and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to get full anytime soon!</li>
            <li> This container will take quite a while to fill, so it&#x27;s perfect for our business needs.  Will order again if needed!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I was very impressed when the truck showed up at my house for delivery within 24hrs.The product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product...very convenient...</li>
            <li> The little models just fill up too quickly.  This one lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Does what it says...</li>
            <li> These sharp containers are just what the Doctor ordered, except the public can now purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;The picture shown can be deceptive, be assured that these containers are 2 Gallon containers and will save a lot of time that would have been used exchanging smaller ones.&lt;br /&gt;When contacted the seller quickly remedied any and all delivery problems.</li>
            <li> Personal sharps disposal had not been on my radar so this is a relief to own once I developed an awareness of the need for this equipment.  It is very large and although my plans were to use this until a liquid laundry soap container was available (permissible in Ohio), it will take a long time to fill this and I think for the reasonable cost I&#x27;ll just buy another.  The other reviewer was correct in saying there is no handle, but I won&#x27;t be moving it until full.</li>
            <li> Good price, does what it is supposed to and doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need it. Sent it back</li>
            <li> Great product.  For the cost, provides ample capacity.  Will easily hold a years worth of syringes and lancets.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> There is no disposal site here for sharps items so this thing is useless.  Wish I had known that before I tried to find somewhere to drop it off.  Bad design as well.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it does the job.</li>
            <li> I ordered large sharps containers (2 gallon) because I&#x27;m tired of bringing small containers into the pharmacy so often. They arrived early and were exactly what I ordered. Great seller.</li>
            <li> Love it!  very large, in expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find this size in the pharmacy great for diabetics who need to dispose of syringes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t  really sure how big a two gallon container was but this is plenty big enough to last me for awhile and the price was right.  It works great for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  I would definitely buy from here , again, although I may want an even bigger container.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well made. It is also a nice big size with an opening large enough for bigger needles and not just insulin needles.</li>
            <li> As a diabetic of 42 years who wears a pump.  This sharps container works perfectly for disposing of my infusion sets.  Some sharps containers only have an opening large enough for a syringe or pen needle.  This works well for me!</li>
            <li> This should last me a year or two.  Plenty of room</li>
            <li> This is a great container.  I&#x27;m only taking Lovinox injections for 10 months. I have 3 months to go in my pregnancy this is my second container.  It seems to hold alot.</li>
            <li> Ordered this exact container numerous times. Just the right size.</li>
            <li> A nice STURDY container, that looks like it will last the rest of my life.  Incredible price too.  I&#x27;ve been used to paying 8X as much for those containers with &amp;#34;free return shipping&amp;#34; and what a farce that plan is.  If your State requires those units, take a trip to a State that allows your containers to be deposited with your local police or recycle center.  Their charges are much more reasonable!</li>
            <li> I had order two containers for my diabetic dog and one came shattered.  They immediately replaced it with a new one!</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as pictured and exactly what was needed.  I will definitely purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Gift for mother.&lt;br /&gt;as described and on time delivery</li>
            <li> This is a great-big container, and it will take me some time to fill it up despite my 2 allergy shots per week. Shipped quickly and arrived without damage or defect. I feel this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big - the size of a little trash can.  That&#x27;s what I wanted - so I can collect sharps for quite a while before I have to take them somewhere for disposal.  Once the lid is snapped on, it&#x27;s staying on.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She couldn&#x27;t find a decent size one. Went to amazon And found  this one at a great price</li>
            <li> My daughter has diabetes and this size can in handy.</li>
            <li> It is not 2 gallons worth. And it will not fit the Mini med Mios unless you take the saftey cover off. It will be fine for users who just have lancets and injections, but for larger items like the Mio, its going to be a pain to use. Its not huge, I don&#x27;t know why people embelish. Its barely bigger than a gallon milk jug.</li>
            <li> I like this container. It&#x27;s big holds alot so it doesn&#x27;t fill up so fast.  Large opening for deposits.  I would recommend this container.  I&#x27;ve paid the more for a smaller container than I did for this.  I ordered it and had it the next day!</li>
            <li> well made and as described, price great. (local waste management company charges $50 bucks for a unit that&#x27;s less than half this size).</li>
            <li> Great price for the size of container. Really holds a lot and economical. Great find and will order more when ones I have full.</li>
            <li> my brother and i r both diabetics,and this container is so huge we can both put our needles and lancets in it with plenty of room to spare much cheaper using this than going to store to have to purchase one every other month or so.</li>
            <li> Good deal. The sliding lid got caught once though. It took me a few minutes to get it un jammed.</li>
            <li> I originally got some 2 quart sized ones but they don&#x27;t fit my husband&#x27;s Humira shot.  This one is the perfect size for that.  The discarded injection pen is probably 8 inches long of so.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it. Rotor lid was already locked so it couldn&#x27;t be opened. Possibly a manufacture error.</li>
            <li> I use insulin needles 3x per day, plus a couple of daily doses of Lovenox, which comes with a fairly bulky needle. This container is sufficient for just over 2 months of usage at this rate. I leave the top open until it&#x27;s time to turn the container in to our local cancer clinic for disposal, and then it seals nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that is a shortcoming (although not enough to ding it) is that the round opening leads to a slightly uneven distribution inside the container. Would like to see an opening that spans the width of the long dimension; although shaking it cures the issue. (So does trying to fling the needles to the far corners of the container).</li>
            <li> This item is used in our evidence department.  This something that is needed, and being that the cost was perfect!</li>
            <li> This is cheap and effective way to get rid of sharps.  I will not need another for a few years.</li>
            <li> This is inexpensive and works well.  Nothing really to say about it. I haven&#x27;t tried dropping it off yet--if there are any issues, I&#x27;ll update the review.</li>
            <li> Wish it were semi&#x3D;transparent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend- Repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Very large capacity.  If you buy a smaller one that removes the pen needles without the sleeve and then transfer them to the 2 Gallon model, it will last a long time before disposing.</li>
            <li> this sharps container is perfect.  I needed it for work and it was the perfect size.  I will order it again</li>
            <li> nice containers. i use about 6-7 syringes a day and this will easily hold 2 months worth, maybe even more.</li>
            <li> This container was exactly what I wanted. It came promptly and was perfect! When I need another one, I know just where to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s red and holds sharps.</li>
            <li> Professional Grade. Holds a lot of needles.</li>
            <li> These Sharps containers were a good value. They are a  secure way to dispose of your needles and syringes used on a farm to vaccinate the animals.</li>
            <li> sturdy, secure container, appears to hold approximately 150-160 enoxaparin sodium 40mg syringes (single-use, slightly bulky syringes equipped with plastic shield that snaps out over needle after use).</li>
            <li> Nice, big, sturdy sharps container. Just what I was looking for to dispose of my syringes used for daily injections.</li>
            <li> Larger then I thought it would be, will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> Arrived before stated time. Was exactly as pictured and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use 5 shots a day, so this is the perfect size for me. Price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Very good product. meets the standard required at much lower price. We used to pay more for similar items to dental supply companies. Very satisfied. will order again.</li>
            <li> came real quick ... was bigger than i thought.. but thats a good thing</li>
            <li> Big and perfect for insulin pen needles, lancets, and regular needles alike. It will last a LONG LONG time. Great deal and would buy this again. A+++</li>
            <li> This is perfect for safely disposing of all my lancets and pen needles.  I&#x27;ve even knocked it over a couple of times but the whole lid stayed on and the rotor for the opening stayed shut.  No mess to clean up.  It&#x27;s fairly large so it&#x27;ll be a while before I actually fill it and have to tape it up and dispose of it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I really had was the shipping since the tape came off and the box arrived opened.  It wasn&#x27;t damaged or anything but don&#x27;t like the idea that my neighbors or anyone else can look inside a delivery.</li>
            <li> Received product assembled and locked..</li>
            <li> I take insulin, so I need a disposal method.  Kendall make an inexpensive way for me to do it.  Locally, only small ones are available.  Ordering from Amazon make obtaining a larger size easy.</li>
            <li> The Kendall Sharps Container is hugely convenient. I plan on reordering again and again. 2 gallons goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just started using an Avonex Pen and this is the perfect size for the pens.  Not too big not to small.</li>
            <li> I got tired of throwing syringe disposal containers out every few weeks. I have a diabetic cat who gets a shot twice a day. This is about twice the size of the containers I found locally and I just leave it on top of the counter for easy disposal. I&#x27;m very pleased for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice size container and sturdy. Have not used lid ongoing but will use once container full (no kids in home).</li>
            <li> I ordered it on a Tuesday late in the evening. It was promised 7 days later but it arrived on Thursday afternoon. only 2 days later. IT is exactly like it looked like in the picture. When this fills up I will order another one from them.</li>
            <li> Love the container, thank you</li>
            <li> The kendall sharps container is good , but they need to make it bigger.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described on Amazons website. It also came earlier than originally stated. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product was a little larger than I pictured; I am not willing to take this container to recycle, so I use it to store over the months, then offload into a smaller container to carry to our recycling center.  I like this product.  It is sturdy and practical; if ordering again, I would probably order a smaller container.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my Lovenox daily injections and it is perfect! Very large size that will last me throughout my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> this is so nice to have since we go thru lots of needles</li>
            <li> Is safer and keeps all needles in the container with the safety rotor lid!</li>
            <li> Great arrived in one piece and is the right size, Thanks Kendall Healthcare</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer of this product. Good value and VERY QUICK SHIPPING. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great and is easy to use. I feel good knowing I have somewhere safe for the sharp items to go when I am done with them.</li>
            <li> little smaller than I expected, easy to snap on lid. easy to close when full.no chance of accidental closing. will hold a lot of needles and syringes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what it says it is. Good price for the unit. No problems. If you need one, this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This container is great. I&#x27;m still trying to fill it up. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and just got the very bottom covered. Really like the rotor lid too.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find a sharps container in this size. For those of us who take Lovenox daily, those smaller containers just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Very good product, very sturdy, lid locks on tightly. My only mistake was I should have ordered a larger size for all the used needles I have.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Sharps container to replace smaller one. Great Value for the price. Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> these are very good for large groups of people working,i use these at Sturgis for the crew, it costs less to dispose of one big one rather than a bunch of small ones for such an event</li>
            <li> I really like the sharps container.  It is durable.  It holds a lot and is easy to store.  I have bought these several times.</li>
            <li> with an iv and ongoing health needs involving needles, this was the best value I have found in some time</li>
            <li> Meets my husband&#x27;s needs for sharps disposals at home. Keeps needles out of garbage cans and kids safe. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The medical team at mom&#x27;s American House likes it.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to buy a new one as often.  2 gallons sounds huge, but actually fits on the counter ledge between the kitchen and living room.</li>
            <li> We needed this to dispose of sharps we find on walks.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> huge, exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Definately worth the moeny, I have to take 2 injections, so I have alot of needles to dispose of.</li>
            <li> I have just recently started giving myself allergy shot injections 3 times a week. I needed to get a sharps container so I could despose my used syringes since it is illegal to throw them in the trash.  This sharps container was just what I needed and there is plenty of room to discard the used syringes and it will take some time before the sharps container is full. It&#x27;s a very convenient way to despose of your syringes properly.</li>
            <li> Great container. Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of storage space. Very sturdy, durable. Easy to snap on lid with opening for needles.</li>
            <li> Happy to have a really large container so I don&#x27;t have to think of buying another for a looong time.  Those of us who inject regularly are grateful!</li>
            <li> perfect for sharp objects!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time as described.</li>
            <li> Just what every needle using diabetic needs!  Much cheaper than Walgreens or other drug stores.</li>
            <li> This container is graeat, very large, easy to use, holds gobs of needles and lancets for a great price; excellent deal</li>
            <li> Arrived early in excellent condition. Just right for easy,safe use.</li>
            <li> This was perfect to get rid of my injectables! MS sucks!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thankfull I don&#x27;t have diabites . Thered be needles everywhere; then!</li>
            <li> the Kendall Sharps container goes beyond my expectations. It&#x27;s compact yet holds a large number of Auto-inject Pens. and the service from Amazon was great!</li>
            <li> This is rugged, functional, and the capacity is good.  The door is sometimes difficult to open and close, though with a little persistence it has always yielded.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> very great container, very great price. not much to say about it. its exactly as advertised. came in an undamaged box.&lt;br /&gt;5/5 bought it to dispose of practice tattoo needles. theres not really much of a safety mechanism on it which is a little dissapointing as i have a 9 year old in the house. but it can always store it in a higher area out of reach of the children / pets.</li>
