            <li> Not worth buying. Chain and arrow part is a lot bigger and longer than picture. Does not look cute like in picture looks tacky and cheaply made</li>
            <li> It broke the second I tried putting it on. The clasp broke day I got it</li>
            <li> It came broken but i fixed it, it had all the pieces. Was hard to figure out how it actually went back together though but i&#x27;m just nifty like that so it was easy to fix. Only thing is it started to lose it&#x27;s shiney-ness. Thought i would get more wears out of it. Still like it though..</li>
            <li> dulled out pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Such a pretty necklace</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the purchase price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price!</li>
            <li> Looks THe Same As When I Got It And In Fact Came Before Time</li>
            <li> Great for the price, a little cheap but not terrible and looks beautiful with any outfit.</li>
            <li> Turned rust color in one day</li>
            <li> This is SO CUTE on!  It hasn&#x27;t tarnished yet and I wear it almost every day (had it for about a month now.</li>
            <li> Worst thing i purchased</li>
            <li> Very good necklace. I was a little scared to buy it, but it turned out great and came just on time. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Just recived the necklace in the mail today. The Cain looks nothing like the picture also the rectangle and triangle on the necklace have finger prints on them. I tried to clean it so it would come off that didnt work. I&#x27;m not happy with it at all. I will not be wearing it at allüòê</li>
            <li> very pretty and for the price the qulaity didnt suprise me, but it still really is just a cheap jewelery peice</li>
