            <li>and I could see fine lines start to develop, because my face was too dry.</li>

            <li>We have used this product several years now, and as a man, it&#x27;s hard to find a good product that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin without it being very floral smelling (marketed towards a particular group).    </li>
            <li>I have a severe issue of thin skin and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Before using this cleansing gel, my skin was oily/combination, supple, and soft.</li>

            <li>cuz I just can&#x27;t stand to put the stuff near my nose.</li>
            <li>I. He loves it and it makes his gruffly face feel soft.  </li>
            <li>It left our face feeling so clean and pure, but didn&#x27;t feel harsh at all.  </li>
            <li>It is super concentrated so you need very little.  </li>
            <li>difficult to find where we live and the quick shipment was terrific-loved the twin pack!</li>
            <li>The Avalon Organics facial products don&#x27;t dry my already dry skin and make my dry skin less dry plus very smooth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We have used this product several years now, and as a man, it&#x27;s hard to find a good product that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin without it being very floral smelling (marketed towards a particular group).    This product contains very low toxins, though it does contain DLS (see [...] for an explanation).    The scent is pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of natural moisture, and if the special CoQ10 has helped prevent aging, then great! I am often told I look younger than my 40 years (usually people guess 10 years younger), though that could be the fact that I avoid the sun quite a bit and use SPF 15 daily.</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser.  I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years but this is my new favorite.  It&#x27;s gentle and my skin does look much more refined after using this for awhile.  I got the 2 pack to keep one in the shower and 1 at the tub.  It is super concentrated so you need very little.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the Avalon Organics products have been significantly better than anything else I&#x27;ve used (and some of the other brands were really expensive). This company has been a great find for me.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and I can only ever find the CoQ10 cleanser in cream (which does not clean my face and just leaves it oily) in local stores or on other websites.  This smells great (FYI if you have not used all natural products and are used to fake fragrances and chemicals the scent might be too much for you).  It cleans all my makeup off and does not leave a film.  A little bit goes a long way - so use half a pump.  Highly recommended if you are concerned about early signs of aging!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I have this annoying problem with the bottle.  Does anyone else have the problem with the CoQ10 bottle oozing out the gel from the neck and caking all over the shoulder of the bottle?  It is wasting all my gel and making a mess on the bathroom sink.  This is the third or fourth bottle I&#x27;ve been through that is oozing out from the bottom of the neck of the bottle. This must be a cheap plastic bottle they are using because I&#x27;ve never experienced that before.  This will probably be the last bottle I&#x27;m purchasing from them.  I&#x27;m going to call the customer service to report this problem.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for ten years.  I love it</li>
            <li> I love the C0Q10! Nica</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about face washes.  Here&#x27;s my review of every face wash except this one:  too greasy, too drying, too oily, not foamy enough, too foamy, made from gross cancer causing chemicals, too fragrant, too natural smelling, too flipping expensive, a bottle lasts 2 weeks, seriously who washes their face without water??, doesn&#x27;t work with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my review of this product:  perfect and cheap.  Please don&#x27;t stop making it or I may stop washing my face entirely just to not have to deal with the hassle of every other face wash ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use with yhe co10q skin body lotion. I have a severe issue of thin skin and this product is amazing. I use it daily and already see a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s easy to use and no fuss along with other items from their skin care line. Good value.</li>
            <li> This is actually a staple product of mine which I depend upon as an important step in my facial-care routing. I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to most products yet this face gel keeps my very fair complexion feeling and looking wonderful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product(because it&#x27;s ingredients are low in toxins), but this product ruined my skin! Before using this cleansing gel, my skin was oily/combination, supple, and soft. After using this product my face was stripped and dry. I tried applying heavy moisturizers and oils afterwards, but it didn&#x27;t go back to it&#x27;s former feel. At first I didn&#x27;t really mind it that much, because I thought at least it was better than being oily. However, I&#x27;m in my 20s and I could see fine lines start to develop, because my face was too dry. Now I&#x27;m trying to get rid of the crows feet that have appeared around my eyes. I tried to give this product a chance, but my face kept getting worse. I hate to leave such a negative review, I still think that Avalon is a great company with great products, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser it&#x27;s gentle but very effective and has impressive ingrediants.  My husband gave to me as a stocking stuffer, but paid a lot more for it at whole foods.  This is not an easy product to find and Amazon certainly has the best price.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells exactly like my dog&#x27;s flea and tick shampoos. I can&#x27;t stand to use it. The texture of it is also kind of... sticky? It&#x27;s weird for a facial gel. I&#x27;ve had two almost completely full bottles for 3 years now, cuz I just can&#x27;t stand to put the stuff near my nose.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and I. He loves it and it makes his gruffly face feel soft.  Smells calming and does not cause my face to break out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many non-soap face washes and have used this product line for several years; however, the subscribe and save is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found. The Avalon Organics facial products don&#x27;t dry my already dry skin and make my dry skin less dry plus very smooth. It is wonderful. I do wear make-up and the cleansing gel takes it right off including non-waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Caution: it takes less than one squirt which is great because the product does the job but lasts longer than you might think. I rub the gel in my hands before applying it to my face. I also enjoy the odor. I would say it was citrus but doesn&#x27;t last like perfumes.</li>
            <li> First time I bought this, but can&#x27;t fairly rate it because I have shingles on my face and eye.  It has been very gently on my skin.</li>
            <li> excellent item. difficult to find where we live and the quick shipment was terrific-loved the twin pack!</li>
            <li> Same as toner.  have been using for years.  I&#x27;m 63, people say I look 15-20 years younger.</li>
            <li> if you love organic and pure products, this is the way to go.  Healthy, safe, non-toxic, good inside and out.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Works so well!</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser.  Their lotion is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> An excellent product for cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> i have been using this and only this for the past few year in conjuntion with the rest of their line of products (cq10 creams) and i love it. i also buy it from vitacost.</li>
            <li> It mades me feel fresh and very clean..</li>
            <li> I was visiting my mom in NYC.  I forgot to bring my toiletry bag so I borrowed her cleansers &amp; moisturizers.  She bought this Facial Cleansing Gel from Trader Joe&#x27;s, she said.  Both my husband and I used it and absolutely LOVED it.  It left our face feeling so clean and pure, but didn&#x27;t feel harsh at all.  That was May 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWO MONTHS later, I buy this cleanser here on Amazon...and had a completely different experience:&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling amazing like it did in May.  Instead, it was just, &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;  It was just really disappointing.--Didn&#x27;t impress at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now the end of November and I&#x27;m STILL trying to finish the bottle because I just don&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; I felt when I used it the first time.</li>
