            <li>Best cream for diabetic feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>alpha hydroxy that is supposed to add a bit of refresh to the skin layers appears to have some impact, but my feet may not be the best for a &amp;#34;light peel&amp;#34;....  they may need a jackhammer puce.  </li>
            <li>I found the best price here on Amazon and had a coupon from Eucerin which I used...got three tubes for around $11.  </li>

            <li>Five EFFECTIVE Stars!</li>
            <li>of the good things is that it has zero fragrance, thus making it good for anyone to use.</li>
            <li>I just like them feeling good.</li>
            <li>Knowing that Eucerin is a good quality brand</li>
            <li>I will continue using this creme, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It is a nice lotion consistency.</li>
            <li>The skin on her feet is smoother and softer, and everything is healing up nicely.</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of lotions and salves to find some effective form of relief.</li>
            <li>happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by how rapidly the cr&amp;egrave;me is absorbed, without oily or filmy residue and the product is gratefully, fragrance free.</li>
            <li>this is the best for my mom&#x27;s diabetic feet--keeps them soft</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this cream, specifically for Diabetics.</li>
            <li>Five SMOOTH Stars!</li>
            <li>This product seems better suited to use on the feet than the hand lotion</li>
            <li>The hand lotion had to be wiped off with a towel or cloth, but this seems to absorb better.  </li>
            <li>I am not diabetic, but I love this foot cream.  </li>
            <li>and it really does a great job at keeping my elbows</li>
            <li>It is knd of pricey but most of these type of cremes are pricey.</li>
            <li>much better product that I&#x27;ve been using for a while (I&#x27;m the non-diabetic) is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>podiatrist tells me that my feet are in excellent condition following the use of this product.</li>
            <li>The Lubriderm I use is a better lotion.</li>
            <li>I walk around in flip flops most of the time, and barefoot a lot of the time.</li>
            <li>comes in a tube and is more like a lotion than a cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over 2 weeks now and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It seems to me to be a great moisturizer for feet, hands, elbows, ankles, really anywhere, and I don’t see a reason why you would hesitate to use this just because you don’t have diabetes.</li>
            <li>My feet were visibly smoother and just felt better.</li>
            <li>That claim would be more truthful if it said &amp;#34;soon.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and there is now a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>This cream is perfect for anyone who has problems with dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer for dry feet.  </li>
            <li>I can vouch that this product is very effective on my &#x27;winterized&#x27; hands and true to the product&#x27;s description - one application is all I need to receive good results that last for the entirety of a</li>
            <li>lotion is odorless and easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have skin that can easily have reactions to creams or lotions</li>
            <li>This is a very good product for those with extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li>The tubes are 3oz, so for a woman, it will easily fit in your purse.</li>
            <li>It is unscented and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and they continue to be as  smooth  </li>
            <li>This cream makes the diabetics&#x27; foot look smooth and helps heal cracks.  </li>
            <li>Great product if used daily!</li>
            <li>To be honest, this one really did nothing to help.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t entirely smooth, but they are getting there, and that&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on easily and dries rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The product absorbed so quickly, and did not have the greasy coating most foot creams have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched the doc check them periodically, but never felt the need to do anything special until Arctic blasts this winter started chewing up my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have experienced a burning sensation after applying this a couple of times, but that was when my hands/knuckles were super duper dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>In any case, it doesn&#x27;t add any stinging or tingling that an aggressive alpha hydroxy can create or the creme is repairing while its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all -- it&#x27;s a good foot creme that doesn&#x27;t seem stick out for any specific property besides what it doesnt do...</li>
            <li>Moving to a much colder climate two years ago, I find having heat on so much more is adding to my neuropathy caused by the diabetes and thus the pain is also a problem.</li>
            <li>do know that my feet are much better and the pain I was getting is much relieved now that I am using this.</li>
            <li>This is a simple, mostly unscented, and remarkably moisturizing cream which sinks in immediately and does a very good job of deeply moisturizing skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy (like the Eucerin hand lotion), and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>These qualities fit my requirements on first application</li>
            <li>and I was willing to try this to help smooth out my feet.</li>
            <li>She said that it was absorbed by the skin quite quickly and there was no greasy residue, so I put it on my hands one night before bed.</li>
            <li>First of all, the Eucerin cream is rich but more liquified than most lotions and easily comes out of the tube with just a slight touch to sides of the flip-top tube.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely buying more!</li>
            <li>This foot lotion did exactly what it said it would, to my disbelief - it healed my feet with one use!  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and not too much is needed.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin is a bit pricey but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Come to think of it, this product mentions an exfoliating effect, and while I can’t honestly say I noticed it, that may be what ended the flakiness on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>It really seemed to help my highly irritated feet and with continued usage it did seem to benefit me better than anything else I had used before.  </li>
            <li>My feet feel moisturized and the exfoliation is just right for my feet.  </li>
            <li>I put it on right after he takes his shower</li>
            <li>The non-diabetic experienced burning about an hour after application; general irritation remained for several hours.</li>
            <li>so was thrilled to find that this Eucerin Diabetic Dry Skin Relief Foot Cr&amp;egrave;me didn’t bother my often allergic skin condition.</li>
            <li>It does seem to give the skin a very smooth feeling and whatever I left over on my hands</li>
            <li>I don’t have to use very much so</li>
            <li>When used right after showering, the improvement in foot condition is immediate and dramatic making the feet look and feel very good for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>As a Diabetic, I&#x27;m already an avid Eucerin user.</li>
            <li>This one tube came plastic wrapped, which was nice as it ensured the lid remained closed and</li>
            <li>It keeps my heels moisturized, soft, and smooth and helps the skin on my feet to heal faster.  </li>
            <li>my feet have not felt better in recent years.</li>
            <li>I have also used various foot care products, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Since the first use they have been soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does not have any noticeable odor and goes on very well and seems to be absorbed into the skin well.  </li>
            <li>Great for the winter months when your skin is extra dry.</li>
            <li>It will take a while to see how it affects the skin over time, but first impressions are positive.</li>
            <li>cream does pretty much what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>It is a nice consistency and easy to rub in, and it helped a lot with my dry knuckles (more than several other types of lotion that I tried).</li>
            <li>but I need to use a little more to get full benefit.  </li>
            <li>I felt that I would certainly give it a try.  </li>
            <li>So with this in mind, I will say it is a pretty decent product</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, just a dab</li>
            <li>I received one tube of this cream (I am not complaining, just stating this because I can&#x27;t really say how the three pack is packaged).</li>
            <li>I find the consistency to be very close.  </li>
            <li>In testing, this creme is indeed fragrance-free, easy to apply because it easily comes out of the tube with just a squeeze, and it does provide effective relief to dry skin on the feet for at least 24 hours: producing a soft, smooth, satiny effect on the skin, penetrating deep, and getting into wrinkles and patchy areas.</li>
            <li>I have several lotions and cremes that I rotate to keep my elbows smooth.</li>
            <li>You would not want to put this on your feet and then immediately begin walking around on smooth floors (without covering your feet) as you&#x27;d likely slip.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Scent is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>I do have to wash my hands after applying because the exfoliating effect is just too much for my hands.  </li>
            <li>very usefull.</li>
            <li>This cream works really well.  </li>
            <li>and I have used this cream on his arms and legs and it has really helped.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen a real improvement.  </li>
            <li>After just one use, my feet felt so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>The diabetic had a worse experience: the burning started immediately and even though he washed it off right away, he developed a rash between his toes, across the top of his feet and up his ankles that lasted more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion seems &amp;#34;thin,&amp;#34;, not like most other foot creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>Better than any other cream I have used and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The dry peeling skin will easily sloth off after using this product.  </li>
            <li>When I was diagnosed as diabetic several years ago, I knew my feet should be get special attention.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great feeling putting this on my feet -- they are softer now after a few uses, but that may just be perception since I forget about them before they dry out again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having used many products in the past to fight dry and calloused conditions of my feet, I conclude that Eucerin&#x27;s dry foot creme is as good as or better than any other brand I have</li>
            <li>My feet need constant care and I&#x27;ve tried many foot creams, and need regular pedicures.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this a lot, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Directed toward diabetics (I’m not), after a single use of the cr&amp;egrave;me I did notice significant improvement.</li>
            <li>so I really think it depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok have not use it long enough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of thin when applying and doesn&#x27;t really seem to really absorb -</li>
            <li>This may not seem like much, but over a period of a year I would estimate that I will end up wasting an entire tube because it is not possible to use a significant amount of the product from the bottom of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the price is right - I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>Examining the contents listed on the tube, this creme contains, among other things, Alpha Hydroxy, an ingredient known for its ability to smooth wrinkled skin and improve looks of the treated skin area, but it also  increases the sensitivity of the skin to sunlight and the possibility of sunburn, so limit exposure to sunlight and wear clothing that protects the skin from the sun when using this product.    </li>
            <li>I expected something that would do the job better than my regular lotion, this did not.</li>
            <li>have suffered from leg sores over the last 2 years, keeping skin moist is necessary is important for healing leg sores.</li>
            <li>A very soft, creamy foot creme without fragrance.  </li>
            <li>If I were including the confusing marketing in my rating, I’d probably deduct a star, but for a foot (and other body parts) moisturizer, it’s great</li>
            <li>A three-tube pack ordered from Amazon will last nine weeks, which is the exact time between visits to my</li>
            <li>This is the first time I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with those that said they could feel a difference with just the first initial application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I am not diabetic, during the winter months I consistently experience severely chapped hands and have tried a plethora of different lotions and remedies to keep my mitts moisturized.</li>
            <li>It helps to smooth and moisturize my cracked dry skin and a little goes a long way, being absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>The creme is a nice consistency... not as thick as some hand or general use cremes, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs well</li>
            <li>I have had problems with rough, dry skin on my feet for many years and have not had it at all since I started using this lotion by Eucerin.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin&#x27;s &#x27;Dry Skin Relief&#x27; foot creme is an effective moisturizer designed to nourish and rehydrate the dried, cracked feet skin that diabetics can sometimes experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a mild scent that I find a little sweet and cloying, but it faded after ten minutes or so, and is worth it to deal with that very minor odor to have my skin so deeply</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have diabetes but this product is so creamy and rich enough to help his dry cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by my doctor nearly a decade ago</li>
            <li>Although it claims to absorb fast and be &amp;#34;non-greasy,&amp;#34; I believe that you will find that it does feel a bit greasy and takes several minutes to fully absorb.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this lotion broke me out after I applied it.</li>
            <li>I quit using it because my skin is just too sensitive for the product, and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing to remove roughness on the foot.  </li>
            <li>Really, for softening I still don’t believe anything works better than some common old petroleum jelly but the filmy residue from that ointment is an irritation of a different nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product surprised me.</li>
            <li>I was surprised in the morning at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive but worth every penny (there&#x27;s a miraculous Hand Balm too).</li>
            <li>If you know a diabetic - then you are aware of how awfully dry their feet can become.  </li>
            <li>A small dab is all I require for each of my hands (slightly bigger dab for foot application) which should make this 3 ounce tube last a good 2-3 months even with daily utilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not everyone will have the same experience as I can see by the other reviews, but this is definitely worth trying if you haven&#x27;t had success with other foot products.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several months and have found it to live up to its promises.</li>
            <li>There was a slight softening but it wasn&#x27;t worth the irritation.</li>
            <li>cream has a very slight medicinal odor that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>and it makes my feet soft and void of all that dry skin I was having to live with.</li>
            <li>Although it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all, it did feel just a little bit tacky to me, so I probably won’t use this before sitting down at my grand piano, but for working around the house and whatnot, it fits the bill.</li>
            <li>your feet become very slippery when wet.</li>
            <li>but I do have dry skin, particularly in winter.</li>
            <li>I now use it on my hands as well and the rough places around my nails are much improved.</li>
            <li>They feel soft the following day as well.</li>
            <li>I was desperate to find a good lotion to stop the cracking and dryness but also aid in pain relief.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you have cracked, dry skin anywhere, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>my skin feel not dry anymore.</li>
            <li>I feel sure I will be totally satisfied because I have never been disappointed with any other Eucerin products.</li>
            <li>Hard to believe, but true.  </li>
            <li>very thick lotion that makes my foot soft and moisturized, fast absorbing</li>
            <li>don’t have a problem with mess and because it is non-greasy, I really like it.</li>
            <li>For all I know the alpha hydroxyy acid in this formula might be burning my skin off like a newbie on the hot coal walking circuit but as long as I no longer have to keep a separate single sock drawer to make up new pairs after the crocodile heels destroy only one at a time</li>
            <li>Again, there may be some benefits of this cream for diabetics specifically, but for someone who only suffers from dry feet, you can get better results with coconut oil products or even straight coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not super thick and hard to rub in like some creams, but not so light and greasy as other lotions.</li>

            <li> Best cream for diabetic feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> alpha hydroxy that is supposed to add a bit of refresh to the skin layers appears to have some impact, but my feet may not be the best for a &amp;#34;light peel&amp;#34;....  they may need a jackhammer puce.  </li>
            <li> I found the best price here on Amazon and had a coupon from Eucerin which I used...got three tubes for around $11.  </li>

            <li> Five SMOOTH Stars!</li>
            <li> This product seems better suited to use on the feet than the hand lotion</li>
            <li> The hand lotion had to be wiped off with a towel or cloth, but this seems to absorb better.  </li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, but I love this foot cream.  </li>
            <li> and it really does a great job at keeping my elbows</li>
            <li> It is knd of pricey but most of these type of cremes are pricey.</li>
            <li> much better product that I&#x27;ve been using for a while (I&#x27;m the non-diabetic) is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> podiatrist tells me that my feet are in excellent condition following the use of this product.</li>
            <li> The Lubriderm I use is a better lotion.</li>
            <li> I walk around in flip flops most of the time, and barefoot a lot of the time.</li>
            <li> comes in a tube and is more like a lotion than a cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 2 weeks now and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It seems to me to be a great moisturizer for feet, hands, elbows, ankles, really anywhere, and I don’t see a reason why you would hesitate to use this just because you don’t have diabetes.</li>
            <li> My feet were visibly smoother and just felt better.</li>
            <li> That claim would be more truthful if it said &amp;#34;soon.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and there is now a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect for anyone who has problems with dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for dry feet.  </li>
            <li> I can vouch that this product is very effective on my &#x27;winterized&#x27; hands and true to the product&#x27;s description - one application is all I need to receive good results that last for the entirety of a</li>
            <li> lotion is odorless and easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have skin that can easily have reactions to creams or lotions</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for those with extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li> The tubes are 3oz, so for a woman, it will easily fit in your purse.</li>
            <li> It is unscented and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and they continue to be as  smooth  </li>
            <li> This cream makes the diabetics&#x27; foot look smooth and helps heal cracks.  </li>
            <li> Great product if used daily!</li>
            <li> To be honest, this one really did nothing to help.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t entirely smooth, but they are getting there, and that&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> The cream goes on easily and dries rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The product absorbed so quickly, and did not have the greasy coating most foot creams have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched the doc check them periodically, but never felt the need to do anything special until Arctic blasts this winter started chewing up my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have experienced a burning sensation after applying this a couple of times, but that was when my hands/knuckles were super duper dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> In any case, it doesn&#x27;t add any stinging or tingling that an aggressive alpha hydroxy can create or the creme is repairing while its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all -- it&#x27;s a good foot creme that doesn&#x27;t seem stick out for any specific property besides what it doesnt do...</li>
            <li> Moving to a much colder climate two years ago, I find having heat on so much more is adding to my neuropathy caused by the diabetes and thus the pain is also a problem.</li>
            <li> do know that my feet are much better and the pain I was getting is much relieved now that I am using this.</li>
            <li> This is a simple, mostly unscented, and remarkably moisturizing cream which sinks in immediately and does a very good job of deeply moisturizing skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy (like the Eucerin hand lotion), and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> These qualities fit my requirements on first application</li>
            <li> and I was willing to try this to help smooth out my feet.</li>
            <li> She said that it was absorbed by the skin quite quickly and there was no greasy residue, so I put it on my hands one night before bed.</li>
            <li> First of all, the Eucerin cream is rich but more liquified than most lotions and easily comes out of the tube with just a slight touch to sides of the flip-top tube.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> This foot lotion did exactly what it said it would, to my disbelief - it healed my feet with one use!  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and not too much is needed.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin is a bit pricey but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, this product mentions an exfoliating effect, and while I can’t honestly say I noticed it, that may be what ended the flakiness on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> It really seemed to help my highly irritated feet and with continued usage it did seem to benefit me better than anything else I had used before.  </li>
            <li> My feet feel moisturized and the exfoliation is just right for my feet.  </li>
            <li> I put it on right after he takes his shower</li>
            <li> The non-diabetic experienced burning about an hour after application; general irritation remained for several hours.</li>
            <li> so was thrilled to find that this Eucerin Diabetic Dry Skin Relief Foot Cr&amp;egrave;me didn’t bother my often allergic skin condition.</li>
            <li> It does seem to give the skin a very smooth feeling and whatever I left over on my hands</li>
            <li> I don’t have to use very much so</li>
            <li> When used right after showering, the improvement in foot condition is immediate and dramatic making the feet look and feel very good for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> As a Diabetic, I&#x27;m already an avid Eucerin user.</li>
            <li> This one tube came plastic wrapped, which was nice as it ensured the lid remained closed and</li>
            <li> It keeps my heels moisturized, soft, and smooth and helps the skin on my feet to heal faster.  </li>
            <li> my feet have not felt better in recent years.</li>
            <li> I have also used various foot care products, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Since the first use they have been soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does not have any noticeable odor and goes on very well and seems to be absorbed into the skin well.  </li>
            <li> Great for the winter months when your skin is extra dry.</li>
            <li> It will take a while to see how it affects the skin over time, but first impressions are positive.</li>
            <li> cream does pretty much what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> It is a nice consistency and easy to rub in, and it helped a lot with my dry knuckles (more than several other types of lotion that I tried).</li>
            <li> but I need to use a little more to get full benefit.  </li>
            <li> I felt that I would certainly give it a try.  </li>
            <li> So with this in mind, I will say it is a pretty decent product</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, just a dab</li>
            <li> I received one tube of this cream (I am not complaining, just stating this because I can&#x27;t really say how the three pack is packaged).</li>
            <li> I find the consistency to be very close.  </li>
            <li> In testing, this creme is indeed fragrance-free, easy to apply because it easily comes out of the tube with just a squeeze, and it does provide effective relief to dry skin on the feet for at least 24 hours: producing a soft, smooth, satiny effect on the skin, penetrating deep, and getting into wrinkles and patchy areas.</li>
            <li> I have several lotions and cremes that I rotate to keep my elbows smooth.</li>
            <li> You would not want to put this on your feet and then immediately begin walking around on smooth floors (without covering your feet) as you&#x27;d likely slip.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Scent is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I do have to wash my hands after applying because the exfoliating effect is just too much for my hands.  </li>
            <li> very usefull.</li>
            <li> This cream works really well.  </li>
            <li> and I have used this cream on his arms and legs and it has really helped.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen a real improvement.  </li>
            <li> After just one use, my feet felt so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> The diabetic had a worse experience: the burning started immediately and even though he washed it off right away, he developed a rash between his toes, across the top of his feet and up his ankles that lasted more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion seems &amp;#34;thin,&amp;#34;, not like most other foot creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> Better than any other cream I have used and not greasy.</li>
            <li> The dry peeling skin will easily sloth off after using this product.  </li>
            <li> When I was diagnosed as diabetic several years ago, I knew my feet should be get special attention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great feeling putting this on my feet -- they are softer now after a few uses, but that may just be perception since I forget about them before they dry out again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having used many products in the past to fight dry and calloused conditions of my feet, I conclude that Eucerin&#x27;s dry foot creme is as good as or better than any other brand I have</li>
            <li> My feet need constant care and I&#x27;ve tried many foot creams, and need regular pedicures.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this a lot, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Directed toward diabetics (I’m not), after a single use of the cr&amp;egrave;me I did notice significant improvement.</li>
            <li> so I really think it depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok have not use it long enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of thin when applying and doesn&#x27;t really seem to really absorb -</li>
            <li> This may not seem like much, but over a period of a year I would estimate that I will end up wasting an entire tube because it is not possible to use a significant amount of the product from the bottom of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the price is right - I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Examining the contents listed on the tube, this creme contains, among other things, Alpha Hydroxy, an ingredient known for its ability to smooth wrinkled skin and improve looks of the treated skin area, but it also  increases the sensitivity of the skin to sunlight and the possibility of sunburn, so limit exposure to sunlight and wear clothing that protects the skin from the sun when using this product.    </li>
            <li> I expected something that would do the job better than my regular lotion, this did not.</li>
            <li> have suffered from leg sores over the last 2 years, keeping skin moist is necessary is important for healing leg sores.</li>
            <li> A very soft, creamy foot creme without fragrance.  </li>
            <li> If I were including the confusing marketing in my rating, I’d probably deduct a star, but for a foot (and other body parts) moisturizer, it’s great</li>
            <li> A three-tube pack ordered from Amazon will last nine weeks, which is the exact time between visits to my</li>
            <li> This is the first time I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with those that said they could feel a difference with just the first initial application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I am not diabetic, during the winter months I consistently experience severely chapped hands and have tried a plethora of different lotions and remedies to keep my mitts moisturized.</li>
            <li> It helps to smooth and moisturize my cracked dry skin and a little goes a long way, being absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> The creme is a nice consistency... not as thick as some hand or general use cremes, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs well</li>
            <li> I have had problems with rough, dry skin on my feet for many years and have not had it at all since I started using this lotion by Eucerin.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin&#x27;s &#x27;Dry Skin Relief&#x27; foot creme is an effective moisturizer designed to nourish and rehydrate the dried, cracked feet skin that diabetics can sometimes experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a mild scent that I find a little sweet and cloying, but it faded after ten minutes or so, and is worth it to deal with that very minor odor to have my skin so deeply</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have diabetes but this product is so creamy and rich enough to help his dry cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my doctor nearly a decade ago</li>
            <li> Although it claims to absorb fast and be &amp;#34;non-greasy,&amp;#34; I believe that you will find that it does feel a bit greasy and takes several minutes to fully absorb.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this lotion broke me out after I applied it.</li>
            <li> I quit using it because my skin is just too sensitive for the product, and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing to remove roughness on the foot.  </li>
            <li> Really, for softening I still don’t believe anything works better than some common old petroleum jelly but the filmy residue from that ointment is an irritation of a different nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product surprised me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised in the morning at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive but worth every penny (there&#x27;s a miraculous Hand Balm too).</li>
            <li> If you know a diabetic - then you are aware of how awfully dry their feet can become.  </li>
            <li> A small dab is all I require for each of my hands (slightly bigger dab for foot application) which should make this 3 ounce tube last a good 2-3 months even with daily utilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not everyone will have the same experience as I can see by the other reviews, but this is definitely worth trying if you haven&#x27;t had success with other foot products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and have found it to live up to its promises.</li>
            <li> There was a slight softening but it wasn&#x27;t worth the irritation.</li>
            <li> cream has a very slight medicinal odor that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> and it makes my feet soft and void of all that dry skin I was having to live with.</li>
            <li> Although it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all, it did feel just a little bit tacky to me, so I probably won’t use this before sitting down at my grand piano, but for working around the house and whatnot, it fits the bill.</li>
            <li> your feet become very slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> but I do have dry skin, particularly in winter.</li>
            <li> I now use it on my hands as well and the rough places around my nails are much improved.</li>
            <li> They feel soft the following day as well.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a good lotion to stop the cracking and dryness but also aid in pain relief.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you have cracked, dry skin anywhere, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my skin feel not dry anymore.</li>
            <li> I feel sure I will be totally satisfied because I have never been disappointed with any other Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe, but true.  </li>
            <li> very thick lotion that makes my foot soft and moisturized, fast absorbing</li>
            <li> don’t have a problem with mess and because it is non-greasy, I really like it.</li>
            <li> For all I know the alpha hydroxyy acid in this formula might be burning my skin off like a newbie on the hot coal walking circuit but as long as I no longer have to keep a separate single sock drawer to make up new pairs after the crocodile heels destroy only one at a time</li>
            <li> Again, there may be some benefits of this cream for diabetics specifically, but for someone who only suffers from dry feet, you can get better results with coconut oil products or even straight coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I love that it is not super thick and hard to rub in like some creams, but not so light and greasy as other lotions.</li>
            <li> Not long after being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, I went from wearing strappy sandals to tube socks and loafers because  I could not control the dry skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> I woke up to visibly less irritated skin, with large patches of red, flaky skin having become visually whiter with no flakes and much less irritation.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I use this cream on my feet once a day</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skeptic that I am, any product that proclaims you will notice marked improvement after a single use is typically no more than basting for a dish to be roasted in my sarcastic review oven.  </li>
            <li> Finally, something for my dry, diabetic skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products all claiming to relieve dry feet and help with the cracks, etc.  </li>
            <li> My wife has chronically dry skin on the bottoms of her feet, especially the heels.</li>
            <li> My husband is not diabetic, but I ordered this lotion for him because he has very dry, cracked heels, with some so deep that they bleed a bit.</li>
            <li> careful entering a shower as the next morning</li>
            <li> I put some on my feet after a shower, and they felt slimy all day long.  </li>
            <li> But I do live in South Florida and wear sandals year round and suffer from very dry feet as a result of that lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> There are also other reviewers that have said the same thing.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Foot Creme is targeted at the dry, scaly skin on the feet and heels and \\&quot;after</li>
            <li> (Package of three-3 ounce flip-top tubes of Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; \\&quot;Dry Skin Relief Foot Creme.)</li>
            <li> EUCERIN DIABETIC&#x27;S DRY SKIN RELIEF FOOT CREME stops all that.  </li>
            <li> recommend this creme not just for your feet but for any dry skin.</li>
            <li> In any case, this is creme for all, all of us with dry feet...</li>
            <li> Have an effect on the dry skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> My husband is a type 1 diabetic and this crème had helped heal his heals which have been dry and cracking for years.  </li>
            <li> It does help dry, cracked skin, but does not relieve dry, cracked skin &amp;#34;after one use&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I battle dry heels and toes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cream for dry feet, I&#x27;d recommend the Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Oil foot cream instead of this one.  </li>
            <li> While just about any moisturizer will provide some degree of dry foot relief, her go to remedy has been O’Keefe’s.</li>
            <li> Although I myself do not have a dry skin problem on my feet, as the winter months have dragged on, my hands have been severely put to the test.</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry</li>
            <li> We have used it on our hands and dry knuckles</li>
            <li> While the cream doesn&#x27;t dry on contact, it does dry rather rapidly when exposed to air.</li>
            <li> This Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Foot Creme is literally just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> I don’t see any reason anyone couldn’t use it who has severe dry feet problems but</li>
            <li> but I do tend to get dry skin on my feet</li>
            <li> In my experience this product, Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Foot Creme, does not live up to it&#x27;s promise of softening after just one application.</li>
            <li> Very thick creme that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it twice a day to my feet and at night to my dry cracked fingers and there is minimal improvement if any at all after 7 days.</li>
            <li> You only need a slight amount.</li>
            <li> It really penetrates tough skin and helps it heal.</li>
            <li> I use other skin products from Eucerin and they work well, helping me keep my dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> great lotion, horrible price</li>
            <li> Again please use caution if you step onto a wet surface with barefoot after using this cream.</li>
            <li> I do not have rough skin in my feet but my elbows tend to have it.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have been experiencing trouble with diabetes affecting my feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other lotions, but always end up with either a build up of dead skin cells or don&#x27;t get sufficient moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> but my feet did not turn pink as other reviewers have suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so use sparingly.  </li>
            <li> I have a little guy who gets really dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy and does NOT live up to its &amp;#34;one day to smoother&amp;#34; skin billing.  </li>
            <li> This past winter I got extremely dry feet and developed thick calloused skin on the bottom of my feet and they cracked....</li>
            <li> Overall I was not happy with this product and will not use it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I apply it and let my feet dry out for a few minutes before tucking them under the covers.</li>
            <li> This cream Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; dry skin relief foot cream was  too harsh for my feet,  my feet started to peeled</li>
            <li> Also, I expected to feel a little tingling or something due to the alphahydroxy, but I felt nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> average, I used one ounce of the creme per week.</li>
            <li> complaint I have is that the lids cannot be removed from the tubes to permit extracting the last bit of creme.</li>
            <li> I applied it to both my feet, which are very dry and have some thick rough spots.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin a little softer but it was not worth the burning sensation.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As a Diabetic, I&#x27;m already an avid Eucerin user. It was recommended by my doctor nearly a decade ago and I&#x27;ve been using it every since. I was pleased to find this cream, specifically for Diabetics. Not long after being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, I went from wearing strappy sandals to tube socks and loafers because  I could not control the dry skin on my feet. Over the years, it got worse. In the past, slathering Vaseline on my feet and wearing socks overnight, even that no longer worked. Long story short, I use this cream on my feet once a day and it actually works. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, just a dab and it makes my feet soft and void of all that dry skin I was having to live with. The tubes are 3oz, so for a woman, it will easily fit in your purse. You get three in the pack for about $15. Eucerin is a bit pricey but its worth every penny. I use other skin products from Eucerin and they work well, helping me keep my dry skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I received one tube of this cream (I am not complaining, just stating this because I can&#x27;t really say how the three pack is packaged). This one tube came plastic wrapped, which was nice as it ensured the lid remained closed and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would refer to this as a lotion as opposed to a cream. It isn&#x27;t thick like a cream. It is a nice lotion consistency. It is unscented and goes on smoothly.  It absorbs quickly.  I applied it to both my feet, which are very dry and have some thick rough spots. My dermatologist said to use something with lactic acid, like lac-hydren 12%.  I have run out of it so used this in its place.  I find the consistency to be very close.  The Eucerin lists lactic acid on the label but does not give %.  I used this cream and put on cotton socks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation to the skin and they continue to be as  smooth  as when I used the lac-hydren 12%.  This lotion is cheaper, but I do consider it a con that I have no way to know the % in it.  Otherwise it is a very good lotion and has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Five EFFECTIVE Stars! Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Foot Creme is targeted at the dry, scaly skin on the feet and heels and \\&quot;after just one use\\&quot; it boasts moisture effectiveness for 24 hours in a fragrance-free creme. First of all, the Eucerin cream is rich but more liquified than most lotions and easily comes out of the tube with just a slight touch to sides of the flip-top tube.  Examining the contents listed on the tube, this creme contains, among other things, Alpha Hydroxy, an ingredient known for its ability to smooth wrinkled skin and improve looks of the treated skin area, but it also  increases the sensitivity of the skin to sunlight and the possibility of sunburn, so limit exposure to sunlight and wear clothing that protects the skin from the sun when using this product.    In testing, this creme is indeed fragrance-free, easy to apply because it easily comes out of the tube with just a squeeze, and it does provide effective relief to dry skin on the feet for at least 24 hours: producing a soft, smooth, satiny effect on the skin, penetrating deep, and getting into wrinkles and patchy areas. This smoothness is visible. There is no greasy effect on the feet which would cause the foot to slide around in flip flops or shoes. When used right after showering, the improvement in foot condition is immediate and dramatic making the feet look and feel very good for the rest of the day. The 3 ounce tube may last from two to four weeks depending on usage. Highly Recommended. Five SMOOTH Stars! (Package of three-3 ounce flip-top tubes of Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; \\&quot;Dry Skin Relief Foot Creme.)</li>
            <li> In my experience this product, Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Foot Creme, does not live up to it&#x27;s promise of softening after just one application. I&#x27;ve applied it twice a day to my feet and at night to my dry cracked fingers and there is minimal improvement if any at all after 7 days. The tube is only 3 oz so it is not very big. There is some stinging when applied after a bath but my feet did not turn pink as other reviewers have suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful entering a shower as the next morning your feet become very slippery when wet. Again please use caution if you step onto a wet surface with barefoot after using this cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect for anyone who has problems with dry cracked skin.  Hey, no need to become a diabetic.  Use it in the morning just before putting on socks if that&#x27;s  your style.  No sock person, no problem.  Use it just before getting into bed.</li>
            <li> My wife has problems with the skin on her feet--particularly in the heel area--getting dry and severely cracked, to the extent they bleed and are painful. She isn&#x27;t diabetic, but we figured she should give this a try. Of all the things she&#x27;s tried this has worked the best, and it has worked miracles. The skin on her feet is smoother and softer, and everything is healing up nicely. We&#x27;re very happy.</li>
            <li> This product seems better suited to use on the feet than the hand lotion I was using.for the same purpose.  It goes on smoothly, and not too much is needed.  The hand lotion had to be wiped off with a towel or cloth, but this seems to absorb better.  It will take a while to see how it affects the skin over time, but first impressions are positive.</li>
            <li> I am not a diabetic but I do have dry skin, particularly in winter. I was hoping that this cream would moisturize and relieve this dryness; however, I suffered a bad reaction from it. Within 5 minutes of application, my feet felt burning and tingling, then became quite red.  I immediately took a bath to remove the cream. I suspect that it was the urea that caused this reaction. This cream is simply wrong for me.</li>
            <li> Best cream for diabetic feet.&lt;br /&gt;Small amount brings relief.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am not diabetic, but I love this foot cream.  I am a life-long dancer, with thick callous pads on my feet.  In the winter, my feet get so dry that they crack, peel, and bleed, all of which is very painful.  EUCERIN DIABETIC&#x27;S DRY SKIN RELIEF FOOT CREME stops all that.  It keeps my heels moisturized, soft, and smooth and helps the skin on my feet to heal faster.  I no longer have to wear Vaseline and socks to bed, which is gross.  I am definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> I do not have rough skin in my feet but my elbows tend to have it. I have several lotions and cremes that I rotate to keep my elbows smooth. I added this creme  to my stash and it really does a great job at keeping my elbows smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the good things is that it has zero fragrance, thus making it good for anyone to use. It is knd of pricey but most of these type of cremes are pricey. I like the small size as it can be taken on  the plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this creme not just for your feet but for any dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for dry feet.  A little bit goes a long way so use sparingly.  Although it claims to absorb fast and be &amp;#34;non-greasy,&amp;#34; I believe that you will find that it does feel a bit greasy and takes several minutes to fully absorb.  You would not want to put this on your feet and then immediately begin walking around on smooth floors (without covering your feet) as you&#x27;d likely slip.  If you know a diabetic - then you are aware of how awfully dry their feet can become.  This cream makes the diabetics&#x27; foot look smooth and helps heal cracks.  The dry peeling skin will easily sloth off after using this product.  This is a very good product for those with extremely dry feet.  If the price is right - I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Sometimes marketing is misleading.  I think, in this case, that Eucerin is trying to attract diabetics to the product, but may also be discouraging non-diabetics to try it.  In any case, this is creme for all, all of us with dry feet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing to note is that this is a small tube - 3 ounce... so set your expectations accordingly.  The creme is a nice consistency... not as thick as some hand or general use cremes, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs well so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about collecting fuzz or making marks on the bed or floor.  It&#x27;s a great feeling putting this on my feet -- they are softer now after a few uses, but that may just be perception since I forget about them before they dry out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alpha hydroxy that is supposed to add a bit of refresh to the skin layers appears to have some impact, but my feet may not be the best for a &amp;#34;light peel&amp;#34;....  they may need a jackhammer puce.  In any case, it doesn&#x27;t add any stinging or tingling that an aggressive alpha hydroxy can create or the creme is repairing while its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all -- it&#x27;s a good foot creme that doesn&#x27;t seem stick out for any specific property besides what it doesnt do... It&#x27;s unscented... so my guy feet wont smell rosy...  you may like scented... I just like them feeling good.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after both a diabetic and non-diabetic in my household tested this product, I&#x27;m not sure I can recommend it. The non-diabetic experienced burning about an hour after application; general irritation remained for several hours. There was a slight softening but it wasn&#x27;t worth the irritation. The diabetic had a worse experience: the burning started immediately and even though he washed it off right away, he developed a rash between his toes, across the top of his feet and up his ankles that lasted more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much better product that I&#x27;ve been using for a while (I&#x27;m the non-diabetic) is [[ASIN:B0013H8M5E Flexitol Heel Balm, 4 Ounce Tube]]. It&#x27;s more expensive but worth every penny (there&#x27;s a miraculous Hand Balm too).</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom.I also used it myself. Have an effect on the dry skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> A very soft, creamy foot creme without fragrance.  Just as I like it.  These qualities fit my requirements on first application but I need to use a little more to get full benefit.  I feel sure I will be totally satisfied because I have never been disappointed with any other Eucerin products. At that time I will rate 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This foot lotion did exactly what it said it would, to my disbelief - it healed my feet with one use!  Hard to believe, but true.  I have had problems with rough, dry skin on my feet for many years and have not had it at all since I started using this lotion by Eucerin.  I now use it on my hands as well and the rough places around my nails are much improved.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and have found it to live up to its promises. Having used many products in the past to fight dry and calloused conditions of my feet, I conclude that Eucerin&#x27;s dry foot creme is as good as or better than any other brand I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On average, I used one ounce of the creme per week. A three-tube pack ordered from Amazon will last nine weeks, which is the exact time between visits to my podiatrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint I have is that the lids cannot be removed from the tubes to permit extracting the last bit of creme. This may not seem like much, but over a period of a year I would estimate that I will end up wasting an entire tube because it is not possible to use a significant amount of the product from the bottom of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My podiatrist tells me that my feet are in excellent condition following the use of this product. I agree -- my feet have not felt better in recent years.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husband whose hands are badly cut.  He doesn&#x27;t have diabetes but this product is so creamy and rich enough to help his dry cracked hands.  He loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this lotion broke me out after I applied it. There are also other reviewers that have said the same thing. Another person in my household used the lotion but it didn&#x27;t have the same effect on him so I really think it depends on how sensitive your skin is. It did make my skin a little softer but it was not worth the burning sensation. Although this lotion claims to be non greasy it felt a little greasy and sticky after I applied it. Overall I was not happy with this product and will not use it again in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok have not use it long enough</li>
            <li> I expected something that would do the job better than my regular lotion, this did not. Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> very thick lotion that makes my foot soft and moisturized, fast absorbing</li>
            <li> this is the best for my mom&#x27;s diabetic feet--keeps them soft</li>
            <li> This is a great diabetes foot lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband is a type 1 diabetic and this crème had helped heal his heals which have been dry and cracking for years.  Great product if used daily!</li>
            <li> great lotion, horrible price</li>
            <li> great product, my skin becomes moist within 30 minutes. have suffered from leg sores over the last 2 years, keeping skin moist is necessary is important for healing leg sores.</li>
            <li> Finally, something for my dry, diabetic skin. I didn&#x27;t know it existed until I went shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a simple, mostly unscented, and remarkably moisturizing cream which sinks in immediately and does a very good job of deeply moisturizing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have diabetes, but as a landscaper I have some areas of skin on my hands that crack every winter, and this moisturized, sunk in, and didn&#x27;t sting the cracked bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a mild scent that I find a little sweet and cloying, but it faded after ten minutes or so, and is worth it to deal with that very minor odor to have my skin so deeply moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have cracked, dry skin anywhere, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. It really penetrates tough skin and helps it heal.</li>
            <li> My husband is not diabetic, but I ordered this lotion for him because he has very dry, cracked heels, with some so deep that they bleed a bit. He used this creme and got instant results. It&#x27;s not greasy (like the Eucerin hand lotion), and absorbs quickly. I have also used various foot care products, and this is my favorite. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Scent is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed:&lt;br /&gt;- It does help dry, cracked skin, but does not relieve dry, cracked skin &amp;#34;after one use&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I applied this after showering. Although it claims to make a difference after 24 hours, I did not notice a difference after 5 days. On the fifth day, my feet itched bad after applying it. I hoped it meant I would see a change in the roughness, but still none. I quit using it because my skin is just too sensitive for the product, and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing to remove roughness on the foot.  The Lubriderm I use is a better lotion.</li>
            <li> As one who does constantly battle cracked, scaly heels I have tried a variety of lotions and salves to find some effective form of relief. Really, for softening I still don’t believe anything works better than some common old petroleum jelly but the filmy residue from that ointment is an irritation of a different nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skeptic that I am, any product that proclaims you will notice marked improvement after a single use is typically no more than basting for a dish to be roasted in my sarcastic review oven.  This time, I am left with nothing to serve. Directed toward diabetics (I’m not), after a single use of the cr&amp;egrave;me I did notice significant improvement. For all I know the alpha hydroxyy acid in this formula might be burning my skin off like a newbie on the hot coal walking circuit but as long as I no longer have to keep a separate single sock drawer to make up new pairs after the crocodile heels destroy only one at a time, I’m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by how rapidly the cr&amp;egrave;me is absorbed, without oily or filmy residue and the product is gratefully, fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I battle dry heels and toes. I walk around in flip flops most of the time, and barefoot a lot of the time. My feet need constant care and I&#x27;ve tried many foot creams, and need regular pedicures. This is the first time I can definitely see a difference. I have to agree with those that said they could feel a difference with just the first initial application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a tube and is more like a lotion than a cream. You only need a slight amount. I have been using it for over 2 weeks now and am pleased with the results. I only use it once at night before bed. I apply it and let my feet dry out for a few minutes before tucking them under the covers. I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all. They feel soft the following day as well. After showering I use my regular body cream all over, including my feet, but at night I only use this one. Not everyone will have the same experience as I can see by the other reviews, but this is definitely worth trying if you haven&#x27;t had success with other foot products.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer - I&#x27;m not diabetic.  But I do live in South Florida and wear sandals year round and suffer from very dry feet as a result of that lifestyle.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous products all claiming to relieve dry feet and help with the cracks, etc.  To be honest, this one really did nothing to help.  It&#x27;s kind of thin when applying and doesn&#x27;t really seem to really absorb - I applied at night and wore socks (like I do with any foot cream).  If you&#x27;re looking for a cream for dry feet, I&#x27;d recommend the Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Oil foot cream instead of this one.  Also, I expected to feel a little tingling or something due to the alphahydroxy, but I felt nothing at all.  Again, there may be some benefits of this cream for diabetics specifically, but for someone who only suffers from dry feet, you can get better results with coconut oil products or even straight coconut oil.</li>
            <li> My feet have finally stopped cracking, especially my heals.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that has ever helped my feet! Since the first use they have been soft and smooth.Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of problems with my feet.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous other lotions, but always end up with either a build up of dead skin cells or don&#x27;t get sufficient moisturizing.  This lotion took care of both problems.  My feet feel moisturized and the exfoliation is just right for my feet.  I do have to wash my hands after applying because the exfoliating effect is just too much for my hands.  FYI, I&#x27;m a diabetic with severe diabetic nerve pain.  I recommend this product to anyone who has similar issues.</li>
            <li> very usefull. my skin feel not dry anymore.</li>
            <li> This cream Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; dry skin relief foot cream was  too harsh for my feet,  my feet started to peeled and I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> My wife has chronically dry skin on the bottoms of her feet, especially the heels. While just about any moisturizer will provide some degree of dry foot relief, her go to remedy has been O’Keefe’s. Although I myself do not have a dry skin problem on my feet, as the winter months have dragged on, my hands have been severely put to the test. So when we got this Eucerin diabetic foot cream product, there was ample opportunity to test it out in a variety of fashions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, my wife applied it to her feet. After one day, she commented that it “seems to be working” and after three days, she announced, “That stuff is great, you should try it.” She said that it was absorbed by the skin quite quickly and there was no greasy residue, so I put it on my hands one night before bed. I woke up to visibly less irritated skin, with large patches of red, flaky skin having become visually whiter with no flakes and much less irritation. Although it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all, it did feel just a little bit tacky to me, so I probably won’t use this before sitting down at my grand piano, but for working around the house and whatnot, it fits the bill. Come to think of it, this product mentions an exfoliating effect, and while I can’t honestly say I noticed it, that may be what ended the flakiness on the back of my hands. (Anyway, it worked on skin flakes, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works quite well, and I’m forced to question why the Eucerin marketing team decided it wanted to limit itself to just being applied to the feet of diabetes sufferers. It seems to me to be a great moisturizer for feet, hands, elbows, ankles, really anywhere, and I don’t see a reason why you would hesitate to use this just because you don’t have diabetes. If I were including the confusing marketing in my rating, I’d probably deduct a star, but for a foot (and other body parts) moisturizer, it’s great, so I rate it at five stars.</li>
            <li> This product surprised me. The lotion seems &amp;#34;thin,&amp;#34;, not like most other foot creams I have tried. I was doubtful as to how well it would work. The product absorbed so quickly, and did not have the greasy coating most foot creams have. I was surprised in the morning at how well it worked. My feet were visibly smoother and just felt better. I&#x27;ll be using this a lot, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Eucerin&#x27;s &#x27;Dry Skin Relief&#x27; foot creme is an effective moisturizer designed to nourish and rehydrate the dried, cracked feet skin that diabetics can sometimes experience. While I am not diabetic, during the winter months I consistently experience severely chapped hands and have tried a plethora of different lotions and remedies to keep my mitts moisturized. I can vouch that this product is very effective on my &#x27;winterized&#x27; hands and true to the product&#x27;s description - one application is all I need to receive good results that last for the entirety of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is odorless and easily absorbs into the skin. A small dab is all I require for each of my hands (slightly bigger dab for foot application) which should make this 3 ounce tube last a good 2-3 months even with daily utilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that this product contains Alpha Hydroxy Acid which can increase your skin&#x27;s sensitivity to sunlight so instructions recommend the additional application of a sunscreen while using the lotion and up to 1 week afterward.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy and does NOT live up to its &amp;#34;one day to smoother&amp;#34; skin billing.  I put some on my feet after a shower, and they felt slimy all day long.  This cream does not &amp;#34;sink in.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ll probably use it until it is gone, but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry I called it alligator skin.  The dry skin was so bad I felt like I had dandruff.  Now the flakes are gone.</li>
            <li> Very thick creme that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This cream works like a champ!</li>
            <li> This past winter I got extremely dry feet and developed thick calloused skin on the bottom of my feet and they cracked....it was so painful I was almost literally carrying my hands in my feet.  I searched the internet to find something that may aid me with this and happened to see this on the Dr. Oz Show...good timing!  Knowing that Eucerin is a good quality brand I felt that I would certainly give it a try.  I found the best price here on Amazon and had a coupon from Eucerin which I used...got three tubes for around $11.  Although I don&#x27;t believe I am Diabetic it seemed to have all of the elements that could potentially help me.  it arrived within two days and I began using it.  It does not have any noticeable odor and goes on very well and seems to be absorbed into the skin well.  It does seem to give the skin a very smooth feeling and whatever I left over on my hands I rubbed into my hands.  I used socks at bedtime after applying and then again in the morning.  It really seemed to help my highly irritated feet and with continued usage it did seem to benefit me better than anything else I had used before.  My feet were so irritated and in such pain before that I could not detect any burning or irritation from this product as some have mentioned.  So with this in mind, I will say it is a pretty decent product and I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> After living in a humid climate for fours years and then moving to a dry climate, we have had the worst dry skin in our house this winter! This lotion is great! We have used it on our hands and dry knuckles and I do recommend it. I love that it is not super thick and hard to rub in like some creams, but not so light and greasy as other lotions. It is a nice consistency and easy to rub in, and it helped a lot with my dry knuckles (more than several other types of lotion that I tried). I have experienced a burning sensation after applying this a couple of times, but that was when my hands/knuckles were super duper dry and cracked. I will continue using this creme, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Better than any other cream I have used and not greasy.</li>
            <li> When I was diagnosed as diabetic several years ago, I knew my feet should be get special attention. I&#x27;ve watched the doc check them periodically, but never felt the need to do anything special until Arctic blasts this winter started chewing up my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream does pretty much what it claims to do. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement immediately. That claim would be more truthful if it said &amp;#34;soon.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and there is now a noticeable difference. I don&#x27;t feel like I could scrape paint off of furniture with my heels. They aren&#x27;t entirely smooth, but they are getting there, and that&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a very slight medicinal odor that dissipates quickly. While the cream doesn&#x27;t dry on contact, it does dry rather rapidly when exposed to air. And it feels terrific when applied. It doesn&#x27;t claim to be a stress reducer, but that is a claim it could legitimately make.</li>
            <li> This Eucerin Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Foot Creme is literally just what the doctor ordered. Recently, I have been experiencing trouble with diabetes affecting my feet. I was desperate to find a good lotion to stop the cracking and dryness but also aid in pain relief. Moving to a much colder climate two years ago, I find having heat on so much more is adding to my neuropathy caused by the diabetes and thus the pain is also a problem. I have skin that can easily have reactions to creams or lotions so was thrilled to find that this Eucerin Diabetic Dry Skin Relief Foot Cr&amp;egrave;me didn’t bother my often allergic skin condition. I apply the cream following my shower and it does indeed last for 24 hours. I don’t have to use very much so don’t have a problem with mess and because it is non-greasy, I really like it. It helps to smooth and moisturize my cracked dry skin and a little goes a long way, being absorbed quickly. I don’t see any reason anyone couldn’t use it who has severe dry feet problems but do know that my feet are much better and the pain I was getting is much relieved now that I am using this. Thus I think people with diabetes will benefit from the product.</li>
            <li> This cream works really well.  Not just for feet.  I have a little guy who gets really dry skin in the winter and I have used this cream on his arms and legs and it has really helped.  I put it on right after he takes his shower and I have seen a real improvement.  Very good cream, no scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have diabetes but I do tend to get dry skin on my feet and I was willing to try this to help smooth out my feet. This cream worked so well. After just one use, my feet felt so much smoother and softer. The cream goes on easily and dries rather quickly. It wasn&#x27;t greasy at all. I&#x27;m a happy camper with this cream and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to both diabetics and non-diabetics alike. Great for the winter months when your skin is extra dry.</li>
