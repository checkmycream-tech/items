            <li>excellent quality and soft for my skin</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure something was amiss.</li>
            <li>There was counterfeit lotion in here for sure (if you can call it that).</li>
            <li>I love THIS clinique product.</li>
            <li>Clinique is a great product, shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For reasons that I do not understand, this lotion makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>Wonderful moisturizer for summertime and add extra moisture with Repairware in the Winter.</li>
            <li>Very excited....</li>
            <li>This is a very good facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The newer formula is ok, but I really really liked the older version of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the easy of use with the pump.  </li>
            <li>My package was received in a manilla lightly packed envelope.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer right now.  </li>
            <li>it was the original lotion as advertised.</li>
            <li>Clinique has changed the formula of the original moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the old version and I was reluctant to  try the new version.</li>
            <li>My first impression is: the product is different but good.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>(had a Bloomingdale&#x27;s return receipt right on the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a pleased customer and will use amazon in the future.</li>
            <li>Seriously leaves a nice, moisturized, non-oily smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first time trying to buy the older bottles on here</li>
            <li>Can I really complain about that?</li>
            <li>I wondered if it was an older formula.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the older product for my skin without the + .</li>
            <li>that I was getting the older formula.  </li>
            <li>This is just my experience and opinion with my particular skin type.  </li>
            <li>it would make if making it little more</li>
            <li>If you just want to pick up some Clinique lotion, but don&#x27;t care if it is the older bottle or the new one, then I guess this seller is fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>kinds sucks that they charge $4.95 per item for shipping and don&#x27;t give an option to combine shipping cost, but I knew that going into the purchase, just would have been a nice</li>
            <li>I apply under make up, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without dry spot or flaking.</li>
            <li>is a product of the new formula.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the new formula as well.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>Keeps all of my family girls looking young.....</li>
            <li>My Mother loves this lotion for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I do not mind patting more lotion on my face throughout a dreadfully dry and bitterly cold Wisconin winter day.</li>
            <li>: When I first started using this product 5 years ago, when I used the last of the lotion in the bottle, the lotion would leave red splotches on my face that would fade in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>but anyone who is in the same boat I am, and looking to find the older bottle, should probably shop else where.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product consistently for the past five years (old formula to new formula), and though the new formula takes maybe half a minute to disappear into my skin, I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>have very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I live in Wisconsin, and this product doesn&#x27;t always stand up to the 15 mph blasts of dry, -15F air and the dry air circulating throughout my workplace.</li>

            <li> This is a very good facial moisturizer. No perfumes. No nonsense.  I use it twice a day. Keeps my skin soft without feeling greasy.  I only wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much. But nothing else works so well.</li>
            <li> This is a must have beauty product for me, especially in the winter. I apply under make up, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without dry spot or flaking. It has no strong smell, and you need very little for your face (so it lasts a long time). It is fairly expensive, but I refuse to use anything else - it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Item received as decribed.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product of the new formula. I was happy with the old version and I was reluctant to  try the new version. My first impression is: the product is different but good.</li>
            <li> Gave me an allergic reaction immediately. I have tried this product in samples before so I&#x27;m sure something was amiss. Nothing was sealed. There was counterfeit lotion in here for sure (if you can call it that).</li>
            <li> Very excited....it was the original lotion as advertised. No return this time...thank you.  I am a pleased customer and will use amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> The moisturising lotion feel great on my skin.  I enjoy the easy of use with the pump.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Seriously leaves a nice, moisturized, non-oily smooth feeling. I&#x27;ve been buying this for years and out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this face lotion works the best on my combination skin. Now only if I could keep my husband from using it all.</li>
            <li> This is the previous formula that you can no longer get in the stores. Just what I was looking for. Don&#x27;t like the new formula as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer right now.  However, the box I received was mangled and looked like it had been kept in storage for a few years.  I wondered if it was an older formula.  Has it changed over the years?</li>
            <li> I love THIS clinique product. I have used it for several years.</li>
            <li> Clinique is a great product, shipped fast.  My package was received in a manilla lightly packed envelope. Box was completely broken so its impossible to give as a gift without it lookibg &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used this product consistently for the past five years (old formula to new formula), and though the new formula takes maybe half a minute to disappear into my skin, I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry, sensitive skin. I have found that this lotion is instantly hydrating and keeps my skin moisturized all day. Winter, however, is a bit of a challenge for this product on my skin. I live in Wisconsin, and this product doesn&#x27;t always stand up to the 15 mph blasts of dry, -15F air and the dry air circulating throughout my workplace. Can I really complain about that? No. No lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried has stood up to those conditions. I love this product, and I do not mind patting more lotion on my face throughout a dreadfully dry and bitterly cold Wisconin winter day. If you do not have such severely dry skin, you&#x27;ll probably fare better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reasons that I do not understand, this lotion makes my skin look healthy. I would even say it makes my skin glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lightweight, scent-free, deeply moisturizing, lasting moisturization, non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When I first started using this product 5 years ago, when I used the last of the lotion in the bottle, the lotion would leave red splotches on my face that would fade in about 10 minutes. However, perhaps because of the change in the formula, I have not had this problem in over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent lotion for the price. (I purchase this at department stores where I pay less than on Amazon.)</li>
            <li> Not happy with it&lt;br /&gt;Sample size is small and price is very high&lt;br /&gt;what difference it would make if making it little more</li>
            <li> Keeps all of my family girls looking young.....35-92....we do Clinique! Wonderful moisturizer for summertime and add extra moisture with Repairware in the Winter.</li>
            <li> Clinique has changed the formula of the original moisturizer. I prefer the older product for my skin without the + .</li>
            <li> My Mother loves this lotion for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff !</li>
            <li> Well I got my package in the mail, and it was well wrapped/packaged so that was a plus. . . .but . . . I thought based on the product photo (and on others review here) that I was getting the older formula.  Well I was wrong.  The newer bottle (and formula) has a &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; added to the name.  So the bottle states &amp;#34;moisturizing lotion +&amp;#34; . . . and that is what I got in the mail today.  Two bottles of the newer formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer formula is ok, but I really really liked the older version of this lotion.  &amp;#34;The moisturizing lotion +&amp;#34; feels a little greasier and leaves my skin feeling slightly oily, where as before my skin would just suck up the old lotion and it would not feel so greasy to the touch afterwards.  This is just my experience and opinion with my particular skin type.  I have been using this lotion (older version) on and off for about 20 years, so I am a little bummed that they changed it . . .oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time trying to buy the older bottles on here (amazon) rather then just going to my local department sore . . . . but anyone who is in the same boat I am, and looking to find the older bottle, should probably shop else where.  If you just want to pick up some Clinique lotion, but don&#x27;t care if it is the older bottle or the new one, then I guess this seller is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kinds sucks that they charge $4.95 per item for shipping and don&#x27;t give an option to combine shipping cost, but I knew that going into the purchase, just would have been a nice option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles themselves looks like they were bought at a department store and then sold here . . . . (had a Bloomingdale&#x27;s return receipt right on the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, I will probably not buy from this seller in the future. Not so much that the seller did anything wrong, but because I think I can find this lotion cheaper from other sellers or in the store with out having to pay for the shipping . . .</li>
            <li> The lotion is great, and what I wanted, but the bottle that came was NOT A PUMP AS PICTURED. It is just a regular screw off cap, which is really frustrating.</li>
            <li> I returned it because I hate this new lotion!  Whatever they added makes my face feel sticky.  They should have added it as a 3rd lotion in their line.  I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star, but that&#x27;s the only way I could write a review.</li>
            <li> i love your cute notes! the products r good though!  i will buy them next time~ and i will told my friends~</li>
            <li> excellent quality and soft for my skin</li>
