            <li>Definitely a must have for natural hair care!</li>
            <li>We both have dry frizzy hair, mine is thin and her is alot more thicker.</li>
            <li>First off, there is no way it can weigh your hair down because it makes it dry and sticky.</li>

            <li> First off, there is no way it can weigh your hair down because it makes it dry and sticky.</li>
            <li> I put a little drop of that billion hair potion in my bangs (because they were buy one get one free)  way worse.</li>
            <li> But if you read the back of this product, it has no oils other than carrot oil???</li>
            <li> I apply it daily or every other day, depending on how dry my hair is.</li>
            <li> Not real Amla oil.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick, but you only need a little on your hair, and it&#x27;s actually lite.</li>
            <li> My edges had virtually disappeared due to over braiding and tension.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually thick dry and brittle .</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> After washing my hair I put a few drops in my palm, combed through and blow dryed.</li>
            <li> I mix Jamaican Black Castor Oil in mine and use it at least twice a week on my hair and my daughters hair as well.</li>
            <li> I failed to read the back for the ingriedents, I must have been in a rush.</li>
            <li> Omg..I&#x27;m so mad.</li>
            <li> I hate it when a product is hyped up, expensive and turns out to be trash.</li>
            <li> product is horrible!</li>
            <li> Of all the oils I have ever tried this has been the worst!</li>

            <li> I love this oil, it smells wonderful and it leaves my hair so soft. The oil is thick, but you only need a little on your hair, and it&#x27;s actually lite. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair doen.</li>

            <li> love it it keeps my hair shiny and soft , it made my hair  condition much better</li>
            <li> This is all toxic garbage. Not real Amla oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is very light. It also gives my hair a good shine without weighing it down. I apply it daily or every other day, depending on how dry my hair is. I love this product and the smell. I recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for an oil that is weightless and applies shine.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it. So moisturizing. I definitely recommend this oil. I use it every night, I have the condition I need the shampoo now</li>
            <li> has helped with dryness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about a month and it has worked great for me.My hair is usually thick dry and brittle . Now I have soft manageable hair. I just bought the shampoo and conditioner and night wrap cream.</li>
            <li> I love it. Makes my natural hair feel great!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. first heard about it on Dr Oz and I use it everywhere now my hair face body it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> Omg..I&#x27;m so mad. I hate it when a product is hyped up, expensive and turns out to be trash. I am black, 3c/4a hair natural, it is long and fine. First off, there is no way it can weigh your hair down because it makes it dry and sticky. I tried coming through it and it just started to snap and break off. The comb just drags thru like glue. To top that of. I put a little drop of that billion hair potion in my bangs (because they were buy one get one free)  way worse. It leaves a sticky white reside. I am going to pray, wash this out, and never use it again.</li>
            <li> i saw this on TV and liked it so I decided to purchase the oil first. Its just ok has a odor to it and wont be ordering anymore. I rather use coconut oil</li>
            <li> It does the job, my hair is soft, and it is helping control the breakage. I will continue to use Amla Oil, and ordering it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This oil does the job that I needed to help bring my hair back to life. It is rich, lite and smells good. I will be using&lt;br /&gt;this oil forever.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday it&#x27;s so light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This one seemed diluted with something else maybe olive oil or something else because I used the product before and it had a different feel in my hair, density and look.</li>
            <li> You would think looking at this bottle and reading indian amla oil, Wow! this must be amazing, NOT! I failed to read the back for the ingriedents, I must have been in a rush. But if you read the back of this product, it has no oils other than carrot oil??? Where is the indian oil??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is horrible! I hair african american 2c hair and my daughter has 3b hair. We both have dry frizzy hair, mine is thin and her is alot more thicker. This product sits on top of the hair weighing it down! Of all the oils I have ever tried this has been the worst! It makes the hair frizzy and more dry. I won&#x27;t be purchasing  this anymore.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Its very light, nongreasy and has a light smell. After washing my hair I put a few drops in my palm, combed through and blow dryed. After drying I applied a little more, perfect results! It left my hair soft and shiny!  I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS OIL!  Not only does it smell wonderful. A little bit goes a long way. My hair has bounced back from years of damage. It works great on my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> I so love this oil! It is very light, and smells great. I mix Jamaican Black Castor Oil in mine and use it at least twice a week on my hair and my daughters hair as well. My edges had virtually disappeared due to over braiding and tension. For many years it seemed as if they would never grow back in, even with me using the JBCO, but once I mixed the JBCO with Amla Legend Rejuvenating Oil, I have peach fuzz! I am so happy! Definitely a must have for natural hair care!</li>
