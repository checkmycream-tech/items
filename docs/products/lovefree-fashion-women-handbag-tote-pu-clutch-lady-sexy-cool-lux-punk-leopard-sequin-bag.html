            <li> This purse is amazing in person. The pictures do it no justice! It is the perfect size and fits ALL of my necessities. Still need to use it a little longer to be sure, but possibly my new favorite purse!</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful, but cheep at the same time. Flimsy and thin. My zipper was stuck the moment I got it. The seller was great.</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> Beautiful but made of plastic.</li>
            <li> A great bag! Just enough sparkle, smells like real leather, which surprised me. Lots of room, but just the right size and shape, not too floppy. LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> This item was a bust..not as pictured..way small.  Was not the size that was described.  I am a grown women that needs stuff and size is for a child to carry crayons and tissue</li>
            <li> Not what I expected really. It&#x27;s not ugly and I do like it alright.</li>
            <li> Cute bag, but a handle is not attached at all on one end. Instead of the hassle of returning I will glue myself but am disappointed.</li>
            <li> The material was so cheap.  Everything about the bag looks fake and super cheap.  I would not recommend this bag to anyone.  I feel bad that I did not have the time to put into returning this product.  The bag I received looks nothing like the picture.  The quality of this bag is very thin material and just does not look like the bag in the picture.  Last time I am ordering a bag from the internet.</li>
            <li> Looks great in the picture but wound never have bouts it had I seen it in real life.  It&#x27;s stiff broken and awful.  All the zippers were broke,  the cheetah print on the back doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture and it&#x27;s a solid block so if you like the slouch look in the photo,  your not getting it.  Seriously don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
