            <li>LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!</li>
            <li>CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li>This hair brush is also great for traveling because it is so lightweight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>For me this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush that works well and does not hurt your scalp.  </li>
            <li>Great brush</li>
            <li>While this is eventually going to be great, for now it is a bit of a problem because of tangles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great for that.</li>
            <li>works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt on tangled hair&lt;</li>
            <li>The paddle part of this brush is great and functions as promised.  </li>
            <li>Great for detangling and for styling.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice product and great price.  </li>
            <li>However with this brush it is very easy and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>:-P</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s magic in this brush or not, but it is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I&#x27;d recommend this to any who have struggled with the hair in regards to tangles and the brushing out of the hair with the problem of losing a fair amount of hair in the process.</li>
            <li>a good amount of the blowdryer output will travel through the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Untangles</li>
            <li>Therefore a good chunk of it is in contact with the brush.</li>
            <li>Good Brush, I like that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a good paddle brush for blowdrying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It feels good on the head and in your hand.</li>
            <li>If you use a hair dryer and hold a hair brush, you will welcome and love that this brush is soooo lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>I got this brush and it has so helped with the frizz and static!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush!</li>
            <li>I love the quality too!</li>
            <li>and I love that!</li>
            <li>It is quite beautiful and made of a lightweight bamboo wood that will fit nicely in your hand.</li>
            <li>is a nice looking brush with coordinating colors of beige and brown.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I&#x27;d recommend this to any who have struggled with the hair in regards to tangles and the brushing out of the hair with the problem of losing a fair amount of hair in the process. :)</li>
            <li>It also has a nice handle and grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best detangling brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>so it is nice to have a brush that might help lessen any hair loss by pulling out hair that is snarled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is going to my bathroom before the teenager grabs it for her own.</li>
            <li>It has a nice look and feel.</li>
            <li>Something on the balls is catching on my hair.  </li>
            <li>All the eco brushes are kind to hair and work well</li>
            <li>Today I ordered her her own brush.  </li>
            <li>This attractive brush is wonderful for long and medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>I found this one at WM for $10 and am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have ALWAYS ripped out a bunch every morning after my shower when I combed it out before blowdrying it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My eight-year-old daughter, who has lots of hair, enjoys the brush very much and has taken it for her very own.</li>
            <li>Somehow my fine hair is catching on those bristles.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect brush for blow drying your hair super straight; the vents are perfectly sized to allow plenty of air flow and the paddle is wide/large enough to keep the section your brushing out from blowing around uncontrollably.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>brush that won&#x27;t rip your hair out, thus leading to &amp;#34;early onset hair loss.&amp;#34; :) Thus, when I saw this brush - since I have two - one for home, one for &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; - and both are seemingly &amp;#34;wearing down,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>:)g the day when it is dry/dried out, I&#x27;ve yet to have it happen when I couldn&#x27;t brush it out or that it was hard/painful/difficult/</li>
            <li>These teeth slip in between the hairs so much more.</li>
            <li>and I love it as a smoother.</li>
            <li>With most brushes, I just run a comb through to pull any hair out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still it seems to work better as a hairbrush for my longer hair.</li>
            <li>I have a favorite paddle brush that I have had for years</li>
            <li>This brush looked interesting because it does have vents</li>
            <li>Will look into more products by this company.</li>
            <li>and I love brushing my hair with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn’t shell out more than that for it, though.</li>
            <li>interesting.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it looks better once it dries if this is the brush I use.</li>
            <li>Sometimes she&#x27;s working them in more than getting them</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;d prefer a more multi-purpose brush.</li>
            <li>I love using a paddle brush for blow outs because my hair is a wavy</li>
            <li>Five stars for sure.</li>
            <li>When I received the brush, I was even more sceptical.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and detangles even the most stubborn knots.</li>
            <li>Would love grooves or something to offer a better grip.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for very long hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent to dry and straighten hair and helps with frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to do a better job detangling the fine hairs at the nape of my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush works, but it doesn&#x27;t work as great as our old brush, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like this brush because I have purchased other Ecotools products (sold at Walgreens) and haven&#x27;t been impressed.  </li>
            <li>most days I’m wrestling with significantly fewer tangles.</li>
            <li>I have owned other paddle brushes but this one is especially nice.  </li>
            <li>easily</li>
            <li>It glides through beautifully and is pretty gentle - my hair didn&#x27;t get caught on the bristles.  </li>
            <li>and it is very quick to eliminate frizz and any knots in the hair.</li>
            <li>I have hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and to handle</li>
            <li>I like the handle as it is easy to hold on to</li>
            <li>Actually, I liked it so much, I asked her if I could have it!</li>
            <li>So if you are very Eco and earth friendly, you will feel good about this product.  </li>
            <li>and it still looks as good as new.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush, my mom liked it so much, she bought one too!</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine and shoulder length</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this brush if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;Maraika, St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines</li>
            <li>This brush has a huge head-</li>
            <li>handle looks like it is made of wood and fits comfortably in the hand.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it was easy to clean my daughter&#x27;s hair out of it after she gave it to me.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t pull at hair.</li>
            <li>handle is comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>With a wife and two daughters with shoulder-length or longer hair this seemed like a great idea to ease some of the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that sometimes occurs on mornings when tangled hair is being brushed out.  </li>
            <li>It is light</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the ability to detangle my hair without ripping it out.</li>
            <li>I suppose that I should mention that this is made of Eco materials, a bamboo handle which is comfortable to hold and capped rounded bristles.  </li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I need to find a smooth bristled brush.  </li>
            <li>Great brush but broke after only 3 months.</li>
            <li>This is not promoted as a kid brush, but it is fabulous for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Ecotools Brush also feels like an indulgence against the scalp since the bristles are soft and comfy and offer a good massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was particularly excited to try this detangler padder brush because my daughter increasingly wants to do her own hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like spending this much money on a brush, but my hair comes out very easily when I brush it</li>
            <li>I wish that this worked as great on my easily tangled hair as it did for other people</li>
            <li>this brush is great for very long hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I clean brushes with baking soda in water to remove any built up oil</li>
            <li>but there are no hints or directions on how to clean this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this Ecotools Smooth Detangler Paddle Brush gets the snarls out quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>I have definitely found a wonderful replacement for my old brush, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase something else made by this company because of the quality of this item.</li>
            <li>My stylist led me to believe there was a special knack for using a paddle brush</li>
            <li>Really helps the static and frizz with my hair.</li>
            <li>Ecotools brush is a good product that will probably last for years.</li>
            <li>, I gave this brush a fair shake, using it daily</li>
            <li>it had a nice soft feel in your hair.  </li>
            <li>, this one seems to only be good for detangling...</li>
            <li>This is a great brush for my fine thin VERY EASILY tangly hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about blowing my hair dry if it will still look okay drying on its own.</li>
            <li>This light, vented brush glides through fine, straight hair with ease.</li>
            <li>; I figured I could look into obtaining another, newer, [hopefully] better brush that wouldn&#x27;t take out all of my hair when I tried to brush it - for lack of a better term/phrasing - though I brush like how one is &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to, starting at the end and working my way</li>
            <li>This company is really trying to be conscious about their materials, and they have also made a really good brush.  </li>
            <li>I also love that this brush is incredibly light weight, is easy to clean/remove trapped hair and it doesn&#x27;t induce static in dry/cold air.  </li>
            <li>First of all it is huge</li>
            <li>The brush is VERY lightweight and would be great for those who have long hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good and just as soft as my natural bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li>Every one had their own specific flaws</li>
            <li>It truly is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>and although I still have my other paddle brush, this one is a good replacement</li>
            <li>I love pretty much everything about this brush, the feel of the handle in my hand is very comfortable, it is not heavy and it glides easily though my very coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li>Brushes are brushes right?</li>
            <li>The bamboo handle is just the right size and shape, and I appreciate the company using recycled materials in the brush and the packaging.</li>
            <li>The brush has a very large head of bristles.</li>
            <li>we first got this brush, we tried it on freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked this brush so much that it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used on her hair for the month since I purchased it.</li>
            <li>This is a sturdy brush with a great wooden handle that works great for our daughter who has extremely fine hair that tangles mercilessly.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for me to really love a brush.</li>
            <li>Still, that isn&#x27;t enough to deter me from thoroughly enjoying and appreciating the brush</li>
            <li>when the spacing of the bristles - as proportionately spread out as they are and well-suited for a [more] grown individual - would seem disproportionately ill-fitting for a kid.</li>
            <li>Still, that isn&#x27;t enough to deter me from thoroughly enjoying and appreciating the brush</li>
            <li>when the spacing of the bristles - as proportionately spread out as they are and well-suited for a [more] grown individual - would seem disproportionately ill-fitting for a kid.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the funny thing.</li>
            <li>and it has many slits in the back</li>
            <li>This brush is my favorite brush in the entire world.</li>
            <li>This brush is much better in that department than others I&#x27;ve tried with similar bristles.  </li>
            <li>I wish to use more ecotool products in the future</li>
            <li>, the paddle of this brush is much larger than most cheapo brushes I’ve seen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty amazed by it.</li>
            <li>and the width is great if your hair is like mine and thick.</li>
            <li>I liked using it on wet hair after showering.</li>
            <li>Actually does reduce static, too.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I read the description for the Ecotools Smooth Detangler Brush with more than a little scepticism.</li>
            <li>Has an actual super nice handle that I can actually grip onto!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Granted, there have been times when my hair was REALLY short, and I didn&#x27;t need to worry as much, but for the greater part, it has been about shoulder-length or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 7 yr old san has been using it in his bathroom and it does a good job of styling his wet hair.</li>
            <li>for long fuller hair will work better.</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I have long hair and it did gently detangle , was light and did an nice job of working through a day of long hair.  </li>
            <li>recognize that the bristles aren&#x27;t super soft, but I don&#x27;t think they hurt the scalp.</li>
            <li>It is rather large and can brush a lot of hair at one time.</li>
            <li>so I certainly had nothing to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like truly BRUSH with this particular brush!</li>
            <li>Certainly, I would never have considered buying it at the store for that very reason.</li>
            <li>hair is over 3 feet long is SUPER TANGLY and SUPER TICK.</li>
            <li>This is impressive since I’ve struggled with thyroid and other health issues for a while that have left my long, straight hair in a state of disarray.</li>
            <li>on this brush - they feel great on my scalp and seem a little firmer than those on the smaller detangler brushes I have.</li>
            <li>In general, though, I love the large size, which is great for my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>If so, not by much.</li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to complain as much when I brush out her snarls with this brush.</li>
            <li>much.</li>
            <li>It actually almost makes me enjoy and look forward to brushing my hair.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any real comparison against anything else to make hence 4/5.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker than most, but as I have aged it has lost some of that depth that it had,</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I hit the snooze button too much not to appreciate any time saving method.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really the \\&quot;cusion\\&quot; part that makes the difference.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>WAS JUST O-U-T-R-A-E-G-O-U-S especially for something that was made so cheaply</li>
            <li>Very disapointed.</li>
            <li>This really gets my tangles out without pulling too much</li>
            <li>I have never found a brush this good at untangling my thick wavy hair that didn&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
            <li>do, almost wonder at times, if there might be the same kind, only smaller, for, this particular brush seems perfect for an adolescent aged individual up to an adult, but for kids?????</li>

            <li>My husband, my son and I all have long hair, so we get a variety of tanlges, despite how we care for our hair (particularly my son who has fine-textured hair, but also a very full head of hair).</li>
            <li>And since the Mercier brush was working well I was worried about using this brush but most of my other brushes are paddle brush</li>
            <li>so it does look a bit cheap in that regard, but overall, this is a high quality brush.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>and I like the vents as you can blow dry your hair easily while brushing.  </li>
            <li>The plastic on the bristles, and the plastic around the outside of the brush paddle, don&#x27;t create new tangles for me, but they don&#x27;t help smooth them out either.</li>
            <li>though the brush is wide, it is very lightweight and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Can use easily with wet hair, I also use leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>I tried regular paddle brushes, different combs, bore brushes, and even dryer sheets to fix the frizz and static but all results were temporary if that.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the brush not only detangles, but with such a fat surface, detangles super-fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I detangle while wet with a comb and immediately smooth through with this brush, which is really helpful for ponytails and clumping my strands.</li>
            <li>I have a brush with similar bristles and it did nothing to help me detangle quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried but the combs were leaving me a static mess</li>
            <li>prolonged high heat that some dryers put out can ruin the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot use it in the shower, bath or soak the handle.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was a little dubious about this Ecotools Smooth Detangler Paddle Brush at first glance.</li>
            <li>My other brush stays on the surface of my hair and i can pull it through from the roots just fine.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this very beautiful and large brush is a bit stiff and doesn&#x27;t simply glide through the hair - as evidenced by the collection it quickly accumulates.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are uniquely positioned in the center so that you don&#x27;t end up tearing your hair out.  </li>
            <li>Combs through without creating new tangles.</li>
            <li>daughter, who loves to try new things, doesn&#x27;t even want to use this brush anymore.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product because I have been looking for a new brush that will help not only detangle my hair but to help put some body back into it when I brush.  </li>
            <li>and although this brush is rather big, I was able to style my hair and in a shorter time due to the vents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sometimes had problems in the past with this sort of bristle- plastic, with a rounded top.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t detangle any better than the brush I currently use, but I think this is due to the width.</li>
            <li>However, traditional paddle brushes get really hot and don&#x27;t allow for hair flow (making the drying process take longer).  </li>
            <li>Surprised!</li>
            <li>I love the very firm bristles (is that what you call them?)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s made of super cheap plastic and has a super awkward handle.</li>
            <li>only drawback is the bristles can draw an &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; because of their stiffness&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a much better than average hair brush</li>
            <li>Nice long bristles that so far seem to be holding up really well, and can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li>The brush is well made and should last a while which is a positive aspect of the product.</li>
            <li>; that I have is that because the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; of the brush are so spread out and arranged as they are, unless you have OOBERLY THICK hair, it makes pulling the hair back - say, for a bun, ponytail, or in general to get out of the face to pull/pin back - a bit more challenging and (at least for me) doesn&#x27;t always quite capture all of the hair as easily as I&#x27;d like....</li>
            <li>; that I have is that because the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; of the brush are so spread out and arranged as they are, unless you have OOBERLY THICK hair, it makes pulling the hair back - say, for a bun, ponytail, or in general to get out of the face to pull/pin back - a bit more challenging and (at least for me) doesn&#x27;t always quite capture all of the hair as easily as I&#x27;d like....</li>
            <li>plastic bristles are spaced far apart which allows the bristles to move effortlessly through the hair.</li>
            <li>Each bristle is capped with a smooth round ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is getting old and it does not have vents.  </li>
            <li>It’s plastic and lightweight, so I couldn’t help but think, “Is this really going to be any different than the brushes I can buy at the dollar store?”</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to have as much breakage and hair left in the brush after using it.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it does - the thing just glided through my hair and I am not seeing nearly the amount of hair loss that I see with my old brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush is  larger ( the head is 3&amp;#34; by 5&amp;#34;) that the average hairbrush, and at times rather unwieldy but all in all I think this is a useful product.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I got the $15 Michel Mercier detangling brush for thick hair and while I do like that brush for truly painless detangling</li>
            <li>This brush flies right through wet hair.  </li>
            <li>By the time it&#x27;s dry it can look pretty...</li>
            <li>Also, there aren&#x27;t a ton of bristles and they are spaced out differently than normal brushes which means it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your hair instead of a comb.</li>
            <li>Today I tried it on her dry hair first thing in the morning, and it was the same thing--no more crying!  </li>
            <li>I still lose hair during brushing like I do with my old brush, so I’m skeptical about the claim that this brush detangles more gently than others, but at the same time, detangling doesn’t really hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush also seems to leave more static behind on my dry hair than any of my other brushes, which is why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
            <li>main reason that I selected this brush for review was because of the detangling claim, but it was very ineffective compared to the other brushes that we have in the house.</li>
            <li>I love using a big paddle brush for my hair versus the big round brush because it is easier and faster to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>It works a little better on wet hair</li>
            <li>I have long (down to the middle of my back), fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>it really cuts through tangles with out much of a struggle and I use it as my everyday go to brush now.</li>
            <li>, it seems like it would be such a challenge to be able to use it and use it effectively on such a small head,</li>
            <li>, it seems like it would be such a challenge to be able to use it and use it effectively on such a small head,</li>
            <li>I was having major issues before I had this brush.</li>
            <li>For my daughter, I think the plastic made it more difficult to work out the tangles, as too much of it is exposed and serves a function in holding the brush together, but not in actually brushin.</li>
            <li>U have long wavy hair and normally lots of tangles.</li>
            <li>any case, I&#x27;ve gone through brush after brush, and have even broken one or two (or maybe more</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably not any worse than most others out there, so</li>
            <li>and I find this brush just does not get down to the very roots of my hair as easily as my old brush with a thinner head but with deeper bristles.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately for her, she has a very sensitive scalp as well so most brushes are torturous.  </li>
            <li>In our house, we have all kinds of hair types: long &amp; wavy, long &amp; straight, thick, fine...</li>
            <li>and this brush is gentle and doesnt rip out my hair like other brushes.</li>
            <li>However, what I don&#x27;t like that much is that the head is quite wide but the bristles are not as long as my old brush.  </li>
            <li>That ripping is particularly an issue on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I have my daughter to thank for this little miracle as she bought hers first and then told me about it.  </li>
            <li>The head of the brush is wide which is a little much to handle any blow drying beyond straight styles though.</li>
            <li>I have a 3 year old with long curly hair and have literally purchased every &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; brush out there.</li>
            <li>I also disliked the amount of hair left in the brush even though I am very gentle in plying it to hair.</li>
            <li>She says the bristles are very hard and do not feel comfortable on one&#x27;s scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I wash it, I normally separate it into sections and brush out one section at a time simply because the tangles prevent any other option.</li>

            <li> BEST BRUSH</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!</li>
            <li> CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is also great for traveling because it is so lightweight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> For me this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush that works well and does not hurt your scalp.  </li>
            <li> Great brush</li>
            <li> While this is eventually going to be great, for now it is a bit of a problem because of tangles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great for that.</li>
            <li> works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt on tangled hair&lt;</li>
            <li> The paddle part of this brush is great and functions as promised.  </li>
            <li> Great for detangling and for styling.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice product and great price.  </li>
            <li> However with this brush it is very easy and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> :-P</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s magic in this brush or not, but it is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I&#x27;d recommend this to any who have struggled with the hair in regards to tangles and the brushing out of the hair with the problem of losing a fair amount of hair in the process.</li>
            <li> a good amount of the blowdryer output will travel through the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Untangles</li>
            <li> Therefore a good chunk of it is in contact with the brush.</li>
            <li> Good Brush, I like that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a good paddle brush for blowdrying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It feels good on the head and in your hand.</li>
            <li> If you use a hair dryer and hold a hair brush, you will welcome and love that this brush is soooo lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush!</li>
            <li> I got this brush and it has so helped with the frizz and static!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!</li>
            <li> I love the quality too!</li>
            <li> and I love that!</li>
            <li> It is quite beautiful and made of a lightweight bamboo wood that will fit nicely in your hand.</li>
            <li> is a nice looking brush with coordinating colors of beige and brown.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I&#x27;d recommend this to any who have struggled with the hair in regards to tangles and the brushing out of the hair with the problem of losing a fair amount of hair in the process. :)</li>
            <li> It also has a nice handle and grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best detangling brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> so it is nice to have a brush that might help lessen any hair loss by pulling out hair that is snarled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is going to my bathroom before the teenager grabs it for her own.</li>
            <li> It has a nice look and feel.</li>
            <li> Something on the balls is catching on my hair.  </li>
            <li> All the eco brushes are kind to hair and work well</li>
            <li> Today I ordered her her own brush.  </li>
            <li> This attractive brush is wonderful for long and medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I found this one at WM for $10 and am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have ALWAYS ripped out a bunch every morning after my shower when I combed it out before blowdrying it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My eight-year-old daughter, who has lots of hair, enjoys the brush very much and has taken it for her very own.</li>
            <li> Somehow my fine hair is catching on those bristles.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for blow drying your hair super straight; the vents are perfectly sized to allow plenty of air flow and the paddle is wide/large enough to keep the section your brushing out from blowing around uncontrollably.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> brush that won&#x27;t rip your hair out, thus leading to &amp;#34;early onset hair loss.&amp;#34; :) Thus, when I saw this brush - since I have two - one for home, one for &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; - and both are seemingly &amp;#34;wearing down,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> :)g the day when it is dry/dried out, I&#x27;ve yet to have it happen when I couldn&#x27;t brush it out or that it was hard/painful/difficult/</li>
            <li> These teeth slip in between the hairs so much more.</li>
            <li> and I love it as a smoother.</li>
            <li> With most brushes, I just run a comb through to pull any hair out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still it seems to work better as a hairbrush for my longer hair.</li>
            <li> I have a favorite paddle brush that I have had for years</li>
            <li> This brush looked interesting because it does have vents</li>
            <li> Will look into more products by this company.</li>
            <li> and I love brushing my hair with it.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn’t shell out more than that for it, though.</li>
            <li> interesting.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it looks better once it dries if this is the brush I use.</li>
            <li> Sometimes she&#x27;s working them in more than getting them</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d prefer a more multi-purpose brush.</li>
            <li> I love using a paddle brush for blow outs because my hair is a wavy</li>
            <li> Five stars for sure.</li>
            <li> When I received the brush, I was even more sceptical.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and detangles even the most stubborn knots.</li>
            <li> Would love grooves or something to offer a better grip.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for very long hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent to dry and straighten hair and helps with frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to do a better job detangling the fine hairs at the nape of my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush works, but it doesn&#x27;t work as great as our old brush, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this brush because I have purchased other Ecotools products (sold at Walgreens) and haven&#x27;t been impressed.  </li>
            <li> most days I’m wrestling with significantly fewer tangles.</li>
            <li> I have owned other paddle brushes but this one is especially nice.  </li>
            <li> easily</li>
            <li> It glides through beautifully and is pretty gentle - my hair didn&#x27;t get caught on the bristles.  </li>
            <li> and it is very quick to eliminate frizz and any knots in the hair.</li>
            <li> I have hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and to handle</li>
            <li> I like the handle as it is easy to hold on to</li>
            <li> Actually, I liked it so much, I asked her if I could have it!</li>
            <li> So if you are very Eco and earth friendly, you will feel good about this product.  </li>
            <li> and it still looks as good as new.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush, my mom liked it so much, she bought one too!</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine and shoulder length</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this brush if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;Maraika, St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines</li>
            <li> This brush has a huge head-</li>
            <li> handle looks like it is made of wood and fits comfortably in the hand.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it was easy to clean my daughter&#x27;s hair out of it after she gave it to me.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t pull at hair.</li>
            <li> handle is comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> With a wife and two daughters with shoulder-length or longer hair this seemed like a great idea to ease some of the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that sometimes occurs on mornings when tangled hair is being brushed out.  </li>
            <li> It is light</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the ability to detangle my hair without ripping it out.</li>
            <li> I suppose that I should mention that this is made of Eco materials, a bamboo handle which is comfortable to hold and capped rounded bristles.  </li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> I need to find a smooth bristled brush.  </li>
            <li> Great brush but broke after only 3 months.</li>
            <li> This is not promoted as a kid brush, but it is fabulous for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Ecotools Brush also feels like an indulgence against the scalp since the bristles are soft and comfy and offer a good massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was particularly excited to try this detangler padder brush because my daughter increasingly wants to do her own hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending this much money on a brush, but my hair comes out very easily when I brush it</li>
            <li> I wish that this worked as great on my easily tangled hair as it did for other people</li>
            <li> this brush is great for very long hair.</li>
            <li> Normally I clean brushes with baking soda in water to remove any built up oil</li>
            <li> but there are no hints or directions on how to clean this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this Ecotools Smooth Detangler Paddle Brush gets the snarls out quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> I have definitely found a wonderful replacement for my old brush, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase something else made by this company because of the quality of this item.</li>
            <li> My stylist led me to believe there was a special knack for using a paddle brush</li>
            <li> Really helps the static and frizz with my hair.</li>
            <li> Ecotools brush is a good product that will probably last for years.</li>
            <li> , I gave this brush a fair shake, using it daily</li>
            <li> it had a nice soft feel in your hair.  </li>
            <li> , this one seems to only be good for detangling...</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for my fine thin VERY EASILY tangly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about blowing my hair dry if it will still look okay drying on its own.</li>
            <li> This light, vented brush glides through fine, straight hair with ease.</li>
            <li> ; I figured I could look into obtaining another, newer, [hopefully] better brush that wouldn&#x27;t take out all of my hair when I tried to brush it - for lack of a better term/phrasing - though I brush like how one is &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to, starting at the end and working my way</li>
            <li> This company is really trying to be conscious about their materials, and they have also made a really good brush.  </li>
            <li> I also love that this brush is incredibly light weight, is easy to clean/remove trapped hair and it doesn&#x27;t induce static in dry/cold air.  </li>
            <li> First of all it is huge</li>
            <li> The brush is VERY lightweight and would be great for those who have long hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels good and just as soft as my natural bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li> Every one had their own specific flaws</li>
            <li> It truly is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> and although I still have my other paddle brush, this one is a good replacement</li>
            <li> I love pretty much everything about this brush, the feel of the handle in my hand is very comfortable, it is not heavy and it glides easily though my very coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> Brushes are brushes right?</li>
            <li> The bamboo handle is just the right size and shape, and I appreciate the company using recycled materials in the brush and the packaging.</li>
            <li> The brush has a very large head of bristles.</li>
            <li> we first got this brush, we tried it on freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this brush so much that it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used on her hair for the month since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy brush with a great wooden handle that works great for our daughter who has extremely fine hair that tangles mercilessly.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for me to really love a brush.</li>
            <li> Still, that isn&#x27;t enough to deter me from thoroughly enjoying and appreciating the brush</li>
            <li> when the spacing of the bristles - as proportionately spread out as they are and well-suited for a [more] grown individual - would seem disproportionately ill-fitting for a kid.</li>

            <li> &#x27;s the funny thing.</li>
            <li> and it has many slits in the back</li>
            <li> This brush is my favorite brush in the entire world.</li>
            <li> This brush is much better in that department than others I&#x27;ve tried with similar bristles.  </li>
            <li> I wish to use more ecotool products in the future</li>
            <li> , the paddle of this brush is much larger than most cheapo brushes I’ve seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty amazed by it.</li>
            <li> and the width is great if your hair is like mine and thick.</li>
            <li> I liked using it on wet hair after showering.</li>
            <li> Actually does reduce static, too.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I read the description for the Ecotools Smooth Detangler Brush with more than a little scepticism.</li>
            <li> Has an actual super nice handle that I can actually grip onto!</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Granted, there have been times when my hair was REALLY short, and I didn&#x27;t need to worry as much, but for the greater part, it has been about shoulder-length or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old san has been using it in his bathroom and it does a good job of styling his wet hair.</li>
            <li> for long fuller hair will work better.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have long hair and it did gently detangle , was light and did an nice job of working through a day of long hair.  </li>
            <li> recognize that the bristles aren&#x27;t super soft, but I don&#x27;t think they hurt the scalp.</li>
            <li> It is rather large and can brush a lot of hair at one time.</li>
            <li> so I certainly had nothing to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like truly BRUSH with this particular brush!</li>
            <li> Certainly, I would never have considered buying it at the store for that very reason.</li>
            <li> hair is over 3 feet long is SUPER TANGLY and SUPER TICK.</li>
            <li> This is impressive since I’ve struggled with thyroid and other health issues for a while that have left my long, straight hair in a state of disarray.</li>
            <li> on this brush - they feel great on my scalp and seem a little firmer than those on the smaller detangler brushes I have.</li>
            <li> In general, though, I love the large size, which is great for my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> If so, not by much.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to complain as much when I brush out her snarls with this brush.</li>
            <li> much.</li>
            <li> It actually almost makes me enjoy and look forward to brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any real comparison against anything else to make hence 4/5.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker than most, but as I have aged it has lost some of that depth that it had,</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I hit the snooze button too much not to appreciate any time saving method.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really the \\&quot;cusion\\&quot; part that makes the difference.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> WAS JUST O-U-T-R-A-E-G-O-U-S especially for something that was made so cheaply</li>
            <li> Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> This really gets my tangles out without pulling too much</li>
            <li> I have never found a brush this good at untangling my thick wavy hair that didn&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
            <li> do, almost wonder at times, if there might be the same kind, only smaller, for, this particular brush seems perfect for an adolescent aged individual up to an adult, but for kids?????</li>

            <li> My husband, my son and I all have long hair, so we get a variety of tanlges, despite how we care for our hair (particularly my son who has fine-textured hair, but also a very full head of hair).</li>
            <li> And since the Mercier brush was working well I was worried about using this brush but most of my other brushes are paddle brush</li>
            <li> so it does look a bit cheap in that regard, but overall, this is a high quality brush.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> and I like the vents as you can blow dry your hair easily while brushing.  </li>
            <li> The plastic on the bristles, and the plastic around the outside of the brush paddle, don&#x27;t create new tangles for me, but they don&#x27;t help smooth them out either.</li>
            <li> though the brush is wide, it is very lightweight and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Can use easily with wet hair, I also use leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> I tried regular paddle brushes, different combs, bore brushes, and even dryer sheets to fix the frizz and static but all results were temporary if that.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the brush not only detangles, but with such a fat surface, detangles super-fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I detangle while wet with a comb and immediately smooth through with this brush, which is really helpful for ponytails and clumping my strands.</li>
            <li> I have a brush with similar bristles and it did nothing to help me detangle quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried but the combs were leaving me a static mess</li>
            <li> prolonged high heat that some dryers put out can ruin the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot use it in the shower, bath or soak the handle.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious about this Ecotools Smooth Detangler Paddle Brush at first glance.</li>
            <li> My other brush stays on the surface of my hair and i can pull it through from the roots just fine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this very beautiful and large brush is a bit stiff and doesn&#x27;t simply glide through the hair - as evidenced by the collection it quickly accumulates.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are uniquely positioned in the center so that you don&#x27;t end up tearing your hair out.  </li>
            <li> Combs through without creating new tangles.</li>
            <li> daughter, who loves to try new things, doesn&#x27;t even want to use this brush anymore.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product because I have been looking for a new brush that will help not only detangle my hair but to help put some body back into it when I brush.  </li>
            <li> and although this brush is rather big, I was able to style my hair and in a shorter time due to the vents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sometimes had problems in the past with this sort of bristle- plastic, with a rounded top.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t detangle any better than the brush I currently use, but I think this is due to the width.</li>
            <li> However, traditional paddle brushes get really hot and don&#x27;t allow for hair flow (making the drying process take longer).  </li>
            <li> Surprised!</li>
            <li> I love the very firm bristles (is that what you call them?)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s made of super cheap plastic and has a super awkward handle.</li>
            <li> only drawback is the bristles can draw an &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; because of their stiffness&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a much better than average hair brush</li>
            <li> Nice long bristles that so far seem to be holding up really well, and can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> The brush is well made and should last a while which is a positive aspect of the product.</li>
            <li> ; that I have is that because the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; of the brush are so spread out and arranged as they are, unless you have OOBERLY THICK hair, it makes pulling the hair back - say, for a bun, ponytail, or in general to get out of the face to pull/pin back - a bit more challenging and (at least for me) doesn&#x27;t always quite capture all of the hair as easily as I&#x27;d like....</li>

            <li> plastic bristles are spaced far apart which allows the bristles to move effortlessly through the hair.</li>
            <li> Each bristle is capped with a smooth round ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is getting old and it does not have vents.  </li>
            <li> It’s plastic and lightweight, so I couldn’t help but think, “Is this really going to be any different than the brushes I can buy at the dollar store?”</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to have as much breakage and hair left in the brush after using it.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does - the thing just glided through my hair and I am not seeing nearly the amount of hair loss that I see with my old brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush is  larger ( the head is 3&amp;#34; by 5&amp;#34;) that the average hairbrush, and at times rather unwieldy but all in all I think this is a useful product.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I got the $15 Michel Mercier detangling brush for thick hair and while I do like that brush for truly painless detangling</li>
            <li> This brush flies right through wet hair.  </li>
            <li> By the time it&#x27;s dry it can look pretty...</li>
            <li> Also, there aren&#x27;t a ton of bristles and they are spaced out differently than normal brushes which means it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your hair instead of a comb.</li>
            <li> Today I tried it on her dry hair first thing in the morning, and it was the same thing--no more crying!  </li>
            <li> I still lose hair during brushing like I do with my old brush, so I’m skeptical about the claim that this brush detangles more gently than others, but at the same time, detangling doesn’t really hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush also seems to leave more static behind on my dry hair than any of my other brushes, which is why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> main reason that I selected this brush for review was because of the detangling claim, but it was very ineffective compared to the other brushes that we have in the house.</li>
            <li> I love using a big paddle brush for my hair versus the big round brush because it is easier and faster to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> It works a little better on wet hair</li>
            <li> I have long (down to the middle of my back), fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> it really cuts through tangles with out much of a struggle and I use it as my everyday go to brush now.</li>
            <li> , it seems like it would be such a challenge to be able to use it and use it effectively on such a small head,</li>
            <li> , it seems like it would be such a challenge to be able to use it and use it effectively on such a small head,</li>
            <li> I was having major issues before I had this brush.</li>
            <li> For my daughter, I think the plastic made it more difficult to work out the tangles, as too much of it is exposed and serves a function in holding the brush together, but not in actually brushin.</li>
            <li> U have long wavy hair and normally lots of tangles.</li>
            <li> any case, I&#x27;ve gone through brush after brush, and have even broken one or two (or maybe more</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably not any worse than most others out there, so</li>
            <li> and I find this brush just does not get down to the very roots of my hair as easily as my old brush with a thinner head but with deeper bristles.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for her, she has a very sensitive scalp as well so most brushes are torturous.  </li>
            <li> In our house, we have all kinds of hair types: long &amp; wavy, long &amp; straight, thick, fine...</li>
            <li> and this brush is gentle and doesnt rip out my hair like other brushes.</li>
            <li> However, what I don&#x27;t like that much is that the head is quite wide but the bristles are not as long as my old brush.  </li>
            <li> That ripping is particularly an issue on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have my daughter to thank for this little miracle as she bought hers first and then told me about it.  </li>
            <li> The head of the brush is wide which is a little much to handle any blow drying beyond straight styles though.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old with long curly hair and have literally purchased every &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; brush out there.</li>
            <li> I also disliked the amount of hair left in the brush even though I am very gentle in plying it to hair.</li>
            <li> She says the bristles are very hard and do not feel comfortable on one&#x27;s scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I wash it, I normally separate it into sections and brush out one section at a time simply because the tangles prevent any other option.</li>
            <li> I usually brush it when it&#x27;s wet, and it seems to go through my hair like a hot knife going through a stick of butter!</li>
            <li> And I find that I don&#x27;t mind it out of the shower when my hair is still wet, but I prefer my old brush when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than a year and most of the zillions of bristles are broken on it</li>
            <li> This hair brush fits well in your hand and because it&#x27;s wood feels long lasting.</li>
            <li> and I like using it with my flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely helps dry my hair faster...</li>
            <li> but he was wrong, it is easy to use for drying your hair, even if you have longer hair.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping this brush would reduce the yank-factor, but, if anything, it aggravates the situation with the hard bristles.</li>
            <li> I got this for my granddaughter&#x27;s long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still try it, but I think it&#x27;s integrity was compramised, and I don&#x27;t think it will get thru my long think hair.</li>
            <li> No one, and I mean NO ONE, thought this brush felt gentle.</li>
            <li> Since I have fine, thin strands, I don’t necessarily need the extra bulk, but I point it out for those of you who have that thick head of hair</li>
            <li> I think this tool has reduced my blow dry time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t plan to use this as a blow dry paddle brush.</li>
            <li> so I can use it to dry my hair too -</li>
            <li> And I do think it helps my hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But combing on dry hair is another matter.</li>
            <li> when I tried it on dry hair, it made a lot of static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Since my hair is short, I went back to my tried-and-true round style brush, which gives me the results I desire the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair, I mean, I can brush my hair out SO FAST and there are NO tangles or remote traces where tangles can start to form!</li>
            <li> When it is dried, it has the potential to become a &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; of sorts.</li>
            <li> minus</li>
            <li> It is harder to get hairs out after you brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She likes the wide brush as it means fewer strokes&lt;br</li>
            <li> And in some ways it’s really not.</li>
            <li> But I often have time to just brush my hair once and rush to work with it still wet.</li>
            <li> And it even detangles wet hair.</li>
            <li> it is supposed to help detangle because of the wide bristles.  </li>
            <li> Especially for those of us with long hair who have to take at least 5-10 minutes to get the job done this is the hair brush for you.  </li>
            <li> should I decide to retire my other one-NOT.  </li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; about it other than its a well made plastic bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I used this brush instead of a comb on my wet hair and did not have one snag!  </li>
            <li> I have to say that me as a short and thin hair this brush doesnt work well on me, its too big and the brushes are too &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;maybe</li>
            <li> and I can dry my hair quicker and straighter than my round brush.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the Conair brush has a cushion base that provides a better feel when you&#x27;re trying to work through the snags and less plastic that gets in the way of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy and long enough to efficiently fully go through the thickness of my daughters hair and do not fall out like the thin metal bristles.</li>
            <li> It pulled my hair like none other!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also slightly bendy and flexible</li>
            <li> I have about half a dozen hairbrushes around the house</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Ecotools Brush for my daughter, who has long and thick hair, and it \\&quot;mysteriously\\&quot; ended up in my makeup receptacle.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly and kinky hair</li>
            <li> and I both have long, thick, curly hair and use both paddle brushes and detangling combs to comb and style in the mornings.</li>
            <li> This is because of the round plastic ends that have little balls on them - you cannot run a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because the back is open, there is no wonder about how dirty and moldy it might be inside</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is a hair stylist and is always telling me that I should comb my hair and that brushing is to harsh.</li>
            <li> but I have a comb, pick, and another small hairbrush I can use for that.</li>

            <li> No more ouches from my daughters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this design of brush works as well as it does, but she loves it.</li>
            <li> I usually use skinnier brushes.</li>
            <li> some since I was a kid, but it&#x27;s almost as if I hardly have to brush...</li>
            <li> I have a 25 year old Mason Pearson hairbrush and have become increasingly frustrated with the snarls and tangles</li>
            <li> I was amazed, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> My hair is quite thick</li>
            <li> I mean like we&#x27;re talking Hermione or Princess Diaries status here.</li>
            <li> Seriously: there is just something in the design that makes brushing my hair so.</li>
            <li> (I have seriously looked for one of these at Ulta for years).  </li>
            <li> so when it is dry it is virtually impossible to brush out.</li>
            <li> I do still use the Mercier brush for those incredibly nasty bird nest dreads that tend to happen on the back of my head but one that nasty is taken care of I go over it with this brush to smooth everything out.</li>
            <li> less painful.</li>
            <li> The bristles suck and well basically melt and shape themselves the wrong way.</li>
            <li> WTF:</li>
            <li> saw this brush and while skeptical, figured I had nothing to lose and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid of dropping it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really not impressed with it. :(</li>
            <li> With the Ecotools brush, working out tangles can be a bit painful.</li>

            <li> I love this brush! Definitely helps dry my hair faster...</li>
            <li> Can tell the differance after using this brush two times. Really helps the static and frizz with my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for me to really love a brush. Brushes are brushes right? No. My sister-in-law is a hair stylist and is always telling me that I should comb my hair and that brushing is to harsh. I&#x27;ve tried but the combs were leaving me a static mess and I just didn&#x27;t like it. I tried regular paddle brushes, different combs, bore brushes, and even dryer sheets to fix the frizz and static but all results were temporary if that. I got this brush and it has so helped with the frizz and static! Also, there aren&#x27;t a ton of bristles and they are spaced out differently than normal brushes which means it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your hair instead of a comb. Don&#x27;t plan on ever buying another!</li>
            <li> I think this tool has reduced my blow dry time. If so, not by much. I have thick, long, curly hair. I&#x27;m always looking for a speedier alternative. My daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to complain as much when I brush out her snarls with this brush. That&#x27;s a definite advantage!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that tangles easily and this brush is gentle and doesnt rip out my hair like other brushes. It&#x27;s also slightly bendy and flexible that I think helps with not tearing your hair. Love this.</li>
            <li> This lightweight yet solidly constructed detangler brush painlessly works its way through tangles.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic bristles are spaced far apart which allows the bristles to move effortlessly through the hair. Each bristle is capped with a smooth round ball.&lt;br /&gt;The handle looks like it is made of wood and fits comfortably in the hand. The brush part has slits which enable air to pass through.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice looking brush with coordinating colors of beige and brown.&lt;br /&gt;The Ecotools brush is a good product that will probably last for years.</li>
            <li> I threw it away. It pulled my hair like none other!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL brush for 4a hair, detangling made easier and faster! Best brush ever.....telling all my curl friends.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t plan to use this as a blow dry paddle brush. The bristles suck and well basically melt and shape themselves the wrong way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick, CURLY hair since I was a child, and, when it&#x27;s wet, it gets REALLY curly, and REALLY TANGLED. When it is dried, it has the potential to become a &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; of sorts. Thus, all my life, I&#x27;ve always had the struggle of trying to not only &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it, but to perform even the &amp;#34;simplest&amp;#34; of tasks to brush it out.&lt;br /&gt;*Granted, there have been times when my hair was REALLY short, and I didn&#x27;t need to worry as much, but for the greater part, it has been about shoulder-length or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;ve gone through brush after brush, and have even broken one or two (or maybe more....I can&#x27;t remember) and it&#x27;s always been struggle to find that &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; brush that won&#x27;t rip your hair out, thus leading to &amp;#34;early onset hair loss.&amp;#34; :) Thus, when I saw this brush - since I have two - one for home, one for &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; - and both are seemingly &amp;#34;wearing down,&amp;#34; I figured I could look into obtaining another, newer, [hopefully] better brush that wouldn&#x27;t take out all of my hair when I tried to brush it - for lack of a better term/phrasing - though I brush like how one is &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to, starting at the end and working my way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what it is about this brush, and maybe my hair had &amp;#34;thinned&amp;#34; some since I was a kid, but it&#x27;s almost as if I hardly have to brush...like truly BRUSH with this particular brush! It&#x27;s incredible. Whether I start at the ends and work my way up, or if I start at the roots...my hair, I mean, I can brush my hair out SO FAST and there are NO tangles or remote traces where tangles can start to form! I usually brush it when it&#x27;s wet, and it seems to go through my hair like a hot knife going through a stick of butter! Seriously: there is just something in the design that makes brushing my hair so. much. easier. It actually almost makes me enjoy and look forward to brushing my hair. Even if I want to &#x27;brush it out&#x27; at some point during the day when it is dry/dried out, I&#x27;ve yet to have it happen when I couldn&#x27;t brush it out or that it was hard/painful/difficult/didn&#x27;t work well/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; that I have is that because the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; of the brush are so spread out and arranged as they are, unless you have OOBERLY THICK hair, it makes pulling the hair back - say, for a bun, ponytail, or in general to get out of the face to pull/pin back - a bit more challenging and (at least for me) doesn&#x27;t always quite capture all of the hair as easily as I&#x27;d like....but I have a comb, pick, and another small hairbrush I can use for that. Still, that isn&#x27;t enough to deter me from thoroughly enjoying and appreciating the brush itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, almost wonder at times, if there might be the same kind, only smaller, for, this particular brush seems perfect for an adolescent aged individual up to an adult, but for kids????? I would say this is almost TOO big, for, it seems like it would be such a challenge to be able to use it and use it effectively on such a small head, when the spacing of the bristles - as proportionately spread out as they are and well-suited for a [more] grown individual - would seem disproportionately ill-fitting for a kid. (I hope that makes sense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;d recommend this to any who have struggled with the hair in regards to tangles and the brushing out of the hair with the problem of losing a fair amount of hair in the process. :)g the day when it is dry/dried out, I&#x27;ve yet to have it happen when I couldn&#x27;t brush it out or that it was hard/painful/difficult/didn&#x27;t work well/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; that I have is that because the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; of the brush are so spread out and arranged as they are, unless you have OOBERLY THICK hair, it makes pulling the hair back - say, for a bun, ponytail, or in general to get out of the face to pull/pin back - a bit more challenging and (at least for me) doesn&#x27;t always quite capture all of the hair as easily as I&#x27;d like....but I have a comb, pick, and another small hairbrush I can use for that.

            <li> I ordered the Ecotools Brush for my daughter, who has long and thick hair, and it \\&quot;mysteriously\\&quot; ended up in my makeup receptacle. Actually, I liked it so much, I asked her if I could have it! I love the fact that the brush not only detangles, but with such a fat surface, detangles super-fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the brush is wide, it is very lightweight and easy to grip. Not to mention, it was easy to clean my daughter&#x27;s hair out of it after she gave it to me. Ecotools Brush also feels like an indulgence against the scalp since the bristles are soft and comfy and offer a good massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the funny thing. After a week, I am giving the brush back to my daughter. Since my hair is short, I went back to my tried-and-true round style brush, which gives me the results I desire the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist&lt;br /&gt;Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE&lt;br /&gt;Ace Blogger: WTF: Where&#x27;s the Faith, [...]</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and it has many slits in the back so I can use it to dry my hair too - a good amount of the blowdryer output will travel through the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Untangles easily but I recommend working it through from the ends anyway. My other brush stays on the surface of my hair and i can pull it through from the roots just fine. These teeth slip in between the hairs so much more. Therefore a good chunk of it is in contact with the brush. I found I had to amend the technique for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only minus -  this looked wooden but its all plastic. For the price I am NOT complaining, just FYI. This is not a wood or Bamboo brush.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush gets mixed reviews from our family. My wife does not recommend it. She says the bristles are very hard and do not feel comfortable on one&#x27;s scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that the bristles aren&#x27;t super soft, but I don&#x27;t think they hurt the scalp. Besides the brush is for detangling. It is rather large and can brush a lot of hair at one time. It also has a nice handle and grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eight-year-old daughter, who has lots of hair, enjoys the brush very much and has taken it for her very own.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best detangling brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  No more ouches from my daughters. Now that&#x27;s a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;Maraika, St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines</li>
            <li> The brush is VERY lightweight and would be great for those who have long hair.  If you use a hair dryer and hold a hair brush, you will welcome and love that this brush is soooo lightweight.  Especially for those of us with long hair who have to take at least 5-10 minutes to get the job done this is the hair brush for you.  This hair brush is also great for traveling because it is so lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is made of recycled aluminum and the packaging is all recycled paper.  So if you are very Eco and earth friendly, you will feel good about this product.  This company is really trying to be conscious about their materials, and they have also made a really good brush.  You could never tell that it was recycled!!!  Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle on this hair brush is the best thing about it too.  It is quite beautiful and made of a lightweight bamboo wood that will fit nicely in your hand.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy brush with a great wooden handle that works great for our daughter who has extremely fine hair that tangles mercilessly.  Unfortunately for her, she has a very sensitive scalp as well so most brushes are torturous.  I&#x27;m not sure why this design of brush works as well as it does, but she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for blow drying your hair super straight; the vents are perfectly sized to allow plenty of air flow and the paddle is wide/large enough to keep the section your brushing out from blowing around uncontrollably.  I also love that this brush is incredibly light weight, is easy to clean/remove trapped hair and it doesn&#x27;t induce static in dry/cold air.  The cushion area looks a bit concave so it does look a bit cheap in that regard, but overall, this is a high quality brush.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily since having received it and it still looks as good as new.</li>
            <li> This light, vented brush glides through fine, straight hair with ease. My 7 yr old san has been using it in his bathroom and it does a good job of styling his wet hair. Easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t pull at hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly and kinky hair and I love it as a smoother. I detangle while wet with a comb and immediately smooth through with this brush, which is really helpful for ponytails and clumping my strands. It glides through beautifully and is pretty gentle - my hair didn&#x27;t get caught on the bristles.  I wish I could detangle/smooth it all in one fell swoop, but that&#x27;s not the brush&#x27;s fault. :-P Bottom line: I recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I purchased this at Walmart not on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good Brush, I like that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a good paddle brush for blowdrying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any real comparison against anything else to make hence 4/5.</li>
            <li> Brush started falling apart after one week of use</li>
            <li> This brush is my favorite brush in the entire world. It feels like you&#x27;re massaging your scalp when you use it and it is very quick to eliminate frizz and any knots in the hair.</li>
            <li> This is a brush that gets the tangles out easier than regular hair brushes but is not fool proof. My hair is thicker than most, but as I have aged it has lost some of that depth that it had, so it is nice to have a brush that might help lessen any hair loss by pulling out hair that is snarled.&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is wider than any I have ever used. It is harder to get hairs out after you brush. With most brushes, I just run a comb through to pull any hair out. With this you have to pull out any hairs individually. This is because of the round plastic ends that have little balls on them - you cannot run a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good and just as soft as my natural bristle brushes.  It does seem to do a better job detangling the fine hairs at the nape of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;There are some cautions with it: prolonged high heat that some dryers put out can ruin the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot use it in the shower, bath or soak the handle. Normally I clean brushes with baking soda in water to remove any built up oil but there are no hints or directions on how to clean this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Still it seems to work better as a hairbrush for my longer hair.</li>
            <li> It actually does detangle. I was having major issues before I had this brush. Thanks</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush, my mom liked it so much, she bought one too!</li>
            <li> I got this for my granddaughter&#x27;s long hair&lt;br /&gt;She likes the wide brush as it means fewer strokes&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable to hold and she likes it being &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the bristles can draw an &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; because of their stiffness&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a much better than average hair brush</li>
            <li> In our house, we have all kinds of hair types: long &amp; wavy, long &amp; straight, thick, fine...you get the idea. No one, and I mean NO ONE, thought this brush felt gentle. In fact, I personally think this is one of the hardest brushes that I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason that I selected this brush for review was because of the detangling claim, but it was very ineffective compared to the other brushes that we have in the house. My husband, my son and I all have long hair, so we get a variety of tanlges, despite how we care for our hair (particularly my son who has fine-textured hair, but also a very full head of hair). I was really hoping this brush would reduce the yank-factor, but, if anything, it aggravates the situation with the hard bristles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this brush because I have purchased other Ecotools products (sold at Walgreens) and haven&#x27;t been impressed.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I love using a big paddle brush for my hair versus the big round brush because it is easier and faster to style my hair.  I have a favorite paddle brush that I have had for years but it is getting old and it does not have vents.  This brush looked interesting because it does have vents but it is made of wood and plastic, not metal.  I used it to style my hair which is short and although this brush is rather big, I was able to style my hair and in a shorter time due to the vents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, I am not that impressed with Ecotools products but I do like this brush and although I still have my other paddle brush, this one is a good replacement should I decide to retire my other one-NOT.  LOL</li>
            <li> I have hair that tangles easily and this Ecotools Smooth Detangler Paddle Brush gets the snarls out quickly and painlessly.  And it doesn&#x27;t even seem to pull any extra hair out!  I like the feel of the bristles on my scalp as well. And I do think it helps my hair dry faster. For me this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This brush has a huge head- it&#x27;s the biggest brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve sometimes had problems in the past with this sort of bristle- plastic, with a rounded top.  I&#x27;ve found that sort of bristle to rip at tangles.  This brush is much better in that department than others I&#x27;ve tried with similar bristles.  There&#x27;s still SOME ripping at tangles, which is why I gave this four instead of five stars.  That ripping is particularly an issue on wet hair.  In general, though, I love the large size, which is great for my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!! I like the way the bristles are angled .. This minimizes breakage !! I wish to use more ecotool products in the future</li>
            <li> The brush was smooshed from packing. I&#x27;ll still try it, but I think it&#x27;s integrity was compramised, and I don&#x27;t think it will get thru my long think hair.</li>
            <li> I have to say that me as a short and thin hair this brush doesnt work well on me, its too big and the brushes are too &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;maybe for long fuller hair will work better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I have very curly hair so when it is dry it is virtually impossible to brush out. However with this brush it is very easy and feels wonderful. I love the quality too!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product and great price.  This hair brush fits well in your hand and because it&#x27;s wood feels long lasting. Both my daughter and I have long hair and it did gently detangle , was light and did an nice job of working through a day of long hair.  This brush is going to my bathroom before the teenager grabs it for her own. Will look into more products by this company.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush that works well and does not hurt your scalp.  It is easy to hold and to handle and I love brushing my hair with it.  My stylist led me to believe there was a special knack for using a paddle brush but he was wrong, it is easy to use for drying your hair, even if you have longer hair.  Great brush and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It feels good on the head and in your hand. I would buy it again and it was $5.00 cheaper on amazon then at the store.</li>
            <li> I love the very firm bristles (is that what you call them?) on this brush - they feel great on my scalp and seem a little firmer than those on the smaller detangler brushes I have. The head of the brush is wide which is a little much to handle any blow drying beyond straight styles though. The brush also seems to leave more static behind on my dry hair than any of my other brushes, which is why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars. Otherwise, this is a great detangler!</li>
            <li> With a wife and two daughters with shoulder-length or longer hair this seemed like a great idea to ease some of the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that sometimes occurs on mornings when tangled hair is being brushed out.  Unfortunately, this very beautiful and large brush is a bit stiff and doesn&#x27;t simply glide through the hair - as evidenced by the collection it quickly accumulates.  It pulls and scratches and my girls complain it hurts.  It works a little better on wet hair but it&#x27;s probably not any worse than most others out there, so I&#x27;ll go with 3 stars even if it is a bit generous.</li>
            <li> It was just as my sister hoped it would be. She got it as a christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old with long curly hair and have literally purchased every &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; brush out there. Every one had their own specific flaws so I continued to search. I found this one at WM for $10 and am very happy with it so far. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; about it other than its a well made plastic bristle brush. The bristles are sturdy and long enough to efficiently fully go through the thickness of my daughters hair and do not fall out like the thin metal bristles. They also have &amp;#34;balled&amp;#34; coated tips so my daughter doesn&#x27;t complain of it being &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve liked this brush so much that it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used on her hair for the month since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious about this Ecotools Smooth Detangler Paddle Brush at first glance. It’s plastic and lightweight, so I couldn’t help but think, “Is this really going to be any different than the brushes I can buy at the dollar store?” And in some ways it’s really not. It’s got the same plastic bulbs at the end of each bristle that I know are going to break/wear off over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flipside, the paddle of this brush is much larger than most cheapo brushes I’ve seen. Since I have fine, thin strands, I don’t necessarily need the extra bulk, but I point it out for those of you who have that thick head of hair I’m so envious of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now all that said, I gave this brush a fair shake, using it daily and I have to admit, most days I’m wrestling with significantly fewer tangles. In turn, my hair is smoother and shinier too. This is impressive since I’ve struggled with thyroid and other health issues for a while that have left my long, straight hair in a state of disarray. I still lose hair during brushing like I do with my old brush, so I’m skeptical about the claim that this brush detangles more gently than others, but at the same time, detangling doesn’t really hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d recommend this Ecotools brush if you can find it for under $8. I probably wouldn’t shell out more than that for it, though.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It has a nice look and feel. It doesn&#x27;t detangle any better than the brush I currently use, but I think this is due to the width. I usually use skinnier brushes. I haven&#x27;t noticed that my hair dries any faster. But I often have time to just brush my hair once and rush to work with it still wet. By the time it&#x27;s dry it can look pretty... interesting. I have noticed that it looks better once it dries if this is the brush I use. I will continue to use this brush over my others for that reason alone. I hit the snooze button too much not to appreciate any time saving method. I don&#x27;t have to worry about blowing my hair dry if it will still look okay drying on its own.</li>
            <li> This brush does what it advertises: detangles. And it even detangles wet hair. I&#x27;m pretty amazed by it. Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for my fine thin VERY EASILY tangly hair. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> U have long wavy hair and normally lots of tangles. Brush works great! Very happy with purchase. Can use easily with wet hair, I also use leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> this brush is great for very long hair. it doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt your scalp. it had a nice soft feel in your hair.  and the width is great if your hair is like mine and thick.</li>
            <li> This attractive brush is wonderful for long and medium length hair.  Everyone has been trying to steal this away from me.  The bristles are uniquely positioned in the center so that you don&#x27;t end up tearing your hair out.  I have owned other paddle brushes but this one is especially nice.  It is light and I can dry my hair quicker and straighter than my round brush.</li>
            <li> My 7-year-old daughter and I both have long, thick, curly hair and use both paddle brushes and detangling combs to comb and style in the mornings. I was particularly excited to try this detangler padder brush because my daughter increasingly wants to do her own hair in the morning. While this is eventually going to be great, for now it is a bit of a problem because of tangles. Sometimes she&#x27;s working them in more than getting them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we first got this brush, we tried it on freshly washed hair. It&#x27;s really great for that. Combs through without creating new tangles. Bristles are solid and uniform, so they keep hair from getting frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But combing on dry hair is another matter. This brush works, but it doesn&#x27;t work as great as our old brush, [[ASIN:B001OHQWTG Conair Pro Hair Brush, Paddle, Cushion Base]]. I think it&#x27;s really the \\&quot;cusion\\&quot; part that makes the difference. With the Ecotools brush, working out tangles can be a bit painful. The plastic on the bristles, and the plastic around the outside of the brush paddle, don&#x27;t create new tangles for me, but they don&#x27;t help smooth them out either. For my daughter, I think the plastic made it more difficult to work out the tangles, as too much of it is exposed and serves a function in holding the brush together, but not in actually brushin. On the other hand, the Conair brush has a cushion base that provides a better feel when you&#x27;re trying to work through the snags and less plastic that gets in the way of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who loves to try new things, doesn&#x27;t even want to use this brush anymore. And I find that I don&#x27;t mind it out of the shower when my hair is still wet, but I prefer my old brush when my hair is dry and I actually need the detangler.</li>
            <li> I love pretty much everything about this brush, the feel of the handle in my hand is very comfortable, it is not heavy and it glides easily though my very coarse curly hair. I don&#x27;t seem to have as much breakage and hair left in the brush after using it. I really enjoy the ability to detangle my hair without ripping it out. I have definitely found a wonderful replacement for my old brush, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase something else made by this company because of the quality of this item.</li>
            <li> I liked using it on wet hair after showering. The brush is really big, and it&#x27;s vented. Detangles hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But when I tried it on dry hair, it made a lot of static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this one seems to only be good for detangling... It&#x27;s too big to use for styling, like I couldn&#x27;t use it to help put my hair into a ponytail. I guess I&#x27;d prefer a more multi-purpose brush.</li>
            <li> I have a 25 year old Mason Pearson hairbrush and have become increasingly frustrated with the snarls and tangles I get just trying to get my mane in order.  I also disliked the amount of hair left in the brush even though I am very gentle in plying it to hair. My hair is baby fine and shoulder length so you can see my problem.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this brush and while skeptical, figured I had nothing to lose and ordered it.  It does what it says it does - the thing just glided through my hair and I am not seeing nearly the amount of hair loss that I see with my old brush.  There isn&#x27;t any tugging or picking apart strands as I had to do before.  I suppose that I should mention that this is made of Eco materials, a bamboo handle which is comfortable to hold and capped rounded bristles.  The brush is  larger ( the head is 3&amp;#34; by 5&amp;#34;) that the average hairbrush, and at times rather unwieldy but all in all I think this is a useful product.  It has the added virtue on not costing 3 arms and 2 legs.</li>
            <li> Excellent for very long hair.  Does not rip or tear at the ends of your hair and cause split ends</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I love using a paddle brush for blow outs because my hair is a wavy and it seems to result in the best look for me.  However, traditional paddle brushes get really hot and don&#x27;t allow for hair flow (making the drying process take longer).  Finally, someone realized that you could combine the two (I have seriously looked for one of these at Ulta for years).  Actually does reduce static, too.  Five stars for sure.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product because I have been looking for a new brush that will help not only detangle my hair but to help put some body back into it when I brush.  I like the handle as it is easy to hold on to and I like the vents as you can blow dry your hair easily while brushing.  However, what I don&#x27;t like that much is that the head is quite wide but the bristles are not as long as my old brush.  My hair is quite thick and I find this brush just does not get down to the very roots of my hair as easily as my old brush with a thinner head but with deeper bristles.  The brush is well made and should last a while which is a positive aspect of the product.</li>
            <li> I read the description for the Ecotools Smooth Detangler Brush with more than a little scepticism. I have a brush with similar bristles and it did nothing to help me detangle quickly. I have long (down to the middle of my back), fine, straight hair. After I wash it, I normally separate it into sections and brush out one section at a time simply because the tangles prevent any other option. When I received the brush, I was even more sceptical. The brush has a very large head of bristles. Certainly, I would never have considered buying it at the store for that very reason. After using it, my scepticism turned into delight. Rather than a 15 minute ordeal, brushing out my hair took only five or six strokes. The bamboo handle is just the right size and shape, and I appreciate the company using recycled materials in the brush and the packaging. I recommend it for anyone with longer hair.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my daughter whose hair is getting longer and tangles are an issue. She really likes it. The bristles are big enough and spongy enough that it seems to make getting tangles out less painful. Very happy. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I got the $15 Michel Mercier detangling brush for thick hair and while I do like that brush for truly painless detangling I&#x27;ve had it less than a year and most of the zillions of bristles are broken on it, it&#x27;s made of super cheap plastic and has a super awkward handle. And for me, A STARVING ART COLLEGE STUDENT paying FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR A HAIRBRUSH WAS JUST O-U-T-R-A-E-G-O-U-S especially for something that was made so cheaply I was afraid of dropping it. Now THIS brush is great! Has an actual super nice handle that I can actually grip onto! Nice long bristles that so far seem to be holding up really well, and can be used wet or dry and I like using it with my flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is over 3 feet long is SUPER TANGLY and SUPER TICK. I mean like we&#x27;re talking Hermione or Princess Diaries status here. Brushing my hair is like a cowboy trying to lasso a tornado; it just don&#x27;t work. And since the Mercier brush was working well I was worried about using this brush but most of my other brushes are paddle brush so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, and I actually got it at Walmart for 7 bucks so I certainly had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not a &amp;#34;painless&amp;#34; detangler it really cuts through tangles with out much of a struggle and I use it as my everyday go to brush now. I do still use the Mercier brush for those incredibly nasty bird nest dreads that tend to happen on the back of my head but one that nasty is taken care of I go over it with this brush to smooth everything out.</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t care for this brush.  Now I wish I got something else.  First of all it is huge so it is cumbersome.  Second it is supposed to help detangle because of the wide bristles.  Somehow my fine hair is catching on those bristles.  The bristles don&#x27;t feel smooth.  They have a ball on the end of them.  Something on the balls is catching on my hair.  I need to find a smooth bristled brush.  I do not recommend this brush if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> works great, doesn&#x27;t hurt on tangled hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also because the back is open, there is no wonder about how dirty and moldy it might be inside</li>
            <li> Excellent to dry and straighten hair and helps with frizzy ends.  Surprised! Love this brush.  All the eco brushes are kind to hair and work well</li>
            <li> Best paddle brush I&#x27;ve bought, detangles hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending this much money on a brush, but my hair comes out very easily when I brush it and it gets all over the place.  Amazingly, only one or two strands come out when I use this brush, even when it feels as thought it is pulling.</li>
            <li> Great brush but broke after only 3 months. Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I wish that this worked as great on my easily tangled hair as it did for other people but I&#x27;m really not impressed with it. :(</li>
            <li> The best detailing brush I have ever used! Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and detangles even the most stubborn knots.</li>
            <li> This really gets my tangles out without pulling too much and I love that! I have never found a brush this good at untangling my thick wavy hair that didn&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s magic in this brush or not, but it is AWESOME!  I have about half a dozen hairbrushes around the house and they are all going into the trash.  I have very fine hair and have ALWAYS ripped out a bunch every morning after my shower when I combed it out before blowdrying it.  I used this brush instead of a comb on my wet hair and did not have one snag!  I was amazed, to say the least.  I have my daughter to thank for this little miracle as she bought hers first and then told me about it.  It truly is worth every penny.  I&#x27;m planning on purchasing another one to keep in the car or at work.  LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!</li>
            <li> The paddle part of this brush is great and functions as promised.  The handle, though, is sleek wood that can be slippery.  Would love grooves or something to offer a better grip.  Even with that, this is still the best vented brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Seems like it will last for years and years.  I&#x27;ve had others where the bristles fell off.  Don&#x27;t think that will happen here.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever used!  Great for detangling and for styling.  I am tossing my junky stuff and just using this from now on.  Update:  My 5-year-old daughter hates having her hair brushed.  We tried every brush you can think of, and none have been painless...until now.  I tried my brush on her wet hair and there was no crying over pulled hair and knots.  This brush flies right through wet hair.  Today I tried it on her dry hair first thing in the morning, and it was the same thing--no more crying!  This is not promoted as a kid brush, but it is fabulous for my daughter.  Today I ordered her her own brush.  BEST BRUSH I HAVE EVER USED!!!!!</li>
