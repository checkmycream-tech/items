            <li>Works good seperating your toes without any pain....soft and comfortable.......... too long deliver though but worth the wait.</li>

            <li>The gel is super soft and comfortable</li>
            <li>I got these because my great toe was actually starting to overlap over my second toe.  </li>
            <li>Had to cut the opening larger to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>Works great, exactly like the more expensive prime version, if you don&#x27;t mind waiting a bit longer for the shipping.</li>
            <li>So far they&#x27;re pretty comfortable and seem to be doing the job.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>The first wear one broke...</li>
            <li>This device is very comfortable to sleep with, more so than &amp;#34;Goodnight Bunion.&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t know how long it will last but for the price, it&#x27;s unbeatable.</li>
            <li>Feels so good on my big toe and keeps it from rubbing against the toe next to it.</li>
            <li>It is major hot and humid now, but the gel separators are still cool.  </li>

            <li>These work really well for their purpose.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;There had been a misunderstanding with my order, but the seller wrote back immediately and offered to send me another pair free of charge.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>this really lessens the bunion pain from rubbing</li>
            <li>If you have a bunion or the start of one I HIGHLY suggest getting these!</li>
            <li>But the flap covering the toe hang out too much.</li>
            <li>Quality matches price, cheap but usable for very moderate bunion bend.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>REALLY.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>haughtily it&#x27;s cool in the future</li>
            <li>Pushes second toe on top of third one, so it just causes another problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the separator.</li>
            <li>They feel soft and really separate your toes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much it helped.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>anyway it&#x27;s worth it to just buy an extra set.</li>
            <li>Love the Idea of the attached flap to help hold separator in place but the separator itself is not soft enough to add any comfort relief</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast delivery, item 100% same.</li>
            <li>IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not magic, but my toe has felt much better in the months since I&#x27;ve been wearing it.</li>
            <li>If you end up liking those, I promise these are the same exact thing, and</li>
            <li>If you end up liking those, I promise these are the same exact thing, and</li>
            <li>The natural color !</li>
            <li>Exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The product was ok, not sure what I was thinking it would be but was not what I needed.</li>
            <li>the actual piece that fits between the great toe and second toe may be a little too big for me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft and squishy enough that it doesn&#x27;t bulk up my foot too much to wear shoes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and comfy feeling also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are made out of a soft silicon material, and help relieve friction, but don&#x27;t serve to &amp;#34;re-align&amp;#34; a bunion already formed.</li>
            <li>Other brands are selling the same product, 1 pair only, for 4x+ more than this price.</li>
            <li>These are very soft and helpful for cushioning my large bunions and separating my big toe from the next one over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>particular version of the product left a chemical burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me quite a while to get that to heal back to normal.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can see improvement in my bunion and it does not slip out.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal quality !!</li>
            <li> Works to relieve bunion pain and toe friction, glad I bought them</li>
            <li> This is great. They feel soft and really separate your toes.</li>
            <li> They work great with my huge bunion.  I have tried different bunions aid and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am giving this one 5 stars for the price. Other brands are selling the same product, 1 pair only, for 4x+ more than this price. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME! I recommend this one. You&#x27;ll have to wait longer for it, but just know that this isn&#x27;t inferior to the more expensive ones - there is no difference whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I reviewed the same product by another brand (Foxnovo) and after reviewing it, went in search to see if there were others selling for less. That is when I found and ordered this one, as well as a pair from every brand, in every price point. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all between the Foxnovo and this one, or any of them for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a moderate looking, but excruciatingly painful feeling bunion. I am to the point of desperation, and have tried anything and everything I think might help. It&#x27;s not magic, but my toe has felt much better in the months since I&#x27;ve been wearing it. I like it well enough that I&#x27;m even just wearing it around the house under my sock. If it&#x27;s on right, I don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick enough to provide *some* amount of support between the big toe and the second toe, but it&#x27;s soft and squishy enough that it doesn&#x27;t bulk up my foot too much to wear shoes. It&#x27;s really soft and comfy feeling also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few reviewers here and on other similar products that complain that it cuts off circulation in their toe. I don&#x27;t understand this at all. Are they putting it on wrong? :-/  I wear a woman&#x27;s size 10, and have kind of fat feet. This fits nicely, and would also fit for smaller feet because it&#x27;s stretchy and it stretches to get around my toe. I can&#x27;t speak for bigger feet than mine, however. I suppose it could reach the point of cutting off circulation, but I really think if you put it on right, it won&#x27;t reach that point easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be so desperate that you can&#x27;t wait for this product to arrive from China. There are other options selling for $8.99 Prime-shipped. Go ahead and buy a pair and see if you like them. If they help the pain, that price is fine too. If you end up liking those, I promise these are the same exact thing, and maybe you&#x27;ll then want to stock up by buying a whole bunch of these. They might not be the most attractive footwear, but the amount they have decreased my bunion pain is so significant that I don&#x27;t ever want to live without them again.ling for $8.99 Prime-shipped.

They feel like what might happen if gelatin and silly putty made a baby.  Eep!  No thank you.  I&#x27;ll stick with the alignment socks for now.</li>
            <li> The natural color ! Send white one !!!</li>
            <li> Easy to wear. Waiting for some results.</li>
            <li> Works great and comfortable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using similar products for years without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;This particular version of the product left a chemical burn.&lt;br /&gt;It looks just as it&#x27;s pictured, the price is great,and it was delivered in a hurry.  Unfortunately there&#x27;s an unfriendly chemical in the manufacturing process that&#x27;s harmful to human skin.</li>
            <li> they are great and useful, I gave my mom a pair and she is so thankful about them.</li>
            <li> Works well.  So comfy that you can wear them with shoes!  The gel material they are made with keeps them at a comfortable temp.  The actually reflect your own temp.  It is major hot and humid now, but the gel separators are still cool.  hmmm</li>
            <li> Very comfortable when wearing my shoes or boots! Felt a instant improvement! Very affordable</li>
            <li> They are great. So happy with the quantity and they are on time</li>
            <li> works good for bunions. a little bit awkward between the toes. have to get use to it.</li>
            <li> I would not even give it a 1 star.  I will not use them.</li>
            <li> The picture was misleading to me. However, It would likely do  the job it is intended for.</li>
            <li> These really did help relieve pain in my toes.  I was surprised how much it helped.&lt;br /&gt;And they are squishy so you don&#x27;t notice them so much and they fit in shoes well.&lt;br /&gt;They also are holding up really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear this with shoes, I only wear it at night to help reposition the big toe.  My bunion is not severe but is bothersome.  This device is very comfortable to sleep with, more so than &amp;#34;Goodnight Bunion.&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t know how long it will last but for the price, it&#x27;s unbeatable.</li>
            <li> To bulky, don&#x27;t care for them</li>
            <li> These work really well. The only reason they are not getting 5 stars is the material. It is not great and does seem to have a tendency to stick together......I will probably order them again.</li>
            <li> I looked at getting the more expensive versions of these, but after reading some reviews that said these are the same as the more expensive versions I got these. I don&#x27;t have bunions, but I dance on my toes and I want to keep my big toe spread from my other toes. So far they&#x27;re pretty comfortable and seem to be doing the job. I was prepared to wait a long time for these to arrive, but they arrived faster than anticipated.</li>
            <li> My son used it and said it really relieved the pain and is very comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I got the for my mom who suffers from gout on the big toe, it has done wonders for her she can actually wear her shoes without being in unbearable pain. They are very light weight and soft. The only downfall is that they take about a month to ship to you.</li>
            <li> I only received on pair of toe separator unlike the two pair promised in the advertisement.</li>
            <li> These are well made, fit easily over bunion and are soft and don&#x27;t rub.  The price is great and their customer service is the best--they want you to be happy</li>
            <li> Not comfortable.  I think the part that goes in your toe should be reversed so that the larger part goes at the base of your toes and the narrower part towards the top of your toes.  Not comfortable to walk in with the silicon under your foot.  I was hoping this would be better than the wedge alone but that was more comfortable.</li>
            <li> does not work at all. it does not fit and can not have any affect. it is like a mere accessory.</li>
            <li> Eases the pain a bit and arrived in a timely manner. I can wear these in sneakers, since its not too bulky.</li>
            <li> Everything as the price, cheaper for cheaper!</li>
            <li> helps to decrease rubbing &amp; irritation. Good until I can get the surgery</li>
            <li> Relief for the toes, nice product, bought a few more,</li>
            <li> The rubber is not sturdy at all.  The rubber that covers bunion has broken away from the separator on both pairs. Maybe I just got a faulty pair because I don&#x27;t overuse these at all. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> The gel is super soft and comfortable</li>
            <li> These work really well for their purpose.  Another reviewer had suggested putting powder on them before wearing, and this works really well.  I use plain corn starch (or corn flour if you&#x27;re British).  These are very soft and helpful for cushioning my large bunions and separating my big toe from the next one over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There had been a misunderstanding with my order, but the seller wrote back immediately and offered to send me another pair free of charge.  Note, they don&#x27;t mean you get two pairs - you get two separators - one for each foot.  That wording needs to be changed on the description.  But heck, they&#x27;re so cheap anyway it&#x27;s worth it to just buy an extra set.</li>
            <li> I love these toe separators.  I don&#x27;t have bunion problems but I do have a problem with my big toe.  I injured my toe in one of my work out routines.  When I put these on in my sneakers they feel really good.  It arrived on time and was package nicely.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These things are great! Cushy comfort for my feet. Long walks that were very painful are now possible for much needed exercise.</li>
            <li> These were such a waste of money, they were so flimsy she wasn&#x27;t able to use them at all.</li>
            <li> The description of the product was incorrect. You only receive one pair not two of the separators. Doesn&#x27;t help to alleviate any pain or provide support.</li>
            <li> These are immensely helpful in several ways.  I had a toe removed next to my big toe and have to have a spacer to keep my toes in somewhat alliance.  I also have started a &amp;#34;hammertoe&amp;#34; on my other foot and this keeps the toe in place.  I highly recommend the separator.</li>
            <li> rubber and wouldn&#x27;t fit on toe. not a solid piece.</li>
            <li> too lose to wear alone. good with shoes.</li>
            <li> Love the Idea of the attached flap to help hold separator in place but the separator itself is not soft enough to add any comfort relief</li>
            <li> it dose help reduce the pain but I only received 1 pair  I ware them to work. the performance part is great. but they didn&#x27;t send me what was advertised.</li>
            <li> These are really comfortable. I&#x27;ve only been using them for a couple of weeks, and only when I wear my running shoes.  However, I think that maybe since my feet are on the smallish side - I&#x27;m a size 6 - the actual piece that fits between the great toe and second toe may be a little too big for me. I got these because my great toe was actually starting to overlap over my second toe.  When wearing these, I&#x27;ve noticed that with the repositioning of the toes, I&#x27;m getting some pain on the balls of my feet.  However, I think that this pain should disappear with constant use of the separator.  Otherwise, the price is right!</li>
            <li> A little thick between the toes but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Really works!!! Very affordable. Now I go to work with ease knowing my bunions are cushioned for 12 hours while walking and standing for long hours at work.</li>
            <li> Gel Bunion are perfect. Thank you</li>
            <li> They were as advertised, and I will be ordering more. Great buy!</li>
            <li> this really lessens the bunion pain from rubbing</li>
            <li> Work great, definitely worth what I paid for them..</li>
            <li> These are made out of a soft silicon material, and help relieve friction, but don&#x27;t serve to &amp;#34;re-align&amp;#34; a bunion already formed. I tried a few of these for sale on Amazon, and they&#x27;re essentially all the same. Same material, same configuration. Exactly the same.</li>
            <li> haughtily it&#x27;s cool in the future will have to deal with you</li>
            <li> This helps me for short periods.  After that, the separator begins to pain me.</li>
            <li> It is great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Comfortable,keeps toe straighter</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for sleeping and stuff but you could never wear these during the day with your shoes</li>
            <li> They work great. I wear at work and while working out. One just broke when I was taking my socks off after wearing them for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> These are great! I&#x27;m so glad I ordered 2! If you have a bunion or the start of one I HIGHLY suggest getting these! I use mine at night EVERY night. Now I can keep one with me in my purse!</li>
            <li> I can not even say anything and have nothing to seller</li>
            <li> Good. But the flap covering the toe hang out too much. Does not stay in place.</li>
            <li> The first wear one broke... shipping takes way to long...</li>
            <li> No directions for use or care included.  Overpriced.  Received only one pair.</li>
            <li> good quality, comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These Gel toe separators do not stay in place and a rather a hassle. I wish I had not bought them. Thankfully the price was very low.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.Pushes second toe on top of third one, so it just causes another problem.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless. Would not recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Quality matches price, cheap but usable for very moderate bunion bend.</li>
            <li> Received on schedule. My mom likes the product. I found it too uncomfortable in some shoes, but ok in others.</li>
            <li> This is not one size fits all. It was tight around the toe and did not lay against bunion/ post surgery scar. I wear an 11 Women shoe.</li>
            <li> The divider between big toe and other one is thick.</li>
            <li> pretty awkward and a little uncomfortable for long periods.  I try sleeping with it on.  Don&#x27;t think this is going to help prevent surgery... was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Thank you, good product</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t fit well in your foot</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Item as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These pads do help with bunion pain. I use when the bunion gets sore and&lt;br /&gt;when it feel better I do not use them. Am happy to have them when I need&lt;br /&gt;them.</li>
            <li> they are comfortable and seem to be helping</li>
            <li> REALLY.  I threw it away.....</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable and helped lessen the pain tremendously.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and fit well in shoes.</li>
            <li> side that covers the bunion should be longer. otherwise does a good job.</li>
            <li> every comfortable, stays inplace better than anything else i have tried</li>
            <li> Had to cut the opening larger to fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> I am usually least likely to write a post, however I felt my review might help someone decide on whether to purchase this product or not. The first one I purchased (not from this supplier) lasted not even a week! It one ripped and I was left with only one. I wore this item everyday during that week and even over night. What I began to notice was redness and then blistered skin. It took me quite a while to get that to heal back to normal. After further research on this product&#x27;s usage, I discovered that it works BEST when you sprinkle a bit of talcum or baby powder on to the product before you apply it on your foot. This keeps that area dry and avoids the extra sweating. I gave this product another shot AFTER I have read how to properly use it. I purchased two since is is so inexpensive. Since then, I have not experienced any problems and I am continuing to see noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my big toe and keeps it from rubbing against the toe next to it. Perfect for what I needed. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Works good seperating your toes without any pain....soft and comfortable.......... too long deliver though but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> comfortable, serves the purpose, not bulky, can be used inside a tennis shoe</li>
            <li> Awesome little gadget.  Perfect</li>
            <li> Works great, exactly like the more expensive prime version, if you don&#x27;t mind waiting a bit longer for the shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast delivery, item 100% same. pictures attached. thanks again</li>
            <li> Too soft to do any good.</li>
            <li> in the parcel i see another item than on the pictures! Bad service</li>
            <li> very helpful as it reduces friction greatly</li>
            <li> It helps quite a bit for something that cost so little.</li>
            <li> These cause blisters on your feet when worn with socks and shoes. They did come in the mail much quicker then expected and for the price, it was not much of a concern when they did not work out.</li>
            <li> A waist, use Gel Silicone Orthotic Separate Toes instead</li>
            <li> The product was ok, not sure what I was thinking it would be but was not what I needed. I only received one pair. Had to email the seller and request second pair. Just received second pair last week.  Give them away to some else.</li>
