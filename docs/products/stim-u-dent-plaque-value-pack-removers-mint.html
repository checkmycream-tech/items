    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome Product!</li>
            <li>They work best when use BEFORE flossing, then you brush, then you use a fluoride rinse to end it off.</li>
            <li>I use a Sonicare brush, the best in the world for plaque removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>: Of course I use this product as directed with superb results.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, durable and good quality!</li>
            <li>Excellent compliance and good product</li>
            <li>They are a great tool for tooth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>They are a great adjunct to flossing.</li>
            <li>Great dental health</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll be happy you tried it.</li>
            <li>Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great for cleaning between teeth and removing plaque.</li>
            <li>, I think the product itself is great</li>
            <li>If you like stimulants, you know how great they are.</li>
            <li>These are great for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Stimudent is great for the gums.</li>
            <li>Happy to find them through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>These are really great for removing excess plaque on your teeth.</li>
            <li>very effective.</li>
            <li>these toothpicks are very good for your teeth, almost as good as flossing, love them, would not be without them</li>
            <li>Taste so good</li>
            <li>NOT GOING TO FEEL GOOD.</li>
            <li>They allow me to do a good job of cleaning between my teeth when I don&#x27;t have a brush with me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wondered what had happened to a product I had used and loved for years</li>
            <li>Very effective in safely removing food particles and stimulating the gums.  </li>
            <li>I keep these in my car, in the kitchen where I brush my teeth and at my bedside, so they are always handy.  </li>
            <li>These are sold for the best price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>After about one month, however, they slide in and out very easily.</li>
            <li>Have used for years - my dentist tells me they are a suitable substitute for flossing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are great at removing hard to get food particles, work well on rubbing off stains, and are excellent at stimulating your gums, thus the name.</li>
            <li>The best way to keep gum disease at bay is to use dental floss daily to get between your teeth.</li>
            <li>I was really glad to see Amazon carry this product.</li>
            <li>used to be able to find this in any drug store in Dallas.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great price &amp; product.  </li>
            <li>love the idea</li>
            <li>My husband started using Stimudents many years when his dentist recommended them.  </li>
            <li>I always feel better after using.</li>
            <li>Glad to know</li>
            <li>and I love how well they work.  </li>
            <li>They are more efficient and sturdier than a toothpick designed for the tooth gum.  </li>
            <li>I like to run this around the gum line of each tooth after lunch every day - my dentist loves that I love these and can tell that I use them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Listen to my wife, she knows better.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and has a nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>They tend to break more easily / leave splinters than they used to.</li>
            <li>They have helped to keep my gums healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li>I wish these were a bit thinner - I would like them to be more tapered so they would fit between teeth a bit.</li>
            <li>They break easily.</li>
            <li>Glad to see these are available on Amazon, they are no longer available in my area.</li>
            <li>replacements are so easy to obtain.</li>
            <li>All stuck food cleans out easy, without irritation to the gums.  </li>
            <li>As described, easy to use, dependable.</li>
            <li>and she gave me a strong thumbs up.</li>
            <li>Love the price and ease of obtaining these special cleaners.</li>
            <li>These are fine.</li>
            <li>Filled my need</li>
            <li>These plaque removers fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Great for teeth with bigger gabs.  </li>
            <li>I had read reviews that said the product was not as strong as the ones made in this country, and that is true.  </li>
            <li>Give them a shot; you may have some gum bleeding initially because your gums likely are swollen or not in good shape; Stimudents are great at correcting that and helping prevent gum disease.</li>
            <li>But found a UNIQUE way to use this twice a day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you let them get moist (takes a couple minutes in your mouth), they will easily clean between hard-to-get places.</li>
            <li>I keep a pack of these things in my car - I can very effectively clean my teeth while I&#x27;m waiting at a traffic signal.</li>
            <li>Always got complimented on how clean my teeth were when I went to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Once you use these, you&#x27;ll never want to miss a day because your teeth won&#x27;t feel clean without them.</li>
            <li>thought this was some kind of special plaque remover gadget...turns out to be nothing more than a bunch of wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Stim-u-dents are a tried and true way to clean between your teeth and are another weapon against disease.  </li>
            <li>I find them handy and keep them in my purse and share them with friends who also miss the dental perks of old days.</li>
            <li>The reason that I use this an not a dental PICK, is these are GENTLE and for me work much better than a PICK.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as good as before, but the only thing like it on the market that&#x27;s recyclable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and keeps gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>These new sticks quickly split and break making it easy to puncture the gums.  </li>
            <li>Get the real thing, don&#x27;t short your self when it comes to good teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gross, but it&#x27;s nice to know there&#x27;s a way to remove it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is right on as well - convenient match book size, fits in your pocket.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I can use them right after flossing and brushing and still get junk off my teeth.</li>
            <li>good as my purchase of this item previously.  </li>
            <li>These simple wooden picks are great for the gums and always earn me a gold star at my dentist.</li>
            <li>The product comes in a nice small package so it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very, very highly recommend this to ALL!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Simple and fabulous!</li>
            <li>I notice a burning feeling after a while of using them in my throat / mouth as I have swallowed many tiny bits of wood.  </li>
            <li>When I injured my foot and temporarily couldn&#x27;t drive, I ordered  a large supply from the Amazon website.</li>
            <li>; thinner pack so doesn&#x27;t fit between tight teeth, but does a great job if your teeth aren&#x27;t tight together.</li>
            <li>Use gentle force and they work well....</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And these Plaque Removers are so gentle on my gums and teeth&lt;</li>
            <li>Since these are so gentle, my gums do not bleed when I use these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best toothpick on the market - puts not only those round wooden picks, but also all those plastic ones at the drugstore to shame.  </li>
            <li>These things work very well for me.</li>
            <li>Very versatile and minty</li>
            <li>These triangular shaped (not round or flat like a toothpick) are used to really RUB stuff off your teeth better than floss does.</li>
            <li>What I do is I gently use one of these Plaque Removers to gently rub again the suface of my 4 bottom teeth when the heaviest of tartar is.&lt;br /&gt;Result: On just the FOURTH day of using PLAX and then brushing right after and then gently scraping my inside bottom front teeth, the loose tartar is coming off each day MORE</li>
            <li>chase with sugar-free gum for decent cleaning.</li>
            <li>My gums were bleeding pretty bad before setting up this routine &amp; now they are nice &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>These little picks often do a better job of cleaning your teeth than floss.</li>
            <li>They make narrower version, but I&#x27;ve been using these for so many years, the narrow ones don&#x27;t even touch my teeth.</li>
            <li>My gums have gone from a very dark pink (almost red) to a much healthier pink and since I have seen this wonderful change in my gums in just two weeks, I believe that my gums will continue to improve each day!</li>
            <li>One stick could clean between all my teeth without breaking, sometimes even for a second or third go-around.</li>
            <li>If you are motivated enough to brush, floss, and use a new Stim-u-dent every day for a week or 2, unless you already have serious gum disease (which needs professional help), you (and your significant other) will notice a most pleasant subtle change in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Definitely overpriced for what it really is.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised to see them on amazon.</li>
            <li>They really do help your gums if you use them on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they have really improved the overall health of my gums!.</li>
            <li>A quick plaque clean up when flossing is inconvenient works very well.</li>
            <li>The Chinese product seems to be better quality lately.  </li>
            <li>These not only help clear your teeth of debris after eating, but they stimulate the gums when you use them.  </li>
            <li>They do not have the same friction and plaque removal power as the old sticks.  </li>
            <li>THE FIRST FEW TIMES YOU USE THEM, THEY&#x27;RE</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have used these forever, but they are getting harder to find locally.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Couldn&#x27;t find in store, so I went to Amazon.  Filled my need</li>
            <li> good as my purchase of this item previously.  very effective.</li>
            <li> My dentist swears by these and they are definitely cheaper bought in bulk this way.</li>
            <li> Used these for years. If you let them get moist (takes a couple minutes in your mouth), they will easily clean between hard-to-get places. Use gentle force and they work well.... chase with sugar-free gum for decent cleaning. You&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> I keep these in my car, in the kitchen where I brush my teeth and at my bedside, so they are always handy.  They are a great tool for tooth cleaning.  Simple and fabulous!</li>
            <li> I wish these were a bit thinner - I would like them to be more tapered so they would fit between teeth a bit.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for as a retired dental hygienist..........thanks</li>
            <li> I keep a pack of these things in my car - I can very effectively clean my teeth while I&#x27;m waiting at a traffic signal.</li>
            <li> Having been using this now for several months and find my gums are stronger, no bleeding.  These little picks often do a better job of cleaning your teeth than floss.</li>
            <li> thought this was some kind of special plaque remover gadget...turns out to be nothing more than a bunch of wooden toothpicks. Definitely overpriced for what it really is. Has a minty taste, but that doesn&#x27;t justify the cost. Should simply be titled &amp;#34;toothpicks&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;plaque removers&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My gums used to bleed everytime I flossed and had a cleaning (embarrassingly so). My new dentist recommended this product, which I&#x27;ve used at least once daily for the past 2 weeks or so (in addition to flossing). My teeth are now shinier, they feel cleaner, and there is no more plaque build up. And, no more bleeding gums! I fully recommend this simple little product.</li>
            <li> My dentist has given me these for home care, but when I tried to find them locally I was unable to. They are a great adjunct to flossing.</li>
            <li> Great dental health product!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be happy you tried it.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product! Inexpensive, durable and good quality! Happy with purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for several years &amp; they&#x27;re hard to find in stores; they&#x27;re stimulating as posted on the product &amp; don&#x27;t hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> The insidious way for a person to lose teeth is to let gum disease get the upper hand in your mouth.  The best way to keep gum disease at bay is to use dental floss daily to get between your teeth. NO toothbrush reaches between your teeth no matter what their ads say.  Stim-u-dents are a tried and true way to clean between your teeth and are another weapon against disease.  AND, they do what no floss can do: they massage the gum tissue between your teeth while they remove plaque and food debris.  I rate Stim-u-dent 5 stars without hesitation.  If you are motivated enough to brush, floss, and use a new Stim-u-dent every day for a week or 2, unless you already have serious gum disease (which needs professional help), you (and your significant other) will notice a most pleasant subtle change in your mouth.  Helps protect against disease and subtly facilitates relationships?  Count me in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on since the mid 1970s and they&#x27;ve always been basically the same. This time however it appears the wood itself is different and the mint flavor is non a figment of their imagination.&lt;br /&gt;Usable but I&#x27;m disappointed with the differences.</li>
            <li> I hate those plastic things they call stimulants. Get the real thing, don&#x27;t short your self when it comes to good teeth.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and has a nice fresh smell.  Highly recommend and keeps gums healthy.  The product comes in a nice small package so it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever watched the TV show &amp;#34;Survivor&amp;#34; you may have seen them cleaning their teeth with a stick.  These work the same way.  You can rub your teeth and gum line or these are the bomb for using as a tooth pick between your teeth.  The packaging is right on as well - convenient match book size, fits in your pocket.  I was really glad to see Amazon carry this product.</li>
            <li> Our dentist no longer hands these out and I was surprised to see them on amazon. I find them handy and keep them in my purse and share them with friends who also miss the dental perks of old days.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that said the product was not as strong as the ones made in this country, and that is true.  They break easily.</li>
            <li> These simple wooden picks are great for the gums and always earn me a gold star at my dentist. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Everyone should use these!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Bigger than the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; thinner pack so doesn&#x27;t fit between tight teeth, but does a great job if your teeth aren&#x27;t tight together.</li>
            <li> used to be able to find this in any drug store in Dallas.  No more!  Only thru amazon.    Great for cleaning between teeth and removing plaque.</li>
            <li> I have been using stimulants since I was in college.  Always got complimented on how clean my teeth were when I went to the dentist.  They no longer sell stimulants at drugstores or supermarkets in my area.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price &amp; product.  Thank You!!!!</li>
            <li> These have gotten cheaper. I notice a burning feeling after a while of using them in my throat / mouth as I have swallowed many tiny bits of wood.  They tend to break more easily / leave splinters than they used to. I think the quality of the wood has gone down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea, I think the product itself is great but something has changed.</li>
            <li> Glad to see these are available on Amazon, they are no longer available in my area. I have not had any trouble about sticks breaking so far. They really do help your gums if you use them on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dip the stick in a small container of Listerine &amp; poke around each tooth. Then rinse with remaining Listerine in cup &amp; then brush as usual. My gums were bleeding pretty bad before setting up this routine &amp; now they are nice &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> These feel like mint flavored , thin tree twigs (wood) you rub at the base of your teeth. Taste so good and you are probably removing tarter when using them so I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together and flossing is difficult.  These plaque removers fit the bill.  Unfortunately, they are difficult to find in stores so I need to order them online.</li>
            <li> If you like stimulants, you know how great they are. If you&#x27;ve never used them, you&#x27;re missing out. These triangular shaped (not round or flat like a toothpick) are used to really RUB stuff off your teeth better than floss does. They work best when use BEFORE flossing, then you brush, then you use a fluoride rinse to end it off. I use a Sonicare brush, the best in the world for plaque removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great at removing hard to get food particles, work well on rubbing off stains, and are excellent at stimulating your gums, thus the name. NOTE: THE FIRST FEW TIMES YOU USE THEM, THEY&#x27;RE NOT GOING TO FEEL GOOD. That&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t likely have enough space between your teeth. After about one month, however, they slide in and out very easily. They make narrower version, but I&#x27;ve been using these for so many years, the narrow ones don&#x27;t even touch my teeth. Once you use these, you&#x27;ll never want to miss a day because your teeth won&#x27;t feel clean without them. Give them a shot; you may have some gum bleeding initially because your gums likely are swollen or not in good shape; Stimudents are great at correcting that and helping prevent gum disease. Now try THAT with flossing alone, Batman!</li>
            <li> These are great for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have used these forever, but they are getting harder to find locally.  So this was perfect for me.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My husband started using Stimudents many years when his dentist recommended them.  These are sold for the best price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> For me, I use this STIM-U-DENT Plaque Removers several times a day and have been using them for 2 weeks now and they have really improved the overall health of my gums!. My gums have gone from a very dark pink (almost red) to a much healthier pink and since I have seen this wonderful change in my gums in just two weeks, I believe that my gums will continue to improve each day! And these Plaque Removers are so gentle on my gums and teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Special use for this: Of course I use this product as directed with superb results. But found a UNIQUE way to use this twice a day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++ Each morning before I brush, floss I use PLAX Plaque Rinse. Started using the PLAX just 6 days ago. What I do is I gently use one of these Plaque Removers to gently rub again the suface of my 4 bottom teeth when the heaviest of tartar is.&lt;br /&gt;Result: On just the FOURTH day of using PLAX and then brushing right after and then gently scraping my inside bottom front teeth, the loose tartar is coming off each day MORE AND MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++ The reason that I use this an not a dental PICK, is these are GENTLE and for me work much better than a PICK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++ Since these are so gentle, my gums do not bleed when I use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++ These began working to remove food between my teeth and around my gums right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very highly recommend this to ALL!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for about twenty years because I prefer them to regular foss. As long as they keep making them, I&#x27;ll keep buying them.</li>
            <li> Stimudent is great for the gums. I always feel better after using. I cleans in a way that floss just does not do. I use both floss and stimudent. I keep packs lying around in different places so there is always one around when i need it.</li>
            <li> Used them for several years. Glad to know replacements are so easy to obtain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these anymore in our local stores and I love how well they work.  They are more efficient and sturdier than a toothpick designed for the tooth gum.  These were recommended by our dentist and now I use them daily.</li>
            <li> My mother had some of these several years ago and I&#x27;ve been unable to find them in stores.  Happy to find them through Amazon.  They allow me to do a good job of cleaning between my teeth when I don&#x27;t have a brush with me.&lt;br /&gt;I have suggested them to others.</li>
            <li> I like to run this around the gum line of each tooth after lunch every day - my dentist loves that I love these and can tell that I use them.</li>
            <li> These are really great for removing excess plaque on your teeth. I can use them right after flossing and brushing and still get junk off my teeth. It&#x27;s gross, but it&#x27;s nice to know there&#x27;s a way to remove it.</li>
            <li> Best toothpick on the market - puts not only those round wooden picks, but also all those plastic ones at the drugstore to shame.  Have used for years - my dentist tells me they are a suitable substitute for flossing.  Very effective in safely removing food particles and stimulating the gums.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great for teeth with bigger gabs.  All stuck food cleans out easy, without irritation to the gums.  I always carry a pack in my purse.  A quick plaque clean up when flossing is inconvenient works very well.</li>
            <li> These not only help clear your teeth of debris after eating, but they stimulate the gums when you use them.  I told my hygienist I&#x27;m using them and she gave me a strong thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Love the price and ease of obtaining these special cleaners.</li>
            <li> The Chinese product seems to be better quality lately.  They no longer are as stringy and dull as they were for a while.</li>
            <li> these toothpicks are very good for your teeth, almost as good as flossing, love them, would not be without them</li>
            <li> These are fine. Not as good as before, but the only thing like it on the market that&#x27;s recyclable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these things for decades.  These are Chinese made knock offs.  Johnson &amp; Johnson stopped making them several years ago for reasons known only to them.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference so I don&#x27;t care about the source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t floss, but almost always have one of these in my mouth.  Yeah, I know...it&#x27;s tacky...get over it.  It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve needed any dental work other than my semi-annual checkup and an occasional superficial cleaning.  My dentists tells me that&#x27;s at least in part due to my regular use of these.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years.They have helped to keep my gums healthy and strong.  As described, easy to use, dependable. I&#x27;d recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent compliance and good product</li>
            <li> These things work very well for me.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and minty</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t help you there. Not for my personal use.</li>
            <li> My wife raves about these.  When she could no longer get them at our local Walgreens, she went crazy.  I now order them on line for her.  She loves them and swears by them. I just use a toothpick. Then again, I have gum problems. Listen to my wife, she knows better.</li>
            <li> i have used Stim-U-Dent plaque removers for years, buying them from my local drugstore.  One stick could clean between all my teeth without breaking, sometimes even for a second or third go-around. When I injured my foot and temporarily couldn&#x27;t drive, I ordered  a large supply from the Amazon website. These new sticks quickly split and break making it easy to puncture the gums.  They do not have the same friction and plaque removal power as the old sticks.  I now need to use 2 or 3 sticks to get comparable results.  I wondered what had happened to a product I had used and loved for years so I read the label.  These sticks are made in China.  I cannot prove it; but, I believe the problem is the wood used in the Chinese sticks is not the same wood used in past purchases.  The wood is definitely inferior to the wood product I used in the past. I will not buy this product again except in a store where I can read the label in advance and determine where the sticks were made.</li>
            <li> Literally just tooth picks</li>
