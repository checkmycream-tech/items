    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and does what it claims.  </li>
            <li>Loved it and the price is great!!</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>SO HAPPY</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, happy buyer.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very confident when I placed the order</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the results..easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>so it can work its magic!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is effective for nail fungus.</li>
            <li>This is the best so far.</li>
            <li>My best advice is to be patient - it can take 6 months or more to grow out a new healthy nail.</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years and even took Lamisil by tablet for 3 months.</li>
            <li>There are many types of fungus that affect toes and feet and nothing&lt;br /&gt;seems to have cured mine.</li>
            <li>Me and my husband are both so so in love in this product.</li>
            <li>They have already sent me 3 more.</li>
            <li>Nails look better in about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>love the fact it can be used even with polish on</li>
            <li>I think it also softens the nail more that the prescription stuff alone, and so lets me peel off more infested nail for faster control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li>(including liver function tests)&lt;br /&gt;This has been the most useful and affordable product.</li>
            <li>Works Great, offer says pack of 2, only received one 0.6 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy it took so long to get this product, and lack of support on the amazon side.</li>
            <li>My nails are growing back nice and healthy after using it for 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>so my nails still look neat and clean.</li>
            <li>Product is fine, I just didn&#x27;t like that it took so long to come, I even called in and spoke with a lady at customer service who was super friendly and was supposed to follow up with me, but never did!!!</li>
            <li>Super east to apply and my nail is growing out clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW...........</li>
            <li>the clear nail is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is not expensive and may help you as it has me.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t even try to fix that anymore, nothing I was willing to try ever having succeeded) off and on for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I caught it early and my nail salon sold me the first bottle of Clear Nails, then I ordered two more on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The shipping was timely and cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li>If you really want to do yourself a favor, soak your nail clippers in alcohol, and spray disinfectant in your shoes.</li>
            <li>They were very correct.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me</li>
            <li>This has really done wonders for me.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to really make a difference</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s look like my toenails getting clear every day !!!</li>
            <li>This came highly recommended by my manicurist.</li>
            <li>When it says &amp;#34;not for use on toenails&amp;#34; that does not mean it doesn&#x27;t work for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>I had tried many cures for fungus, including mixtures of vinegar and hydrogen peroxide, but they were messy to use and time consuming.</li>
            <li>On day 3, my toenails were quite clear, looked almost normal!  </li>
            <li>If I dont use it, it comes right back.</li>
            <li>I TRIED EVERY THING UNDER THE SUN TO CLEAR IT UP WITH NO RESULTS!</li>
            <li>The exact same thing as Tinactin.&lt;br /&gt;-The package reads, \\&quot;Dr.</li>
            <li>But with continued use, this product has kept my nails clear.</li>
            <li>I never received the Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment...</li>
            <li>It says clear nails on the bottle.</li>
            <li>G&#x27;s Clear Nail, Kills fungus that cause infections, Professional Strength Formula,</li>
            <li>I guess Tinactin is considered \\&quot;Professional Strength\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>So far I am still using this product and can&#x27;t completely see yet what the outcome will be.</li>
            <li>It is NEARLY gone</li>
            <li>Fixed my sore nail immediately.</li>
            <li>tend to doubt it would effect a complete cure by itself</li>
            <li>The only treatment, including prescription, that really gets rid of fungus on the nails.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that really works.</li>
            <li>but so far, the effect is holding up.  </li>
            <li>Glad I took a chance as I was seriously considering laser treatment which according to some, does not always work.</li>
            <li>I thought would be getting second bottle shortly after receiving first.</li>
            <li>this product is half the size it used to be / and the product is only have full /you will have to order at least 4 bottles and maybe more in order to solve one nail(s)</li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t have much faith sense it completely contradicts itself, not to mention that it is essentially Tinactin in a different container.</li>
            <li>Have used in the past with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>Apply twice a day and do not stop after your toenail begins to grow back normally.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about three weeks, Nail fungus is tough to get rid of.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s probably going to be another few months before my nails are completely normal, but Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nails has really helped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prescription Ciclopirox eventually fixes it when I get an outbreak, but this non-prescription stuff boosts it a bit and gets me back clear nails faster.  </li>
            <li>Cut the toenail back as far as you can and get the lotion in there</li>
            <li>No Need to Remove Polish or Acrylics,\\&quot; with accompanying pictures of unhealthy and healthy finger and toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>It is simple to use, not messy or expensive, and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>Cut your nails short, use Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nails 2X daily, and polish with Dr. Remedy&#x27;s polish.</li>

            <li> I think my nails were damaged from twice a month Shellac manicures, then I got a manicure at an out of town salon and my nails developed a white fungus that caused the white tip of my nails to extend down into the beds of my fingernails.</li>
            <li> My thumbnail developed an icky yellow color and thickened, but Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nails has cleared it up.  </li>
            <li> This is my second order - toenails take a long time to grow out</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if it&#x27;s going to work or not.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for one or two toes (I have used it), but not for extremely serious cases of toe fungus (my brother found it no help at all).  </li>
            <li> I used this product every day for a long time.</li>
            <li> But long term use is affective.</li>
            <li> But I can say that it&#x27;s not getting worse, so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m on the right track.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is expensive, but at least you can keep your nails looking nice.</li>
            <li> You have to use it faithfully every single day.</li>
            <li> I had been getting weekly pedicures and thought that the big toes both looked \\&quot;black and blue\\&quot; and I might lose the nail -     </li>
            <li> Be careful of toe nails that discolor - and use this product to help them heal.</li>
            <li> Have only been using the product for a few weeks but seems to be making a difference with my husbands feet.  </li>
            <li> Hv two other bottles waiting in the wings.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mess up the nail polish like other anti fungal products.  </li>
            <li> Since my previous attempts were unsuccessful, thought I&#x27;d give this try.  </li>
            <li> It turned his skin red, which it said it might on the pkg, so he is cutting back to 1x a day to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with a fungal nail infection for quite a few months.</li>
            <li> Now I use it once every few days.</li>
            <li> My husband has used it a few days now.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This product is not effective on scalp or nails\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am on my 2nd bottle now, afraid to stop.  </li>
            <li> I was to go to another salon and be told that I had a serious fungal infection that would take years to go away.    </li>
            <li> Prior to application of Dr. G&#x27;s, they looked disgustingly filthy even though I knew they were not cuz I scrubbed them everyday with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> - nail fungus is tough stuff.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this producy didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> He has been fighting a toe fungus for 15 years and they are in bad shape.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very good product and does what it claims.  The shipping was timely and cost was reasonable. I would recommend others to acquire it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this producy didn&#x27;t work. I have not seen a difference in my nails since I started using it. So I cannot recommend the product. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> After 3 years of battling fungus on 16 nails, including 6 months of Lamisil, I think this product is working.  In 2-3 weeks, 4 nails have all but cleared, and they did not have to grow out to do so.  I recommend this.  It is not expensive and may help you as it has me.</li>
            <li> The package can be misleading. When it says &amp;#34;not for use on toenails&amp;#34; that does not mean it doesn&#x27;t work for toenail fungus. It means that it works for the fungus under and around the toenail, where the fungus lives. The fungus is not literally on the toenail. Be vigilant! Apply twice a day and do not stop after your toenail begins to grow back normally. If you really want to do yourself a favor, soak your nail clippers in alcohol, and spray disinfectant in your shoes. Cut the toenail back as far as you can and get the lotion in there so it can work its magic!</li>
            <li> I just received this product and this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;-Active ingredient 1% Tolnaftate (Antifungal). The exact same thing as Tinactin.&lt;br /&gt;-The package reads, \\&quot;Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail, Kills fungus that cause infections, Professional Strength Formula, No Need to Remove Polish or Acrylics,\\&quot; with accompanying pictures of unhealthy and healthy finger and toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;Now Get This:&lt;br /&gt;-On the back of the box under the directions it states under the 5th bullet: \\&quot;This product is not effective on scalp or nails\\&quot;... WTF!&lt;br /&gt;On the front it indicates that it&#x27;s for nails and on the back it states that it is \\&quot;not effective\\&quot; on nails...&lt;br /&gt;And I guess Tinactin is considered \\&quot;Professional Strength\\&quot;... Seriously?!&lt;br /&gt;I paid for it so I&#x27;m giving it a go though I don&#x27;t have much faith sense it completely contradicts itself, not to mention that it is essentially Tinactin in a different container. This is why I&#x27;m giving it a 2 star.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years and even took Lamisil by tablet for 3 months. (including liver function tests)&lt;br /&gt;This has been the most useful and affordable product. There are many types of fungus that affect toes and feet and nothing&lt;br /&gt;seems to have cured mine. But with continued use, this product has kept my nails clear.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried everything for a nail fungus. This is the best so far. i carry a bottle with me and apply it about 4 times a day instead of 2 but it does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s look like my toenails getting clear every day !!! Me and my husband are both so so in love in this product. We are in a process and its looks promising.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> My nail keeps getting smaller so I guess this is working.</li>
            <li> I never received the Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment...therefore I cannot do a review on this product.  I do not know why it has not arrived.</li>
            <li> This product is effective for nail fungus. You have to use it faithfully every single day. Minimum 3 months. I still use this several times a week to prevent fungus again. I have acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for one or two toes (I have used it), but not for extremely serious cases of toe fungus (my brother found it no help at all).  My best advice is to be patient - it can take 6 months or more to grow out a new healthy nail.</li>
            <li> They have already sent me 3 more. They were very correct.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about three weeks, Nail fungus is tough to get rid of. But I can say that it&#x27;s not getting worse, so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m on the right track. But you must use it faithfully every day , otherwise , nothing will happen.</li>
            <li> Hoping this will solve the fungus problem</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Have used in the past with fantastic results.</li>
            <li> this product is half the size it used to be / and the product is only have full /you will have to order at least 4 bottles and maybe more in order to solve one nail(s)</li>
            <li> Product is fine, I just didn&#x27;t like that it took so long to come, I even called in and spoke with a lady at customer service who was super friendly and was supposed to follow up with me, but never did!!! She told me she would call me on Sunday to see if the product came, but never did! I wasn&#x27;t happy it took so long to get this product, and lack of support on the amazon side.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with a fungal nail infection for quite a few months. I was advised by my nail tech to try Dr G&#x27;s product. I am delighted with the results..easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It doesn&#x27;t mess up the nail polish like other anti fungal products.  Nails look better in about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on a stubborn toenail fungus problem and I believe it is helping.</li>
            <li> So far I am still using this product and can&#x27;t completely see yet what the outcome will be.</li>
            <li> It works if used faithfully</li>
            <li> I was horrified 2 years ago to understand that the toenail on both big toes was compromised by a fungus infection. I had been getting weekly pedicures and thought that the big toes both looked \\&quot;black and blue\\&quot; and I might lose the nail -     You can imagine how freaked out I was to go to another salon and be told that I had a serious fungal infection that would take years to go away.    It is NEARLY gone but guess what, it did take 2 years.    I used this product every day for a long time. Now I use it once every few days. It did stop the spread of the problem and gradually my nails healed.    Be careful of toe nails that discolor - and use this product to help them heal.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. It says clear nails on the bottle. But, on the side of the box it says &amp;#34;not for nails.&amp;#34;  I can&#x27;t give it zero stars so I had to give it one.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended by my manicurist. Fixed my sore nail immediately. Now my elderly parents order it for their toe nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff works just takes time</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! Problem is gone after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is terrific product for conquering toe nail or finger nail fungus. Both my friend and I used it over several months, and the fungus disappeared. It is simple to use, not messy or expensive, and it&#x27;s effective. I had tried many cures for fungus, including mixtures of vinegar and hydrogen peroxide, but they were messy to use and time consuming. This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me</li>
            <li> the clear nail is easy to use.  the price is preect compared to the price in the store.  love the fact it can be used even with polish on</li>
            <li> I have had finger nail fungus (not toe nail - I don&#x27;t even try to fix that anymore, nothing I was willing to try ever having succeeded) off and on for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prescription Ciclopirox eventually fixes it when I get an outbreak, but this non-prescription stuff boosts it a bit and gets me back clear nails faster.  I think it also softens the nail more that the prescription stuff alone, and so lets me peel off more infested nail for faster control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put in on, let it soak in, and then apply the prescription stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to doubt it would effect a complete cure by itself - nail fungus is tough stuff.  Then again, one never knows - what works for one might not work for another.</li>
            <li> The only treatment, including prescription, that really gets rid of fungus on the nails.</li>
            <li> Super east to apply and my nail is growing out clear and healthy. This is my second order - toenails take a long time to grow out and I plan to just keep using this as a preventative.</li>
            <li> AFTER 33 YEARS OF NEVER TAKING OFF MY ACRILIC NAILS...I GOT A NAIL FUNGAS. I TRIED EVERY THING UNDER THE SUN TO CLEAR IT UP WITH NO RESULTS! THEN I FOUND DR G&#x27;S....THREE WEEKS PEOPLE, THREE WEEKS AND IT WAS GONE!! SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW...........</li>
            <li> I have had a nail fungus for 15 yrs and this product keeps it from showing.  If I dont use it, it comes right back. My Dr said to use it if it works.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, happy buyer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working, I never see any result.</li>
            <li> Works Great, offer says pack of 2, only received one 0.6 ounce bottle. I thought would be getting second bottle shortly after receiving first.</li>
            <li> Have only been using the product for a few weeks but seems to be making a difference with my husbands feet.  He has been fighting a toe fungus for 15 years and they are in bad shape.  Glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works. This really finally made a big difference for me. Hope it works for ya&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very confident when I placed the order but I had tried Fungi Nail for months, not an iota of improvement.  Tried tea tree oil for months, similar result.  I suppose any product can work differently on different people.  Since my previous attempts were unsuccessful, thought I&#x27;d give this try.  On day 3, my toenails were quite clear, looked almost normal!  Prior to application of Dr. G&#x27;s, they looked disgustingly filthy even though I knew they were not cuz I scrubbed them everyday with soap and water.  I wash and apply twice daily.  I don&#x27;t know if this remedied condition will continue but so far, the effect is holding up.  I am on my 2nd bottle now, afraid to stop.  Hv two other bottles waiting in the wings.  This has really done wonders for me.  Glad I took a chance as I was seriously considering laser treatment which according to some, does not always work.</li>
            <li> Loved it and the price is great!!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Had yellowing of nails on left foot, and this did the trick in 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This did not work for us</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It&#x27;s not an over the night remedy. But long term use is affective.</li>
            <li> Seemed to really make a difference</li>
            <li> My husband has used it a few days now. It turned his skin red, which it said it might on the pkg, so he is cutting back to 1x a day to see if that helps. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if it&#x27;s going to work or not.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, it seemed to help - but did not fix my problem.  I will continue to use it, hoping it will work eventually.</li>
            <li> This product works. My nails are growing back nice and healthy after using it for 8 weeks. I noticed an improvment after about 4 weeks.  I am on my third bottle, so be patient, it doesn&#x27;t work overnight. I think my nails were damaged from twice a month Shellac manicures, then I got a manicure at an out of town salon and my nails developed a white fungus that caused the white tip of my nails to extend down into the beds of my fingernails. My thumbnail developed an icky yellow color and thickened, but Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nails has cleared it up.  Thankfully, I caught it early and my nail salon sold me the first bottle of Clear Nails, then I ordered two more on Amazon. While they are healing, I am using Dr. Remedy&#x27;s nail polishes to cover so my nails still look neat and clean. This nail polish is expensive, but at least you can keep your nails looking nice. I bought the Dr. Remedy&#x27;s polishes on Amazon also. Cut your nails short, use Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nails 2X daily, and polish with Dr. Remedy&#x27;s polish. I think it&#x27;s probably going to be another few months before my nails are completely normal, but Dr. G&#x27;s Clear Nails has really helped. I&#x27;m done with the Shellac manicures!</li>
