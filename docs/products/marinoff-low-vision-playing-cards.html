            <li> I bought these for someone who was legally blind.  </li>
            <li> My mom has macular degeneration, and it is getting bad.</li>
            <li> Got the cards for my father who has bad vision.  </li>

            <li> I bought these for my dad who has Macula degeneration and they are too big and too busy for him.  He immediately said he could not use them.  I did not really like them either because there just seemed to be too much going on, on the cards.</li>

            <li> My mom has macular degeneration, and it is getting bad. She can&#x27;t see to drive anymore, and is having trouble watching TV &amp; reading. She insisted over &amp; over she did not want anything for her B-Day. Well, i thought, she still plays Bridge at the Community Residence she lives at near Orlando. So i picked these out. they are only $6.50. Then i called her and asked if she could see them, and she said yes. mission accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;MKS</li>
            <li> My husband is losing his eye sight but loves playing cards so I thought I would try this. Arrived fast &amp; in good condition. We are back playing again &amp; not getting upset because he was having a hard time seeing them. Now he is back beating me, thanks.</li>

            <li> this was a grift,never heard back</li>
            <li> These are a wonderful size.&lt;br /&gt;The low visions title is great.&lt;br /&gt;They are even bigger type than the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; card set.</li>

            <li> cards numbers are easy to read. made of good quality material, not easy to bend. very good product. would recommend for person with sight problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these decks for my 99-year old mother, and they have been a Godsend for her (she plays solitaire.)  They are high quality and easily readable.</li>
            <li> Cards arrived promptly and in great condition.  I bought these for my sister&#x27;s 60th birthday as a gag gift. When her husbands came through, he loved them as he was having problems reading regular cards while playing poker!!</li>
            <li> Work well for 88 yr old with macular degeneration. They show both the suit and denomination when fanned in your hand.</li>
            <li> Since my mother can  see only large number cards I use them to play cards with her.</li>
            <li> Bought the playing cards for my ageing parents whose eyesight has diminished over the years. The cards are great and are much easier for them to see.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> My dad is slowly going blind and he loves to play cards.  These low vision cards are wonderful.  Playing card keeps his mind active.  My dad is 92 years old.</li>
            <li> great....if you only have a grat magnifyin g glasss for a ;a loww vission. person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a hand held one..</li>
            <li> I bought these for someone who was legally blind.  I searched for cards with large print.  These were by far the largest I have found.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, fast shipping.  For low vision playing cards, don&#x27;t waste your time, get these.</li>
            <li> I ordered one deck to try and came back to get 2 more! Easy on the eyes and with low vision I am back to enjoying cards without trying to strain to see! :) and I was looking for a regular size card with jumbo print.. Not a huge jumbo card. These are perfect and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These cards were not helpful for my dad who struggles with low vision. The larger numbers are upside down when you place them in the card holders unless you keep them from overlapping - which is inconvenient for most games. Also the suits are even more difficult to see than a regular playing deck.</li>
