            <li>In what world does this have a pleasant scent?</li>
            <li>Provides good hold</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a good wax with good hold, this is it.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>My Dad really liked this wax he said it works great with a non greasy hold and does a good job keeping things under control.</li>
            <li>Works good would buy again speedy shipping very satisfied</li>
            <li>It has a nice, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, and I recommend it to anyone interested in styling your mustache!</li>
            <li>This product has a pleasant smell and a very convenient package (it fits perfectly in the watch pocket of my 501&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>Great hold, smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li>My first moustache wax, so I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of perfect application.</li>
            <li>Hilarious!</li>
            <li>What more could a guy want?!</li>
            <li>I love that it has a pleasant smell</li>
            <li>It has made his mustache a lot healthier as well as being amazing for his mustache  curls.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s never tried anything kind of beard products and says this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a review from my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My mustache tends to have a mind of its own, and this tames it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a wax that didn&#x27;t smell or leave any kind of residue or flakes.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I agreed to provide honest feedback when posting my review.  </li>
            <li>(i now warm up the wax between fingers).</li>
            <li>but the shorter whiskers still wanted to go their own way and did.  </li>
            <li>With that in mind, I liked this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has a nice conditioning effect,  taming those wiry hairs and making them softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li>but you have to keep it warm to use it.</li>
            <li>There is no scent to this product which my husband liked because some products make him “smell like a flower”.</li>
            <li>We recieved this product to test in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>It says to either warm in warm water OR in a pocket.</li>
            <li>We also used the warm water bath method.</li>
            <li>Which was nice.</li>
            <li>These would make a really nice Fathers Day or Christmas basket gift</li>
            <li>Which was nice.</li>
            <li>Great product, worth the price!</li>
            <li>With that particular technique, it seems that the results are best the quickest it can be done (before the wax hardens, I&#x27;d imagine).  </li>
            <li>It is the best wax I have ever used, and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I saw this Primary mustache wax discounted during a promotion and of course I bought it, and my husband is just as happy with the Primary!</li>
            <li>Has a light and pleasant beeswax smell to it when applying.</li>
            <li>has a very strong beeswax scent to it.</li>
            <li>After using the primary wax it feels really good.</li>
            <li>Nice hold, lasts most of the day for my unruly stache.</li>
            <li>the most part, it shapes nicely.  </li>
            <li>By far the best mustache was I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li>He carries it with him throughout the day in the rare case he needs to reapply for those fly away beard hairs.</li>
            <li>Works in to your mustache really easily, has a great (light) scent of beeswax.</li>
            <li>Easy with this wax!</li>
            <li>I received the wax at a discount as part of a promotion for my honest review and my whole family is happily participating.</li>
            <li>I received the wax at a discount as part of a promotion for my honest review and my whole family is happily participating.</li>
            <li>Discounted product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.</li>
            <li>He especially liked the fact that it just smelled like beeswax and no other addins.</li>
            <li>It is easy to warm in his pocket or with my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>The all day hold ensured his mustache looked handsome and unruffled without reapplying.</li>
            <li>Stylish and convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love you.</li>
            <li>I tried another brand but wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on melting the two together soon :)</li>
            <li>It works, but I have to use a lot more, applied more often, then the brand I have used before.  </li>
            <li>The price is definitely reasonable, and the hold is great.  </li>
            <li>love the hold power of this wax, not too sticky, but doesn&#x27;t fall apart in 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light odor and the wax disappears into my mostly gray stache.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found some with stronger hold, some that were easier to use, and even one that smelled better.</li>
            <li>but I fully intend to revisit the Primary when my &#x27;stache has come into its own.  </li>
            <li>Lasts most of the day but is seemingly gone by the evening.</li>
            <li>I had to heat it up by wrapping it in a heating pad for 30 minutes on top of a running dishwasher.  </li>
            <li>Caveat: I am, as I&#x27;m sure many are, growing out my mustache for Movember.</li>
            <li>I had to use my Layrite hair gel over top of it</li>
            <li>I need the extra hold of their &amp;#34;secondary&amp;#34; which is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions would be most helpful.  </li>
            <li>so I have been trying different products to see what works best for me.  </li>
            <li>However, I believe that there should be something printed on the tin or something that comes in the box explaining how to soften the wax safely.</li>
            <li>My husband was able to rub his thumb into the wax for a minute or two to soften it up.</li>
            <li>This worked much better than warming it with a touch or in a hand/pocket etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Softening the wax was probably the most consuming part of testing this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also been \\&quot;Kiss tested\\&quot; and it&#x27;s been Wife approved! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>The wax also (if left on hands) is great for cuticles!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also been \\&quot;Kiss tested\\&quot; and it&#x27;s been Wife approved! :)  </li>
            <li>The wax also (if left on hands) is great for cuticles!</li>
            <li>, it would be even better.</li>
            <li>I have officially fallen in love with this company.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect or how to use it.</li>
            <li>I love the way his beard looks and feels, as does he.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the most perfect moustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great hold for much of the day, easy to apply, &amp; enjoyable scent.  </li>
            <li>I like a wax that is easy to apply, easy to remove, gives a  nice sheen, smells good, has natural ingredients, and is effective throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going through various waxes for a while now, trying to find something that can give me a great hold, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li>does pretty good holding my mustache out of my mouth, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the hold</li>
            <li>High quality product with excellent ingredients and stellar &amp;#34;performance.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Just like the beard dry oil we were given to test out, this moustache wax is great!</li>
            <li>You Handlebar flexi-guitar pick that makes it easy to scrape the wax off the top and then move to my thumb and forefinger.</li>
            <li>The Primary works best for the middle of your stache and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the Primary wax.</li>
            <li>Fantastic primary mustache wax!</li>
            <li>The Wax holds very well over a good amount of time  </li>
            <li>This wax is much stiffer and a bit darker, both of which are good things about it in my mind.</li>
            <li>If you need a pretty good hold (not stiff) for your &#x27;stache, then this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very mild.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to soften</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to come off.</li>
            <li>I use that for the most troublesome times, and the Primary as my, well, primary.</li>
            <li>It does feel clean and healthy for my mustache though.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, not sticky or tacky.</li>
            <li>Until now, that has not been easy to accomplish for me.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the light scent, makes it enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>product arrived very quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>Holds really strong too.</li>
            <li>This is fine for me because I don&#x27;t wear my mustache that way.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with - great for someone just starting out or a mustache waxer with years of experience.  </li>
            <li>The ease with which I was able to shape my moustache was a pleasant surprise, and I only needed to apply it twice all day.</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference in how his beard looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I did not receive a discount or free products from CanYouHandlebar.</li>
            <li>received my Primary moustache wax</li>
            <li>It was so great to get an actual person addressing my concerns and explaining that it was in fact just the way it needed to be.</li>
            <li>Overall it has great hold</li>
            <li>got this free or discounted........</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>well, win some lose some.&amp;#34; Then out of the blue I get an email from Andy, the customer satisfaction person I&#x27;m assuming.</li>
            <li>He said I must have gotten a jar that was affected by sub-zero temps during shipping and would replace it for free.</li>
            <li>I am SO HAPPY with not only the product, but their customer service.</li>
            <li>Can you handle Bar Primary.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, you will get them all with Canyouhandlebar&#x27;s Primary Wax.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a happy man with well styled facial hair.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CanYouHandlebar Primary Moustache wax comes in a tin packaging.</li>
            <li>The wax blends nicely, once warmed and rubs very well into the hairs.</li>
            <li>The wax blends nicely, once warmed and rubs very well into the hairs.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and he prefers this brand to the several others he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>While this wax is great for making funky shapes and designs with your stache, it is also nice for everyday grooming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that all the ingredients are natural and good for your mustache.  </li>
            <li>I normally get poked with or end up eating his moustache when we try to kiss, but after using the wax it definitely makes kissing a much more pleasant experience!</li>
            <li>wax is good for giving a nice groomed look to any mustache,  it keeps your hairs in place and keeps you looking sharp all day</li>
            <li>Every product I&#x27;ve tried from CanYouHandleBar has been great, and if you want your beard to look healthy and professional,  I would highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li>It left his skin feeling soothed and his beard looked amazing!</li>
            <li>I gave this brand a try, and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Holds ok it&#x27;s just my face runs too hot</li>
            <li>So I was excited to have him try this product!&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>you can see in first photo, I was able to test all three products.</li>
            <li>As you can see in first photo, I was able to test all three products.</li>
            <li>The mustache wax is a good investment I think - maybe even a good gift for guys that are typically hard to find things for.  </li>
            <li>My wax came with a specially branded Can</li>
            <li>I will certainly order more when  I get to the bottom of this canister.</li>
            <li>The hold is excellent and it doesn&#x27;t leave my moustache hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li>This has a light fresh sent and isint goopy and</li>
            <li>It really tames his mustache, and he uses it for when he&#x27;s trimming his mustache to make sure his whiskers are even.</li>
            <li>The hold is good enough to keep the whiskers out of my pie hole and my wife hating the day I started growing it!</li>
            <li>My husband got this along with the secondary wax and it works great!</li>
            <li>this wax comes out of another great lakes state, so my recommendation would be that depending on your area, perhaps a can of the Secondary wax would do better for you than the Primary.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have found that beeswax has many uses and really can become a multi purpose</li>
            <li>This wax is ok, smells like straight beeswax because that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really has fallen in love with this mustache wax.</li>
            <li>He said the first application, he used too much and it was kind of gooky and super shiny.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>If taking too long, you could try more wax but more often than not it was a bit of a lost cause unless I was willing to invest 15-20 more minutes.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will probably be taking one of his tins (as I am trying both the primary and secondary products) for my own use!    </li>
            <li>Good stiff wax, works in easily enough, provides good hold for most conditions.</li>
            <li>Only a dab on each side is necessary to get your &#x27;stache looking and feeling its best.</li>
            <li>doesnt last the entire day though but still great quality!</li>
            <li>no color residue and isn&#x27;t super smelly</li>
            <li>It actually turned out to be really simple, which was great!</li>
            <li>Overall my Dad is very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>He had great success using the Secondary wax from this company, and wanted something with even more hold.</li>
            <li>It is good but does not hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li>I got my replacement extremely quickly and the new tin worked like magic.</li>
            <li>It may not have been long enough for the ideal curls, however this wax was strong and held it in place even after putting on a shirt and tugging on the mustache.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good overall, but</li>
            <li>CYHB seems to make good stuff, and I like supporting a local Michigan based business.</li>
            <li>Its pretty durable and the style will last for a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to get this product during a promotion so that I could share my honest and unbiased opinion with CanYouHandlebar Classic Scent Beard Dry Oil here with you.</li>
            <li>has a pretty good hold that will last the day if you use the right amount.</li>
            <li>I love it and will probably be taking one of his tins (as I am trying both the primary and secondary products) for my own use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li>There are no artificial dyes or fragrances</li>
            <li>/&gt;The folks at CanYouHandlebar were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
            <li>husband said he really liked this product and would be purchasing in the future</li>
            <li>Easily workable and the hold is decent.</li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacturer who responded immediately and sent a fresh can.  </li>
            <li>After either using warm water on the outside of the waterproof tin its packaged within, or rubbing the product vigorously between your fingers, the product is then applied.</li>
            <li>I was leery of too stiff a wax but after trying it I think this medium hold wax really is best for styling a mature, manageable mustache when unyielding, all-day hold isn&#x27;t required or desired.  </li>
            <li>its just right</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold without feeling too waxy.</li>
            <li>The scent will be applied to the moustache right under the nose, so keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients are:  Local Michigan Beeswax, USP Lanolin, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter and Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are to warm the wax in your pocket or (with the lid on) under hot water.</li>
            <li>My bf loves it and we both live the light scent.</li>
            <li>This is a great mid day wax to bring the stache back up after working all day.</li>
            <li>Apply from the middle to the outside and it looks great.</li>
            <li>but it does get kind of \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; and sets funny if he grows it out too long.</li>
            <li>was initially somewhat thrown by how rock solid the wax came, but as I illustrate in my video, I found the solidity worked out great for me.  </li>
            <li>Soften it up in a sink of hot water (tin is pretty water tight if you keep it right side up), and it is good to go by the time I&#x27;m out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t believe that it is strong enough for a full handlebar mustache.</li>
            <li>My bearded gentleman caller very much enjoys this product.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My husband has a gorgeous lumberjack mustache that can sometimes get a little ruffled.</li>
            <li>First time I have purchased a mustache wax.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>, I heat the tin using an old scent diffuser (with a tea light candle) that belongs to my wife.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I ordered my first can a month or so again.</li>
            <li>The application could be tricky for the beginner but not difficult to master.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about halfway through my first can which I started the beginning of June (almost exactly 3 months</li>
            <li>Both waxes need to be warmed up before using; I use hot water over the tins with the lids attached.  </li>
            <li>Only 4 starts because I don&#x27;t love the aroma of honey.</li>
            <li>this was my first moustache wax.  </li>
            <li>*tin will be hot after doing so,  handle with caution*&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>the tin can sit in hot water without messing up the label.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the manufacturer says it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>His beard was very shiny and looked like he had just been groomed at the barber!</li>
            <li>As a first time user, I selected this product based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>I put it in hot water.  </li>
            <li>I really want to use this product but haven&#x27;t had much success.  </li>
            <li>There is no weird smell and the wax holds its shape without melting or getting into food.</li>
            <li>Once I received it, I tried the methods recommended by other users to warm the wax.  </li>
            <li>That said however, I just got back from a month-long trip to Ohio, and the humidity was just too much for my moustache most days.  </li>
            <li>The second time that I tried this, I made sure to microwave the bowl of water and that made the water much hotter, leaving it only 5 minutes before it was able to be dug out without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hold is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t damage the mustache hairs, which is a major selling point for me.  </li>
            <li>Company stood behind it&#x27;s product beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The container is very manageable and easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>While my husband isnt normally the &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; type, this certainly helps keep his unruly moustache hair in line!</li>
            <li>Primary, secondary and dry beard oil are some great products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and has a subtle, pleasant smell that reminds me of Southern youth when honey...good honey...came with the comb in the jar.  </li>
            <li>I kind of expected things to be a little bit better considering</li>
            <li>It still keeps things out of my nose but doesn&#x27;t really keep things put so that I can shape the stache.  </li>
            <li>Holds its shape really well over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>and I really respect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the third kind he has tried, and the only one he really likes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know -</li>
            <li>email info on how to apply the wax was very helpful</li>
            <li>This wax is multi-purpose at my house and we all really like it and use it often.</li>

            <li>This wax is multi-purpose at my house and we all really like it and use it often.</li>
            <li>The ultra soften wax (or melted is much easier for me to work</li>
            <li>These guys really care.</li>
            <li>I sent him the whole set</li>
            <li>This wax however holds his mustache really well</li>
            <li>Which I really like because...</li>
            <li>My husband has a very manly beard and at times it can get unruly and very itchy for him.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>, we really don&#x27;t see a difference in either of them.</li>
            <li>, we really don&#x27;t see a difference in either of them.</li>
            <li>Hold varies on how much you use.</li>
            <li>He really loves the act that it has no scent.</li>
            <li>The wax is firm and holds his spectacular mustachio in place.</li>
            <li>I found that the wax only started to be come warm enough to mold between my fingers by about the 15 minute mark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hold was not very firm, but my mustache definitely feels softer and more train-able.</li>
            <li>easy to use as long as it is warmed up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to go overboard with curling irons, clamps, and anything else like that, just warm the can up in my armpit for a few minutes and warm the wax again in my fingers.  </li>
            <li>It keeps things clean, without being obviously gummy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any man who wants his moustache to look</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I didn&#x27;t order the entire daily care kit like I wish I should have after the fact since this product is that good.</li>
            <li>my entire trip, without using a lot more wax and twice as much time and occasionally a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I used a small bowl of warm water.</li>
            <li>Tried many different Waxes to train my moustache, have always come back to</li>
            <li>It was harder than I expected but that turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>particularly well</li>
            <li>Smells decent.</li>
            <li>It does have a decent hold, but I thought it would hold stronger with the name.  </li>
            <li>I tried the classic handlebar ( go figure).</li>
            <li>He simply scrapes a bit out using a guitar pic and warms it between his fingers and evenly distributes it through his beard then gives it a quick comb through.</li>
            <li>Put it under my thigh in my car and turned the seat warmers on high (20 min drive).  </li>
            <li>The primary is harder and needs to be softened.  </li>
            <li>Never having used any product before I didn&#x27;t know how to style really, so I chose a look I had seen on an old bus driver of mine.</li>
            <li>This wax has nearly no odor, goes on well, and holds well enough to get me through most of the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few of their products and each has been better than advertised.</li>
            <li>, otherwise you might have trouble getting the top off.</li>
            <li>The seller wrote me back immediately and explained that the beeswax in the product makes it hard at room temperature and it must be warmed up by placing in a pool or warm water or in your pocket to get it to the right consistency before using.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described and it has enough body to the formula that it is more of a solid consistency than the Vaseline consistency of other brands (and this was exactly what</li>
            <li>So far my husband has used it twice, it does allow him to manage his moustache slightly and gives it a healthy thicker look.</li>
            <li>I have used the secondary wax for a few months, and I have been very pleased, so I decided to give the Primary wax a try.  </li>
            <li>I live in Kentucky (a humid state) and work in a factory where the sweat pours.</li>
            <li>(For a more intense handlebar, I recommend CanYouHandlebar&#x27;s Secondary wax.)</li>
            <li>I would heartily recommend this product to anyone interested in shaping their facial hair.</li>
            <li>I am willing to update this review and let you all know after 1-2 weeks if anyone is wanting to know the overall benefits and cons.</li>
            <li>So far he does like it!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my partner who decided to grow out his facial hair for the first time.</li>
            <li>He definitely likes this brand better than any other now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with a mustache.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using any type of facial hair wax.</li>
            <li>I have very course and curly facial hair, without a good wax I look like a confused walrus.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with when a little heat is applied.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hairs soft, NOT STIFF!</li>
            <li>Leaves the hairs soft, NOT STIFF!</li>
            <li>Merely by rubbing my forefinger in a circular motion across the top, swiping across the surface of my moustache, repeating a few times while combing out the hairs, I get more than enough to get all my wires to face the same way.  :)</li>
            <li>wax has a very light scent - having a hard time naming the smell, something along the lines of soap or vanilla</li>
            <li>I also like the lanolin in it because I use it to clear up my sons sores on his mouth instead of nipple cream.</li>
            <li>Made is beard softer instantly Would recommend this product for anyone that wants to take care of their beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>Just realize that if you need more control you should buy the secondary wax.</li>
            <li>The wax is natural feeling and helps keep the mustache in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every day for nearly two consecutive years.</li>
            <li>Do you really want to use such a product?</li>
            <li>Make&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s beard manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and have had a handlebar mustache for 45 years.</li>
            <li>Even after setting it, it&#x27;s still on the soft side.  </li>
            <li>Soft, but now and then you&#x27;ll get a whiff of it and think &amp;</li>
            <li>Stays soft but holds in place</li>
            <li>I suggest getting a small chunk and rubbing between your fingers til it becomes easily manageable,  or get a hairdryer, put it on the hottest setting  and hold it over the tin for a minute.  </li>
            <li>Primary is great for everyday use and the secondary if you want the really firm Salvador Dali look!  </li>
            <li>you live in a dry state like I do, I&#x27;ve found this wax to work particularly well, and if I put on in the morning, I almost never need to retouch.  </li>
            <li>He had looked all over the local stores to find mustache wax, but all the varieties available were for men with black hair or for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to buy their secondary wax for the end curls (although I will have to wait until next year to try it, as my mustache has been trimmed back to normal length).</li>
            <li>It holds strong and if needed isn&#x27;t hard to wash out.</li>
            <li>Very soothing on cracked and dry hands or cuticles.</li>
            <li>Very soothing on cracked and dry hands or cuticles.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I apply, it fails to hold for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I mean, serously, this should be an easy process, not a cumbersome one.  </li>
            <li>Hard wax but works in smoothly....</li>
            <li>I ordered both the primary and secondary.  </li>
            <li>You Handlebar Primary and Secondary moustache</li>
            <li>I bought both the primary and the secondary for my husband, who loves his mustache.</li>
            <li>l brushed it in, looked natural and held well.  </li>
            <li>which apparently is a thing?  </li>
            <li>That being said, be careful with how much you apply.</li>
            <li>however I found that it was entirely too soft to meet my needs.</li>
            <li>Recently shaved off my beard and left a nice handlebar moustache behind.  </li>
            <li>In fact, not very far from where we live.</li>

            <li>I am unable to write a full review on any significant changes since it has only been a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Indeed, no single wax has had these qualities in the aggregate.</li>
            <li>The Primary &amp; Secondary waxes (Which, in our opinion both work about the same-look the same-effects are the same etc)</li>
            <li>The Primary &amp; Secondary waxes (Which, in our opinion both work about the same-look the same-effects are the same etc)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a batch that&#x27;s defective; it&#x27;s pretty soft as compared to other comments that say it&#x27;s a lot harder.  </li>
            <li>Not long after I received an email from the seller &#x27;canyouhandlebar&#x27;, giving me tips on using the wax and asking if i had any questions.</li>
            <li>I find I have trouble getting a consistent result day after day.  </li>
            <li>Great product but a little too soft, the secondary is way too hard</li>
            <li>when I received the wax (for my hubby&#x27;s stocking this Christmas) it was super hard</li>
            <li>The wax washes off easily without leaving behind any residue.</li>
            <li>Also, I like the fact that Primary Wax moisturizes the hair, doesn&#x27;t clump up, and doesn&#x27;t dry so hard that it pulls out hair.</li>
            <li>You don’t need very much of this product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Little to no scent and work really well.</li>

            <li> These would make a really nice Fathers Day or Christmas basket gift item!    </li>

            <li> Provides good hold</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a good wax with good hold, this is it.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>

            <li> This product has a pleasant smell and a very convenient package (it fits perfectly in the watch pocket of my 501&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> Great hold, smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> My first moustache wax, so I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of perfect application.</li>
            <li> Hilarious!</li>
            <li> What more could a guy want?!</li>
            <li> I love that it has a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> It has made his mustache a lot healthier as well as being amazing for his mustache  curls.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never tried anything kind of beard products and says this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a review from my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My mustache tends to have a mind of its own, and this tames it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a wax that didn&#x27;t smell or leave any kind of residue or flakes.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I agreed to provide honest feedback when posting my review.  </li>
            <li> (i now warm up the wax between fingers).</li>
            <li> but the shorter whiskers still wanted to go their own way and did.  </li>
            <li> With that in mind, I liked this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a nice conditioning effect,  taming those wiry hairs and making them softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li> but you have to keep it warm to use it.</li>
            <li> There is no scent to this product which my husband liked because some products make him “smell like a flower”.</li>
            <li> We recieved this product to test in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> It says to either warm in warm water OR in a pocket.</li>
            <li> We also used the warm water bath method.</li>
            <li> Which was nice.</li>
            <li> These would make a really nice Fathers Day or Christmas basket gift</li>
            <li> Which was nice.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth the price!</li>
            <li> With that particular technique, it seems that the results are best the quickest it can be done (before the wax hardens, I&#x27;d imagine).  </li>
            <li> It is the best wax I have ever used, and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I saw this Primary mustache wax discounted during a promotion and of course I bought it, and my husband is just as happy with the Primary!</li>
            <li> Has a light and pleasant beeswax smell to it when applying.</li>
            <li> has a very strong beeswax scent to it.</li>
            <li> After using the primary wax it feels really good.</li>
            <li> Nice hold, lasts most of the day for my unruly stache.</li>
            <li> the most part, it shapes nicely.  </li>
            <li> By far the best mustache was I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> He carries it with him throughout the day in the rare case he needs to reapply for those fly away beard hairs.</li>
            <li> Works in to your mustache really easily, has a great (light) scent of beeswax.</li>
            <li> Easy with this wax!</li>
            <li> I received the wax at a discount as part of a promotion for my honest review and my whole family is happily participating.</li>
            <li> I received the wax at a discount as part of a promotion for my honest review and my whole family is happily participating.</li>
            <li> Discounted product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.</li>
            <li> He especially liked the fact that it just smelled like beeswax and no other addins.</li>
            <li> It is easy to warm in his pocket or with my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> The all day hold ensured his mustache looked handsome and unruffled without reapplying.</li>
            <li> Stylish and convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love you.</li>
            <li> I tried another brand but wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on melting the two together soon :)</li>
            <li> It works, but I have to use a lot more, applied more often, then the brand I have used before.  </li>
            <li> The price is definitely reasonable, and the hold is great.  </li>
            <li> love the hold power of this wax, not too sticky, but doesn&#x27;t fall apart in 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light odor and the wax disappears into my mostly gray stache.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found some with stronger hold, some that were easier to use, and even one that smelled better.</li>
            <li> but I fully intend to revisit the Primary when my &#x27;stache has come into its own.  </li>
            <li> Lasts most of the day but is seemingly gone by the evening.</li>
            <li> I had to heat it up by wrapping it in a heating pad for 30 minutes on top of a running dishwasher.  </li>
            <li> Caveat: I am, as I&#x27;m sure many are, growing out my mustache for Movember.</li>
            <li> I had to use my Layrite hair gel over top of it</li>
            <li> I need the extra hold of their &amp;#34;secondary&amp;#34; which is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Any suggestions would be most helpful.  </li>
            <li> so I have been trying different products to see what works best for me.  </li>
            <li> However, I believe that there should be something printed on the tin or something that comes in the box explaining how to soften the wax safely.</li>
            <li> My husband was able to rub his thumb into the wax for a minute or two to soften it up.</li>
            <li> This worked much better than warming it with a touch or in a hand/pocket etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Softening the wax was probably the most consuming part of testing this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also been \\&quot;Kiss tested\\&quot; and it&#x27;s been Wife approved! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> The wax also (if left on hands) is great for cuticles!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also been \\&quot;Kiss tested\\&quot; and it&#x27;s been Wife approved! :)  </li>
            <li> The wax also (if left on hands) is great for cuticles!</li>
            <li> , it would be even better.</li>
            <li> I have officially fallen in love with this company.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect or how to use it.</li>
            <li> I love the way his beard looks and feels, as does he.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the most perfect moustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great hold for much of the day, easy to apply, &amp; enjoyable scent.  </li>
            <li> I like a wax that is easy to apply, easy to remove, gives a  nice sheen, smells good, has natural ingredients, and is effective throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going through various waxes for a while now, trying to find something that can give me a great hold, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> does pretty good holding my mustache out of my mouth, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the hold</li>
            <li> High quality product with excellent ingredients and stellar &amp;#34;performance.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Just like the beard dry oil we were given to test out, this moustache wax is great!</li>
            <li> You Handlebar flexi-guitar pick that makes it easy to scrape the wax off the top and then move to my thumb and forefinger.</li>
            <li> The Primary works best for the middle of your stache and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the Primary wax.</li>
            <li> Fantastic primary mustache wax!</li>
            <li> The Wax holds very well over a good amount of time  </li>
            <li> This wax is much stiffer and a bit darker, both of which are good things about it in my mind.</li>
            <li> If you need a pretty good hold (not stiff) for your &#x27;stache, then this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very mild.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to soften</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to come off.</li>
            <li> I use that for the most troublesome times, and the Primary as my, well, primary.</li>
            <li> It does feel clean and healthy for my mustache though.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, not sticky or tacky.</li>
            <li> Until now, that has not been easy to accomplish for me.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the light scent, makes it enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> product arrived very quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Holds really strong too.</li>
            <li> This is fine for me because I don&#x27;t wear my mustache that way.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with - great for someone just starting out or a mustache waxer with years of experience.  </li>
            <li> The ease with which I was able to shape my moustache was a pleasant surprise, and I only needed to apply it twice all day.</li>
            <li> and I can see a huge difference in how his beard looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I did not receive a discount or free products from CanYouHandlebar.</li>
            <li> received my Primary moustache wax</li>
            <li> It was so great to get an actual person addressing my concerns and explaining that it was in fact just the way it needed to be.</li>
            <li> Overall it has great hold</li>
            <li> got this free or discounted........</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> well, win some lose some.&amp;#34; Then out of the blue I get an email from Andy, the customer satisfaction person I&#x27;m assuming.</li>
            <li> He said I must have gotten a jar that was affected by sub-zero temps during shipping and would replace it for free.</li>
            <li> I am SO HAPPY with not only the product, but their customer service.</li>
            <li> Can you handle Bar Primary.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, you will get them all with Canyouhandlebar&#x27;s Primary Wax.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a happy man with well styled facial hair.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CanYouHandlebar Primary Moustache wax comes in a tin packaging.</li>
            <li> The wax blends nicely, once warmed and rubs very well into the hairs.</li>
            <li> The wax blends nicely, once warmed and rubs very well into the hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and he prefers this brand to the several others he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> While this wax is great for making funky shapes and designs with your stache, it is also nice for everyday grooming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that all the ingredients are natural and good for your mustache.  </li>
            <li> I normally get poked with or end up eating his moustache when we try to kiss, but after using the wax it definitely makes kissing a much more pleasant experience!</li>
            <li> wax is good for giving a nice groomed look to any mustache,  it keeps your hairs in place and keeps you looking sharp all day</li>
            <li> Every product I&#x27;ve tried from CanYouHandleBar has been great, and if you want your beard to look healthy and professional,  I would highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li> It left his skin feeling soothed and his beard looked amazing!</li>
            <li> I gave this brand a try, and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Holds ok it&#x27;s just my face runs too hot</li>
            <li> So I was excited to have him try this product!&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> you can see in first photo, I was able to test all three products.</li>
            <li> As you can see in first photo, I was able to test all three products.</li>
            <li> The mustache wax is a good investment I think - maybe even a good gift for guys that are typically hard to find things for.  </li>
            <li> My wax came with a specially branded Can</li>
            <li> I will certainly order more when  I get to the bottom of this canister.</li>
            <li> The hold is excellent and it doesn&#x27;t leave my moustache hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> This has a light fresh sent and isint goopy and</li>
            <li> It really tames his mustache, and he uses it for when he&#x27;s trimming his mustache to make sure his whiskers are even.</li>
            <li> The hold is good enough to keep the whiskers out of my pie hole and my wife hating the day I started growing it!</li>
            <li> My husband got this along with the secondary wax and it works great!</li>
            <li> this wax comes out of another great lakes state, so my recommendation would be that depending on your area, perhaps a can of the Secondary wax would do better for you than the Primary.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have found that beeswax has many uses and really can become a multi purpose</li>
            <li> This wax is ok, smells like straight beeswax because that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really has fallen in love with this mustache wax.</li>
            <li> He said the first application, he used too much and it was kind of gooky and super shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> If taking too long, you could try more wax but more often than not it was a bit of a lost cause unless I was willing to invest 15-20 more minutes.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will probably be taking one of his tins (as I am trying both the primary and secondary products) for my own use!    </li>
            <li> Good stiff wax, works in easily enough, provides good hold for most conditions.</li>
            <li> Only a dab on each side is necessary to get your &#x27;stache looking and feeling its best.</li>
            <li> doesnt last the entire day though but still great quality!</li>
            <li> no color residue and isn&#x27;t super smelly</li>
            <li> It actually turned out to be really simple, which was great!</li>
            <li> Overall my Dad is very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> He had great success using the Secondary wax from this company, and wanted something with even more hold.</li>
            <li> It is good but does not hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> I got my replacement extremely quickly and the new tin worked like magic.</li>
            <li> It may not have been long enough for the ideal curls, however this wax was strong and held it in place even after putting on a shirt and tugging on the mustache.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good overall, but</li>
            <li> CYHB seems to make good stuff, and I like supporting a local Michigan based business.</li>
            <li> Its pretty durable and the style will last for a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to get this product during a promotion so that I could share my honest and unbiased opinion with CanYouHandlebar Classic Scent Beard Dry Oil here with you.</li>
            <li> has a pretty good hold that will last the day if you use the right amount.</li>
            <li> I love it and will probably be taking one of his tins (as I am trying both the primary and secondary products) for my own use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li> There are no artificial dyes or fragrances</li>
            <li> /&gt;The folks at CanYouHandlebar were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
            <li> husband said he really liked this product and would be purchasing in the future</li>
            <li> Easily workable and the hold is decent.</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacturer who responded immediately and sent a fresh can.  </li>
            <li> After either using warm water on the outside of the waterproof tin its packaged within, or rubbing the product vigorously between your fingers, the product is then applied.</li>
            <li> I was leery of too stiff a wax but after trying it I think this medium hold wax really is best for styling a mature, manageable mustache when unyielding, all-day hold isn&#x27;t required or desired.  </li>
            <li> its just right</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of hold without feeling too waxy.</li>
            <li> The scent will be applied to the moustache right under the nose, so keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingredients are:  Local Michigan Beeswax, USP Lanolin, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter and Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are to warm the wax in your pocket or (with the lid on) under hot water.</li>
            <li> My bf loves it and we both live the light scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great mid day wax to bring the stache back up after working all day.</li>
            <li> Apply from the middle to the outside and it looks great.</li>
            <li> but it does get kind of \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; and sets funny if he grows it out too long.</li>
            <li> was initially somewhat thrown by how rock solid the wax came, but as I illustrate in my video, I found the solidity worked out great for me.  </li>
            <li> Soften it up in a sink of hot water (tin is pretty water tight if you keep it right side up), and it is good to go by the time I&#x27;m out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t believe that it is strong enough for a full handlebar mustache.</li>
            <li> My bearded gentleman caller very much enjoys this product.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My husband has a gorgeous lumberjack mustache that can sometimes get a little ruffled.</li>
            <li> First time I have purchased a mustache wax.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> , I heat the tin using an old scent diffuser (with a tea light candle) that belongs to my wife.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first can a month or so again.</li>
            <li> The application could be tricky for the beginner but not difficult to master.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about halfway through my first can which I started the beginning of June (almost exactly 3 months</li>
            <li> Both waxes need to be warmed up before using; I use hot water over the tins with the lids attached.  </li>
            <li> Only 4 starts because I don&#x27;t love the aroma of honey.</li>
            <li> this was my first moustache wax.  </li>
            <li> *tin will be hot after doing so,  handle with caution*&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> the tin can sit in hot water without messing up the label.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the manufacturer says it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> His beard was very shiny and looked like he had just been groomed at the barber!</li>
            <li> As a first time user, I selected this product based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> I put it in hot water.  </li>
            <li> I really want to use this product but haven&#x27;t had much success.  </li>
            <li> There is no weird smell and the wax holds its shape without melting or getting into food.</li>
            <li> Once I received it, I tried the methods recommended by other users to warm the wax.  </li>
            <li> That said however, I just got back from a month-long trip to Ohio, and the humidity was just too much for my moustache most days.  </li>
            <li> The second time that I tried this, I made sure to microwave the bowl of water and that made the water much hotter, leaving it only 5 minutes before it was able to be dug out without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hold is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t damage the mustache hairs, which is a major selling point for me.  </li>
            <li> Company stood behind it&#x27;s product beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The container is very manageable and easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> While my husband isnt normally the &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; type, this certainly helps keep his unruly moustache hair in line!</li>
            <li> Primary, secondary and dry beard oil are some great products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has a subtle, pleasant smell that reminds me of Southern youth when honey...good honey...came with the comb in the jar.  </li>
            <li> I kind of expected things to be a little bit better considering</li>
            <li> It still keeps things out of my nose but doesn&#x27;t really keep things put so that I can shape the stache.  </li>
            <li> Holds its shape really well over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> and I really respect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the third kind he has tried, and the only one he really likes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know -</li>
            <li> email info on how to apply the wax was very helpful</li>
            <li> This wax is multi-purpose at my house and we all really like it and use it often.</li>
            <li> This wax is multi-purpose at my house and we all really like it and use it often.</li>
            <li> This wax is multi-purpose at my house and we all really like it and use it often.</li>
            <li> The ultra soften wax (or melted is much easier for me to work</li>
            <li> These guys really care.</li>
            <li> I sent him the whole set</li>
            <li> This wax however holds his mustache really well</li>
            <li> Which I really like because...</li>
            <li> My husband has a very manly beard and at times it can get unruly and very itchy for him.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> , we really don&#x27;t see a difference in either of them.</li>
            <li> , we really don&#x27;t see a difference in either of them.</li>
            <li> Hold varies on how much you use.</li>
            <li> He really loves the act that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> The wax is firm and holds his spectacular mustachio in place.</li>
            <li> I found that the wax only started to be come warm enough to mold between my fingers by about the 15 minute mark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hold was not very firm, but my mustache definitely feels softer and more train-able.</li>
            <li> easy to use as long as it is warmed up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to go overboard with curling irons, clamps, and anything else like that, just warm the can up in my armpit for a few minutes and warm the wax again in my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It keeps things clean, without being obviously gummy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to any man who wants his moustache to look</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I didn&#x27;t order the entire daily care kit like I wish I should have after the fact since this product is that good.</li>
            <li> my entire trip, without using a lot more wax and twice as much time and occasionally a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I used a small bowl of warm water.</li>
            <li> Tried many different Waxes to train my moustache, have always come back to</li>
            <li> It was harder than I expected but that turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> particularly well</li>
            <li> Smells decent.</li>
            <li> It does have a decent hold, but I thought it would hold stronger with the name.  </li>
            <li> I tried the classic handlebar ( go figure).</li>
            <li> He simply scrapes a bit out using a guitar pic and warms it between his fingers and evenly distributes it through his beard then gives it a quick comb through.</li>
            <li> Put it under my thigh in my car and turned the seat warmers on high (20 min drive).  </li>
            <li> The primary is harder and needs to be softened.  </li>
            <li> Never having used any product before I didn&#x27;t know how to style really, so I chose a look I had seen on an old bus driver of mine.</li>
            <li> This wax has nearly no odor, goes on well, and holds well enough to get me through most of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of their products and each has been better than advertised.</li>
            <li> , otherwise you might have trouble getting the top off.</li>
            <li> The seller wrote me back immediately and explained that the beeswax in the product makes it hard at room temperature and it must be warmed up by placing in a pool or warm water or in your pocket to get it to the right consistency before using.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described and it has enough body to the formula that it is more of a solid consistency than the Vaseline consistency of other brands (and this was exactly what</li>
            <li> So far my husband has used it twice, it does allow him to manage his moustache slightly and gives it a healthy thicker look.</li>
            <li> I have used the secondary wax for a few months, and I have been very pleased, so I decided to give the Primary wax a try.  </li>
            <li> I live in Kentucky (a humid state) and work in a factory where the sweat pours.</li>
            <li> (For a more intense handlebar, I recommend CanYouHandlebar&#x27;s Secondary wax.)</li>
            <li> I would heartily recommend this product to anyone interested in shaping their facial hair.</li>
            <li> I am willing to update this review and let you all know after 1-2 weeks if anyone is wanting to know the overall benefits and cons.</li>
            <li> So far he does like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my partner who decided to grow out his facial hair for the first time.</li>
            <li> He definitely likes this brand better than any other now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with a mustache.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using any type of facial hair wax.</li>
            <li> I have very course and curly facial hair, without a good wax I look like a confused walrus.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with when a little heat is applied.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hairs soft, NOT STIFF!</li>
            <li> Leaves the hairs soft, NOT STIFF!</li>
            <li> Merely by rubbing my forefinger in a circular motion across the top, swiping across the surface of my moustache, repeating a few times while combing out the hairs, I get more than enough to get all my wires to face the same way.  :)</li>
            <li> wax has a very light scent - having a hard time naming the smell, something along the lines of soap or vanilla</li>
            <li> I also like the lanolin in it because I use it to clear up my sons sores on his mouth instead of nipple cream.</li>
            <li> Made is beard softer instantly Would recommend this product for anyone that wants to take care of their beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Just realize that if you need more control you should buy the secondary wax.</li>
            <li> The wax is natural feeling and helps keep the mustache in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for nearly two consecutive years.</li>
            <li> Do you really want to use such a product?</li>
            <li> Make&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s beard manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and have had a handlebar mustache for 45 years.</li>
            <li> Even after setting it, it&#x27;s still on the soft side.  </li>
            <li> Soft, but now and then you&#x27;ll get a whiff of it and think &amp;</li>
            <li> Stays soft but holds in place</li>
            <li> I suggest getting a small chunk and rubbing between your fingers til it becomes easily manageable,  or get a hairdryer, put it on the hottest setting  and hold it over the tin for a minute.  </li>
            <li> Primary is great for everyday use and the secondary if you want the really firm Salvador Dali look!  </li>
            <li> you live in a dry state like I do, I&#x27;ve found this wax to work particularly well, and if I put on in the morning, I almost never need to retouch.  </li>
            <li> He had looked all over the local stores to find mustache wax, but all the varieties available were for men with black hair or for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> I liked it enough to buy their secondary wax for the end curls (although I will have to wait until next year to try it, as my mustache has been trimmed back to normal length).</li>
            <li> It holds strong and if needed isn&#x27;t hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on cracked and dry hands or cuticles.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on cracked and dry hands or cuticles.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I apply, it fails to hold for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I mean, serously, this should be an easy process, not a cumbersome one.  </li>
            <li> Hard wax but works in smoothly....</li>
            <li> I ordered both the primary and secondary.  </li>
            <li> You Handlebar Primary and Secondary moustache</li>
            <li> I bought both the primary and the secondary for my husband, who loves his mustache.</li>
            <li> l brushed it in, looked natural and held well.  </li>
            <li> which apparently is a thing?  </li>
            <li> That being said, be careful with how much you apply.</li>
            <li> however I found that it was entirely too soft to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> Recently shaved off my beard and left a nice handlebar moustache behind.  </li>
            <li> In fact, not very far from where we live.</li>
            <li> In fact, not very far from where we live.</li>
            <li> I am unable to write a full review on any significant changes since it has only been a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Indeed, no single wax has had these qualities in the aggregate.</li>
            <li> The Primary &amp; Secondary waxes (Which, in our opinion both work about the same-look the same-effects are the same etc)</li>
            <li> The Primary &amp; Secondary waxes (Which, in our opinion both work about the same-look the same-effects are the same etc)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a batch that&#x27;s defective; it&#x27;s pretty soft as compared to other comments that say it&#x27;s a lot harder.  </li>
            <li> Not long after I received an email from the seller &#x27;canyouhandlebar&#x27;, giving me tips on using the wax and asking if i had any questions.</li>
            <li> I find I have trouble getting a consistent result day after day.  </li>
            <li> Great product but a little too soft, the secondary is way too hard</li>
            <li> when I received the wax (for my hubby&#x27;s stocking this Christmas) it was super hard</li>
            <li> The wax washes off easily without leaving behind any residue.</li>
            <li> Also, I like the fact that Primary Wax moisturizes the hair, doesn&#x27;t clump up, and doesn&#x27;t dry so hard that it pulls out hair.</li>
            <li> You don’t need very much of this product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Little to no scent and work really well.</li>
            <li> I turned right around and bought the stiffer Secondary Wax for now</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of control to slowly train the whiskers.</li>
            <li> Individual long hairs don&#x27;t stick together, no matter how much I use, and no matter how I try and set it; cool air from the hair dryer, cold water, etc.  </li>
            <li> i have been playing with that over the past week to determine how much to use</li>
            <li> but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> Given the total failure of this product I am not inclined to purchase the allegedly better Secondary wax.</li>
            <li> I, for one, want to know exactly what I&#x27;m using, and Primary Wax lists all of its ingredients right on the label; there is no petroleum jelly or other nasty stuff involved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the handlebar mustache experience and bought this wax to tame and shape my untrained lip whiskers...</li>
            <li> Massive improvement over the waxes I tried over a decade ago - especially the ones that left little \\&quot;booger-like\\&quot; nuggets in my hairs.  </li>
            <li> The secondary is softer and I find it easier to use and holds really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just long on the sides.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it the outside was liquid wax and there was still a hockey puck of a center part.  </li>
            <li> My partner has a brown (with some grey) beard</li>
            <li> BTW, several other brands have &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> husband doesn&#x27;t have a very long mustache</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> and I was kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> He works outside in subzero temps everyday so his skin gets really dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also means this little tin will be lasting me AGES.  </li>
            <li> For comparability the other brand would need to be applied 4-6 times a day, and as I mentioned this wax only needed a slight adjustment well into my shift.</li>
            <li> Enough hold without being too hard for daily use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not much of a smell to it at all</li>
            <li> only a hair dryer will soften it for a few seconds</li>
            <li> Really not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, on time with no issues.  </li>
            <li> He immediately regretted his decision and spent all day looking for the CanYouHandlebar brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they tended to be too sticky and the packaging was not very portable.  </li>
            <li> For $15, I expected this to work much better than it does.  :(</li>
            <li> Other waxes just don&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other waxes, this stuff holds well</li>
            <li> Applying it in larger amounts to just the ends works no better than combing it through my mustache.  </li>
            <li> There are other methods that work just as well.  </li>
            <li> There are no perfumes or other scents.</li>
            <li> Which made things a bit difficult for my husband and I at first.</li>
            <li> I am head over heels over buying local and fully support our small businesses and handmade</li>
            <li> partner lost the tin the other day and purchased another brand of wax at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> After trying the product several different ways and in different amounts, it fails to hold my mustache together for any longer than a half hour or so.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s VERY prickly and uncomfortable for me to kiss or nuzzle him when it&#x27;s grown out.</li>
            <li> It is naturally harder in the container than other brands I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> However, the longer mine gets the less control this wax has.  </li>
            <li> i typically apply once in the morning and once after lunch.  </li>
            <li> My &#x27;stache is a half horseshoe, and I keep it neat and trim.</li>
            <li> My go-to Stache Wax along with the Secondary Stiff Wax by the same company.  </li>
            <li> Scoop a little bit out and massage between your index fingers and thumbs.</li>
            <li> Just a little is needed.</li>
            <li> I am head over heels over buying local and fully support our small businesses and handmade products!!    </li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; wax for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this out for a few weeks before writing a review.  </li>
            <li> but my toddler son found my hiding spot and gave it to daddy with a few others.</li>
            <li> Holds well and isn&#x27;t really heavy.  </li>
            <li> is a stiff wax so it does need to be warmed up a bit before applying.  </li>
            <li> The hold is not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong scent which he likes.</li>
            <li> How do you tame a moustache like my husband&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> He would get a little curl by the middle of his lip and it looked silly.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get out of the container,</li>
            <li> A little softer than the secondary wax, it smoothes in between my fingers like buttah.</li>
            <li> Came dried out and rock hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This is the only brand of wax I&#x27;ve ever used, so sorry that I can&#x27;t give you anything to which to compare it.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, I have gotten tired of having to heat up other waxes with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever got the moustache looking</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Hard as a brick.  </li>
            <li> The  wax is for holding a stache style so the consistency at room temp is hard.  </li>
            <li> This company makes their mustache wax without any sticky or greasy residue, and there is no real scent or weird colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, this would have been the strongest wax I had ever tried, if I hadn&#x27;t also picked up a can of CanYouHandlebar Secondary.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a stronger wax use the secondary.</li>
            <li> I will have to try the secondary.</li>
            <li> the Secondary is used for the ends.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, gang, I&#x27;m not impressed with all the natural ingredients, etc., it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> If you use this in conjunction with the secondary wax that they offer, it&#x27;ll hold your mustache up all day.</li>
            <li> Then again I have thick hair for a beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> I mean what guy hasn&#x27;t thought about styling his stache.</li>
            <li> so he was unable to use other brands of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had been using  wax in a tube, it was the same brand as an aftershave I like, but it had a smell I found unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Not thinking I would actually get a response i expressed my concerns about the hard wax and asked if I had gotten a bad batch.</li>
            <li> hold is too weak for a longer moustache</li>
            <li> I purchased a tin recently and am wholly disappointed.</li>
            <li> (he&#x27;s very hard to please).</li>
            <li> wax is very hard to apply and it leaves a residue in my hair even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> &quot; it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very hard in the hairs, doesn&#x27;t flake or get gunky.</li>

            <li> From other reviews I think I&#x27;ve got a bad one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product does not work for me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am not personally using it but my husband seems to be happy</li>
            <li> use. Made is beard softer instantly Would recommend this product for anyone that wants to take care of their beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> I did not receive a discount or free products from CanYouHandlebar. This is a review from my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;I received my Primary moustache wax and I absolutely love it. I had never used wax for my moustache before, I&#x27;ve only used hair gel. After using the primary wax it feels really good. The hold is excellent and it doesn&#x27;t leave my moustache hard and crunchy. It&#x27;s as if I don&#x27;t have any product at all. I would highly recommend this product to any man who wants his moustache to look it&#x27;s best. The quality is worth the price. The only downside is that I didn&#x27;t order the entire daily care kit like I wish I should have after the fact since this product is that good. Maybe I will order it once my wax gets used up.</li>
            <li> I got this to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; my mustache.  The hairs kept tickling my nose.  It helped with that.  However, the longer mine gets the less control this wax has.  It still keeps things out of my nose but doesn&#x27;t really keep things put so that I can shape the stache.  This is by design.  Just realize that if you need more control you should buy the secondary wax.</li>
            <li> The wax works great! Holds its shape really well over the course of the day. Holds really strong too. My mustache tends to have a mind of its own, and this tames it.</li>
            <li> Works great and what I wanted. I was looking for a wax that didn&#x27;t smell or leave any kind of residue or flakes. It holds the hair in place and out of my mouth but I don&#x27;t believe that it is strong enough for a full handlebar mustache. This is fine for me because I don&#x27;t wear my mustache that way.</li>
            <li> Has the same manly scent as Snow Seal so your moustache can smell as manly as your boots.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Provides good hold and it&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The perfect solution to all my needs.  Shopped around but nothing works like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zach</li>
            <li> The mustache wax is a good investment I think - maybe even a good gift for guys that are typically hard to find things for.  This product comes from a company that does everything by hand and makes the products in the USA and I really respect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax has a very light scent - having a hard time naming the smell, something along the lines of soap or vanilla but it&#x27;s very mild.  There are no artificial dyes or fragrances so the scent probably comes from the shea butter or coconut oil.  The ingredients are:  Local Michigan Beeswax, USP Lanolin, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter and Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are to warm the wax in your pocket or (with the lid on) under hot water. Scoop a little bit out and massage between your index fingers and thumbs. Apply from the inside toward the curls. Once worked all the way into the mustache, without clumps, comb the mustache out with a comb and shape the curls.  Of course curls are optional but the point is to work it through thoroughly before combing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folks at CanYouHandlebar were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.  Therefore, I agreed to provide honest feedback when posting my review.  Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I can recommend this product! Great hold for much of the day, easy to apply, &amp; enjoyable scent.  Just the right amount of control to slowly train the whiskers.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get out of the container, but I guess that&#x27;s the nature of stache wax. I heated it up with a blow-drier and that helped.</li>
            <li> when I received the wax (for my hubby&#x27;s stocking this Christmas) it was super hard and I was kind of disappointed. Not long after I received an email from the seller &#x27;canyouhandlebar&#x27;, giving me tips on using the wax and asking if i had any questions. Not thinking I would actually get a response i expressed my concerns about the hard wax and asked if I had gotten a bad batch. The seller wrote me back immediately and explained that the beeswax in the product makes it hard at room temperature and it must be warmed up by placing in a pool or warm water or in your pocket to get it to the right consistency before using. It was so great to get an actual person addressing my concerns and explaining that it was in fact just the way it needed to be. I like that once the wax gets to room temperature in my hubby&#x27;s stache it will have killer hold. Can&#x27;t wait till he gets his gift. Again great seller and communication, thank you!!</li>
            <li> My Dad really liked this wax he said it works great with a non greasy hold and does a good job keeping things under control.The wax is natural feeling and helps keep the mustache in place.The Wax holds very well over a good amount of time  It keeps things clean, without being obviously gummy. The wax washes off easily without leaving behind any residue. Overall my Dad is very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with when a little heat is applied. Got me about 8 hrs of hold through breakfast and lunch.</li>
            <li> My first moustache wax, so I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of perfect application. Overall it has great hold and I love the smell. Definitely a great product to begin training my moustache.</li>
            <li> I attend an annual event each December where the dress is Victorian.  That includes growing out my mustache to handlebar, and goatee.  I gave this brand a try, and was not disappointed.  It is naturally harder in the container than other brands I have used in the past.  This was not a problem when the tin was warmed up.  l brushed it in, looked natural and held well.  I liked it enough to buy their secondary wax for the end curls (although I will have to wait until next year to try it, as my mustache has been trimmed back to normal length).</li>
            <li> got this free or discounted........&lt;br /&gt;My husband said he really liked this product and would be purchasing in the future</li>
            <li> Pretty much the most perfect moustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used. Enough hold without being too hard for daily use. (For a more intense handlebar, I recommend CanYouHandlebar&#x27;s Secondary wax.)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this product for his moustache. He would get a little curl by the middle of his lip and it looked silly. This has a light fresh sent and isint goopy and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Reccomend for those unrully moustaches!</li>
            <li> How do you tame a moustache like my husband&#x27;s? Easy with this wax! My husband has a gorgeous lumberjack mustache that can sometimes get a little ruffled. He had great success using the Secondary wax from this company, and wanted something with even more hold. I saw this Primary mustache wax discounted during a promotion and of course I bought it, and my husband is just as happy with the Primary! This company makes their mustache wax without any sticky or greasy residue, and there is no real scent or weird colors. It really tames his mustache, and he uses it for when he&#x27;s trimming his mustache to make sure his whiskers are even. The all day hold ensured his mustache looked handsome and unruffled without reapplying. And when he&#x27;s feeling mischievous he lets our kids use the wax to turn the ends of his moustache into points or curlicues. Hilarious!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Great videos!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m voting this for my husband, whom I bought this wax for.  This is the third kind he has tried, and the only one he really likes.  It is easy to warm in his pocket or with my hair dryer.  It is helping him &#x27;train&#x27; his moustache.... which apparently is a thing?  I don&#x27;t really know - but I do know that I like the smell, or lack thereof​, and it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of kissing.  Bonus.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I&#x27;ve been going through various waxes for a while now, trying to find something that can give me a great hold, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried yet. That being said, be careful with how much you apply.</li>
            <li> The wax adds structure and allows to grow out the mo, moving it away from my mouth horizontally. Stylish and convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The email info on how to apply the wax was very helpful (i now warm up the wax between fingers). I use it to style my mo, and it also helps to shape my beard.</li>
            <li> Good and tacky wax! I have used a lot but this i have found to be the best.</li>
            <li> I got this waxer my husband and smells absolutely wonderful it&#x27;s not much of a smell to it at all but it does have a hint of the Shea butter and it&#x27;s just wonderful. It has made his mustache a lot healthier as well as being amazing for his mustache  curls. He uses this wax daily.&lt;br /&gt;My husband enjoys this mustache wax  because he doesn&#x27;t need a lot to do what he needs to do with his mustache it&#x27;s great quality it&#x27;s easy to soften it&#x27;s easy to apply and it&#x27;s easy to come off. I love that it has a pleasant smell so I&#x27;m not turned off when I go to kiss him! These are Absolutely my very own opinions after having tried this product at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> I initially got a defective tin of wax and thought the product sucked. I figured, &amp;#34;Oh well, win some lose some.&amp;#34; Then out of the blue I get an email from Andy, the customer satisfaction person I&#x27;m assuming. He asked how it was working and I told him my tale of woe. He said I must have gotten a jar that was affected by sub-zero temps during shipping and would replace it for free. I was so happy! I got my replacement extremely quickly and the new tin worked like magic. I am SO HAPPY with not only the product, but their customer service. Andy, you&#x27;re the man. I love you.</li>
            <li> Good stiff wax, works in easily enough, provides good hold for most conditions. Does have a bit of amber color to it, so if you have a white/gray mustache, it&#x27;s going to color it a bit. Only a problem if you don&#x27;t apply it throughout.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this would have been the strongest wax I had ever tried, if I hadn&#x27;t also picked up a can of CanYouHandlebar Secondary. I use that for the most troublesome times, and the Primary as my, well, primary.</li>
            <li> once you learn how to use mustache wax this products works to perfection!</li>
            <li> First time I have purchased a mustache wax. It is good but does not hold up for a long time. Then again I have thick hair for a beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Recently shaved off my beard and left a nice handlebar moustache behind.  I tried another brand but wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  Did a bit of research and ended up with the wax from CanYouHandlebar..  Big improvement!  I would heartily recommend this product to anyone interested in shaping their facial hair.</li>
            <li> Just like the beard dry oil we were given to test out, this moustache wax is great! While my husband isnt normally the &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; type, this certainly helps keep his unruly moustache hair in line! I normally get poked with or end up eating his moustache when we try to kiss, but after using the wax it definitely makes kissing a much more pleasant experience! Im hoping he keeps up with it! This company is awesome and I would definitely do business with them again!</li>
            <li> Great product but a little too soft, the secondary is way too hard so if there was something in between it would be perfect.  I&#x27;m planning on melting the two together soon :)</li>
            <li> My bf loves it and we both live the light scent.</li>
            <li> Grew out my mustache for 4-1/2 months.  It may not have been long enough for the ideal curls, however this wax was strong and held it in place even after putting on a shirt and tugging on the mustache.  It smells like Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm or bee&#x27;s wax.  The smell is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using this every day for nearly two consecutive years. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Has a light and pleasant beeswax smell to it when applying. If you want to have a moustache, this is a necessity.</li>
            <li> This moustache wax is awesome for many  cream. This wax is multi-purpose at my house and we all really like it and use it often. I received the wax at a discount as part of a promotion for my honest review and my whole family is happily participating. I would recommend this wax to anyone since I see it as a multi-purpose wax.beeswax from neighbor Michigan since I&#x27;m in Wisconsin. I also like the lanolin in it because I use it to clear up my sons sores on his mouth instead of nipple cream.This wax is multi-purpose at my house and we all really like it and use it often.

            <li> This mustache wax is a lot weaker then I anticipated.  It works, but I have to use a lot more, applied more often, then the brand I have used before.  If you are looking for a tighter hold, go with their stronger wax. It does feel clean and healthy for my mustache though.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Prompt service!!</li>
            <li> Tried many different Waxes to train my moustache, have always come back to Can you handle Bar Primary.  The price is definitely reasonable, and the hold is great.  I use a different method than suggested though, I heat the tin using an old scent diffuser (with a tea light candle) that belongs to my wife. The ultra soften wax (or melted is much easier for me to work with)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t change the product its just right</li>
            <li> Pretty good overall, but hold is too weak for a longer moustache</li>
            <li> Holds ok it&#x27;s just my face runs too hot so it ends up with greasy cheeks</li>
            <li> love the hold power of this wax, not too sticky, but doesn&#x27;t fall apart in 30 minutes.  i typically apply once in the morning and once after lunch.  will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great customer service! These guys really care. This is a great mid day wax to bring the stache back up after working all day. Easy to use, not sticky or tacky. If your looking for a stronger wax use the secondary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the Primary wax. If you need a pretty good hold (not stiff) for your &#x27;stache, then this is good stuff. My wax came with a specially branded Can You Handlebar flexi-guitar pick that makes it easy to scrape the wax off the top and then move to my thumb and forefinger. Just a little is needed. Apply from the middle to the outside and it looks great. The hold is good enough to keep the whiskers out of my pie hole and my wife hating the day I started growing it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My &#x27;stache is a half horseshoe, and I keep it neat and trim. I like a wax that is easy to apply, easy to remove, gives a  nice sheen, smells good, has natural ingredients, and is effective throughout the day. Until now, that has not been easy to accomplish for me. Indeed, no single wax has had these qualities in the aggregate. Fortunately, you will get them all with Canyouhandlebar&#x27;s Primary Wax. Other waxes just don&#x27;t measure up. Also, I like the fact that Primary Wax moisturizes the hair, doesn&#x27;t clump up, and doesn&#x27;t dry so hard that it pulls out hair. Indeed, I have gotten tired of having to heat up other waxes with a hairdryer. I mean, serously, this should be an easy process, not a cumbersome one.  Only a dab on each side is necessary to get your &#x27;stache looking and feeling its best. BTW, several other brands have &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; ingredients which are not listed on the label. Do you really want to use such a product? I, for one, want to know exactly what I&#x27;m using, and Primary Wax lists all of its ingredients right on the label; there is no petroleum jelly or other nasty stuff involved. This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; wax for everyday use. It is the best wax I have ever used, and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Works good would buy again speedy shipping very satisfied</li>
            <li> My nephew has a handlebar mustache and said it works great!!</li>
            <li> Make&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s beard manageable and soft. I&#x27;ve bought it two years in a row!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this wax. I had been using  wax in a tube, it was the same brand as an aftershave I like, but it had a smell I found unpleasant. This wax has nearly no odor, goes on well, and holds well enough to get me through most of the day. I haven&#x27;t had a problem softening it for application. I simply hold a fingertip on the wax in the can for a minute or so and my body heat softens it sufficiently to apply. CYHB seems to make good stuff, and I like supporting a local Michigan based business.</li>
            <li> I ordered my first can a month or so again. It was harder than I expected but that turned out to be a good thing. It has a nice light odor and the wax disappears into my mostly gray stache.  I will certainly order more when  I get to the bottom of this canister. It will probably take a while. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a beard guy, but my gramps is. I sent him the whole set and he likes it (he&#x27;s very hard to please). Use sparingly though. He said the first application, he used too much and it was kind of gooky and super shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. I am 70 years old and have had a handlebar mustache for 45 years. Over the years I have used many types of wax and this is one of the best. No problem with discoloring my all gray mustache or application. The application could be tricky for the beginner but not difficult to master. If you want ALL DAY HOLD this is the product you need. Thank you for this product  Pap</li>
            <li> My husband got this along with the secondary wax and it works great! He had gotten some mustache wax from a different company and it just did not do what it was supposed to. This wax however holds his mustache really well so he doesn&#x27;t have to keep messing with it all day. We are really happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality wax.</li>
            <li> Nice hold, lasts most of the day for my unruly stache.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it. He uses it daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other waxes, this stuff holds well but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t last that long I will have to try the secondary. I also enjoy the light scent, makes it enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> my husband likes this product</li>
            <li> Decent product. Easily workable and the hold is decent. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either. 8/10 would mustache again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this out for a few weeks before writing a review.  Unfortunately, this product does not work for me.  The hold is not strong at all.  My mustache is by no means big. It&#x27;s just long on the sides.  After trying the product several different ways and in different amounts, it fails to hold my mustache together for any longer than a half hour or so.  Individual long hairs don&#x27;t stick together, no matter how much I use, and no matter how I try and set it; cool air from the hair dryer, cold water, etc.  Applying it in larger amounts to just the ends works no better than combing it through my mustache.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a batch that&#x27;s defective; it&#x27;s pretty soft as compared to other comments that say it&#x27;s a lot harder.  Even after setting it, it&#x27;s still on the soft side.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  For $15, I expected this to work much better than it does.  :(</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of wax I&#x27;ve ever used, so sorry that I can&#x27;t give you anything to which to compare it.  I&#x27;m about halfway through my first can which I started the beginning of June (almost exactly 3 months ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely scent.  Soft, but now and then you&#x27;ll get a whiff of it and think &amp;#34;Oh, that&#x27;s nice.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, it shapes nicely.  I&#x27;m not one to go overboard with curling irons, clamps, and anything else like that, just warm the can up in my armpit for a few minutes and warm the wax again in my fingers.  With that particular technique, it seems that the results are best the quickest it can be done (before the wax hardens, I&#x27;d imagine).  If taking too long, you could try more wax but more often than not it was a bit of a lost cause unless I was willing to invest 15-20 more minutes.  Maybe my technique needs work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in a dry state like I do, I&#x27;ve found this wax to work particularly well, and if I put on in the morning, I almost never need to retouch.  That said however, I just got back from a month-long trip to Ohio, and the humidity was just too much for my moustache most days.  I hardly ever got the moustache looking particularly well my entire trip, without using a lot more wax and twice as much time and occasionally a hairdryer.  I kind of expected things to be a little bit better considering this wax comes out of another great lakes state, so my recommendation would be that depending on your area, perhaps a can of the Secondary wax would do better for you than the Primary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at grooming a handlebar, but this works great. It has a nice, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Have only been using moustashe wax for a couple of weeks now. This stuff seems to be doing the trick. Smells decent. Would buy again</li>
            <li> This product works great.  Just the right amount of hold without feeling too waxy. I have very course and curly facial hair, without a good wax I look like a confused walrus. This product has a pleasant smell and a very convenient package (it fits perfectly in the watch pocket of my 501&#x27;s).  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but they tended to be too sticky and the packaging was not very portable.  I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> My go-to Stache Wax along with the Secondary Stiff Wax by the same company.  A terrific combo for guys who have a traditional handlebar mustache.  The Primary works best for the middle of your stache and the Secondary is used for the ends.  Works for me.  Both waxes need to be warmed up before using; I use hot water over the tins with the lids attached.  There are other methods that work just as well.  Highly recommended and hard to beat.  The price and service is excellent.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I  purchased this product as a Father&#x27;s Day gift but my toddler son found my hiding spot and gave it to daddy with a few others. So far my husband has used it twice, it does allow him to manage his moustache slightly and gives it a healthy thicker look. I am unable to write a full review on any significant changes since it has only been a short period of time. I am willing to update this review and let you all know after 1-2 weeks if anyone is wanting to know the overall benefits and cons. So far he does like it!</li>
            <li> By far the best mustache was I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I waxed my mustache up it lasted all day, woke up and it still looked great. Rode on a boat all day still looked great!! I will defiantly buy this again!</li>
            <li> I purchased a tin recently and am wholly disappointed. No matter how much I apply, it fails to hold for more than 5 minutes. I have to reapply, reapply, reapply. Given the total failure of this product I am not inclined to purchase the allegedly better Secondary wax. Sorry, gang, I&#x27;m not impressed with all the natural ingredients, etc., it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Perfect combination of hold, ease of use, and smell. I&#x27;ve found some with stronger hold, some that were easier to use, and even one that smelled better. In the end, all three matter to me, and this wax is the best compromise I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> I had been using Fisticuffs wax however I found that it was entirely too soft to meet my needs. This wax is much stiffer and a bit darker, both of which are good things about it in my mind. I also found that it does not tend to clump up as badly as the Fisticuffs. Over all I would recommend this wax although I will still be trying some others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the handlebar mustache experience and bought this wax to tame and shape my untrained lip whiskers...but the shorter whiskers still wanted to go their own way and did.  That was my mistake, entirely.  I was leery of too stiff a wax but after trying it I think this medium hold wax really is best for styling a mature, manageable mustache when unyielding, all-day hold isn&#x27;t required or desired.  I turned right around and bought the stiffer Secondary Wax for now but I fully intend to revisit the Primary when my &#x27;stache has come into its own.  It&#x27;s easy to use and has a subtle, pleasant smell that reminds me of Southern youth when honey...good honey...came with the comb in the jar.  The tin conveniently fits in the match/watch pocket of my chinos.</li>
            <li> Works in to your mustache really easily, has a great (light) scent of beeswax.</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock. From other reviews I think I&#x27;ve got a bad one. only a hair dryer will soften it for a few seconds then it&#x27;s back to being a brick. Can&#x27;t seem to get any amount into my mustache at all. (edit) found a way to make it work. See comments. Lasts most of the day but is seemingly gone by the evening.</li>
            <li> High quality product with excellent ingredients and stellar &amp;#34;performance.&amp;#34;  Only 4 starts because I don&#x27;t love the aroma of honey.</li>
            <li> Great hold, smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my brother in law who has been growing his beard for a year. He&#x27;s never tried anything kind of beard products and says this stuff is amazing. There&#x27;s no strong scent which he likes. It holds strong and if needed isn&#x27;t hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> My bearded gentleman caller very much enjoys this product. To quote him \\&quot;this s*** is dope\\&quot;. He especially liked the fact that it just smelled like beeswax and no other addins. The wax is firm and holds his spectacular mustachio in place. He&#x27;s a happy man with well styled facial hair.</li>
            <li> Primary, secondary and dry beard oil are some great products. Little to no scent and work really well.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I use now, after trying countless others.  The hold is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t damage the mustache hairs, which is a major selling point for me.  Easy to work with - great for someone just starting out or a mustache waxer with years of experience.  I recommend this product to anyone who asks me for my insight.</li>
            <li> this was my first moustache wax.  works great!  easy to use as long as it is warmed up.  has a pretty good hold that will last the day if you use the right amount. i have been playing with that over the past week to determine how much to use so i do not need to carry the tin with me during the day.  i wanted a wax that was not scented, and this is definitely it.  if you are looking for a good wax with good hold, this is it.</li>
            <li> Came dried out and rock hard.  I had to heat it up by wrapping it in a heating pad for 30 minutes on top of a running dishwasher.  When I opened it the outside was liquid wax and there was still a hockey puck of a center part.  The liquid poured out of the tin onto my hand and solidified instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically the one I got wasn&#x27;t usable at temperatures that humans can handle.</li>
            <li> Caveat: I am, as I&#x27;m sure many are, growing out my mustache for Movember. With that in mind, I liked this product. It&#x27;s hold was not very firm, but my mustache definitely feels softer and more train-able. For work, I use firehouse for the firmer hold; but I throw this on for the weekends and in the evening as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> While this wax is great for making funky shapes and designs with your stache, it is also nice for everyday grooming.&lt;br /&gt;This is a stiff wax so it does need to be warmed up a bit before applying.  I suggest getting a small chunk and rubbing between your fingers til it becomes easily manageable,  or get a hairdryer, put it on the hottest setting  and hold it over the tin for a minute.  *tin will be hot after doing so,  handle with caution*&lt;br /&gt;This wax is good for giving a nice groomed look to any mustache,  it keeps your hairs in place and keeps you looking sharp all day long.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice conditioning effect,  taming those wiry hairs and making them softer to the touch.  (Your partner will appreciate that)&lt;br /&gt;All day hold,  not greasy or sticky.  Stays soft but holds in place&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample tin for reviewing purposes. My statement is what I concluded from testing the wax.</li>
            <li> Works well...doesnt last the entire day though but still great quality!</li>
            <li> Works great on my stach&#x27; and the tin can sit in hot water without messing up the label.</li>
            <li> This is the best mustache wax with the strongest hold I have ever used.  It does exactly what the manufacturer says it does.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of this product.  I also like the fact that all the ingredients are natural and good for your mustache.  Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really not what I wanted.It has no smell whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed by the way the wax sits on my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;The wax is very hard to apply and it leaves a residue in my hair even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> I like it but you have to keep it warm to use it.</li>
            <li> I have used the secondary wax for a few months, and I have been very pleased, so I decided to give the Primary wax a try.  A little softer than the secondary wax, it smoothes in between my fingers like buttah. Holds well and isn&#x27;t really heavy.  Soften it up in a sink of hot water (tin is pretty water tight if you keep it right side up), and it is good to go by the time I&#x27;m out of the shower.  There are no perfumes or other scents. Which I really like because... you know... my mustache is under my nose, and I would prefer not to smell some scent concoction all day.  I haven&#x27;t tried competitor waxes, and I don&#x27;t think I need to.  Completely happy with this product and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> In what world does this have a pleasant scent? I had to use my Layrite hair gel over top of it or I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Primary is great for everyday use and the secondary if you want the really firm Salvador Dali look!  Great stuff and a tin lasts for months and months.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, on time with no issues.  What more could a guy want?!</li>
            <li> I need the extra hold of their &amp;#34;secondary&amp;#34; which is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> It does have a decent hold, but I thought it would hold stronger with the name.  I find I have trouble getting a consistent result day after day.  does pretty good holding my mustache out of my mouth, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the hold I think I need.</li>
            <li> My husband has a very manly beard and at times it can get unruly and very itchy for him. He works outside in subzero temps everyday so his skin gets really dry. I was so excited to be able to get this product during a promotion so that I could share my honest and unbiased opinion with CanYouHandlebar Classic Scent Beard Dry Oil here with you. I didn’t know that such a product existed to help him manage his beard and condition his skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived very quickly and undamaged. The container is very manageable and easy to open and close. There is no scent to this product which my husband liked because some products make him “smell like a flower”. You don’t need very much of this product, a little goes a long way. It left his skin feeling soothed and his beard looked amazing! His beard was very shiny and looked like he had just been groomed at the barber! Great product, worth the price!</li>
            <li> As a first time user, I selected this product based on the reviews. Once I received it, I tried the methods recommended by other users to warm the wax.  None of them worked.  I put it in hot water.  Brick.  Put it under my thigh for 30 min at church...nope.  Put it under my thigh in my car and turned the seat warmers on high (20 min drive).  Hard as a brick.  I really want to use this product but haven&#x27;t had much success.  Any suggestions would be most helpful.  Thanks.  Update 03/11/15.  I contacted the manufacturer who responded immediately and sent a fresh can.  Works great.  Company stood behind it&#x27;s product beautifully.  I have changed my rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I recently started sporting a handlebar moustache so I have been trying different products to see what works best for me.  I ordered both the primary and secondary.  The primary is harder and needs to be softened.  The secondary is softer and I find it easier to use and holds really well.</li>
            <li> Ladies have a variety of products to give their hair volume, and to make it hold in a style. Over the years men have wanted the same with their moustaches. I mean what guy hasn&#x27;t thought about styling his stache. So I received an opportunity to try stache styles of years ago by using Can You Handlebar Primary and Secondary moustache waxes.&lt;br /&gt;Primary Moustache: Made from beeswax, lanolin, castor oil, coconut oil, Shea butter, and vitamin e. The  wax is for holding a stache style so the consistency at room temp is hard.  After either using warm water on the outside of the waterproof tin its packaged within, or rubbing the product vigorously between your fingers, the product is then applied. Style to your heart&#x27;s content. I tried the classic handlebar ( go figure). Once the wax cools back to room temperature, the style is set. Its pretty durable and the style will last for a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say the Mister likes this brand a lot. We recieved this product to test in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this..works great..</li>
            <li> Love anything beeswax based because of all the wonderful benefits of using it. Over the years, I have found that beeswax has many uses and really can become a multi purpose product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CanYouHandlebar Primary Moustache wax comes in a tin packaging. There is NO instructions with this item in the box itself or on packaging. Which made things a bit difficult for my husband and I at first. When I opened the lid, the wax was ROCK SOLID. I was confused, until I read the description on the post on Amazon where I had ordered it from. You can find the instructions on the sales page. However, I believe that there should be something printed on the tin or something that comes in the box explaining how to soften the wax safely. It says to either warm in warm water OR in a pocket. My husband was able to rub his thumb into the wax for a minute or two to soften it up. We also used the warm water bath method. This worked much better than warming it with a touch or in a hand/pocket etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softening the wax was probably the most consuming part of testing this product. I used a small bowl of warm water. Left it sit and checked in in intervals of 5 minutes. I found that the wax only started to be come warm enough to mold between my fingers by about the 15 minute mark. Otherwise, I had to use my nail to dig some of it up. The second time that I tried this, I made sure to microwave the bowl of water and that made the water much hotter, leaving it only 5 minutes before it was able to be dug out without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SCENT*&lt;br /&gt;This has a very strong beeswax scent to it. Which, I find to be rather soothing. Some may not be fond of this. The scent will be applied to the moustache right under the nose, so keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*USE*&lt;br /&gt;My husband doesn&#x27;t have a very long mustache but it does get kind of \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; and sets funny if he grows it out too long. Also, it&#x27;s VERY prickly and uncomfortable for me to kiss or nuzzle him when it&#x27;s grown out. So I was excited to have him try this product!&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves the hairs soft, NOT STIFF! The wax blends nicely, once warmed and rubs very well into the hairs. Even when it \\&quot;cools\\&quot; it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very hard in the hairs, doesn&#x27;t flake or get gunky. Which was nice. Hubby approves! It&#x27;s also been \\&quot;Kiss tested\\&quot; and it&#x27;s been Wife approved! :)&lt;br /&gt;2. The wax also (if left on hands) is great for cuticles! My cuticles are horrible and I had tried a dab of this on my hands. Very soothing on cracked and dry hands or cuticles. I love it and will probably be taking one of his tins (as I am trying both the primary and secondary products) for my own use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*PACKAGING*&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in first photo, I was able to test all three products. The Primary &amp; Secondary waxes (Which, in our opinion both work about the same-look the same-effects are the same etc), we really don&#x27;t see a difference in either of them. The Beard Oil is also in photo. Check out my review on that! Love all the products and they look GREAT together! These would make a really nice Fathers Day or Christmas basket gift item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to note, this product is handmade, hand packaged locally! In fact, not very far from where we live. I am head over heels over buying local and fully support our small businesses and handmade products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]!  1.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:ff3f4d75c1ebcb3e36f12c8e503c649f]]I was initially somewhat thrown by how rock solid the wax came, but as I illustrate in my video, I found the solidity worked out great for me.  Merely by rubbing my forefinger in a circular motion across the top, swiping across the surface of my moustache, repeating a few times while combing out the hairs, I get more than enough to get all my wires to face the same way.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also means this little tin will be lasting me AGES.  Massive improvement over the waxes I tried over a decade ago - especially the ones that left little \\&quot;booger-like\\&quot; nuggets in my hairs.  LOL-yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Discounted product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product enough. I bought this for my partner who decided to grow out his facial hair for the first time. He had looked all over the local stores to find mustache wax, but all the varieties available were for men with black hair or for darker skin tones. My partner has a brown (with some grey) beard so he was unable to use other brands of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered him the CanYouHandlebar brand and it was a hit from the moment he opened the tin. There is no weird smell and the wax holds its shape without melting or getting into food. It works exactly as described and it has enough body to the formula that it is more of a solid consistency than the Vaseline consistency of other brands (and this was exactly what my partner wanted!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner lost the tin the other day and purchased another brand of wax at Walgreens. He immediately regretted his decision and spent all day looking for the CanYouHandlebar brand. He found his tin and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, just get this one and save yourself time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: If this came bundled with a mustache comb, it would be even better.</li>
            <li> I have officially fallen in love with this company. I&#x27;ve had a few of their products and each has been better than advertised. This is the 2nd brand of wax I&#x27;ve purchased, and now this will be the go to wax from now on. The ease with which I was able to shape my moustache was a pleasant surprise, and I only needed to apply it twice all day. I live in Kentucky (a humid state) and work in a factory where the sweat pours. For comparability the other brand would need to be applied 4-6 times a day, and as I mentioned this wax only needed a slight adjustment well into my shift. Every product I&#x27;ve tried from CanYouHandleBar has been great, and if you want your beard to look healthy and professional,  I would highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li> Fantastic primary mustache wax! If you use this in conjunction with the secondary wax that they offer, it&#x27;ll hold your mustache up all day. I bought both the primary and the secondary for my husband, who loves his mustache. He definitely likes this brand better than any other now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with a mustache. Just don&#x27;t heat up your container(a lot), otherwise you might have trouble getting the top off.</li>
            <li> This wax is ok, smells like straight beeswax because that&#x27;s what it is. Hold varies on how much you use.</li>
            <li> Hard wax but works in smoothly....no color residue and isn&#x27;t super smelly</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using any type of facial hair wax. I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect or how to use it. It actually turned out to be really simple, which was great! Never having used any product before I didn&#x27;t know how to style really, so I chose a look I had seen on an old bus driver of mine. I am very happy with this product, and I recommend it to anyone interested in styling your mustache! I received this product at a discounted price for review purposes.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really has fallen in love with this mustache wax. He has been using it daily and both him and I can see a huge difference in how his beard looks and feels. He really loves the act that it has no scent. He simply scrapes a bit out using a guitar pic and warms it between his fingers and evenly distributes it through his beard then gives it a quick comb through. He carries it with him throughout the day in the rare case he needs to reapply for those fly away beard hairs. I love the way his beard looks and feels, as does he. This is a great product and he prefers this brand to the several others he&#x27;s tried. This will definitely be a repurchase as he intends to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
