            <li>I love how quickly this product absorbs and the smell.</li>

            <li>It is great on super dry feet, before you put socks on!  </li>
            <li>I notice the lime smell more than the coconut; at any rate, they work really well</li>
            <li>This is a pretty strongly scented body butter.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I use the same body scrub but was sent this by mistake and didn&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite for sure.</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t say it enough, for dry rough skin, this is the best!</li>
            <li>I scoop a little out and warm it up between my hands before applying.  </li>
            <li>Love this and will be looking for other Tree Hut body butters!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it smells great, is thick but goes on smoothly, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy and it really helps to moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and have no irritation.</li>
            <li>I can get by using a little less than I would with other body butters, which is great because it means the tub will last longer.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a pretty strongly scented body butter.  I happen to like the scent a lot, although it makes me hungry.  I can get by using a little less than I would with other body butters, which is great because it means the tub will last longer.  I scoop a little out and warm it up between my hands before applying.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to rub in and it makes my legs feel so soft and smooth.  I notice the lime smell more than the coconut; at any rate, they work really well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since I didn&#x27;t see them on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cyclomethicone, Glycerin, Shea Butter, Glyceryl Stearate, Safflower Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-8 Beeswax, Lanolin Alcohol, Polysorbate 80, Laureth-4, Fragrance, Coconut Extract, Lime Fruit Extract, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Diazolidinyl Urea, Disodium EDTA, BHT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this does contain some preservatives, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ve used body butters with cocoa butter/shea butter/etc. before that did not have preservatives, and the oils went rancid.  So I&#x27;m OK with the preservatives if it means the product will have a longer shelf life.  (I bought this several months ago and it was still good when I finally got around to using it.)  Also, please note that this is not vegan because it contains modified beeswax and lanolin alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the artificial fragrance, this has not irritated my skin.  Love this and will be looking for other Tree Hut body butters!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it enough, for dry rough skin, this is the best!</li>
            <li> So glad to find this on Amazon.com. Have a sister in a nursing home who is a former cosmetologist and she swears  by this product.  The stores in this area no longer stock it, but my usual best bet Amazon.com came thru again.  This made her Christmas.</li>
            <li> Received this as a birthday gift-  love it so am ordering more on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> thinner formula than i expected</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and it is virtually better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t like that it has fragrance, but it works. It&#x27;s softens beautifully and even dewrinkles my skin.</li>
            <li> Love how moisturizing  this body butter is and the smell is wonderful too. Tree Hut Coconut Lime has become one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> This product smells great but leaves my skin SUPER sticky feeling. My clothes stick to my skin :( The consistency is weird also....won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite products. it smells great, is thick but goes on smoothly, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy and it really helps to moisturize the skin. I can see a visible difference in my skin and my children&#x27;s skin after a few days especially because we have hard water which makes our skin very dry. the smell even lasts longer than the initial application.</li>
            <li> I love how quickly this product absorbs and the smell. I am a postpartum mom using this cream for stretch marks and dry skin. It has worked wonders. I also have sensitive skin and have no irritation. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> R/t Tree Hut Coconut Lime:  The dryness of my skin has been resolved with the use of your product. I like the settle sent.Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it.....the texture is excellent, and the scent is devine especially when you use it in conjunction with the sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> My wife loves all the Tree Hut Shea Body Butters.  Don&#x27;t bother using the others like Nevia etc. they&#x27;re all great</li>
            <li> This is the best all-around moisturizer I have ever tried. No more chapped hands. I use it as an all-over moisturizer too as well as on my face. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs quickly. Leaves your skin soft and smooth for hours. I usually buy mine at Walmart for $5.00. If you can&#x27;t find in there, Amazon is your next best price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the scent. it was too strong and fake smelling. The texture was off too. I prefer the Brazilian nut. The texture is more like butter and the scent is nice</li>
            <li> Love this sea butterr. It smells amazing and the texture is not greasy. Your husband will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Smell so good am happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! but that is the only thing I like about it. I had to get a big amount on my fingers every time I wanted to just do a hand size area because if I didn&#x27;t it would felt like I wasn&#x27;t even rubbing anything in.  That was okay but then when I was done I was all sticky...which it&#x27;s been over an hour now and I still feel really gross.</li>
            <li> I have purchased all varieties of this products and there is not one I don&#x27;t like, but the mango and coconut lime are my favorites.  I don&#x27;t buy lotions any longer because I like the shea body butter so much better and there is never any waste in the container.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I will get more in the future.</li>
            <li> I use the same body scrub but was sent this by mistake and didn&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite for sure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product:  It is great on super dry feet, before you put socks on!  However, I have gotten it from Amazon for 3/$15.00.  I saw it recently here for $10, assuming I would get 2, as I used to buy it at Walmart  for around $4...but I received only one.  Grr...  I do see it elsewhere at 3/$15, so just giving you a heads up.</li>
            <li> Delicious!  Super moisturizing and the smell is heaven.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this body butter is just about the best for the price. Some competition sell body butter for $20 each and this one blows them out of the water! Ever since I have been using this, my skin so soft and not dry, not to mention, I use it on my hands every night and my nails are growing like crazy! Strong too. I have done nothing different besides use this. :)</li>
