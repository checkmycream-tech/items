            <li>Nice fragrance, not allergic to it.  </li>
            <li>which is great, very fresh, very interesting and for not being too sweet is a plus+</li>
            <li>thought this would be my new favorite but....not as impressed as I was on the sample.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li>it is now my ALL-TIME FAVORITE scent..</li>
            <li>Many compliments on this scent.  </li>
            <li>She fell in love with it and had to have it.  </li>
            <li>I wish i can say i love this perfume but unfornately</li>
            <li>From Chanel to this is impressive enough.</li>
            <li>Not to strong either.</li>
            <li>I spray some on my pillow, also, to enjoy it as I fall asleep..</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried the Jo Malone experience you are missing a wonderful opportunity</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of good perfumes and this is in the top three on my shelf.</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;m unique.</li>
            <li>Definitely unique.  </li>
            <li>It was love at first sniff.</li>
            <li>I get many positive comments.</li>
            <li>it is so light and fresh smelling, like spring...</li>
            <li>so whenever she&#x27;s in Nordstroms she will sample the latest scents and come back with her orders :)  </li>
            <li>The sent fades quickly.</li>
            <li>i quickly fell for it after one sniff</li>
            <li>it is absolutely the loveliest scent ever!</li>
            <li>I really love the scent and last longer!</li>
            <li>If you do have the same problem as mine, don&#x27;t ever buy this even how lovely this perfume appeals to you at first</li>
            <li>I have bought over 40 colognes and this is my 2nd favorite.</li>
            <li>but then after 3 hours, the drydown makes me real headache, it was too \\&quot;aquatic \\&quot; (don&#x27;t know if i described right by this word)</li>
            <li>The fragrance not so much.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t be a particularly helpful review, but my wife just loves this cologne.  </li>
            <li>the next day i sprayed it to work, at first it smelled exact the same as it was supposed to</li>
            <li>specifically asked  the saleslady whether this perfume would have this aquatic smell in any stage but clearly like she never smelled like those Aquatic perfumes before</li>
            <li>So unique and feminine but not sweet.</li>
            <li>i just couldn&#x27;t wait to go home as soon as possible to shower it whole off on</li>
            <li>Such a unique scent and its far from heavy.  </li>
            <li>I buy each other a new bottle of perfume (for her) and cologne (for me).  </li>

            <li> SCENT OF A WOMAN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Valentine&#x27;s Day my beautiful wife and I buy each other a new bottle of perfume (for her) and cologne (for me).  It takes the guesswork out of the day--and it&#x27;s a gift we can both enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife LOVES Jo Malone so whenever she&#x27;s in Nordstroms she will sample the latest scents and come back with her orders :)  The scent on her neck is always a delight.</li>
            <li> I have used Jo Malone&#x27;s Lime Basil &amp; Mandarin cologne for a couple of years and just now tried the English Pear &amp; Freesia, even though I had never smelled it before..it is now my ALL-TIME FAVORITE scent..it is so light and fresh smelling, like spring...I spray some on my pillow, also, to enjoy it as I fall asleep..it is absolutely the loveliest scent ever!</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t be a particularly helpful review, but my wife just loves this cologne.  She&#x27;s happy, so I am too.</li>
            <li> Many compliments on this scent.  It&#x27;s different than anything else out there and so I&#x27;m unique.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in the W magazine I believe.  I was hooked.  Definitely unique.  The dry down isn&#x27;t as glamorous, but it is almost there.</li>
            <li> I first sampled this sent in small tester bottles. It was love at first sniff. I get many positive comments. It is not overpowering. Needless to say, I am extremely pleased and plan to sample other Jo Malone scents.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent! So unique and feminine but not sweet. I get tons of compliments whenever I wear it. I&#x27;m a big fan of good perfumes and this is in the top three on my shelf.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent and last longer! the seller have an excellent service ! AAA +++</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, not allergic to it.  Isn&#x27;t has long lasted as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would be my new favorite but....not as impressed as I was on the sample.&lt;br /&gt;Is this a knockoff?  If so...it&#x27;s overpriced</li>
            <li> Received it as expected.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this at ladies house we were visiting back in the fall. She fell in love with it and had to have it.  I gave it to her for Christmas.  She uses it every day and still thinks its the best.  Not to strong either. I have problem with over powering scents.</li>
            <li> The service was good.. The fragrance not so much.</li>
            <li> Smells great . Very happy</li>
            <li> The sent fades quickly. It doesnt linger.</li>
            <li> I wish i can say i love this perfume but unfornately NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked by Jo Malone counter one day and tried this....OMG....i quickly fell for it after one sniff, it was kindda like honey smell to me which is great, very fresh, very interesting and for not being too sweet is a plus+, so I rushed to buy one (even the big one) thought it&#x27;d become one of my regulars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the next day i sprayed it to work, at first it smelled exact the same as it was supposed to but then after 3 hours, the drydown makes me real headache, it was too \\&quot;aquatic \\&quot; (don&#x27;t know if i described right by this word)....the drydown has the similar effect of Calvin klein&#x27;s \\&quot;Eternity\\&quot; or issey miyake perfume that kind of thing which I cannot stand for some reason, and for worst it lasted for the whole day i just couldn&#x27;t wait to go home as soon as possible to shower it whole off on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically asked  the saleslady whether this perfume would have this aquatic smell in any stage but clearly like she never smelled like those Aquatic perfumes before or she simply didn&#x27;t understand what i meant.  If you do have the same problem as mine, don&#x27;t ever buy this even how lovely this perfume appeals to you at first, you won&#x27;t notice the aquatic rightaway but few hours later, and you&#x27;d be sooooooo regretful if you bought it on a wimp!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I am using Jo Malone&#x27;s \\&quot;Orange Blossoms\\&quot; and \\&quot;Blackberry and Bay\\&quot;  and they don&#x27;t have this aquatic feel at all.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Such a unique scent and its far from heavy.  From Chanel to this is impressive enough.</li>
            <li> I have bought over 40 colognes and this is my 2nd favorite.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to order ths item after having a small sample given to her. She likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Bought for gift.  Recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the Jo Malone experience you are missing a wonderful opportunity</li>
