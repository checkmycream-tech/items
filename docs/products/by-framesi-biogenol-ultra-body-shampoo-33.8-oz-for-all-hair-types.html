            <li>Best shampoo ever for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is an exceptionally good product.</li>
            <li>A great product and so glad that I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans</li>
            <li>Gives great body and soo love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many others trying to find another shampoo (that I wouldn&#x27;t have to mail order!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I can order it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many (MANY!)</li>
            <li>best shampoo there is  as far as i&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years and have never found another shampoo as effective for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine in texture.  </li>
            <li>I have tried others, but this remains my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a better price here</li>
            <li>I sure hope</li>
            <li>and more.</li>
            <li>Have never found anything that I am as pleased with as FB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I love this product and was glad I found it online.</li>
            <li>I know you will love it.</li>
            <li>Framesi is one of the best hair-care products on the market, especially for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Their Reconditioner is also fantastic!</li>
            <li>I would like to find the one for fine hair though since this is the one I was getting from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I have fine</li>
            <li>Works great for my (summer) colored, fine, often quite short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo is lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Framesi is different in that it is a light product that washes out and your hair feels squeaky clean and smells great.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair full and with a lustrous sheen.</li>
            <li>I like best is that one shampoo cleanses off all former residue, including the name-brand conditioner that I use daily.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many different products I have tried and no matter how wonderful the packaging says it is, I feel like I can&#x27;t rinse it out of my hair and it feels heavy and not clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would 100% say to anyone to try this product if you have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>is, by far, my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks clean, bright, and not heavy with any left over oils or shampoos residue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a shampoo that works as well on my hair to leave it clean, shiny and overall healthy.</li>
            <li>so  because i WILL be back for more.</li>
            <li>This entire line of products is absolutely fabulous!  </li>
            <li>However, I switch back and forth between this one and a volumizing shampoo by Alterna, and I feel like my hair is better the days I use this.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was first introduced to me at my day spa/salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you have the same issues I have with shampoo/</li>
            <li>My hair is also professionally color-treated, and my hairdresser constantly tells me that my hair maintains its color better than any of her clients, so this shampoo must be doing its job well!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, and order it rather than buy something from my stylist, because this one doesn&#x27;t dry out my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle on colored hair.</li>
            <li>They use the whole Framesi line there including their hair coloring products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much cheaper to buy here on Amazon then in any salon.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>I find this particular product works very well for me and does not strip out my hair color.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair with absolutely no body.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair and is gentle on the color.</li>
            <li>well and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hair-care professional -- I&#x27;m just a picky, discerning consumer.</li>
            <li>so I now search it out on the internet, as no other shampoo in the world seems to work as well for me.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think there was a difference between this and other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Each individual&#x27;s hair is unique so you may need a different type of Framesi or other brand.  </li>
            <li>So although it is a little pricey, it turns out to be quite economical over its lifetime of use.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and the Framesi Biogenol Products are the only ones that keep my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thin and straight and tends to go flat really fast - most products weigh down my hair, even the shampoos.  </li>
            <li>All other shampoos leave my fine hair limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is terrific for anyone with fine thin hair.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Heavily perfumed products make me ill.  This shampoo is lightly scented.  Unlike some shampoos, Framesi does not leave a heavy residue.  I have used Framesi products off and on since 2005.  I have tried others, but this remains my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is terrific for anyone with fine thin hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It definitely makes my hair fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li> my daily shampoo that I&#x27;ve used for years. doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair and is gentle on the color.</li>
            <li> The ONLY shampoo I will ever use.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 20+ years.  All other shampoos leave my fine hair limp and lifeless.  This shampoo gives my hair great body.  I can no longer find it locally so I now search it out on the internet, as no other shampoo in the world seems to work as well for me.  My hair is also professionally color-treated, and my hairdresser constantly tells me that my hair maintains its color better than any of her clients, so this shampoo must be doing its job well!</li>

            <li> Biogenol  ultra body shampoo...does not weigh your hair down  while giving it Tons and Tons  of body and thickness....and it is gentle on colored hair. I think it even protects the color from fading. i usually purchased it at a solon here in ohio....but they just lost my business. i&#x27;ll get it here from now on. it&#x27;s a better price here and it seems they have it in stock all of the time. I sure hope so  because i WILL be back for more. and more. best shampoo there is  as far as i&#x27;m concerned.</li>

            <li> This entire line of products is absolutely fabulous!  I have fine, color treated that is damaged and my hair is doing so much&lt;br /&gt;better.  My red color is protected now and my hair is shiny and moisturized.  My hair stylist recommended this line for me and&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that he did !!
