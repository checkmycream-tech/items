            <li>Nice colour.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely,</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful mauve, not pink, or orange.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite lipstick for years.</li>
            <li>This color is my favorite, and disappeared from my stores.  </li>
            <li>but glad I found it online.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this lipstick many times before and it has never had a smell like this one did</li>
            <li>Glad to have found the color.  </li>
            <li>Love this color and not in stores anymore, please don&#x27;t take it away.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>So glad I could still order</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing me with my favorite lip color which has now been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite lipstick &amp; has been discontinued by</li>
            <li>and I love the feel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect color for me and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Smooth and stays on well throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>and it did not go on smoothly at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this color for years and because it is no longer available in stores, so far I have been able to purchase it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Guess I must have been one of few who loved this color since it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Hoping the other seller I ordered from sends me the honest product.</li>
            <li>but how much is another question.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the real Mystic Mauve.  </li>
            <li>but I wish I knew the real name or number for this one because if it&#x27;s at the stores, I would just go and buy it there.  </li>
            <li>Hope I can go back to Amazon at a future date to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Markup seemed unfairly high however.  </li>
            <li>Will order this until it is completely out of stock.  </li>
            <li>It was considerably over the cost of current colors.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, and looks great, but the lipstick smells like a crayon and is impossible to apply, it&#x27;s hard as a rock.  </li>
