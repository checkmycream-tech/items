    <ol>
            <li>Best shampoo for seborrhea dermatitis</li>
            <li>I very happy with this zinc shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great product and works well!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best.</li>
            <li>So happy I found this brand of shampoo!</li>
            <li>Then I add more of the product when I get started for the rest of my scalp.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Pyrithione Zinc Shampoo is better than the prescriptions.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a gentle, but very effective product for anyone needing to use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff and oily skin on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Smell is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too smelly (important to me) and it works.</li>
            <li>The first one was a bar soap and I switched to this product because I find bottles more convenient.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be keeping things far better controlled than I&#x27;ve had in years!</li>
            <li>Others I have tried have been too drying, but Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc shampoo leaves skin and hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s easy to find- just about any store carries it and its less then 1/2 the cost for more volume.</li>
            <li>Also, the bar soap was $10 and lasted much longer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this really helps for my spots of psoriasis and accompanying dandruff.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great--no real smell to it</li>
            <li>Neutral and gentle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different prescription shampoos and Noble Formula 2%</li>
            <li>This shampoo was good in the initial days but after a prolonged use, I am getting itchy scalp with little inflammation,  I would not recommend this shampoo for itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I believe the new \\&quot;head and shoulders\\&quot; Shampoo in the solid blue bottle work as well and maybe better then</li>
            <li>I use a hair brush while in the shower to help clear flakes - seems to work for me!</li>
            <li>and this is the first one that has actually worked!</li>
            <li>It certainly helps calm down the flaking and the redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a major improvement in my seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t repeat but use a mild regular shampoo to flush it out thoroughly.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best shampoo for seborrhea dermatitis</li>
            <li> I very happy with this zinc shampoo.  It works well at controlling my flakes.</li>
            <li> Great product and works well!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best. I use it every other day and my scalp and facial seborrhea have completely resolved.</li>
            <li> This is the second 2% Zinc shampoo I&#x27;ve tried  - same results for both.  The first one was a bar soap and I switched to this product because I find bottles more convenient.  With both products I&#x27;ve found they relieve itching and flaking as long as I use them regularly - for me this is every other day - however, if I stop using the product my scalp will gradually get itchy and flaky again.  Also, the bar soap was $10 and lasted much longer so I took star off for price and usage comparison.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 30 years and I know that it keeps my psoriasis at bay and my hair isn&#x27;t falling out like it did before using this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of dandruff products (to get rid of it...) and this is the first one that has actually worked!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was good in the initial days but after a prolonged use, I am getting itchy scalp with little inflammation,  I would not recommend this shampoo for itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I believe the new \\&quot;head and shoulders\\&quot; Shampoo in the solid blue bottle work as well and maybe better then the NF Formula. Also it&#x27;s easy to find- just about any store carries it and its less then 1/2 the cost for more volume. Call me crazy, but I have been battling this my entire adult life and H&amp;S seems to finally hit the mark with their clinical version - all blue bottle- Let me know how you all make out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this really helps for my spots of psoriasis and accompanying dandruff. It isn&#x27;t stinky like the tar shampoos and my skin hates salicylic acid. This seems to be keeping things far better controlled than I&#x27;ve had in years! I put it on my \\&quot;crud spots\\&quot; of psoriasis about 10-15 minutes before my shower. Then I add more of the product when I get started for the rest of my scalp. I usually don&#x27;t repeat but use a mild regular shampoo to flush it out thoroughly. I use a hair brush while in the shower to help clear flakes - seems to work for me!</li>
            <li> I have strong reactions to fragrances and all of the store brand dandruff shampoos have WAY too much fragrance--they are terrible. This shampoo is great--no real smell to it and it has done wonders for my scalp. So happy I found this brand of shampoo!</li>
            <li> farp product  much  too expensive</li>
            <li> This shampoo works and it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh scent.  Neutral and gentle.  I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this for his seborrheic dermatitis in his beard.  It&#x27;s not too smelly (important to me) and it works.</li>
            <li> Got this for itchy scalp acne, not dandruff. It heals as others have described. Smell is fine. I do still need to use styling product. If you aren&#x27;t concerned about styling needs, it might work for you.</li>
            <li> I wish I could write a review., but the product never arrived. This is why we like brick-and-mortar shops. Now I have to purchase this product ...again from some other place , and hope it&#x27;s actually shipped to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using both their shampoo and face cream.  I&#x27;ve noticed a major improvement in my seborrheic dermatitis. It certainly helps calm down the flaking and the redness.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a gentle, but very effective product for anyone needing to use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff and oily skin on the scalp.  Others I have tried have been too drying, but Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc shampoo leaves skin and hair soft and clean.  I have finally found something that works for me.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. I think it&#x27;s the only fragrance-free zinc shampoo on the market. I use it on my skin too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different prescription shampoos and Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc Shampoo is better than the prescriptions. It cleared up a particularly bad case of SD in just a couple of days. I use it just about every day and my SD is kept well under control. I also use it on the SD areas of my face and it keeps it under control, too.  I don&#x27;t have to use a separate product for my face. It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
