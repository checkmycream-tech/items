            <li>This is also a Summer Product- people living in tropical areas will find it perfect.  </li>
            <li>two thumbs up to Neutrogena :D</li>

            <li>Wonderful item!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great after each wash!</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>the product is very good and does what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li>He is a firefighter and is usually very good about bringing all of his grooming items when he works a 24 or 48-hour shift.  </li>
            <li>and it was a great find.  </li>
            <li>like I haven&#x27;t experienced since I was a teenager.     </li>
            <li>So all in all, it&#x27;s great for clearing up your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is great for skin that tends to be oily like mind, because as I said it does not strip away all the moisture out of your skin.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It felt great then.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling stripped or caked with soap.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this soap to be very effective for cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>I thought using it twice a day for a week would be a good trial.</li>
            <li>On its own, I feel it does a great job of cleansing.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a really good cleanser for me.</li>
            <li>even good aound halloween).</li>
            <li>And my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be in adverse terms with this cleanser :)!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>and it lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Love this, it takes off my make up and is good for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I though this would be the perfect product as it claims to be formulated for normal to oily skin...</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>So Invest the money when you are sure.    </li>
            <li>I know I have to use it for more time to draw a conclusion.</li>
            <li>i absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>This one makes my skin feel a bit more \\&quot;squeakier\\&quot;</li>
            <li>We have been using this face wash in our house for years, and love it.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products because of their purity of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this product for many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>is caused my face to produce more oil  </li>
            <li>Okay - I agree with others that this face wash can be drying.  </li>
            <li>Stick with the original!</li>
            <li>I love my smooth skin and leaves</li>
            <li>so I need something that is strong.</li>
            <li>I used this soap for a while now,I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>It took a good week for my skin to return to normal.</li>
            <li>To be honest this is the first time a Neutrogena product did this to me - but I won&#x27;t be using this one again anytime</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews here and my past good experience with Neutrogena products, I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>Using with a fine moisturizer will do though.  </li>
            <li>and my skin still feels super dry and kind of like what heat ask feels like!!  </li>
            <li>I have been back to it for about a week now and already my skin has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>face wash cleans all of the dirt and oils off of my face, does a great job at clearing (I&#x27;d say about 75% of my) clogged pores, and it removes every makeup or facial product that I have ever had on (</li>
            <li>This is a perfect product for those who are out to dirt and pollution for a long time- this one REALLY cleans!  </li>
            <li>After spending my whole life switching between facewashes looking for the perfect one, I finally found this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my face too dry, but does a good job at removing most makeup.</li>
            <li>But for skin-care products, my philosophy is, if it is the product for you, your skin will love it at the first place.</li>
            <li>With all that said, I also think it is important to mention that using this product-or most other face wash products-alone is not enough to get the healthy, beautiful skin that most people desire.</li>
            <li>This soap works well for me and reduces breakouts significantly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels really clean to remove all my make up.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>After use,my skin does feel clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after using it and</li>
            <li>My face did feel relatively clean afterwards, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Amazon delivers it right to my door!</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser and should work for anyone except someone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as you wash your face with this soap, your skin looks clear and kind of shiny.</li>
            <li>much be that much better.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with it as it cleans really well</li>
            <li>I am a tried and true believer in this face wash.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful deep cleaning facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>This signals a mild chemical burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, as many people here attest to it being great for them, but I believe I gave it a fair shake</li>
            <li>Also, My oily areas over compensated for the dryness caused by this product making my nose more oily than normal by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I will certainly discontinue my use of this product for something not as strong, but will have to keep this on hand for those sporadic breakouts.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure there are better products at same price.</li>
            <li>So far, I am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel really silky after washing with it, and it gets make-up off really well too.  </li>
            <li>However, this is a powerful soap and so dryness occurs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using neutrogena products for years after trying many other brands that seemed to just make my face break out even more.</li>
            <li>but right after I had my baby</li>
            <li>While I won&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better than Clinique&#x27;s face wash, I will say that for the amount I paid, it does a pretty good job of cleansing my face without giving my skin that overly taut and dry feeling that I have experienced when I used other brands such as Clearasil and Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li>My experience so far is fine.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I felt a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I did some reading and many said it took some time to make the adjustment to different soaps sometimes,</li>
            <li>And my complexion got a bit lighter even in the first week.</li>
            <li>not so much!  </li>
            <li>I was unsure at first whether it was the cleanser or the followup  products, so I tried the cleanser alone.</li>
            <li>Just to be sure, I tried my follow up products days later, after cleansing my face with dove soap, no burn at all.</li>
            <li>I had to take two benadryl and apply hydrocortisone cream for it to finally get better.</li>
            <li>My face always feels very clean following use.  </li>
            <li>(even my mascara) and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin which I feel the Clean and Clear brand does.</li>
            <li>I use this and it really does deep clean my skin, I dont even need to use makeup remover!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, it cleans and work with your skin tone, and you really don&#x27;t need much to use!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular product to anyone!</li>
            <li>No weird smells, doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>if you have oily skin and are only getting the chance to wash every few days this is a great way to go.  </li>
            <li>Get rid of that oil with this gentle product.  </li>
            <li>i have very oily skin face</li>
            <li>I use this at the sink and Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser in the shower.</li>
            <li>The search got over the moment I found Deep Clean.</li>
            <li>I used deep clean on a Thursday using it twice per day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will never use deep clean again.</li>
            <li>It foams up so nice with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I find this to be a pretty effective alternative to the more expensive face washes.    </li>
            <li>but i mainly use this one when im in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>After Florida and clearing up of my skin, the contours of my face, around nose mainly, started peeling.</li>
            <li>I never suffered from severe acne, but I did expereince mild to moderate &amp;#34;pimpleage&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this beauty product.</li>
            <li>I normally use neutrogena products and they do wonders for my skin</li>
            <li>I alternate between this cleanser and their Fresh Foaming Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Normal to Oily skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those with normal skin.</li>
            <li>I have new acne scars.</li>
            <li>My skin and eyes are very sensitive......</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t normally use astringent products like this</li>
            <li>Proper skin care is a process that involves multiple steps and often times multiple products that when used together will achieve greater results.</li>
            <li>I have been using my Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser for a week now.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this Neutrogena Deep Clean soap numerous times</li>
            <li>A bottle will last me about a month because it does not take a big amount to sufficiently clean your face.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try Neutrogena deep clean facial cleanser</li>
            <li>My normal cleanser (which I typically used every day) wasn&#x27;t getting my face clean when used so infrequently</li>
            <li>I bought this to clear up some clogged pores on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>or it didn&#x27;t clear up the acne but</li>
            <li>I recommend it to any person that likes fast and deep cleaning of his/her face, to continue on the face care process.</li>
            <li>After buying this, my acne went away with use of this product 3 times a day, completely in 3 days.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old with combination skin.</li>
            <li>is sufficient enough for me and the gel lathers very well.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>No fuss and no skin irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(I am 25 years old currently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She also likes how soft her skin feels.</li>
            <li>I am a 46-something african-american woman that developed oily skin and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Although it may not remove all the oil and grime, it does cleanse well compared to other deep clean cleansers.</li>
            <li>the price, results, and overall quality, I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>and this product keeps my skin relatively dry, but not too dry, and feels clean.</li>
            <li>It is an absolute necessary in my bathroom ever since I began using it loyally for the past 3</li>
            <li>It took about a week before I connected the dots, and realized this was the only new product I had used on my face.</li>
            <li>I like not having to engage in major shine control not even 30 mins after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li>After reading other customer reviews about Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Facial Cleanser, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>If he goes even a few days without using Deep Clean he will begin breaking out.  </li>
            <li>actually went to Florida for a week, and while it rained for a good portion of the week, it also was humid and the sun beat down on us for the other half of the week.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to dryness caused by soaps, then a moisturizer will be necessary for you after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The soap is thick, creates a moderate lather, and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the remainder of my face runs normal to dry depending on the season.</li>
            <li>I guessed allergic reaction, and thankfully it has begun to clear up after two full days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;I was seriously considering a visit to my dermatologist...</li>
            <li>(which by the way, is AMAZING and did wonders for my skin), I started researching less expensive brands that would work for my very oily skin.</li>
            <li>This does not dry out my face</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>First night my skin felt tight and clean, a little dry the next day.</li>
            <li>When they say deep clean they mean it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t become oily nearly as fast after using this product compared to the previous two brands I mentioned.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not for the people with sensitive skin or skin that is prone to dry out often!  </li>
            <li>i am dark skinned and live in the tropics and have oily skin I use this every morning after a shower, its not harsh and it doesnt dry out my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Pretty sure there are better products at same price.</li>
            <li> So far, I am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel really silky after washing with it, and it gets make-up off really well too.  </li>
            <li> However, this is a powerful soap and so dryness occurs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using neutrogena products for years after trying many other brands that seemed to just make my face break out even more.</li>
            <li> but right after I had my baby</li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better than Clinique&#x27;s face wash, I will say that for the amount I paid, it does a pretty good job of cleansing my face without giving my skin that overly taut and dry feeling that I have experienced when I used other brands such as Clearasil and Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li> My experience so far is fine.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I felt a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I did some reading and many said it took some time to make the adjustment to different soaps sometimes,</li>
            <li> And my complexion got a bit lighter even in the first week.</li>
            <li> not so much!  </li>
            <li> I was unsure at first whether it was the cleanser or the followup  products, so I tried the cleanser alone.</li>
            <li> Just to be sure, I tried my follow up products days later, after cleansing my face with dove soap, no burn at all.</li>
            <li> I had to take two benadryl and apply hydrocortisone cream for it to finally get better.</li>
            <li> My face always feels very clean following use.  </li>
            <li> (even my mascara) and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin which I feel the Clean and Clear brand does.</li>
            <li> I use this and it really does deep clean my skin, I dont even need to use makeup remover!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, it cleans and work with your skin tone, and you really don&#x27;t need much to use!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular product to anyone!</li>
            <li> No weird smells, doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> if you have oily skin and are only getting the chance to wash every few days this is a great way to go.  </li>
            <li> Get rid of that oil with this gentle product.  </li>
            <li> i have very oily skin face</li>
            <li> I use this at the sink and Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser in the shower.</li>
            <li> The search got over the moment I found Deep Clean.</li>
            <li> I used deep clean on a Thursday using it twice per day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never use deep clean again.</li>
            <li> It foams up so nice with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I find this to be a pretty effective alternative to the more expensive face washes.    </li>
            <li> but i mainly use this one when im in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> After Florida and clearing up of my skin, the contours of my face, around nose mainly, started peeling.</li>
            <li> I never suffered from severe acne, but I did expereince mild to moderate &amp;#34;pimpleage&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this beauty product.</li>
            <li> I normally use neutrogena products and they do wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> I alternate between this cleanser and their Fresh Foaming Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Normal to Oily skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have new acne scars.</li>
            <li> My skin and eyes are very sensitive......</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t normally use astringent products like this</li>
            <li> Proper skin care is a process that involves multiple steps and often times multiple products that when used together will achieve greater results.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser for a week now.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this Neutrogena Deep Clean soap numerous times</li>
            <li> A bottle will last me about a month because it does not take a big amount to sufficiently clean your face.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try Neutrogena deep clean facial cleanser</li>
            <li> My normal cleanser (which I typically used every day) wasn&#x27;t getting my face clean when used so infrequently</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear up some clogged pores on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> or it didn&#x27;t clear up the acne but</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any person that likes fast and deep cleaning of his/her face, to continue on the face care process.</li>
            <li> After buying this, my acne went away with use of this product 3 times a day, completely in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old with combination skin.</li>
            <li> is sufficient enough for me and the gel lathers very well.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> No fuss and no skin irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (I am 25 years old currently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She also likes how soft her skin feels.</li>
            <li> I am a 46-something african-american woman that developed oily skin and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Although it may not remove all the oil and grime, it does cleanse well compared to other deep clean cleansers.</li>
            <li> the price, results, and overall quality, I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> and this product keeps my skin relatively dry, but not too dry, and feels clean.</li>
            <li> It is an absolute necessary in my bathroom ever since I began using it loyally for the past 3</li>
            <li> It took about a week before I connected the dots, and realized this was the only new product I had used on my face.</li>
            <li> I like not having to engage in major shine control not even 30 mins after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> After reading other customer reviews about Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Facial Cleanser, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> If he goes even a few days without using Deep Clean he will begin breaking out.  </li>
            <li> actually went to Florida for a week, and while it rained for a good portion of the week, it also was humid and the sun beat down on us for the other half of the week.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to dryness caused by soaps, then a moisturizer will be necessary for you after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The soap is thick, creates a moderate lather, and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the remainder of my face runs normal to dry depending on the season.</li>
            <li> I guessed allergic reaction, and thankfully it has begun to clear up after two full days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;I was seriously considering a visit to my dermatologist...</li>
            <li> (which by the way, is AMAZING and did wonders for my skin), I started researching less expensive brands that would work for my very oily skin.</li>
            <li> This does not dry out my face</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> First night my skin felt tight and clean, a little dry the next day.</li>
            <li> When they say deep clean they mean it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t become oily nearly as fast after using this product compared to the previous two brands I mentioned.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not for the people with sensitive skin or skin that is prone to dry out often!  </li>
            <li> i am dark skinned and live in the tropics and have oily skin I use this every morning after a shower, its not harsh and it doesnt dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> One problem was that it did dry out my lips if it ran over my mouth when I rinsed my face, so I spread a little petroleum on them first and that did the trick.</li>
            <li> They fixed the issue will the product will discolor due to some reaction with the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally put moisturizer on my face because my skin is a little oily</li>
            <li> Usually my regimen is to use this Neutrogena deep clean face wash in the shower and then immediately after the shower, I follow with the Neutrogena Heathy Skin moisturizer otherwise my skin will feel tight and dry, which is why it become oily later in the day without the moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottle goes a long way, I only use one squirt</li>
            <li> It will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to try a new facial soap because I was starting to get small acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> With that said, for me, someone who has no prior experience with dry skin or anything else, it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use a bathroom sink to rinse (vice a shower), you will likely have soap residue on your face and this will leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> What your left with is a clear radiant complexion, without the skin feeling like it&#x27;s been dried or stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li> It washes all of my makeup off the first time, no need for rinse and repeat or serious scrubbing.</li>
            <li> would certainly not recommend this product for daily use.</li>
            <li> So if this product doesn&#x27;t give you the desired results, you may want to research other products such as toners or clarifying lotions and moisturizers, etc,.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, my nose gets extremely oily while my forehead and the rest of my T-zone gets moderately oily.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a week, my skin ended up extremely dry and burning.</li>
            <li> this soap dry out your skin?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry or overly oil.</li>
            <li> It cleans deep down into the skin tissues and unclogs the pores.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a rethinking for Winter uses as it can dry out!</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling dry!</li>
            <li> I switched immediately back to using my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;standby, black soap &amp; baking soda mixture, it cleared up in about 3 days, but</li>
            <li> It removes all the foundation with one single use!</li>
            <li> If this is the item , you can tell even if he had to use a different product for as little as one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I never had a bad result with most of their products.</li>
            <li> is the only Neutrogena product that has ever affected my skin in such a negative way.</li>
            <li> You need to wet the face before applying it as a MUST.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly cleans without leaving a tight dry feeling to face. &lt;</li>
            <li> I still use other Neutrogena products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Withing minutes, my face was extremely dry,with peeling along my laugh-lines and below my under eye area.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use other Neutrogena products,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a major plus for someone who has ridiculously oily skin like myself.</li>
            <li> Gar soap... hand soap... not right for the oily face.  </li>
            <li> After one use, my skin felt tight and was extremely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I have no need for any other cleansing solution; this is one stop shopping!</li>
            <li> I last left to try an expensive cleanser thinking it</li>
            <li> I had a rash that covered the lower half of my face.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning my face was severely dry, chapped, red and painful.</li>
            <li> I understand why some people felt it was too harsh</li>
            <li> I use it all year round without scrubs or any additional cleansers.</li>
            <li> I have used this face wash everyday for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for years now.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for 2 months and the problem only seemed to get worse.  </li>
            <li> The product is extremely harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> a few of them turned into acne.</li>
            <li> but i only used this stuff twice and it dried out my skin so bad that vie had to put lotion on four times a day for the last three days</li>
            <li> The burning sensation when I used it never went away in that timeframe and my face not only became noticeably red, but I started getting painful pimples and whiteheads</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive for regular uses.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser the past two weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been living in the States for the past 4 years and since I got here, I had been looking for a face wash that was neither creamy nor had the tingling sensation (like mints) on my face.</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using this my forehead was cleared up within a week, not sure what would have happened if I never used this at all</li>
            <li> Usually one pump will do</li>
            <li> Leaves no residue or soil behind which was not the case when trying Oil of Olay and other products.</li>
            <li> been using it for about 3-4 years and so far i havent had a bad experience using it...</li>
            <li> Wrong as usual.</li>
            <li> make it worse.</li>
            <li> and they come in plastic bag, which is needless to say some of them is leaking.</li>
            <li> boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> By the end of the week my face was broken out with acne, and it was bad.</li>
            <li> and it was a bad experience.</li>
            <li> Feels like it takes out all the bad appearance from you face.</li>
            <li> then it is a bad product...</li>
            <li> I was unimpressed with this product and disappointed after the reviews.</li>
            <li> He has been cursed with horrible problem skin that can have bad cystic acne breakouts even though he is in his fifties.  </li>
            <li> Yet, whatever product I follow-up with (Neutrogena Naturals moisturizer, or makeup primer)stings very badly.</li>
            <li> BURNED HORRIBLY!</li>
            <li> Worst product I have used!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When they say deep clean they mean it.  I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t normally use astringent products like this but right after I had my baby I was only getting the chance to wash my face about twice a week.  My normal cleanser (which I typically used every day) wasn&#x27;t getting my face clean when used so infrequently so I tried this and it was a great find.  I understand why some people felt it was too harsh and I would never use it every day, but if you have oily skin and are only getting the chance to wash every few days this is a great way to go.  One problem was that it did dry out my lips if it ran over my mouth when I rinsed my face, so I spread a little petroleum on them first and that did the trick.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a week, my skin ended up extremely dry and burning. It took a good week for my skin to return to normal. I would not recommend this to people that have sensative skin</li>
            <li> This product satisfies all your needs for facial cleansing.  I recommend it to any person that likes fast and deep cleaning of his/her face, to continue on the face care process.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to try a new facial soap because I was starting to get small acne breakouts. After reading all the great reviews here and my past good experience with Neutrogena products, I thought I would give this a try. The first time I tried it, I felt a burning sensation. My face did feel relatively clean afterwards, but nothing special. The next day I had a big breakout and decided not to use it again.    I did some reading and many said it took some time to make the adjustment to different soaps sometimes, so I gave it another go. I thought using it twice a day for a week would be a good trial. The burning sensation when I used it never went away in that timeframe and my face not only became noticeably red, but I started getting painful pimples and whiteheads like I haven&#x27;t experienced since I was a teenager.     I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, as many people here attest to it being great for them, but I believe I gave it a fair shake and it was a bad experience. I still use other Neutrogena products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser for a week now. I used to use a L&#x27;Oreal one and switched to it recently to give it a try. My experience so far is fine. I wanted to share my assessment and here we go. I am not separating it in pros and cons, I am just putting the facts I found about it!    * This is a perfect product for those who are out to dirt and pollution for a long time- this one REALLY cleans!  * This is also a Summer Product- people living in tropical areas will find it perfect.  * I would suggest a rethinking for Winter uses as it can dry out! Using with a fine moisturizer will do though.  * This is definitely not for the people with sensitive skin or skin that is prone to dry out often!  * You need to wet the face before applying it as a MUST. Otherwise it will leave your skin out of moister!  * It is a bit expensive for regular uses. So Invest the money when you are sure.    For me, this is a working product! I have a skin prone to greasiness and it&#x27;s helping a lot to reduce that. And my complexion got a bit lighter even in the first week. I know I have to use it for more time to draw a conclusion. But for skin-care products, my philosophy is, if it is the product for you, your skin will love it at the first place. And my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be in adverse terms with this cleanser :)!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for years now. I use it all year round without scrubs or any additional cleansers. On its own, I feel it does a great job of cleansing. Although it may not remove all the oil and grime, it does cleanse well compared to other deep clean cleansers.</li>
            <li> BURNED HORRIBLY! Left my skin feeling dry and chapped. Used it only at night and the effects did not go away for days after use.</li>
            <li> I used this soap for a while now,I liked it very much. As soon as you wash your face with this soap, your skin looks clear and kind of shiny. Feels like it takes out all the bad appearance from you face.</li>
            <li> i absolutely LOVE this product. i am dark skinned and live in the tropics and have oily skin I use this every morning after a shower, its not harsh and it doesnt dry out my skin.  been using it for about 3-4 years and so far i havent had a bad experience using it...its also not the only fascial cleanser from Neutrogena i use but i mainly use this one when im in a hurry.  two thumbs up to Neutrogena :D</li>
            <li> After spending my whole life switching between facewashes looking for the perfect one, I finally found this. I have combination skin. I use this everyday and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Using it for over a year now and don&#x27;t plan on using anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly cleans without leaving a tight dry feeling to face. &lt;br /&gt;This product leaves Oil of Olay cleanser in the dust!  Leaves no residue or soil behind which was not the case when trying Oil of Olay and other products. Neutrogena periodically dispenses $1.00 off coupons which I look for and use.</li>
            <li> I have used this face wash everyday for years. Keeps the acne away without being too drying. Removes all makeup (I don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara which this cleanser will not remove). I use this at the sink and Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser in the shower.</li>
            <li> I normally use neutrogena products and they do wonders for my skin but this stuff... not so much!  I don&#x27;t normally put moisturizer on my face because my skin is a little oily but i only used this stuff twice and it dried out my skin so bad that vie had to put lotion on four times a day for the last three days and my skin still feels super dry and kind of like what heat ask feels like!!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have changed facial cleansers before and have always come back. I last left to try an expensive cleanser thinking it much be that much better. Wrong as usual. I love this one. I have been back to it for about a week now and already my skin has greatly improved. I also have tried the cream cleanser (Neutrogena) and, for me, it doesn&#x27;t compare. I&#x27;ll not be straying again. It washes all of my makeup off the first time, no need for rinse and repeat or serious scrubbing. This is by far the best. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Keep using it. Pretty sure there are better products at same price. But I just get used to it.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes quality affordable products.  For skin care I like the results and I would recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> Because everyone is different, it will work differently for everyone. With that said, for me, someone who has no prior experience with dry skin or anything else, it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually went to Florida for a week, and while it rained for a good portion of the week, it also was humid and the sun beat down on us for the other half of the week. By the end of the week my face was broken out with acne, and it was bad. After buying this, my acne went away with use of this product 3 times a day, completely in 3 days. So all in all, it&#x27;s great for clearing up your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly not recommend this product for daily use. After Florida and clearing up of my skin, the contours of my face, around nose mainly, started peeling. I will certainly discontinue my use of this product for something not as strong, but will have to keep this on hand for those sporadic breakouts.</li>
            <li> Good but i prefer Cetaphil and Cera ve now.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this cleanser and their Fresh Foaming Cleanser.  This one makes my skin feel a bit more \\&quot;squeakier\\&quot; which I like when the weather is warmer.  This is a great cleanser and should work for anyone except someone with very dry skin. This does not dry out my face and I have combination skin. This is a must have for a gel cleanser.</li>
            <li> Woke up after using this s***. Had puffy eyelids and red itchy blotches all over my freakin face. NEVER USING NEUTROGENA EVER AGAIN.!!</li>
            <li> We have been using this face wash in our house for years, and love it.</li>
            <li> I order 4 of this and they come in plastic bag, which is needless to say some of them is leaking. I would have think they would come in a box instead of plastic bag, which look like they were package manually and individual.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old with combination skin. I have used this cleanser the past two weeks and I had immediate acne flair ups as well as over drying. I was unimpressed with this product and disappointed after the reviews. Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love my smooth skin and leaves</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products because of their purity of ingredients. This is a wonderful deep cleaning facial cleanser. It cleans deep down into the skin tissues and unclogs the pores. What your left with is a clear radiant complexion, without the skin feeling like it&#x27;s been dried or stripped of moisture. This bottle seems to last and last, and lathers up well. It is great for skin that tends to be oily like mind, because as I said it does not strip away all the moisture out of your skin. I highly recommend this beauty product.</li>
            <li> Gar soap... hand soap... not right for the oily face.  Get rid of that oil with this gentle product.  Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Normal to Oily skin I use this facial Cleanser every day and I have no problem with it what so ever I love it !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while and it&#x27;s a really good cleanser for me. Does not dry out my skin and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, it cleans and work with your skin tone, and you really don&#x27;t need much to use! I definitely recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been living in the States for the past 4 years and since I got here, I had been looking for a face wash that was neither creamy nor had the tingling sensation (like mints) on my face. The search got over the moment I found Deep Clean. I have been using it everyday for years now. I am extremely satisfied with it as it cleans really well (even my mascara) and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin which I feel the Clean and Clear brand does. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Truly a quality product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face too dry, but does a good job at removing most makeup.</li>
            <li> After deciding that I could no longer afford to pay $15 per bottle for [[ASIN:B000Z4P538 CLINIQUE by Clinique: Liquid Facial Soap Oily Skin Formular 6F39--/6.7OZ]] (which by the way, is AMAZING and did wonders for my skin), I started researching less expensive brands that would work for my very oily skin. After reading other customer reviews about Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Facial Cleanser, I decided to give it a shot. So far, I am quite pleased with it. While I won&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better than Clinique&#x27;s face wash, I will say that for the amount I paid, it does a pretty good job of cleansing my face without giving my skin that overly taut and dry feeling that I have experienced when I used other brands such as Clearasil and Clean &amp; Clear. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t become oily nearly as fast after using this product compared to the previous two brands I mentioned. This is a major plus for someone who has ridiculously oily skin like myself. I like not having to engage in major shine control not even 30 mins after cleansing my face. I also like that it comes in a pump bottle-one pump is sufficient enough for me and the gel lathers very well. Overall, I find this to be a pretty effective alternative to the more expensive face washes.    With all that said, I also think it is important to mention that using this product-or most other face wash products-alone is not enough to get the healthy, beautiful skin that most people desire. Proper skin care is a process that involves multiple steps and often times multiple products that when used together will achieve greater results. So if this product doesn&#x27;t give you the desired results, you may want to research other products such as toners or clarifying lotions and moisturizers, etc,.  that you can use in addition to this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It foams up so nice with just a small amount.  My face always feels very clean following use.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I&#x27;m hooked for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear up some clogged pores on my forehead.  I used it every day for 2 months and the problem only seemed to get worse.  Once I stopped using this my forehead was cleared up within a week, not sure what would have happened if I never used this at all but if it only works when u stop using it then it is a bad product... lol</li>
            <li> Love this product for many years.&lt;br /&gt;It feels really clean to remove all my make up.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that I just order on line and Amazon delivers it right to my door!</li>
            <li> I buy this when it runs out. That says a lot for someone like me. I try to shake things up with my skin care regime and somehow I always manage to come back to this product.</li>
            <li> After one use, my skin felt tight and was extremely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not hating on the product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Worst product I have used! Leaves face feeling dry! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena and DHC products exclusively, with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a cleanser, and tried this product. After using, I felt a tingling sensation, sort of burning and itchy... and my skin got red, bumpy and blotchy. It took about a week before I connected the dots, and realized this was the only new product I had used on my face. I guessed allergic reaction, and thankfully it has begun to clear up after two full days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;I was seriously considering a visit to my dermatologist...it was that bad!&lt;br /&gt;This is the only Neutrogena product that has ever affected my skin in such a negative way.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love how it makes my skin feel really silky after washing with it, and it gets make-up off really well too.  I&#x27;ve tried the generic brand at Target, and it just doesn&#x27;t work the same.  Stick with the original!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. No weird smells, doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and is easy to use. No fuss and no skin irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> muy bueno el producto y llego a tiempo, muy responsable el vendedor, me gusta el producto, sin más que decir</li>
            <li> The 6oz. bottle goes a long way, I only use one squirt and it lathers up nicely.  It will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, my nose gets extremely oily while my forehead and the rest of my T-zone gets moderately oily. However, the remainder of my face runs normal to dry depending on the season. I though this would be the perfect product as it claims to be formulated for normal to oily skin... boy, was I wrong. The product is extremely harsh on my skin. After use,my skin does feel clean. Yet, whatever product I follow-up with (Neutrogena Naturals moisturizer, or makeup primer)stings very badly. I was unsure at first whether it was the cleanser or the followup  products, so I tried the cleanser alone. Withing minutes, my face was extremely dry,with peeling along my laugh-lines and below my under eye area. This signals a mild chemical burn. Just to be sure, I tried my follow up products days later, after cleansing my face with dove soap, no burn at all. Also, My oily areas over compensated for the dryness caused by this product making my nose more oily than normal by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I am a tried and true believer in this face wash. I&#x27;ve been using neutrogena products for years after trying many other brands that seemed to just make my face break out even more. I never suffered from severe acne, but I did expereince mild to moderate &amp;#34;pimpleage&amp;#34; fro the time I was 14 y/o until I was about 21 (I am 25 years old currently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash cleans all of the dirt and oils off of my face, does a great job at clearing (I&#x27;d say about 75% of my) clogged pores, and it removes every makeup or facial product that I have ever had on (even good aound halloween). It is an absolute necessary in my bathroom ever since I began using it loyally for the past 3+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I dont use this facewash, my forehead and nose become oily by the end of the day. Usually my regimen is to use this Neutrogena deep clean face wash in the shower and then immediately after the shower, I follow with the Neutrogena Heathy Skin moisturizer otherwise my skin will feel tight and dry, which is why it become oily later in the day without the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I get a pimple now, it&#x27;s once a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Neutrogena never gets rid of this product!</li>
            <li> I use this with another medication to reduce the acne in my face&lt;br /&gt;it cleans well and it helped me to reach my goal</li>
            <li> I tried this product on Wednesday night. It felt great then. When I woke up the next morning my face was severely dry, chapped, red and painful. I am still dealing with the problems today. It feels and looks like sun burn only it also itches. To be honest this is the first time a Neutrogena product did this to me - but I won&#x27;t be using this one again anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, try it on a small patch of skin on your face first, then wait and see.</li>
            <li> the product is very good and does what it promises to do.  I would recommend it to those with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this Neutrogena Deep Clean soap numerous times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this soap to be very effective for cleaning my face. I have oily skin so I need something that is strong. This soap works well for me and reduces breakouts significantly. I wash my face with this one to two times a day. A bottle will last me about a month because it does not take a big amount to sufficiently clean your face. Usually one pump will do fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is thick, creates a moderate lather, and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this soap dry out your skin? It can if you do not rinse the soap thoroughly off your face. If you use a bathroom sink to rinse (vice a shower), you will likely have soap residue on your face and this will leave your skin dry. I apply sunscreen before I go out anyway so this is a non issue for me. However, this is a powerful soap and so dryness occurs. If you are sensitive to dryness caused by soaps, then a moisturizer will be necessary for you after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, results, and overall quality, I highly recommend this soap. I&#x27;ve used it for over a year and will continue to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Love this, it takes off my make up and is good for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item!  My skin feels great after each wash! I have no need for any other cleansing solution; this is one stop shopping!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  It&#x27;s a great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling stripped or caked with soap.</li>
            <li> My skin and eyes are very sensitive......this does not bother me at all so I can continue to use this product!! Will continue to buy this item!!!</li>
            <li> great product! i have very oily skin face and this product keeps my skin relatively dry, but not too dry, and feels clean. i use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, gave this a try. First night my skin felt tight and clean, a little dry the next day. Third morning after, my skin was burning, blistering and itchy. I had to take two benadryl and apply hydrocortisone cream for it to finally get better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry or overly oil. They fixed the issue will the product will discolor due to some reaction with the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I use this and it really does deep clean my skin, I dont even need to use makeup remover! It removes all the foundation with one single use!</li>
            <li> My sixteen daughter loves this stuff. She has tried multiple cleansers to combat &amp;#34;break outs.&amp;#34; According to her....this is the only one that works. She also likes how soft her skin feels.</li>
            <li> I am a 46-something african-american woman that developed oily skin and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moderate acne at 30. I thought I&#x27;d try Neutrogena deep clean facial cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as I never had a bad result with most of their products. The worst results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;being is caused my face to produce more oil  or it didn&#x27;t clear up the acne but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t make it worse. I used deep clean on a Thursday using it twice per day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;within 3 days I had a rash that covered the lower half of my face. It was itchy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and a few of them turned into acne. I switched immediately back to using my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;standby, black soap &amp; baking soda mixture, it cleared up in about 3 days, but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now I have new acne scars. I will continue to use other Neutrogena products,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I will never use deep clean again.</li>
            <li> I used to use this years ago and after bouncing around to various brands I came back to this product. My face feels so clean after using it and I like the scent - not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Okay - I agree with others that this face wash can be drying.  I would not use it.  However, my husband swears by it and I see his results.  He has been cursed with horrible problem skin that can have bad cystic acne breakouts even though he is in his fifties.  If he goes even a few days without using Deep Clean he will begin breaking out.  He is a firefighter and is usually very good about bringing all of his grooming items when he works a 24 or 48-hour shift.  Occasionally he forgets an item.  If this is the item , you can tell even if he had to use a different product for as little as one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to believe what I see and his testimonial.</li>
