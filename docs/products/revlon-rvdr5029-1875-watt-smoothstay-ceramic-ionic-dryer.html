            <li>i wanted a good hair dryer but needed it to be light weight.</li>
            <li>It has more than one heat setting which makes it nice for styling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and perfect temperature settings.</li>
            <li>So far So GREAT!</li>
            <li>Light weight, dries my hair quickly, good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good to change cool wind to warm wind.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good to compare with who use every day.&lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful but heats well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly and has saved me a lot of time in the mornings!</li>
            <li>I use only the cooler setting which is great and the speeds work great.  </li>
            <li>my first purchase is still in great working condition after 3 years.  </li>
            <li>While I was pretty happy with this hair dryer for a while, it died at 7 months in.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant when I purchased this because I&#x27;ve never used Revlon before and the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It has a very comfortable  feel when handling it and</li>
            <li>very light weight.  </li>
            <li>Very light, doesn&#x27;t cause frizziness, etc.  </li>
            <li>It stopped working in a week, very very cheap dryer.</li>
            <li>It dos the job quickly and effectively; what more needs to be said!</li>
            <li>First if you are looking for a dryer that is powerful then this is not the best choice.</li>
            <li>but I am beyond happy with this hair dryer - it does a great job at what it needs to dry!</li>
            <li>its price is okay</li>
            <li>Oh, and purple is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>wife said it works ok</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>this has been my favorite blow dryer till now</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it has heat settings because I can use a lower heat.</li>
            <li>And now I see this has happened to many others.</li>
            <li>Secondly, having this hair dryer I&#x27;ve been so pleased and impressed by it.</li>
            <li>I love the product and am so glad I purchased it,</li>
            <li>After using the dryer for five days, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, though, so overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this blow dryer there are so many to choose from.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>love how the buttons can be changed while holding it in one hand.</li>
            <li>Many variations of settings.</li>
            <li>We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fantastic choice for the price!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any product, so that might make it work even better.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s purple, which is a superficial thing to look for</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>Thats all I needed though :)</li>
            <li>but I purchased this 12/12/2012 and was pleased with every aspect of its performance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know - should a hair dryer work for more than13 months?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use one more than once a week.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I really love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it thank you :)</li>
            <li>I love the color too</li>
            <li>I am more comfortable with the warm setting.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better that way anyways since you don&#x27;t want your hair to be fried.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>feels light and cheap but is actually a really good dryer, but the attachment keeps popping off,</li>
            <li>I love the groovy color of the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift which has been enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for a hair dryer that would hold up for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidentally hit the off switch.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>I love this one better that</li>
            <li>and i loved it so much i had to buy my own.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>satisfied with this purchase and for the price can&#x27;t be matched.</li>
            <li>love purple</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the ions work, but it surely keeps my hair in place.</li>
            <li>Manufacturers, you can do better than that.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer dries my hair with a lovely shine.</li>
            <li>which I love &amp;</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I got the Revlon.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $16.95 for it, if it&#x27;s more I would look around.</li>
            <li>but my favorite is the Taiff that I bought in Brasil.</li>
            <li>I have used it many times.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The Ionic heat dries my hair much faster, and my hair is not damaged at all and still in great shape.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love the grip on it with the handle</li>
            <li>Love the click/press buttons/control on this for changing the speed and temperature vs most dryers that have the sliding type button/control.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product for what I paid :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I just love this dryer---sturdy and reliable.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t make me pour sweat</li>
            <li>and it just seems to give me more control over the hair drying process.  </li>
            <li>The best hair dryer for multiple heat and blow options</li>
            <li>I  love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>i wish hair dryers were smaller -- this one seems rather bulky, but it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I do like this dryer because it&#x27;s purple :) It also has many settings, and is Iconic and ceramic, which is better for hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife, who used it mostly every day for 11 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, LOVE this blow dryer.</li>

            <li>Nice quality and handle is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better for straighter</li>
            <li>Love the difference it makes with my hair - fast delivery and great packaging.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- ionic and ceramic so better for hair</li>
            <li>and I think it is even more helpful.</li>

            <li>&#x3D;) love the color, easy to use and drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li>But I just used it for the first time and I am in love!  </li>
            <li>Finally, every day is a good hair day!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The attachment is easy to snap on and off.</li>

            <li>Its easy to use and works</li>
            <li>but it slides off easily.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to operate onehanded with thumb while holding it.  </li>
            <li>However, the attachment easily falls off the end of the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Hi powered, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer and I love the various heat settings.</li>
            <li>The ionic function is easy on hair and prevents &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; and split ends.</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes with the direction attachment which is great for my short hair.</li>
            <li>the Wind is strong.</li>
            <li>It is not for professionals, cause it is not so strong.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>If the force of the air is too strong, however, my hair just flies away, instead of shaping around the brush.  </li>
            <li>OK dryer - nothing special</li>
            <li>It is still nice and does not over heat or get too hot and I like the hanging loop</li>
            <li>Love that is has a cool shot setting I purchase a diffuser to protect my hair</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it has a cool, warm and hot setting.</li>
            <li>On hot is is warm.  </li>
            <li>She uses it on the warm setting and it is hot.  </li>
            <li>Love the cool shot function to hold the look</li>
            <li>Multiple settings make it flexible for use and it is excellent quality especially considering the fair price.  </li>
            <li>Also, the concentrator goes on easily and securely.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>but I pushed the reset button on the plug and it worked just fine afterwards, no problems.</li>
            <li>works fine for the price</li>
            <li>I was drying my hair and it kept shutting off - i tried the heat setting and was fine, then adjusted the speed and that worked fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight(ish) waist length hair.  </li>
            <li>best deal for this price.was looking for a hair dryer for daily use with 3 options (normal,warm and hot) couldn&#x27;t have bargained btter at this price.</li>
            <li>As a hairdryer it works fine</li>
            <li>This is fine though.</li>
            <li>it is fine.</li>
            <li>This dryer works fine.  </li>
            <li>my fine shoulder length hair in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;lots of air and temp options.</li>
            <li>It is light weigh and strong.</li>
            <li>And, luckily, I was standing in front of the sink, so I was able to toss it into the sink so nothing got burned.  </li>
            <li>It melted them so well and so quickly!</li>
            <li>This dryer is lightweight and dries quickly without creating hair static.</li>
            <li>It has many settings, and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you want a good, light weight hair dryer with optional heat &amp; speed settings, at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>Ugh I love this blow dryer but the cap keeps falling off , it&#x27;s get very hot</li>
            <li>Very light and powerful.</li>
            <li>just fine, its light weight</li>
            <li>Not too hot, has more then one heat setting (Hot, warm and cool!)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definitely a difference in the three heat settings; the medium setting works great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>My Original Review - Works well, is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>a huge spark comes out.</li>
            <li>I read the comments about it catching on fire but thought that was something that surely had been fixed.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>No complains.&lt;br /&gt;The hairdryer is light weight</li>

            <li>Was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I wondered if it was because after I applied my bonus points the item was free.</li>
            <li>I understand it was a cheap hair dryer</li>
            <li>It feels nice to hold and use, it&#x27;s also more quiet than most.</li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>1875 Watt Smoothstay Ceramic...not happy, as a stylist, the cord is too short, it dropped to the floor once, and the insides all fell apart and not useable.  </li>

            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I was shopping around and this caught my eye first because of the color (purple is my favorite) -</li>
            <li>I love how lightweight this is and that it heats up fast!</li>
            <li>original review ----&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you can clean the lint trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great hairdryer, I like that the nozel detaches so you can customize how you dry your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly and is smooth and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Great hair dryer, drys hair twice as fast as my old dryer.</li>
            <li>First it is light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>For anybody with extremely curly hair this is the best blow dryer, dries fast &amp; no frizz.</li>
            <li>Works well, nothing too special</li>
            <li>And, this did not do anthing special for my hair.</li>
            <li>For many years purchased Conair, then switched to a Revlon Ionic that  I liked and lasted many years but the above item is so superior to the previously  owned Revlon.</li>
            <li>wind is very strong and really smooth~~also very light.&lt;br /&gt;The most useful dyer I have ever~</li>
            <li>Works great, just as expected</li>
            <li>It over heated and didn&#x27;t really have a change in temperature between hot and warm.</li>
            <li>It works great with as minimal damage to my hair as a blow dryer can be.</li>
            <li>She is heavily influenced by looks first, which this has, but she said this is the best hair dryer she ever used.</li>
            <li>This dryer is ok if you have straight hair and need a bit of air</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a month now and have only good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>Good, simple hair dryer.</li>
            <li>With the 3 speeds and 3 heat settings this gives the user 9 combinations, plus, a button to provide a cool blast of air.&lt;br /&gt;Great choice.</li>
            <li>There are 3 heat settings, a cool button and 3 air speeds.  </li>
            <li>I did not find this too be true on my hair</li>
            <li>It has the cool air setting, which is what I like to use.</li>
            <li>I also like the cool air feature as it helps with smoothing hair at the end of styling.  </li>
            <li>It has 2 heat settings, 2 speeds and the cool switch.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels nice and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>so good in fact that my daughter borrowed it, last I saw of it.</li>
            <li>So, the good news is, I can keep fixing the cord until it gets too short.</li>
            <li>It is light but powerful.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a cool setting in addition to the cool shot button.</li>
            <li>Cool purple color too.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how nice this hair dryer is.  </li>
            <li>It has good power, yet can turn on low and cool to finish styling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent.</li>
            <li>I was able to take the unit apart, cut the power cord, strip the new end and re-solder it in place, good as new, however, this isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened.</li>
            <li>In addition to loving purple, the back side of the dryer is rubberized which makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>only downside is the narrow nozzle which will be better suited to fine hair (perfect for me)</li>
            <li>you need a blow dryer that&#x27;s super affordable, does the job, and has all the cool extras, get the Revlon RDVR5029 1875 Watt Smoothstay Ceramic Ionic Dryer.</li>
            <li>I loved it very much.. has all the features in the best price .. cold shot button, ionic and ceramic etc</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and have experienced none of the problems other reviewers mentioned.  </li>
            <li>and works quickly.</li>
            <li>Dried my hair perfect and fast .</li>
            <li>Mine is super noisy and smells burn inside.</li>
            <li>Dryes hair quickly...</li>
            <li>It will get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky it was not my face.  </li>
            <li>dries really quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair dries so quickly using it.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>so I figured I should give this product a quick review.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, this seemed like a decent replacement.  </li>
            <li>Hair dries quickly, I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time drying the hair.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn hair.  </li>
            <li>Super lightweight and heats up pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>I guess I am lucky mine</li>
            <li>Light-weight and dries my hair quick.</li>
            <li>Nothing extraordinary</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use temperature setting on hot because it is very hot!  </li>
            <li>While it is not as powerful as others we have used it still dries just as fast as more powerful models.</li>
            <li>The dryer gets very hot, hotter than the Conair.</li>
            <li>No far so good.</li>
            <li>It has good power and is not extremely loud.  </li>
            <li>It does heat up and cool down nicely, but the top keeps falling off and it does not allow for applying pressure and thus, providing a quality blow-out.</li>
            <li>I love my new hair dyer.</li>
            <li>Works very well dries hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Fast drying and easy to use.</li>

            <li>It is powerful and dries her hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Every time I use this, it leaves my hair very soft, shinny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>2 times a week and with this hair does in less than 15 minutes, very good air flow and heat you need, really exceeded expectations ..</li>
            <li>The hot setting is warm and the strength is far from powerful.</li>
            <li>works great and dry&#x27;s your hair fast.  </li>
            <li>There are many different settings to choose from and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the many options on this dryer: low, medium and high in addition to cool, warm and hot.</li>
            <li>I love the hot, warm and cool, and the high and low settings on this hair dyer.</li>
            <li>I have medium-length, straight fine hair, and to give it any shape at all I need to curl it around a brush while drying.  </li>
            <li>What I really like about this dryer is it leaves her hair looking smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Hotels always have very basic dryers, and the ceramic ionic dryers are amazing at controlling frizz and making styling easier no matter where you travel.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous hair dryer, not too heavy and the low fan speed is perfect.</li>
            <li>this was worth it.  </li>

            <li>Love the color and drys faster than my old hair dryer</li>
            <li>Feel the Ceramic lonic make my hair more soft.  </li>
            <li>Works great, I was surprised at how well considering how low cost it is.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and deep.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 12 yr old granddaughter for Christmas, purple is her favorite color.  </li>
            <li>Now don&#x27;t laugh</li>
            <li>quick dry easy handling so much better</li>
            <li>worth having to replace a unit every 6-7 months.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, powerful dryer.</li>
            <li>All temperatures are luke warm and all speeds are very low.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much better than the old one.</li>
            <li>She loved it so much, we purchased an extra one for the house!  </li>
            <li>the extra settings are nice.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth the gamble.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I&#x27;m used to, but does the job.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve mostly used it on Hi/warm or Lo</li>
            <li>I color my own hair, which dries it out a bit, and I have a real problem with fly-away hair right near my forehead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far i use it ok, price right when i bought it.</li>
            <li>This blowdryer gets super hot, but it doesn&#x27;t burn the hair.</li>
            <li>If I hold the cord in the right position, it will run.  </li>
            <li>control right</li>
            <li>so I would not be hanging it by that loop, which is right adjacent to the cord strain relief.</li>
            <li>I think the price is right for this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>After a bath he goes right over to where I plug it in and waits for me.  </li>
            <li>the price was right, it does the job</li>
            <li>my sounded like a truck and the price was right too.</li>
            <li>High medium low, cool warm hot, and a cool button.</li>
            <li>There are setting for heat (hot, warm or cool), and blower settings (high or low), and a cool burst button.  </li>
            <li>I like how light it is and the black part on the handle is made of that smooth, matte finish rubber-like material that I love so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a lighter weight hair dryer that enabled me to have a cool dry, warm, hot, or multiplied choices.</li>
            <li>This is actually pretty loud, I think, but it does its job :)</li>
            <li>Is powerful, has high and low settings, as well as warm and cool settings.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to start putting it into full use, I particularly like the fact that it prevents frizzing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good and fast to dry the hair.</li>
            <li>I really liked this dryer, not as much as my previous one, but I liked the different heat options and the cool shot.</li>
            <li>I love the different settings, cool to hot.</li>
            <li>Capable of 9 separate settings and cool or blast button.</li>
            <li>power chord is fairly long as well which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>With hot, warm and cool as well as high and low settings, this dryer gives you all the styling options you need plus plenty of power.</li>
            <li>and I like the hot, warm, and cool settings plus the high and low.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say too much about it other than that she says it&#x27;s a GREAT blow dryer</li>
            <li>Its lightweight and quick. Makes my somewhat curley hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>You can HEAR how much more powerful this one is than my last.</li>
            <li>quick service, works very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than our old one and has better heat settings.</li>
            <li>I am Black with fairly nappy hair and it(with</li>
            <li>GETS THE JOB DONE SUPER FAST</li>
            <li>, I have used it now for a week - and I truly didn&#x27;t expect to notice a dramatic difference in that short of a time - but let me tell you, this is the best thing my hair has seen in many years.  </li>
            <li>It does not blow as strong as the old VS 1875.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought because she liked the first one so much.  </li>
            <li>I was super impressed in the beginning - but recently I noticed it did not turn on right away, after 10+ seconds it started with a loud sound &amp; slow operation.</li>
            <li>The different heat setting and speed settings are amazing for my hair, the cool switch is pretty cool as well.&lt;br /&gt;There are only two problems I have with it:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy and certainly much cheaper than some of the other hairdryers I looked at!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original unit I got, I just assumed wasn&#x27;t serviceable and bought a new one.</li>
            <li>There are three settings--cold, warm, and hot--that can be used with a low or high air speed.</li>
            <li>although hair not always as shiny as it was the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>no weird smells, no overheating.</li>
            <li>Was able to strap it to the well-pipe so it could thaw while I went back inside.</li>
            <li>love the dryer, cord is very short</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work at first</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and soft and not frizzy anymore.  </li>
            <li>hot setting is too hot, but medium is just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Hot setting is just that...</li>
            <li>Then it stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted/needed and delivered in two days.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that!</li>
            <li>At first it appeared this was the one.</li>
            <li>Never gets hot---</li>
            <li>Its not real heavy, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer all the same.</li>
            <li>She had purchased the Revlon Smoothstay Ceramic Ionic Dryer recently, and I fell in love with it to the point that I decided to buy one exactly like it.</li>
            <li>Really fast delivery got it within two days!</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as pictured and works fantastically.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairdryer!</li>
            <li>This is all if you&#x27;re ok with a possible fire hazard.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>hot art.</li>
            <li>Ceramic doesnt get too hot.  </li>
            <li>So glad i ignored those who said it wasnt hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing a different hair dryer that works better.</li>
            <li>(The first one broke after a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>My first one has lasted years</li>
            <li>Truthfully, this is the only hairdryer that I ever want.  </li>
            <li>Pretty goof power supply works exactly how its suppose to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks, but am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it which was about a month ago.</li>
            <li>With 3 heat settings, I would expect the hot to be hot.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot and blows hair around.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this hair dryer if you are looking to straighten your hair with smooth, shiny results!</li>
            <li>It really does everything it promises!</li>
            <li>The plastic is extremely hot after I using it</li>
            <li>I would recommend this dryer - does exactly what it says it will do..</li>
            <li>For the first month</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have expensive dryers to compare it to, but it&#x27;s the best dryer under $35</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working after a year.</li>
            <li>It stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer, it is so quiet and dries my hair in no time at all.  </li>
            <li>Handle doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is exactly what I wanted and is affordable.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt get that hot</li>
            <li>not burn my scalp even on hot set.</li>
            <li>Its wind is evenly and not over hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for for a few months and it still works as good as it did in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, the buttons are great, nothing wrong with the cord, love the different speeds and warming levels.</li>
            <li>It is LIGHTER than my old dryer, has a STRONGER blower and though doesn&#x27;t get as hot, drys my hair FASTER!!  </li>
            <li>quiet, quick, and light weight&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works great to get the hair dry daily.</li>
            <li>If you are someone who just wants their hair to look nice and be dry then this is the dryer for you.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>When I purchased this hairdryer, the reviews were mixed, but considering there were more good than bad and the price point was good, I decided to try it out.  </li>
            <li>It is very light weight and dries my hair fast on the low setting.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by how powerful it is!</li>
            <li>used it for the first time today, it is strong enough and love the different speeds.</li>
            <li>The dryer dries my hair extremely quickly and leaves it extremely shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable holding this while drying my long hair.  </li>
            <li>so some new great dryer technology so after reading a lot of reviews I settled on a much more expensive Babyliss dryer.  </li>
            <li>As good or better than all those expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, and air is consistently hot, but it could be a little bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase, it really cuts down  the frizz when I use it.</li>
            <li>This is a light weight hair dryer of standard size ( not compact like in hotels) and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I like this hair dryer because it has a strong fan and gets hot enough to work quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn tricks but it does dry my hair and makes it very smooth.</li>
            <li>It dries fast without getting too hot that you can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when I got this hair dryer, but unfortunately it was not that great. &#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this dryer a long time, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>did some research on other dryers and realized that they had a problem with catching on fire or the handle heats up too fast.</li>
            <li>most of all, it really works well with my round brush and made my hair looks smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly with less static in the hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the heating options with low medium high cool&lt;br /&gt;Warm</li>
            <li>Nice color and makes less noise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice rubber coating over the black plastic as well.</li>
            <li>I wanted one that was smaller easy to handle with one hand&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This dries my hair quickly and it feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is light and pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>Not too big so it is easy to store.</li>
            <li>It blows strongly and has lots of different settings.</li>
            <li>a certain way in order to use it.  </li>
            <li>I love the multiple settings especially the cool heat option.</li>
            <li>My dried hair is shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great dryer - one odd thing - when the package arrived, there was a perfumy scent, not only on the outer box, but the box the dryer came in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it dried my hair more quickly</li>
            <li>I want to dry my hair quickly, but high heat just doesn&#x27;t work for my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Hope it last a long time, if not will only purchase this model again, and if it&#x27;s not available, I&#x27;m sure whatever Revlon makes will be fine and do a great job.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for someone with short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Worked fine up until one morning when it starting smoking and flamed up.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and damaged, but has looked and felt noticeable better (smoother, softer, straighter) since getting this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that such a great dryer cost me so little</li>
            <li>Just very nice.love it..</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, light weight.</li>
            <li>Given I would not spend much on a hair styling electronic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very quite.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>When your hand is damp, or you have some lotion on, it is very slippery.</li>
            <li>The heat is very controlled in my opinion, even in the hottest setting, and my hair does not feel as though it is being fried.</li>
            <li>The price on this dryer is so reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>As in, real fire.  </li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well for her.</li>
            <li>Starting with damp hair, I could see that it was staying smooth as it was drying.</li>
            <li>I bought two types of dryers, and I like the one with the jet stream flow, not this one as much.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair so fast</li>
            <li>Cheap, quiet, lightweight, and ionic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really dries hair fast.</li>
            <li>I dont use the heat that much</li>
            <li>but it does work and really heats up your hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price I paid</li>
            <li>and she thought it work very well,</li>
            <li>the help of a straightening attachment} gets my hair straight while leaving in body</li>
            <li>It is really lightweight and it doesnt make much noise.</li>
            <li>Some of them heat up so much it burns you.</li>
            <li>This heats gently and the funnel controls the volume of air you want.</li>
            <li>It really bother me but can&#x27;t do anything now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still flabbergasted it worked so fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It functioned very well.</li>
            <li>VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>That way if I need a drier, which happens occasionally, I still have one available when my wife goes out of town.</li>
            <li>Thanks - Satish K B</li>
            <li>My 9 year old wanted purple, so that&#x27;s a bonus, but the dryer is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It dries hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Hair comes out much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have much hair, but its not what I got it for.  </li>
            <li>Next, my hair has never been so frizz free.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>She says it dries her hair really fast</li>
            <li>shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I thought this hairdryer would have all the qualities I needed - 3 heat settings and 2 blow levels, plus ionic, ceramic, quiet and light.  </li>
            <li>So I wanted to go much cheaper with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and would recommend this.</li>
            <li>dries fast, attachments stay on well, and i have TONS of hair.</li>
            <li>Some cons are that I notice my hair is very staticy after use, and the blow isn&#x27;t very forceful.</li>
            <li>The selling price was too cheap to have to pay for shipping back and forth for a replacement.</li>
            <li>Works very well and dryer fast.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast, but doesn&#x27;t damage it.  </li>
            <li>It came with the diffuser and arrived so much sooner.</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is also much quieter and dries my hair faster.</li>
            <li>and it dries fast and smoothes my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how that works, but it really does.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t real noisy</li>
            <li>I dont seem to know much about these because I&#x27;ve never had one</li>
            <li>Not as much power as I would like but</li>
            <li>its lightweight too.. dries hairs fast..</li>
            <li>I have really crappy hair.  </li>
            <li>the price on Amazon was reasonable.</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how much it did to de-frizz her hair when she used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful (fast drying) as my old Vidal Sassoon dryer</li>
            <li>The variety allows me to easily use the dryer on my 4 year old&#x27;s hair when necessary without her complaining the air is too hot.  </li>
            <li>If you are maintaining long hair, good luck with the time it takes to dry it with this one, but if you are maintaining a style and you like the salon feel, then this one is your choice item.</li>
            <li>My wife is delighted with this hair, she has long hair, and dry and brush</li>
            <li>was looking forward to trying this new hot Ionic Dryer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle, long cord.</li>
            <li>Despite the high speed seeming more like medium this dryer has a high heat setting that will dry your hair fast.  </li>
            <li>It also gives me a lot of volume, which I haven&#x27;t been able to get from other dryers.  </li>
            <li>Mine started making some clicking noises like the fan is sliding through some objects constantly during use and its wind speed is significantly lower than before.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its ok.</li>
            <li>but this defeinitely gets the job done better than any other druer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Compared to all other hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned this one lasted the longest and endured the most use.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to this Revlon model because of the positive reviews, the light weight (because I have arthritis in my hands), and the desire to stop burning my scalp and fingers when I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most powerful and yet small hand dryers that I&#x27;ve had - and I had a couple of the years ...&lt;</li>
            <li>It takes a while for it to cool down using the cool switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from all the nifty features I&#x27;ve listed above, the most important thing to me was how fast it dried my hair.</li>
            <li>The dryer is light weight and easy to handle when you are running late for work.  </li>
            <li>I loved that this one was ceramic and ionic for less than others with the same features.</li>
            <li>I am a black guy and it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>its amazing compared to the ones i&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>Works fine, using it to dry up my RCs</li>
            <li>Although my old hair dryer had three heat settings, it only operated at two levels: sort of cool and blistering hot.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific light-weight full size dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, and it doesn&#x27;t frizz my naturally curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>It also dries it a lot faster than my old hair dryer, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot (doesn&#x27;t burn my head).</li>
            <li>Use it on my 3yo daugter&#x27;s hair from time to time and she doesnt complain as much as before with the normal electric coil hair dryer tha</li>
            <li>There is an off/low/high setting, cool/warm/hot setting, and a freeze setting (for an instant of cool air).</li>
            <li>My old one died so this is an exact replacement.</li>
            <li>Only thing I wish it did was fold so that it could fit better into my narrow bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>Looking for a new one!</li>
            <li>The dryer also has high / low settings and a cool shot.</li>
            <li>This was much better than my previous blow-dryer which had a sliding switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this dry bar , the wind is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Previous hair dryers have all lasted more than a year each, so I consider this one to have died quite prematurely.  </li>
            <li>Decent hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It works quickly, efficiently, and it is also very quiet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other features of this dryer that I like is that the cord is a decent length</li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get fiery hot, but hot enough, I suppose.</li>
            <li>It did, and I like it better than my more expensive one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was the main reason I ordered this one.</li>
            <li>Bought this primarily for the color, but it seems to actually make my hair nicer too compared to my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and has multiple settings to assist with styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and seems to be solidly built.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is perfect especially when drying long thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful so it can dry the hair within minutes.</li>
            <li>The heat I don&#x27;t have to put on high and fry my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>a star, because of the power on high mode.</li>
            <li>I use it farther away from my head and in a sweeping motion on high to start with.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The product is lightweight and high powered.</li>
            <li>At the high setting, it feels like it could have used a little more air blowing.  </li>
            <li>The negative ion made my super long hair so smooth and light.</li>
            <li>But overall, a decent dryer and worth the money.</li>
            <li>The attachment falls off easily, but other than that I like this hairblower.</li>
            <li>This works as well as my old conventional dryer, and maybe a bit better.</li>
            <li>-- it wasn&#x27;t anything that I did to the cord, just normal wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for a few months, and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight which I love since I like to use the heat of the dryer and a round brush to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use a blow dryer</li>
            <li>Lightweight, Quiet, Powerful.</li>
            <li>I have been drying my hair everyday since I was able to it myself</li>
            <li>This blowdryer worked pretty well, good heat levels, and strength and dried my hair pretty fast (but not as fast as I expected based on other reviews).</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quick, and I love the shine it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a good product, for me was not useful since  many times cold air comes out even at the hot level.</li>
            <li>That does not seem to be an issue with this dryer, my hair actually looks so much better &amp; feels healthier when I dry it!</li>
            <li>I finally came across this one and decided to buy it because it was a decent price and the reviews were pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading others reviews I am inclined to buy a new dryer and pitch this one.  </li>
            <li>I thought just to be considerate, I&#x27;d buy her a new one.</li>
            <li>I have to buy a new  one.</li>
            <li>This summer I was visiting my parents who live in another state, and I decided instead of packing my blow dryer</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m just going to go buy a new one (NOT Revlon brand.)</li>
            <li>This is especially true when trying to give yourself a blowout (if it bumps into the brush it immediately falls off), but it also falls off with regular (rough dry) use.  </li>
            <li>Also like the adjustable settings.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to dry my hair quickly and without the frizzy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>It actually friezes my hair even more, not what I expected from from an ionic hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lightweight hairdryer that would also dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>old blow dryer&#x27;s high is like my new one&#x27;s low&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its good price but doesnt last long like other dryers</li>
            <li>This is ok if you only want to dry half of your head and if you&#x27;re ok with maybe starting a fire.  </li>
            <li>least it didn&#x27;t start a fire like other reviewers have experienced.</li>
            <li>My hair, though, is not that hard to work with - medium thickness and very fine.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer is pretty standard.</li>
            <li>I bought the second one tells you all you need to know about what I thought of the first one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews although I always read many before buying a product</li>
            <li>I picked this one based on price and reviews, because unless you plan to spend a lot of money, they are pretty similar in function.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Highest heat setting might not be hot enough for some people&#x27;s liking</li>
            <li>I had same one for many about 4 years until recently it started to produce burning smell, I like this one because it has big hook</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m 66 years old!</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to melt crayons</li>
            <li>Definitely a manufacturer&#x27;s hazard to be aware of before ordering.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you need for a basic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>works fine, not super powerfull airflow but price is unexpensive</li>
            <li>The inner box was pretty beat up too, When I opened everything (everything was sealed in plastic), the perfum scent was even stronger - that scent is still there to this day.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new hair dryer to replace my old clunky one.</li>
            <li>Can choose to cool down when temperature is too high.</li>
            <li>Then at less than 6 months the cheap budget cord wore through just below the protective boot.</li>
            <li>The smooth part of the handle (the black part) does not seem to be heat resistant as it should be.  </li>
            <li>Love this dryer for my long hair and the price was a fraction of what i expected to pay.</li>
            <li>It is very light and has hardly has any weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Bought this dryer because my old one died, this design is more lightweight, and the air holes on the side of the attachment mean the dryer doesn&#x27;t overheat as often as the older models did.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I am extremely satisfied and with both purchases and when my second dryer gets burned out in a year and a half, I&#x27;ll purchase another without hesitation.</li>
            <li>Although the high setting does not seem to be as hot as my old dryer, this one seems to dry my hair faster somehow</li>
            <li>Worked great till the other day when blower motor started sounding like a small weed eater/meat grinder cross.</li>
            <li>When I use the cap piece to dry my hair, it leaves the hair a little more burnt feeling than normal and not as smooth (which has not been the case with previous blow dryers).</li>
            <li>I was actually a little skeptical when it came to making this purchase online, but I ordered it and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li>Love it the cord is just a little to short</li>
            <li>More quiet than my other dryer and pretty light weight so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired holding it.</li>
            <li>I liked the way this dryer dried my hair in combination with a large round ceramic brush.</li>
            <li>The wattage is great, and it does a terrific job drying my hair, but it is a little heavy.    </li>
            <li>New out of the box... wouldn&#x27;t even turn on:( very light weight - feels cheap!</li>
            <li>I expected it to be as good as my last Revlon hair dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as the other one.</li>
            <li>Surprised it had so much power for being smaller</li>
            <li>For me who don&#x27;t use a lot of direct heat on my hair</li>
            <li>I know that my old hair dryer was louder and it would blast my hair everywhere.</li>
            <li>Worked really well when I took it outside to thaw frozen pipes.</li>
            <li>Not like my old one which was really loud.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item in April, however my old dryer was still working.</li>
            <li>old dryer just died and I couldn&#x27;t wait for shipping</li>
            <li>I ordered this in a hurry when my old blowdryer started sparking.</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer quit on me</li>
            <li>hope it lasts as long as the first one.</li>
            <li>, my hair dries fast and is quiet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Leaves hair soft and shinny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally dead yet</li>
            <li>This dryer does the obvious very well.</li>
            <li>Have had this a while now, and it works very well, is as advertised, and expect it will last.</li>
            <li>the blow dryer i had was really old, then i went to visit my mother</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old and have tried every product out there for blow drying.</li>
            <li>The cord is pretty long.</li>
            <li>I bought this after my old one broke</li>
            <li>I have an old ConAir that has been working for over 10 years</li>
            <li>So far, no problems.</li>
            <li>My old one was a coil dryer that broke and damaged my hair and made me swear off blow dryers.</li>
            <li>Dries fast &amp; is lightweight compared to my last dryer.  </li>
            <li>at such a reasonable price at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an old worn out hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my 14-year-old daughter who recently had her hair cut and likes to style it straight</li>
            <li>My old coil dryer is in the trash.</li>
            <li>This would be a raving review if this hair dryer hadn&#x27;t completely crapped out in after a month.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this for me for Christmas to replace my old coil dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a month but would highly recommend to my friends!  </li>
            <li>It gets used a frequently, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>just replaced my old one with this model</li>
            <li>My daughter had continued to use my wife&#x27;s old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer really is professional grade.  </li>
            <li>it isnt loud</li>
            <li>my old dryer took closer to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It does its job and unlike old style.</li>
            <li>On both Hi and Lo settings, the dryer remains quiet, which is a real bonus.</li>
            <li>My hair is getting thin and I am trying to handle it gently :)</li>
            <li>I have a Conair Ceramic Ionic Dryer that I love, but it&#x27;s quite heavy and larger than this one.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m pretty easy on my blowdryers - using them 10 minutes every other day or less.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair very fast, and I have very long hair.</li>
            <li>The only negative is the location of the cool shot button, which is right where my index finger normally lands when holding a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Dry the hair very fast.</li>
            <li>This arrived in the original box and a few instructions/tips.  </li>
            <li>like the settings, it gets supper hot, which I really need since my hair is thick, I can fry it fast.</li>
            <li>A few month after I wrote the original review, I discovered that the product picture now is without the diffuser.</li>
            <li>so when I was done only the top layer was slightly damp (personal preference).</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was holding it slightly away from me at the time, so my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer in general works very well and blow drys my hair in a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife to replace an older model that finally died on us,  she loves it,  would buy again.</li>
            <li>I looked back in my Amazon orders to see when I purchased this, and it was exactly this day last year that it was shipped...</li>
            <li>It takes a little more time for me to completely dry my hair because the fan is not as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I narrowed my search down to 2, decided on this after read reviews, it has different heat settings, light weight &amp; quieter.</li>
            <li>Without the nozzle, I still get a pretty quick dry and don&#x27;t have the less desirable side effects, so I generally use it without.</li>
            <li>I have low,  medium,  and high for heating choices.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This hair drier has exeptionally high power for a reasonably low price.</li>
            <li>i was skeptical at first but the first time using i noticed that it&#x27;s light and quiet.  </li>
            <li>Finally, an inexpensive dryer that has a high fan + medium heat setting.  </li>
            <li>was a bit bummed that the dryer was purple and black and not this cute bubblegum pink and black.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you have hair that needs extra special care, you&#x27;ll need to read other reviews to see if this is the dryer for you.</li>
            <li>Its not very heavy.</li>
            <li>however the attachment falls off every single time I use it even though I make sure I put the attachment on firmly.</li>
            <li>my old faithful finally died and this works wonders and fast and so quiet  </li>
            <li>The real test is how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>and I had to use tons of leave in conditioners after, to calm it down.</li>
            <li>The price as very reasonable and the Prime delivery was fast like usual.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to pick a hair dryer on the internet, so I went with what looked the most like the last two I had</li>
            <li>Going to buy a new one from a different brand before it catches fire!!!  </li>
            <li>I have a wavy/curly hair and blow dry it straight</li>
            <li>when i use it ,i find it dry so fast, and feel confortable</li>
            <li>Fast dry and works well.     </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as I think it should.</li>
            <li>if I want to dry it fast, I have to use a dryer.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t blow dry hair fast or efficiently.</li>
            <li>Well it was starting to cut out and the writing was on the wall that it was not going to last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I do feel that I got $16 worth of success out of it, but it is frustrating to be shopping for a hairdryer again so soon.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair really quick</li>
            <li>I thought the dryer was broken at first because it was just blowing cool air until I realized the problem.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that the buttons are very easy to shift without much pressure, so when you&#x27;re holding the handle, it&#x27;s impossible not to flick the top setting around to different temperatures the whole time.</li>
            <li>It works very well but the header is loose so it needs some taping.</li>
            <li>and I use this everyday and so far it has not shown any sign of tear and wear, and the air blown out is comfortable and there are various different settings.</li>
            <li>The first one I owned lasted about two years before the motor sounded very rough</li>
            <li>I love this dryer, it is quieter than any dryer I have had, and I have very thick hair</li>
            <li>It is OK for making your hair dry but it is not powerful enough to make it flat.</li>
            <li>It generally met my expectations.</li>
            <li>If you intend to use the nozzle I&#x27;d suggest buying another dryer, but if you&#x27;re not bothered about it, it&#x27;s generally what you&#x27;d expect for the price.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s too late for me to return this item, and it&#x27;s too cheap for the hassle.  </li>
            <li>TH nozzle is also small enough for me to fit by ion diffuser onto it.</li>
            <li>so it is not cluttered up on my vanity, but I REALLY wanted pink.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets getting it.  </li>
            <li>I had to get used to the different feel and position of the buttons since I was so used to my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I think there is a short in the wiring near the handle.</li>
            <li>I must say the manufacturer really timed their warranty period well to match the expected life of this dryer.</li>
            <li>Give me my old basic hair dryer...</li>
            <li>kinda silicone/rubber really helps from slipping out of hands.  </li>
            <li>should i experience any problems in the near future.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and silky after drying and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry-out my hair like my last one did.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, my hair did not fall out as much as my old hair dryer, hope it last a while.</li>
            <li>I had intended to spend a lot more money on a dryer because I wanted something quiet and efficient and was tired of by old noisy dryer.  </li>
            <li>I rarely ever dried my hair (even before the pain)</li>
            <li>to add: I wrote the above review last night while ordering a new hair dryer in preparation for the Revlon dryer to fully quit working.</li>
            <li>The cool button is in a weird place right</li>
            <li>It is ionic so your hair dries faster but does not have the loud, supersonic blowing power that other high wattage dryers have.</li>
            <li>It was all of these things and more (my hair actually dried faster with less heat).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my thick hair easier to blow dry, and I love the attachment.</li>
            <li>The hot air stopped working a month and a half after I bought it.</li>
            <li>Despite only having 3 reviews I settled on this one mainly because it was the only one in the store with a several heat AND blower settings and was ionic/ceramic.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is decent for the price, and it appears it will last for several years.  </li>
            <li>Second Revlon buy for me...used the old one until the back came off from age and use....</li>
            <li>It also dried my hair twice as fast as my old one.  </li>
            <li>The settings allow you to dry your hair with high heat on a low blow.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t over dry everything around the target area, and you can use high heat on low fan for setting roller styles, too.</li>
            <li>It was what I expected,  I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I bought this product really doubting that it would be (as previous reviews stated) quieter, less hot, and make your hair shinier.  </li>
            <li>This does not appear to be a unique incident as others have complained of the same issue.  </li>
            <li>She has an old dryer for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than my last dryer and seems to be blowing less air, but my hair gets dry just as quick, if not quicker.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked was how ergonomic the handle was, unfortunately that was not enough...  </li>
            <li>After she finished, she raved about how well this dryer dried her hair and how she&#x27;s never had a blow dryer work that quickly on her very long hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is it is louder than I expected, especially after some reviews of it being quiet, I really wanted a quieter one</li>
            <li>Something inside broke within a minute of starting to dry my hair, loud noise, lots of smoke!  </li>
            <li>Unlike most dryers this one has the option to actually switch to cool rather than awkwardly holding  a button down.</li>
            <li>Not just a spark either, I mean full on fire.</li>
            <li>the only thing that i&#x27;m disappointed about is that it does not come with a curl diffuser, so this isn&#x27;t great if you have curls.</li>
            <li>My old dryer used to make my hair dry and frizzy</li>
            <li>I really wanted a finger diffuser too; that it doesn&#x27;t come with one is the ONLY downside to this dryer (not worth taking a star off for).</li>
            <li>No issues so far and hoping that this will last long.</li>
            <li>I will also add a quick video review as I must have looked at at least 20 reviews on hairdryers</li>
            <li>It would take me several rounds to dry my hair due to this problem because the handle would become too hot to hold.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say except that it does what I need it to do, and it&#x27;s not too loud!</li>
            <li>Just be careful if you have long hair, as the &#x27;nose&#x27; is pretty long, and has caught my hair when I bend over to fluff-dry.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft (doesn&#x27;t dry it out!)</li>
            <li>/Hot is just a little too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really Liked it!...</li>

            <li> Loving this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> Now she has her own and doesn&#x27;t have to use her mothers!</li>

            <li> it was just as good as the pricier products.</li>
            <li> Good temperature control.  </li>
            <li> but I thought if I was going to get one, it would be good to try this one since it says it smooths hair as it dries.</li>

            <li> My hair is smoother and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> Great price for such an excellent hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but it does NOT come with the defuser..</li>
            <li> It does not come out nice.  </li>
            <li> one I really like the best.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer but</li>
            <li> liked and recomend</li>
            <li> The one is nice .</li>
            <li> built, did the job nicely.  </li>
            <li> The color is eye catching.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the ceramic kind.</li>
            <li> I must say the color is really nice.</li>
            <li> I was not too thrilled about it being purple, but for the price, I have gotten over it.</li>
            <li> They really are the best budget blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Nice hairdryer.</li>
            <li> and it is also nice looking.  </li>
            <li> Nice product for the money.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having this great product on your site!!</li>
            <li> It is a nice hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The revlon blow dryer has a nice shiny color and works well.</li>
            <li> It is nice, I got it to leave at my daughter&#x27;s house -</li>
            <li> Now she has her own</li>
            <li> Quick and easy is the best in my book and</li>
            <li> sure your outlet supports the higher voltage to get the best power.</li>
            <li> Works great, gets pretty hot and the attachment is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate.</li>
            <li> The best part is my hair is actually soft &amp; shiny after drying it!</li>
            <li> I am proud to be an avid Amazon.com Shopper!</li>
            <li> With a price like this and free shipping (A-prime), it was definitely a good deal.</li>
            <li> Sure she liked it.</li>
            <li> i wanted a good hair dryer but needed it to be light weight.</li>
            <li> It has more than one heat setting which makes it nice for styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and perfect temperature settings.</li>
            <li> So far So GREAT!</li>
            <li> Light weight, dries my hair quickly, good value for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good to change cool wind to warm wind.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good to compare with who use every day.&lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful but heats well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly and has saved me a lot of time in the mornings!</li>
            <li> I use only the cooler setting which is great and the speeds work great.  </li>
            <li> my first purchase is still in great working condition after 3 years.  </li>
            <li> While I was pretty happy with this hair dryer for a while, it died at 7 months in.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant when I purchased this because I&#x27;ve never used Revlon before and the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It has a very comfortable  feel when handling it and</li>
            <li> very light weight.  </li>
            <li> Very light, doesn&#x27;t cause frizziness, etc.  </li>
            <li> It stopped working in a week, very very cheap dryer.</li>
            <li> It dos the job quickly and effectively; what more needs to be said!</li>
            <li> First if you are looking for a dryer that is powerful then this is not the best choice.</li>
            <li> but I am beyond happy with this hair dryer - it does a great job at what it needs to dry!</li>
            <li> its price is okay</li>
            <li> Oh, and purple is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li> wife said it works ok</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> this has been my favorite blow dryer till now</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it has heat settings because I can use a lower heat.</li>
            <li> And now I see this has happened to many others.</li>
            <li> Secondly, having this hair dryer I&#x27;ve been so pleased and impressed by it.</li>
            <li> I love the product and am so glad I purchased it,</li>
            <li> After using the dryer for five days, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, though, so overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer there are so many to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> love how the buttons can be changed while holding it in one hand.</li>
            <li> Many variations of settings.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fantastic choice for the price!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any product, so that might make it work even better.</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s purple, which is a superficial thing to look for</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?  </li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> Thats all I needed though :)</li>
            <li> but I purchased this 12/12/2012 and was pleased with every aspect of its performance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know - should a hair dryer work for more than13 months?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use one more than once a week.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it thank you :)</li>
            <li> I love the color too</li>
            <li> I am more comfortable with the warm setting.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better that way anyways since you don&#x27;t want your hair to be fried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> feels light and cheap but is actually a really good dryer, but the attachment keeps popping off,</li>
            <li> I love the groovy color of the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift which has been enjoyed.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for a hair dryer that would hold up for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidentally hit the off switch.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> I love this one better that</li>

            <li> I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> satisfied with this purchase and for the price can&#x27;t be matched.</li>
            <li> love purple</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the ions work, but it surely keeps my hair in place.</li>
            <li> Manufacturers, you can do better than that.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my hair with a lovely shine.</li>
            <li> which I love &amp;</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I got the Revlon.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $16.95 for it, if it&#x27;s more I would look around.</li>
            <li> but my favorite is the Taiff that I bought in Brasil.</li>
            <li> I have used it many times.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The Ionic heat dries my hair much faster, and my hair is not damaged at all and still in great shape.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love the grip on it with the handle</li>
            <li> Love the click/press buttons/control on this for changing the speed and temperature vs most dryers that have the sliding type button/control.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product for what I paid :)</li>

            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t make me pour sweat</li>
            <li> and it just seems to give me more control over the hair drying process.  </li>
            <li> The best hair dryer for multiple heat and blow options</li>
            <li> I  love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> i wish hair dryers were smaller -- this one seems rather bulky, but it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I do like this dryer because it&#x27;s purple :) It also has many settings, and is Iconic and ceramic, which is better for hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, who used it mostly every day for 11 months.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s much better for straighter</li>
            <li> Love the difference it makes with my hair - fast delivery and great packaging.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- ionic and ceramic so better for hair</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference in outcome between this and my old dryer, but it&#x27;s in an attractive color and easy to use.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) love the color, easy to use and drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li> But I just used it for the first time and I am in love!  </li>
            <li> Finally, every day is a good hair day!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>

            <li> It is easy to style my hair</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The end piece comes off easy.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and works</li>
            <li> but it slides off easily.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to operate onehanded with thumb while holding it.  </li>
            <li> However, the attachment easily falls off the end of the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Hi powered, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer and I love the various heat settings.</li>
            <li> The ionic function is easy on hair and prevents &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; and split ends.</li>
            <li> I also love that it comes with the direction attachment which is great for my short hair.</li>
            <li> the Wind is strong.</li>
            <li> It is not for professionals, cause it is not so strong.</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> If the force of the air is too strong, however, my hair just flies away, instead of shaping around the brush.  </li>
            <li> OK dryer - nothing special</li>
            <li> It is still nice and does not over heat or get too hot and I like the hanging loop</li>
            <li> Love that is has a cool shot setting I purchase a diffuser to protect my hair</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it has a cool, warm and hot setting.</li>

            <li> She uses it on the warm setting and it is hot.  </li>
            <li> Love the cool shot function to hold the look</li>
            <li> Multiple settings make it flexible for use and it is excellent quality especially considering the fair price.  </li>
            <li> Also, the concentrator goes on easily and securely.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> but I pushed the reset button on the plug and it worked just fine afterwards, no problems.</li>
            <li> works fine for the price</li>
            <li> I was drying my hair and it kept shutting off - i tried the heat setting and was fine, then adjusted the speed and that worked fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight(ish) waist length hair.  </li>
            <li> best deal for this price.was looking for a hair dryer for daily use with 3 options (normal,warm and hot) couldn&#x27;t have bargained btter at this price.</li>
            <li> As a hairdryer it works fine</li>

            <li> It is light weigh and strong.</li>
            <li> And, luckily, I was standing in front of the sink, so I was able to toss it into the sink so nothing got burned.  </li>
            <li> It melted them so well and so quickly!</li>
            <li> This dryer is lightweight and dries quickly without creating hair static.</li>
            <li> It has many settings, and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you want a good, light weight hair dryer with optional heat &amp; speed settings, at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Ugh I love this blow dryer but the cap keeps falling off , it&#x27;s get very hot</li>
            <li> Very light and powerful.</li>
            <li> just fine, its light weight</li>
            <li> Not too hot, has more then one heat setting (Hot, warm and cool!)</li>

            <li> My Original Review - Works well, is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> a huge spark comes out.</li>

            <li> 1875 Watt Smoothstay Ceramic...not happy, as a stylist, the cord is too short, it dropped to the floor once, and the insides all fell apart and not useable.  </li>

            <li> - I wanted something more powerful and this did not do it.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> You can buy a comb attachment for it from your beauty supply store for cheap.</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was shopping around and this caught my eye first because of the color (purple is my favorite) -</li>
            <li> I love how lightweight this is and that it heats up fast!</li>
            <li> original review ----&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can clean the lint trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer, I like that the nozel detaches so you can customize how you dry your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly and is smooth and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, drys hair twice as fast as my old dryer.</li>
            <li> First it is light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> For anybody with extremely curly hair this is the best blow dryer, dries fast &amp; no frizz.</li>
            <li> Works well, nothing too special</li>
            <li> And, this did not do anthing special for my hair.</li>
            <li> For many years purchased Conair, then switched to a Revlon Ionic that  I liked and lasted many years but the above item is so superior to the previously  owned Revlon.</li>
            <li> wind is very strong and really smooth~~also very light.&lt;br /&gt;The most useful dyer I have ever~</li>
            <li> Works great, just as expected</li>
            <li> It over heated and didn&#x27;t really have a change in temperature between hot and warm.</li>
            <li> It works great with as minimal damage to my hair as a blow dryer can be.</li>
            <li> She is heavily influenced by looks first, which this has, but she said this is the best hair dryer she ever used.</li>
            <li> This dryer is ok if you have straight hair and need a bit of air</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a month now and have only good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> Good, simple hair dryer.</li>
            <li> With the 3 speeds and 3 heat settings this gives the user 9 combinations, plus, a button to provide a cool blast of air.&lt;br /&gt;Great choice.</li>
            <li> There are 3 heat settings, a cool button and 3 air speeds.  </li>
            <li> I did not find this too be true on my hair</li>
            <li> It has the cool air setting, which is what I like to use.</li>
            <li> I also like the cool air feature as it helps with smoothing hair at the end of styling.  </li>
            <li> It has 2 heat settings, 2 speeds and the cool switch.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels nice and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> so good in fact that my daughter borrowed it, last I saw of it.</li>
            <li> So, the good news is, I can keep fixing the cord until it gets too short.</li>
            <li> It is light but powerful.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a cool setting in addition to the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> Cool purple color too.</li>
            <li> I am surprised how nice this hair dryer is.  </li>
            <li> It has good power, yet can turn on low and cool to finish styling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent.</li>
            <li> I was able to take the unit apart, cut the power cord, strip the new end and re-solder it in place, good as new, however, this isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened.</li>
            <li> In addition to loving purple, the back side of the dryer is rubberized which makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> only downside is the narrow nozzle which will be better suited to fine hair (perfect for me)</li>
            <li> you need a blow dryer that&#x27;s super affordable, does the job, and has all the cool extras, get the Revlon RDVR5029 1875 Watt Smoothstay Ceramic Ionic Dryer.</li>
            <li> I loved it very much.. has all the features in the best price .. cold shot button, ionic and ceramic etc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and have experienced none of the problems other reviewers mentioned.  </li>
            <li> and works quickly.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair perfect and fast .</li>
            <li> Mine is super noisy and smells burn inside.</li>
            <li> Dryes hair quickly...</li>
            <li> It will get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky it was not my face.  </li>
            <li> dries really quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair dries so quickly using it.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> so I figured I should give this product a quick review.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, this seemed like a decent replacement.  </li>
            <li> Hair dries quickly, I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time drying the hair.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn hair.  </li>
            <li> Super lightweight and heats up pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> I guess I am lucky mine</li>
            <li> Light-weight and dries my hair quick.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use temperature setting on hot because it is very hot!  </li>
            <li> While it is not as powerful as others we have used it still dries just as fast as more powerful models.</li>
            <li> The dryer gets very hot, hotter than the Conair.</li>
            <li> No far so good.</li>
            <li> It has good power and is not extremely loud.  </li>
            <li> It does heat up and cool down nicely, but the top keeps falling off and it does not allow for applying pressure and thus, providing a quality blow-out.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dyer.</li>
            <li> Works very well dries hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Fast drying and easy to use.</li>

            <li> Every time I use this, it leaves my hair very soft, shinny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> 2 times a week and with this hair does in less than 15 minutes, very good air flow and heat you need, really exceeded expectations ..</li>
            <li> The hot setting is warm and the strength is far from powerful.</li>
            <li> works great and dry&#x27;s your hair fast.  </li>
            <li> There are many different settings to choose from and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the many options on this dryer: low, medium and high in addition to cool, warm and hot.</li>
            <li> I love the hot, warm and cool, and the high and low settings on this hair dyer.</li>
            <li> I have medium-length, straight fine hair, and to give it any shape at all I need to curl it around a brush while drying.  </li>
            <li> What I really like about this dryer is it leaves her hair looking smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Hotels always have very basic dryers, and the ceramic ionic dryers are amazing at controlling frizz and making styling easier no matter where you travel.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous hair dryer, not too heavy and the low fan speed is perfect.</li>
            <li> this was worth it.  </li>

            <li> Feel the Ceramic lonic make my hair more soft.  </li>
            <li> Works great, I was surprised at how well considering how low cost it is.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and deep.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 12 yr old granddaughter for Christmas, purple is her favorite color.  </li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t laugh</li>
            <li> quick dry easy handling so much better</li>

            <li> All temperatures are luke warm and all speeds are very low.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much better than the old one.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much, we purchased an extra one for the house!  </li>
            <li> the extra settings are nice.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I&#x27;m used to, but does the job.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve mostly used it on Hi/warm or Lo</li>
            <li> I color my own hair, which dries it out a bit, and I have a real problem with fly-away hair right near my forehead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far i use it ok, price right when i bought it.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer gets super hot, but it doesn&#x27;t burn the hair.</li>
            <li> If I hold the cord in the right position, it will run.  </li>
            <li> control right</li>
            <li> so I would not be hanging it by that loop, which is right adjacent to the cord strain relief.</li>
            <li> I think the price is right for this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> After a bath he goes right over to where I plug it in and waits for me.  </li>
            <li> the price was right, it does the job</li>
            <li> my sounded like a truck and the price was right too.</li>
            <li> High medium low, cool warm hot, and a cool button.</li>
            <li> There are setting for heat (hot, warm or cool), and blower settings (high or low), and a cool burst button.  </li>
            <li> I like how light it is and the black part on the handle is made of that smooth, matte finish rubber-like material that I love so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a lighter weight hair dryer that enabled me to have a cool dry, warm, hot, or multiplied choices.</li>
            <li> This is actually pretty loud, I think, but it does its job :)</li>
            <li> Is powerful, has high and low settings, as well as warm and cool settings.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to start putting it into full use, I particularly like the fact that it prevents frizzing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and fast to dry the hair.</li>
            <li> I really liked this dryer, not as much as my previous one, but I liked the different heat options and the cool shot.</li>
            <li> I love the different settings, cool to hot.</li>
            <li> Capable of 9 separate settings and cool or blast button.</li>
            <li> power chord is fairly long as well which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> With hot, warm and cool as well as high and low settings, this dryer gives you all the styling options you need plus plenty of power.</li>
            <li> and I like the hot, warm, and cool settings plus the high and low.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say too much about it other than that she says it&#x27;s a GREAT blow dryer</li>
            <li> Its lightweight and quick. Makes my somewhat curley hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> You can HEAR how much more powerful this one is than my last.</li>
            <li> quick service, works very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than our old one and has better heat settings.</li>
            <li> I am Black with fairly nappy hair and it(with</li>
            <li> GETS THE JOB DONE SUPER FAST</li>
            <li> , I have used it now for a week - and I truly didn&#x27;t expect to notice a dramatic difference in that short of a time - but let me tell you, this is the best thing my hair has seen in many years.  </li>
            <li> It does not blow as strong as the old VS 1875.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought because she liked the first one so much.  </li>
            <li> I was super impressed in the beginning - but recently I noticed it did not turn on right away, after 10+ seconds it started with a loud sound &amp; slow operation.</li>
            <li> The different heat setting and speed settings are amazing for my hair, the cool switch is pretty cool as well.&lt;br /&gt;There are only two problems I have with it:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy and certainly much cheaper than some of the other hairdryers I looked at!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original unit I got, I just assumed wasn&#x27;t serviceable and bought a new one.</li>
            <li> There are three settings--cold, warm, and hot--that can be used with a low or high air speed.</li>
            <li> although hair not always as shiny as it was the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> no weird smells, no overheating.</li>
            <li> Was able to strap it to the well-pipe so it could thaw while I went back inside.</li>
            <li> love the dryer, cord is very short</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at first</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and soft and not frizzy anymore.  </li>
            <li> hot setting is too hot, but medium is just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Hot setting is just that...</li>
            <li> Then it stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted/needed and delivered in two days.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that!</li>
            <li> At first it appeared this was the one.</li>
            <li> Never gets hot---</li>
            <li> Its not real heavy, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer all the same.</li>
            <li> She had purchased the Revlon Smoothstay Ceramic Ionic Dryer recently, and I fell in love with it to the point that I decided to buy one exactly like it.</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery got it within two days!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured and works fantastically.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairdryer!</li>
            <li> This is all if you&#x27;re ok with a possible fire hazard.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> hot art.</li>
            <li> Ceramic doesnt get too hot.  </li>
            <li> So glad i ignored those who said it wasnt hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing a different hair dryer that works better.</li>
            <li> (The first one broke after a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> My first one has lasted years</li>
            <li> Truthfully, this is the only hairdryer that I ever want.  </li>
            <li> Pretty goof power supply works exactly how its suppose to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks, but am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it which was about a month ago.</li>
            <li> With 3 heat settings, I would expect the hot to be hot.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot and blows hair around.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this hair dryer if you are looking to straighten your hair with smooth, shiny results!</li>
            <li> It really does everything it promises!</li>
            <li> The plastic is extremely hot after I using it</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer - does exactly what it says it will do..</li>
            <li> For the first month</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have expensive dryers to compare it to, but it&#x27;s the best dryer under $35</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working after a year.</li>
            <li> It stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, it is so quiet and dries my hair in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> Handle doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer is exactly what I wanted and is affordable.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt get that hot</li>
            <li> not burn my scalp even on hot set.</li>
            <li> Its wind is evenly and not over hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for for a few months and it still works as good as it did in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, the buttons are great, nothing wrong with the cord, love the different speeds and warming levels.</li>
            <li> It is LIGHTER than my old dryer, has a STRONGER blower and though doesn&#x27;t get as hot, drys my hair FASTER!!  </li>
            <li> quiet, quick, and light weight&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works great to get the hair dry daily.</li>
            <li> If you are someone who just wants their hair to look nice and be dry then this is the dryer for you.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this hairdryer, the reviews were mixed, but considering there were more good than bad and the price point was good, I decided to try it out.  </li>
            <li> It is very light weight and dries my hair fast on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by how powerful it is!</li>
            <li> used it for the first time today, it is strong enough and love the different speeds.</li>
            <li> The dryer dries my hair extremely quickly and leaves it extremely shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable holding this while drying my long hair.  </li>
            <li> so some new great dryer technology so after reading a lot of reviews I settled on a much more expensive Babyliss dryer.  </li>
            <li> As good or better than all those expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, and air is consistently hot, but it could be a little bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase, it really cuts down  the frizz when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a light weight hair dryer of standard size ( not compact like in hotels) and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer because it has a strong fan and gets hot enough to work quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn tricks but it does dry my hair and makes it very smooth.</li>
            <li> It dries fast without getting too hot that you can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this hair dryer, but unfortunately it was not that great. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer a long time, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> did some research on other dryers and realized that they had a problem with catching on fire or the handle heats up too fast.</li>
            <li> most of all, it really works well with my round brush and made my hair looks smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly with less static in the hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the heating options with low medium high cool&lt;br /&gt;Warm</li>
            <li> Nice color and makes less noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice rubber coating over the black plastic as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted one that was smaller easy to handle with one hand&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This dries my hair quickly and it feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is light and pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> Not too big so it is easy to store.</li>
            <li> It blows strongly and has lots of different settings.</li>
            <li> a certain way in order to use it.  </li>
            <li> I love the multiple settings especially the cool heat option.</li>
            <li> My dried hair is shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great dryer - one odd thing - when the package arrived, there was a perfumy scent, not only on the outer box, but the box the dryer came in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it dried my hair more quickly</li>
            <li> I want to dry my hair quickly, but high heat just doesn&#x27;t work for my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Hope it last a long time, if not will only purchase this model again, and if it&#x27;s not available, I&#x27;m sure whatever Revlon makes will be fine and do a great job.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for someone with short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Worked fine up until one morning when it starting smoking and flamed up.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and damaged, but has looked and felt noticeable better (smoother, softer, straighter) since getting this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that such a great dryer cost me so little</li>
            <li> Just very nice.love it..</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, light weight.</li>
            <li> Given I would not spend much on a hair styling electronic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very quite.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> When your hand is damp, or you have some lotion on, it is very slippery.</li>
            <li> The heat is very controlled in my opinion, even in the hottest setting, and my hair does not feel as though it is being fried.</li>
            <li> The price on this dryer is so reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> As in, real fire.  </li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well for her.</li>
            <li> Starting with damp hair, I could see that it was staying smooth as it was drying.</li>
            <li> I bought two types of dryers, and I like the one with the jet stream flow, not this one as much.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair so fast</li>
            <li> Cheap, quiet, lightweight, and ionic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really dries hair fast.</li>
            <li> I dont use the heat that much</li>
            <li> but it does work and really heats up your hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price I paid</li>
            <li> and she thought it work very well,</li>
            <li> the help of a straightening attachment} gets my hair straight while leaving in body</li>
            <li> It is really lightweight and it doesnt make much noise.</li>
            <li> Some of them heat up so much it burns you.</li>
            <li> This heats gently and the funnel controls the volume of air you want.</li>
            <li> It really bother me but can&#x27;t do anything now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still flabbergasted it worked so fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It functioned very well.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> That way if I need a drier, which happens occasionally, I still have one available when my wife goes out of town.</li>
            <li> Thanks - Satish K B</li>
            <li> My 9 year old wanted purple, so that&#x27;s a bonus, but the dryer is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It dries hair very well.  </li>
            <li> Hair comes out much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have much hair, but its not what I got it for.  </li>
            <li> Next, my hair has never been so frizz free.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> She says it dries her hair really fast</li>
            <li> shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this hairdryer would have all the qualities I needed - 3 heat settings and 2 blow levels, plus ionic, ceramic, quiet and light.  </li>
            <li> So I wanted to go much cheaper with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and would recommend this.</li>
            <li> dries fast, attachments stay on well, and i have TONS of hair.</li>
            <li> Some cons are that I notice my hair is very staticy after use, and the blow isn&#x27;t very forceful.</li>
            <li> The selling price was too cheap to have to pay for shipping back and forth for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Works very well and dryer fast.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast, but doesn&#x27;t damage it.  </li>
            <li> It came with the diffuser and arrived so much sooner.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is also much quieter and dries my hair faster.</li>
            <li> and it dries fast and smoothes my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how that works, but it really does.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t real noisy</li>
            <li> I dont seem to know much about these because I&#x27;ve never had one</li>
            <li> Not as much power as I would like but</li>
            <li> its lightweight too.. dries hairs fast..</li>
            <li> I have really crappy hair.  </li>
            <li> the price on Amazon was reasonable.</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how much it did to de-frizz her hair when she used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful (fast drying) as my old Vidal Sassoon dryer</li>
            <li> The variety allows me to easily use the dryer on my 4 year old&#x27;s hair when necessary without her complaining the air is too hot.  </li>
            <li> If you are maintaining long hair, good luck with the time it takes to dry it with this one, but if you are maintaining a style and you like the salon feel, then this one is your choice item.</li>
            <li> My wife is delighted with this hair, she has long hair, and dry and brush</li>
            <li> was looking forward to trying this new hot Ionic Dryer.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle, long cord.</li>
            <li> Despite the high speed seeming more like medium this dryer has a high heat setting that will dry your hair fast.  </li>
            <li> It also gives me a lot of volume, which I haven&#x27;t been able to get from other dryers.  </li>
            <li> Mine started making some clicking noises like the fan is sliding through some objects constantly during use and its wind speed is significantly lower than before.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its ok.</li>
            <li> but this defeinitely gets the job done better than any other druer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Compared to all other hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned this one lasted the longest and endured the most use.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this Revlon model because of the positive reviews, the light weight (because I have arthritis in my hands), and the desire to stop burning my scalp and fingers when I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the most powerful and yet small hand dryers that I&#x27;ve had - and I had a couple of the years ...&lt;</li>
            <li> It takes a while for it to cool down using the cool switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from all the nifty features I&#x27;ve listed above, the most important thing to me was how fast it dried my hair.</li>
            <li> The dryer is light weight and easy to handle when you are running late for work.  </li>
            <li> I loved that this one was ceramic and ionic for less than others with the same features.</li>
            <li> I am a black guy and it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> its amazing compared to the ones i&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Works fine, using it to dry up my RCs</li>
            <li> Although my old hair dryer had three heat settings, it only operated at two levels: sort of cool and blistering hot.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific light-weight full size dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, and it doesn&#x27;t frizz my naturally curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It also dries it a lot faster than my old hair dryer, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot (doesn&#x27;t burn my head).</li>
            <li> Use it on my 3yo daugter&#x27;s hair from time to time and she doesnt complain as much as before with the normal electric coil hair dryer tha</li>
            <li> There is an off/low/high setting, cool/warm/hot setting, and a freeze setting (for an instant of cool air).</li>
            <li> My old one died so this is an exact replacement.</li>
            <li> Only thing I wish it did was fold so that it could fit better into my narrow bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> Looking for a new one!</li>
            <li> The dryer also has high / low settings and a cool shot.</li>
            <li> This was much better than my previous blow-dryer which had a sliding switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this dry bar , the wind is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Previous hair dryers have all lasted more than a year each, so I consider this one to have died quite prematurely.  </li>
            <li> Decent hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It works quickly, efficiently, and it is also very quiet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other features of this dryer that I like is that the cord is a decent length</li>
            <li> Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get fiery hot, but hot enough, I suppose.</li>
            <li> It did, and I like it better than my more expensive one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was the main reason I ordered this one.</li>
            <li> Bought this primarily for the color, but it seems to actually make my hair nicer too compared to my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and has multiple settings to assist with styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and seems to be solidly built.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is perfect especially when drying long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful so it can dry the hair within minutes.</li>
            <li> The heat I don&#x27;t have to put on high and fry my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> a star, because of the power on high mode.</li>
            <li> I use it farther away from my head and in a sweeping motion on high to start with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The product is lightweight and high powered.</li>
            <li> At the high setting, it feels like it could have used a little more air blowing.  </li>
            <li> The negative ion made my super long hair so smooth and light.</li>
            <li> But overall, a decent dryer and worth the money.</li>
            <li> The attachment falls off easily, but other than that I like this hairblower.</li>
            <li> This works as well as my old conventional dryer, and maybe a bit better.</li>
            <li> -- it wasn&#x27;t anything that I did to the cord, just normal wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for a few months, and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight which I love since I like to use the heat of the dryer and a round brush to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a blow dryer</li>
            <li> Lightweight, Quiet, Powerful.</li>
            <li> I have been drying my hair everyday since I was able to it myself</li>
            <li> This blowdryer worked pretty well, good heat levels, and strength and dried my hair pretty fast (but not as fast as I expected based on other reviews).</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quick, and I love the shine it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a good product, for me was not useful since  many times cold air comes out even at the hot level.</li>
            <li> That does not seem to be an issue with this dryer, my hair actually looks so much better &amp; feels healthier when I dry it!</li>
            <li> I finally came across this one and decided to buy it because it was a decent price and the reviews were pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading others reviews I am inclined to buy a new dryer and pitch this one.  </li>
            <li> I thought just to be considerate, I&#x27;d buy her a new one.</li>
            <li> I have to buy a new  one.</li>
            <li> This summer I was visiting my parents who live in another state, and I decided instead of packing my blow dryer</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just going to go buy a new one (NOT Revlon brand.)</li>
            <li> This is especially true when trying to give yourself a blowout (if it bumps into the brush it immediately falls off), but it also falls off with regular (rough dry) use.  </li>
            <li> Also like the adjustable settings.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to dry my hair quickly and without the frizzy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> It actually friezes my hair even more, not what I expected from from an ionic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight hairdryer that would also dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> old blow dryer&#x27;s high is like my new one&#x27;s low&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its good price but doesnt last long like other dryers</li>
            <li> This is ok if you only want to dry half of your head and if you&#x27;re ok with maybe starting a fire.  </li>
            <li> least it didn&#x27;t start a fire like other reviewers have experienced.</li>
            <li> My hair, though, is not that hard to work with - medium thickness and very fine.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer is pretty standard.</li>
            <li> I bought the second one tells you all you need to know about what I thought of the first one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews although I always read many before buying a product</li>
            <li> I picked this one based on price and reviews, because unless you plan to spend a lot of money, they are pretty similar in function.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Highest heat setting might not be hot enough for some people&#x27;s liking</li>
            <li> I had same one for many about 4 years until recently it started to produce burning smell, I like this one because it has big hook</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m 66 years old!</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough to melt crayons</li>
            <li> Definitely a manufacturer&#x27;s hazard to be aware of before ordering.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you need for a basic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> works fine, not super powerfull airflow but price is unexpensive</li>
            <li> The inner box was pretty beat up too, When I opened everything (everything was sealed in plastic), the perfum scent was even stronger - that scent is still there to this day.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new hair dryer to replace my old clunky one.</li>
            <li> Can choose to cool down when temperature is too high.</li>
            <li> Then at less than 6 months the cheap budget cord wore through just below the protective boot.</li>
            <li> The smooth part of the handle (the black part) does not seem to be heat resistant as it should be.  </li>
            <li> Love this dryer for my long hair and the price was a fraction of what i expected to pay.</li>
            <li> It is very light and has hardly has any weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this dryer because my old one died, this design is more lightweight, and the air holes on the side of the attachment mean the dryer doesn&#x27;t overheat as often as the older models did.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I am extremely satisfied and with both purchases and when my second dryer gets burned out in a year and a half, I&#x27;ll purchase another without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Although the high setting does not seem to be as hot as my old dryer, this one seems to dry my hair faster somehow</li>
            <li> Worked great till the other day when blower motor started sounding like a small weed eater/meat grinder cross.</li>
            <li> When I use the cap piece to dry my hair, it leaves the hair a little more burnt feeling than normal and not as smooth (which has not been the case with previous blow dryers).</li>
            <li> I was actually a little skeptical when it came to making this purchase online, but I ordered it and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li> Love it the cord is just a little to short</li>
            <li> More quiet than my other dryer and pretty light weight so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired holding it.</li>
            <li> I liked the way this dryer dried my hair in combination with a large round ceramic brush.</li>
            <li> The wattage is great, and it does a terrific job drying my hair, but it is a little heavy.    </li>
            <li> New out of the box... wouldn&#x27;t even turn on:( very light weight - feels cheap!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be as good as my last Revlon hair dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as the other one.</li>
            <li> Surprised it had so much power for being smaller</li>
            <li> For me who don&#x27;t use a lot of direct heat on my hair</li>
            <li> I know that my old hair dryer was louder and it would blast my hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> Worked really well when I took it outside to thaw frozen pipes.</li>
            <li> Not like my old one which was really loud.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item in April, however my old dryer was still working.</li>
            <li> old dryer just died and I couldn&#x27;t wait for shipping</li>
            <li> I ordered this in a hurry when my old blowdryer started sparking.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer quit on me</li>
            <li> hope it lasts as long as the first one.</li>
            <li> , my hair dries fast and is quiet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Leaves hair soft and shinny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not totally dead yet</li>
            <li> This dryer does the obvious very well.</li>
            <li> Have had this a while now, and it works very well, is as advertised, and expect it will last.</li>
            <li> the blow dryer i had was really old, then i went to visit my mother</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and have tried every product out there for blow drying.</li>
            <li> The cord is pretty long.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my old one broke</li>
            <li> I have an old ConAir that has been working for over 10 years</li>
            <li> So far, no problems.</li>
            <li> My old one was a coil dryer that broke and damaged my hair and made me swear off blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Dries fast &amp; is lightweight compared to my last dryer.  </li>
            <li> at such a reasonable price at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old worn out hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my 14-year-old daughter who recently had her hair cut and likes to style it straight</li>
            <li> My old coil dryer is in the trash.</li>
            <li> This would be a raving review if this hair dryer hadn&#x27;t completely crapped out in after a month.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas to replace my old coil dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a month but would highly recommend to my friends!  </li>
            <li> It gets used a frequently, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> just replaced my old one with this model</li>
            <li> My daughter had continued to use my wife&#x27;s old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer really is professional grade.  </li>
            <li> it isnt loud</li>
            <li> my old dryer took closer to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It does its job and unlike old style.</li>
            <li> On both Hi and Lo settings, the dryer remains quiet, which is a real bonus.</li>
            <li> My hair is getting thin and I am trying to handle it gently :)</li>
            <li> I have a Conair Ceramic Ionic Dryer that I love, but it&#x27;s quite heavy and larger than this one.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m pretty easy on my blowdryers - using them 10 minutes every other day or less.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair very fast, and I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the location of the cool shot button, which is right where my index finger normally lands when holding a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Dry the hair very fast.</li>
            <li> This arrived in the original box and a few instructions/tips.  </li>
            <li> like the settings, it gets supper hot, which I really need since my hair is thick, I can fry it fast.</li>
            <li> A few month after I wrote the original review, I discovered that the product picture now is without the diffuser.</li>
            <li> so when I was done only the top layer was slightly damp (personal preference).</li>
            <li> Luckily, I was holding it slightly away from me at the time, so my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer in general works very well and blow drys my hair in a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to replace an older model that finally died on us,  she loves it,  would buy again.</li>
            <li> I looked back in my Amazon orders to see when I purchased this, and it was exactly this day last year that it was shipped...</li>
            <li> It takes a little more time for me to completely dry my hair because the fan is not as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I narrowed my search down to 2, decided on this after read reviews, it has different heat settings, light weight &amp; quieter.</li>
            <li> Without the nozzle, I still get a pretty quick dry and don&#x27;t have the less desirable side effects, so I generally use it without.</li>
            <li> I have low,  medium,  and high for heating choices.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This hair drier has exeptionally high power for a reasonably low price.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical at first but the first time using i noticed that it&#x27;s light and quiet.  </li>
            <li> Finally, an inexpensive dryer that has a high fan + medium heat setting.  </li>
            <li> was a bit bummed that the dryer was purple and black and not this cute bubblegum pink and black.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have hair that needs extra special care, you&#x27;ll need to read other reviews to see if this is the dryer for you.</li>
            <li> Its not very heavy.</li>
            <li> however the attachment falls off every single time I use it even though I make sure I put the attachment on firmly.</li>
            <li> my old faithful finally died and this works wonders and fast and so quiet  </li>
            <li> The real test is how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> and I had to use tons of leave in conditioners after, to calm it down.</li>
            <li> The price as very reasonable and the Prime delivery was fast like usual.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to pick a hair dryer on the internet, so I went with what looked the most like the last two I had</li>
            <li> Going to buy a new one from a different brand before it catches fire!!!  </li>
            <li> I have a wavy/curly hair and blow dry it straight</li>
            <li> when i use it ,i find it dry so fast, and feel confortable</li>
            <li> Fast dry and works well.     </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as I think it should.</li>
            <li> if I want to dry it fast, I have to use a dryer.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t blow dry hair fast or efficiently.</li>
            <li> Well it was starting to cut out and the writing was on the wall that it was not going to last much longer.  </li>
            <li> I do feel that I got $16 worth of success out of it, but it is frustrating to be shopping for a hairdryer again so soon.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair really quick</li>
            <li> I thought the dryer was broken at first because it was just blowing cool air until I realized the problem.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the buttons are very easy to shift without much pressure, so when you&#x27;re holding the handle, it&#x27;s impossible not to flick the top setting around to different temperatures the whole time.</li>
            <li> It works very well but the header is loose so it needs some taping.</li>
            <li> and I use this everyday and so far it has not shown any sign of tear and wear, and the air blown out is comfortable and there are various different settings.</li>
            <li> The first one I owned lasted about two years before the motor sounded very rough</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, it is quieter than any dryer I have had, and I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> It is OK for making your hair dry but it is not powerful enough to make it flat.</li>
            <li> It generally met my expectations.</li>
            <li> If you intend to use the nozzle I&#x27;d suggest buying another dryer, but if you&#x27;re not bothered about it, it&#x27;s generally what you&#x27;d expect for the price.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s too late for me to return this item, and it&#x27;s too cheap for the hassle.  </li>
            <li> TH nozzle is also small enough for me to fit by ion diffuser onto it.</li>
            <li> so it is not cluttered up on my vanity, but I REALLY wanted pink.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets getting it.  </li>
            <li> I had to get used to the different feel and position of the buttons since I was so used to my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I think there is a short in the wiring near the handle.</li>
            <li> I must say the manufacturer really timed their warranty period well to match the expected life of this dryer.</li>
            <li> Give me my old basic hair dryer...</li>
            <li> kinda silicone/rubber really helps from slipping out of hands.  </li>
            <li> should i experience any problems in the near future.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and silky after drying and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry-out my hair like my last one did.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, my hair did not fall out as much as my old hair dryer, hope it last a while.</li>
            <li> I had intended to spend a lot more money on a dryer because I wanted something quiet and efficient and was tired of by old noisy dryer.  </li>
            <li> I rarely ever dried my hair (even before the pain)</li>
            <li> to add: I wrote the above review last night while ordering a new hair dryer in preparation for the Revlon dryer to fully quit working.</li>
            <li> The cool button is in a weird place right</li>
            <li> It is ionic so your hair dries faster but does not have the loud, supersonic blowing power that other high wattage dryers have.</li>
            <li> It was all of these things and more (my hair actually dried faster with less heat).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my thick hair easier to blow dry, and I love the attachment.</li>
            <li> The hot air stopped working a month and a half after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Despite only having 3 reviews I settled on this one mainly because it was the only one in the store with a several heat AND blower settings and was ionic/ceramic.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is decent for the price, and it appears it will last for several years.  </li>
            <li> Second Revlon buy for me...used the old one until the back came off from age and use....</li>
            <li> It also dried my hair twice as fast as my old one.  </li>
            <li> The settings allow you to dry your hair with high heat on a low blow.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t over dry everything around the target area, and you can use high heat on low fan for setting roller styles, too.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected,  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this product really doubting that it would be (as previous reviews stated) quieter, less hot, and make your hair shinier.  </li>
            <li> This does not appear to be a unique incident as others have complained of the same issue.  </li>
            <li> She has an old dryer for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my last dryer and seems to be blowing less air, but my hair gets dry just as quick, if not quicker.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked was how ergonomic the handle was, unfortunately that was not enough...  </li>
            <li> After she finished, she raved about how well this dryer dried her hair and how she&#x27;s never had a blow dryer work that quickly on her very long hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it is louder than I expected, especially after some reviews of it being quiet, I really wanted a quieter one</li>
            <li> Something inside broke within a minute of starting to dry my hair, loud noise, lots of smoke!  </li>
            <li> Unlike most dryers this one has the option to actually switch to cool rather than awkwardly holding  a button down.</li>
            <li> Not just a spark either, I mean full on fire.</li>
            <li> the only thing that i&#x27;m disappointed about is that it does not come with a curl diffuser, so this isn&#x27;t great if you have curls.</li>
            <li> My old dryer used to make my hair dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> I really wanted a finger diffuser too; that it doesn&#x27;t come with one is the ONLY downside to this dryer (not worth taking a star off for).</li>
            <li> No issues so far and hoping that this will last long.</li>
            <li> I will also add a quick video review as I must have looked at at least 20 reviews on hairdryers</li>
            <li> It would take me several rounds to dry my hair due to this problem because the handle would become too hot to hold.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say except that it does what I need it to do, and it&#x27;s not too loud!</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have long hair, as the &#x27;nose&#x27; is pretty long, and has caught my hair when I bend over to fluff-dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft (doesn&#x27;t dry it out!)</li>
            <li> /Hot is just a little too much.</li>
            <li> I had a old dryer of my moms that I was using and it was taking too long to dry.</li>
            <li> I have long hair so it can take a while for my hair to dry natural, so</li>
            <li> This is actually only the 2nd blow dryer I have owned, and this revlon completely blew my other out of the water (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> This hair dryer gets my thick mane dry in a quick manner.  </li>
            <li> It is not as loud as other hair dryers I have owned.</li>
            <li> so I actually have time to flat iron after.</li>
            <li> Usually, if you want high heat, other dryers blow on high also.</li>
            <li> This is a nice feature for those like me who have a lot of thick hair and wind up holding the blow dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other hand to dry the hair section by section.</li>
            <li> Just think the title and pic should be updated to maroon not pink because I actually wanted pink to match my flat iron.</li>
            <li> previous one from same brand hasn&#x27;t spoilt &amp; it&#x27;s 15 years old.</li>
            <li> Since I usually have lotion or hair product on my palms when getting ready to blowdry my hair.  </li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well :/</li>
            <li> Apparently not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same hair dryer for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the low blow setting is not low enough, and the high heat setting not quite high enough.  </li>
            <li> The old coil dryer left my hair a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two sets of clickable buttons on the handle to include speed settings high, low, and off; temperature settings hot, warm, and cold; and then a cold shot button by itself.</li>
            <li> dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 50 - so I have been drying my hair for a very, very long time - and I&#x27;ll never go back to a non-ceramic hair dryer again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re handy, it doesn&#x27;t seem like such a bad buy.</li>
            <li> It is less than a year old and the cord connecting it to the power plug is malfunctioning.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, my order actually arrived much earlier than what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer a few days ago and all I can say is what a big difference from my old one.</li>
            <li> Usually theses things fail quickly after heavy use, but this one still is going strong.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use a large round brush in the other hand while drying yet.</li>
            <li> The handle heats up as the dryer heats up and will actually burn your hand depending on how long you have to dry your hair for.  </li>
            <li> Im Mexican with hair down to my mid back.</li>
            <li> If i don&#x27;t hold the dryer perfectly straight it loses power and shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> This stopped working completely after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be drying for a long time.</li>
            <li> it always seems to take too long.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say on this hairdryer that hasn&#x27;t already been said and I have only just taken it out of the box!</li>
            <li> The copper becomes exposed, which is an obvious issue in a bathroom where there are wet hands all the time.</li>
            <li> has a variety of settings and leaves hair dried but not dried out.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a replacement for my previous Revlon dryer which lasted for several years with daily use.</li>
            <li> it would take too long to dry if you use this.</li>
            <li> I have owned this hair dryer for a little over a year, it takes forever to dry my long thick hair and it gets really hot while you are drying your hair and now its shorting out!</li>
            <li> I used to hate drying my hair, but this goes fast on my fine, medium length hair.</li>
            <li> it is lighter compared to other hair dryers and a bit quieter, but does not offer any extra shine.</li>
            <li> The attachment heats up significantly, too, and then it&#x27;s difficult to reattach.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t come back on (yes I tried troubleshooting and other outlets)</li>
            <li> It started to spark, smoke, and smell in May 2015 and due to obvious reasons I threw away.</li>
            <li> so that shows how long it lasted!</li>
            <li> It has been probably 10 years since I bought my last hairdryer, so I was due.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caught on fire yet like several other reviewers mentioned, but I am throwing it away before it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hot enough.</li>
            <li> With some other reviewers saying theirs caught on fire, I noticed my cord is also damaged in the same spot.  </li>
            <li> Used almost daily and a little after a year&#x27;s use, the wires got a short</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very thick but not thin so in the middle and</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this cuts my drying time in half!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any of my friends that have very long hair as I do.</li>
            <li> Just very strange...</li>
            <li> It was taking her 20 mins to dry, so I bought her this one because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t overheat at all given the length of time it takes to dry our hair and the varying settings</li>
            <li> I timed it this morning and it took about 3 minutes to almost totally dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought it to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I can dry my curly hair in 15 minutes</li>
            <li> However you could keep it on one spot to dry without it burning your scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair has always taken 45min minimum to blow dry.</li>
            <li> Blow dry attachment&lt;</li>
            <li> It gets my hair dry.</li>
            <li> bought this to dry our pomeranians after giving em baths.</li>
            <li> Suits my need to dry hair in summer and winter</li>
            <li> It makes my hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> My hair is still crappy---but now it has blow dry body.  </li>
            <li> But it is now 12-13-2015 a few months later and it started squeeling like the last one.</li>
            <li> This does not pack the air flow punch you expect from a high power dryer, but it does work well for straightening hair, and slow drying.</li>
            <li> just wish it came in different color like Black or Grey, something not so girly like the Purple</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it, especially since it appears this is a pattern with this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty frustrating that it couldn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> The dryer goes on and off because of the cord (loose connection?).  </li>
            <li> The cord came loose from the bottom of the hairdryer and now it doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time of my old hairdryer, with seemingly less heat.</li>
            <li> It takes me at least twice as long to dry my hair as the old dryer.  </li>
            <li> so I am going to guess that it should dry your hair and then some!</li>
            <li> Monday of this week I began to dry my hair and the dryer blew up!  </li>
            <li> Now I look forward to blowing my hair dry!</li>
            <li> I did my hair is dry in a wiz!</li>
            <li> Easy to manage and use the cold shot.</li>
            <li> and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes (short hair).  </li>
            <li> Disappointing to say the least, just glad that nothing else was damaged!</li>
            <li> Only lasted a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> But I think it is a little too big.</li>
            <li> Seems a little cheaper made than the last one I bought from Revlon.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had the thing a little over a month.</li>
            <li> It is soo light weight its crazy.  </li>
            <li> not sure how long hair dryers should last</li>
            <li> I will go back to buying Conair, at least they last longer.</li>
            <li> So I made a mental note, and then ordered one for her as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> I would return it for another one, however the return window is closed.</li>
            <li> But I had already spent the money on it, so I had to go with something cheaper this time.  </li>
            <li> Everything about it was as expected.</li>
            <li> I wasted $20, and only got 6 months out of it.</li>
            <li> not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair, but it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Three days after our &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34; closed.</li>
            <li> A few weeks prior, it started making rattling noises, getting louder and louder, then softer and softer as the motor seemed to be dying.  </li>
            <li> Really no complaints, until it started sparking.</li>
            <li> It only lasted a few months</li>
            <li> quieter than expected.</li>
            <li> Hot&#x27; air wasn&#x27;t hot and my diffuser kept sliding off, which was extremely annoying.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer was hot and dried my hair in no more than 10 minutes, when it usually takes a lot longer for my hair to dry with other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> but it is certainly not for professionals.</li>
            <li> The significant other had a 15 year old hair dryer take a crap.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it takes a little longer to dry vs my old Vidal dryer.</li>
            <li> cord is VERY long and doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle like my previous hairdryer would.</li>
            <li> It takes so much less time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- 2 button settings for hot or cold and low and high&lt;</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the nozzle attachment to direct the air flow does not fit snuggly and tends to fall off if you bump it when using (i.e., accidentally hit it on your round brush).  </li>
            <li> The dryer arrived quickly however I was disappointed that it is NOT pink.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to blow as hard as my old one....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about hairdryers other than all the comments people post.</li>
            <li> This is the first time Prime has failed me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I spent.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d like this one replaced since I&#x27;m not the only one to have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, but I asked my hairdresser and she  educated me on &amp;#34;ion&amp;#34; drying.</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the other reviews...</li>
            <li> LIke other users, mine also caught on fire.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon due to their return policy.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> One thing I saw in other comments was it drys your hair 2 times faster than non ceramic dryers.</li>
            <li> I paid attention to what the other reviewers said about the electrical issues</li>
            <li> The blow dryer motor gets extremely hot making it difficult to hold the body of the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> does the job faster than the other dryers she&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li> This one did not disappoint, and it&#x27;s extremely lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say that I am crazy about this dryer, as it has a tendency to switch down to cool during use, due to the placement of the temp.</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking at all the great reviews, but I&#x27;m sad to say that this went bad within a year.</li>
            <li> This thing dried my hair from dripping wet to completely dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and gets my hair dry in about 3 minutes, which is approximately 15 minutes less than my old one.</li>
            <li> With this, my hair was dry in less than 10 minutes, usually it would take 10 to 15 minutes to dry my hair with a dryer.</li>
            <li> Less noisy than the other unit I have.</li>
            <li> its just because its too big in size.. hard to fix it in your dressing drawers..</li>
            <li> My only complaint was in the shipping.</li>
            <li> Not worth the the money.</li>
            <li> but it is not worth the danger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the weight of an average hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably not worth the shipping costs anyway.</li>
            <li> This was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> That stupid thing was way too hot and so loud that my dog and my baby would start to fret every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> For the price I paid, it just does not worth my time to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to adjust my grip in order to avoid holding the button down.  </li>
            <li> This item has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting that doesn&#x27;t require holding down a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button.  </li>
            <li> I do not like that the controls are where you put your hand and go all the way down the handle.</li>
            <li> but this one does not break down or burn anyone.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, says it dries faster but is less harsh then other dryers.</li>
            <li> It lasted less than a year</li>
            <li> had it for less than a year.  </li>
            <li> I had a hair dryer from Walmart for less than 3 months and it blew up.</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted for years</li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer lasted about 4 years.</li>
            <li> Worked less than a year.  </li>
            <li> It is useless for me, and I will go back to using my former hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The price is almost half I can get from Target.</li>
            <li> The buttons felt awkward at first, but now I like that a can click through the settings without having to stop to see what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hot and shot of cold</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I have really thick long hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, and it&#x27;s really long..</li>
            <li> it dries my long thick hair in about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> By the end of the process, my long, thick hair did feel a little unruly</li>
            <li> My other hair dryer finally gave out (started blowing only cold air)...</li>
            <li> Soaking wet and it still dried my long, thick hair in half the time!!</li>
            <li> If I cut it short its all poofy and weird, plus I like it long.</li>
            <li> If you hold it at JUST the correct angle, it stays on, turn it a little</li>
            <li> Just wish my arms were a little longer when I have the drying tip on</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> I would rather have my hair dry faster, and a little fluffier than dried slow and sheek.</li>
            <li> The con is that if feels a little heavy after a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> the cold shop really works for me to set my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was overall a frustrating experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I expected to get at least a year out of it.  </li>
            <li> So far unable to find any Revlon attachment, which makes no since to me.  </li>
            <li> May have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have had this one now for a few months</li>
            <li> Do not buy or this will happen to you in a few months too.</li>
            <li> and I do not use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> 2 kids also use everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this dryer.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair in under 15 min</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal when you consider the price and convenient size + included concentrator attachment.</li>
            <li> The hard, sharp plastic inner edge eventually cut through the poor quality cord with a spark and puff of smoke, tripping the GFCI breaker.</li>
            <li> and I had a long and frustrating look for another one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, so I don&#x27;t have a ton to dry.</li>
            <li> This one is not damaging like the other, so no frizzies, and less broken strands of hair.</li>
            <li> I usually just throw it in a ponytail and go on with my day.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give off enough heat and unfortunately the 30 day return policy has passed so</li>
            <li> The blow dryer is small.</li>
            <li> Not burst into flames ignition but visible small flame that extinguished and smoked.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review in the past, but I depend on them when making purchases</li>
            <li> I usually stick with a brand name until I&#x27;ve had a disappointment,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> Not sure how the ceramic/ionic technology  works however my hair is softer.</li>
            <li> Cord starts on fire after a few months!</li>
            <li> Obviously, I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> My old dryers have had a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting, but cold air doesn&#x27;t do it either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced that with other dryers.  </li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this blowdryer after reading the reviews but was very unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write the word &amp;#34;BEWARE&amp;#34; in a review... but seriously, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> This was for a teenager who is usually hard to please, but not this time.</li>
            <li> I am not overly hard on the blow dryer</li>
            <li> It makes the dryer hard to hold without switching the settings accidentally.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old dryer was until I got this one.  </li>
            <li> It even has a cold shot and several heat temps.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s way too late to return, but I wish I&#x27;d seen those reviews before buying this.</li>
            <li> you end up pressing the buttons (especially the cold air button) as you are trying to hold the dryer.</li>
            <li> I plan to write a formal complaint.  </li>
            <li> Then suddenly it started cutting in and out for about 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I have cold shot that actually works.</li>
            <li> Only used few months and it became bad connection, on and off on and off.</li>
            <li> And probably at least one blow dryer a year since I was 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is at least a 2 - 3  minute difference in drying time and this was</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer complained, I too ordered it because of the diffuser.</li>
            <li> this is a bit clumsy for me but it works well.  </li>
            <li> I can only get cold air.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to return it to amazon, but I have the warranty information.  </li>
            <li> But god forbid I had been holding it close to my hair, or had been forced to toss it onto carpeting or another flammable surface.</li>
            <li> She has really thick hair and this hair dryer</li>
            <li> Not very happy.</li>
            <li> Another minor issue is the location of the cold shot button.  </li>
            <li> I hate buying a new hair dryer, but after reading the reviews, I decided on this.  </li>
            <li> but then the reviews made me think seriously about</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything in my hair, it&#x27;s like dry it with cold breeze.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is the switches.</li>
            <li> only bad thing is the cap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated because another model I bought only lasted 6 months and then this one lasted 10.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> not a good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> major annoying downside is that the concentrator nozzle falls off every time I use it.</li>
            <li> was so disappointed w the results that I am back w a Revlon.</li>
            <li> I had given this dryer 4 stars, but now am forced to downgrade my review since the dryer burst into FLAMES!</li>
            <li> I also have scalp psoriasis and the heat is sometimes painful for my scalp and makes it really dry.</li>
            <li> have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have belly button length hair and very thick</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t fall on the ground and suffer a violent death like my last hair dryer.</li>
            <li> After six month, it was broken.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin</li>
            <li> and I have thin thin hair.</li>
            <li> so your hand does not get tired.</li>
            <li> Power on blower was poor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get confused.</li>
            <li> so my hair is curly, thin, wispy, prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I like the Revlon name behind it too.</li>
            <li> Since losing function in my arm the few times I tried to dry my hair were painful &amp; basically impossible.</li>
            <li> Since getting this I have actually dried my hair 3 times, without it being extremely painful or dropping the dryer.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> She LOVES it and it cost me a mere 22 bucks.</li>
            <li> After a year of use the body plastic around the button broke and the motor started to make weird scary noises.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use it for over a week now, and every time my hair comes out weird.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it is now useless.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend not buying something that will degrade over time with wear and tear from Amazon as you are unable to return the product that is defective.</li>
            <li> I was SOOO wrong.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace  a terrible Conair, which I only used for a month before I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> It just (after dropping it a time or two) started to make a weird noise.  </li>
            <li> I hate drying my hair because (even tough I have fairly thin hair)</li>
            <li> Another issue I had was that the buttons are all placed inconveniently-</li>
            <li> Just cold.</li>
            <li> noticed it was cutting through again.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the ceramic ion concept but let me tell you..</li>
            <li> Could have been a bad one, but wont try again.</li>
            <li> The bad news is, eventually, I&#x27;ll run out of cord.</li>
            <li> it really shocked me.  </li>
            <li> heat settings including a very cold setting</li>
            <li> I have to hold the cord coming out of the base</li>
            <li> so i was wiggling the cord at the base where the cord goes into the dryer - and poof - flames</li>
            <li> I have to hold the base to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> The cord at the base rubbed off and it literally sparked, caught fire and burned a hole through my shirt.  </li>
            <li> Scared the crap out of me.</li>
            <li> A completely worthless piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Sparks began shooting from the cord at the base of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very Disappointed:(</li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
            <li> Smh very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was terrifying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very annoying and makes me wish I bought another type of dryer.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap!!!</li>
            <li> This bow dryer is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is light weigh and strong.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Like individual heat and flow controls.</li>
            <li> Fabulous hair dryer, not too heavy and the low fan speed is perfect.</li>
            <li> Just very nice.love it..</li>
            <li> The power is enough. But the head often drops when using.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer. For me who don&#x27;t use a lot of direct heat on my hair it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s a very good dryer</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer!  Great price!</li>
            <li> Great blowdryer for the price. Only complaint is that the buttons are very easy to shift without much pressure, so when you&#x27;re holding the handle, it&#x27;s impossible not to flick the top setting around to different temperatures the whole time. Not a huge deal when you consider the price and convenient size + included concentrator attachment. Makes my hair soft (doesn&#x27;t dry it out!) and works quickly.</li>
            <li> it works well its price is okay</li>
            <li> it is lighter compared to other hair dryers and a bit quieter, but does not offer any extra shine. In fact I don&#x27;t think any of the hair dryers out there offer extra shine, it depends on how well you know how to handle a brush during your blowout, and your choice of product and amount used.</li>
            <li> New out of the box... wouldn&#x27;t even turn on:( very light weight - feels cheap! returned.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and have experienced none of the problems other reviewers mentioned.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Problem with the cord.  The dryer goes on and off because of the cord (loose connection?).  If I hold the cord in the right position, it will run.  Only lasted a little over a year.  My last hair dryer lasted over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Works fine, using it to dry up my RCs</li>
            <li> This is a light weight hair dryer of standard size ( not compact like in hotels) and the price is right. The dryer arrived quickly however I was disappointed that it is NOT pink. The title says it is pink and the picture shown is pink, however, the dryer is really maroon. It is still nice and does not over heat or get too hot and I like the hanging loop so it is not cluttered up on my vanity, but I REALLY wanted pink. But hey, at the price I will keep it. Just think the title and pic should be updated to maroon not pink because I actually wanted pink to match my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, light weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of weeks now and it&#x27;s great.  Given I would not spend much on a hair styling electronic this was worth it.  It&#x27;s also very quite.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is pretty standard. It generally met my expectations. When I use the cap piece to dry my hair, it leaves the hair a little more burnt feeling than normal and not as smooth (which has not been the case with previous blow dryers). Without the nozzle, I still get a pretty quick dry and don&#x27;t have the less desirable side effects, so I generally use it without. If you intend to use the nozzle I&#x27;d suggest buying another dryer, but if you&#x27;re not bothered about it, it&#x27;s generally what you&#x27;d expect for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good product, although hair not always as shiny as it was the first time I tried it. However, for me. it was just as good as the pricier products.</li>
            <li> Works great, just as expected</li>
            <li> With three girls in the house, we ordered two. These are exactly what we were looking for. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you. This is a very good &amp; sturdy dryer. It even has a cold shot and several heat temps. Plus ceramic &amp; ionic? I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so good for the price of $16.77, but it really is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this same dryer twice.  But not for the reason you would think....  my first purchase is still in great working condition after 3 years.  I had a friend visiting and she asked if she could use my hair dryer.  After she finished, she raved about how well this dryer dried her hair and how she&#x27;s never had a blow dryer work that quickly on her very long hair.  So I made a mental note, and then ordered one for her as a Christmas gift.  How could I not at this price?  Maybe one of the best deals on a highly effective dryer that exists.  Oh, and purple is my favorite color.  Tip:  Always use the attachment!</li>
            <li> Works great !  Lots of airflow....</li>
            <li> I really like this, I just wish the handle had some sort of gripper. When your hand is damp, or you have some lotion on, it is very slippery.</li>
            <li> wife said it works ok</li>
            <li> Decent hair dryer.  No far so good.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!Great price and Great quality!!! The negative ion made my super long hair so smooth and light. I don&#x27;t need the hair smoother or oil anymore. It comes with 3 temperatures and 2 strengths to choose. It works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift last year for christmas.. It has quit working and it isn&#x27;t even christmas yet.</li>
            <li> This  blow dryer is the best one I  have ever purchased. It has a very comfortable  feel when handling it and best part is it drys your hair quickly. Loving it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hairdryers over the years. I love this hairdryer. Its lightweight and quick. Makes my somewhat curley hair straight and shiny. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about hairdryers other than all the comments people post. I debated between this model and others that don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; or \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; features. I&#x27;m now a believer. This hairdryer doesn&#x27;t frizz up my hair the way a basic hairdryer does. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> very nice powerful and dries pretty fast .cool air blow is nice feature too</li>
            <li> this has been my favorite blow dryer till now &#x3D;) love the color, easy to use and drys hair quickly. Love that is has a cool shot setting I purchase a diffuser to protect my hair and it works great!</li>
            <li> I have never, ever been a fan of blow drying my hair. I have long, thick hair, wavy hair. If I cut it short its all poofy and weird, plus I like it long. I usually just throw it in a ponytail and go on with my day. I also have scalp psoriasis and the heat is sometimes painful for my scalp and makes it really dry. I had a old dryer of my moms that I was using and it was taking too long to dry. It was overall a frustrating experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research and asked my fiance for this for Christmas. I love it. You can HEAR how much more powerful this one is than my last. I LOVE that it has heat settings because I can use a lower heat. It takes so much less time to dry my hair. I&#x27;ve had it for five days now and have used it four times. no weird smells, no overheating. The attachment is easy to snap on and off. I was worried it would be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone. If my review changes I will update it</li>
            <li> This worked great for about a year, until today when the cord shorted, started shooting sparks and caught on fire! I could have been electrocuted! It was terrifying. I took great care of it, too -- it wasn&#x27;t anything that I did to the cord, just normal wear. It happened out of NOWHERE. And now I see this has happened to many others. Of course it&#x27;s way too late to return, but I wish I&#x27;d seen those reviews before buying this. I don&#x27;t usually write the word &amp;#34;BEWARE&amp;#34; in a review... but seriously, don&#x27;t buy this. It&#x27;s not worth it, especially since it appears this is a pattern with this product. Get it together, Revlon!</li>
            <li> I have owned it for about 10 months, but it suddenly stopped working two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It lasted less than a year</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this blowdryer after reading the reviews but was very unhappy with the results. First if you are looking for a dryer that is powerful then this is not the best choice. The hot setting is warm and the strength is far from powerful. I have a wavy/curly hair and blow dry it straight and this did nothing to straighten my hair. Another issue I had was that the buttons are all placed inconveniently- you end up pressing the buttons (especially the cold air button) as you are trying to hold the dryer. This dryer is ok if you have straight hair and need a bit of air - even so- it would take too long to dry if you use this. Overall, i would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice color and makes less noise. I can&#x27;t wait to start putting it into full use, I particularly like the fact that it prevents frizzing!</li>
            <li> I was actually a little skeptical when it came to making this purchase online, but I ordered it and hoped for the best. And what is my result? I&#x27;m actually very pleased!  For one thing, my order actually arrived much earlier than what I had expected. I was given an estimated time of Wednesday for its arrival, but I received it on Monday, which was a very pleasant surprise.  Secondly, having this hair dryer I&#x27;ve been so pleased and impressed by it. The heat is very controlled in my opinion, even in the hottest setting, and my hair does not feel as though it is being fried. It is easy to style my hair and I love the fact that it has a cool, warm and hot setting. It works quickly, efficiently, and it is also very quiet. I know that my old hair dryer was louder and it would blast my hair everywhere. The price on this dryer is so reasonable, too. I have no regrets getting it.  I love the product and am so glad I purchased it, so thanks, Revlon, for the great hair dryer! haha</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Light weight. Easy to use. Well works</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would, but I like this dryer more than I expected to. It is lighter 3-4-year-old Conair dryer in it replaced. In addition to loving purple, the back side of the dryer is rubberized which makes it easy to hold. Although the high setting does not seem to be as hot as my old dryer, this one seems to dry my hair faster somehow (ions?). Also, the concentrator goes on easily and securely. I am very pleased with this dryer.</li>
            <li> After using the dryer for five days, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought because she liked the first one so much.  Instead of carrying these around in a carry on bag we decided to get on for here and there.  The fact I bought the second one tells you all you need to know about what I thought of the first one.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer itself is pretty good, I have no complaints, but the attachment never stays on. This is especially true when trying to give yourself a blowout (if it bumps into the brush it immediately falls off), but it also falls off with regular (rough dry) use.  The attachment heats up significantly, too, and then it&#x27;s difficult to reattach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for a few months, and I really love it.  I already short hair, but this dryer gets the job done even quicker than my last one.  It also gives me a lot of volume, which I haven&#x27;t been able to get from other dryers.  The only negative is the location of the cool shot button, which is right where my index finger normally lands when holding a hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve had to adjust my grip in order to avoid holding the button down.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, though, so overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It was just what we wanted.  No complains.&lt;br /&gt;The hairdryer is light weight and it was purple.</li>
            <li> After 10 Months this Hairdryer has started shorting out. I have to hold the cord coming out of the base a certain way in order to use it.  After reading others reviews I am inclined to buy a new dryer and pitch this one.  AMAZON/REVLON should be issuing refunds for these hair dryers with all of the reviews.  I plan to write a formal complaint.  I bought this hairdryer after my hairdryer of 6 years quit on me.  I expected to get at least a year out of it.  I use it daily, and treat it with respect as I did my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Upsetting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was very good to work with me on this Issue.  I am proud to be an avid Amazon.com Shopper!</li>
            <li> Worked really well when I took it outside to thaw frozen pipes. Was able to strap it to the well-pipe so it could thaw while I went back inside.</li>
            <li> Works fine. I like it.</li>
            <li> I had given this dryer 4 stars, but now am forced to downgrade my review since the dryer burst into FLAMES! I&#x27;m not kidding.  And I&#x27;m not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it for less than a year.  One morning, I was using it.  No problem.  Then suddenly it started cutting in and out for about 20 seconds.  Then, at the juncture where the cord connects to the body of the dryer, the cord burst into flames.  As in, real fire.  Luckily, I was holding it slightly away from me at the time, so my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire.  And, luckily, I was standing in front of the sink, so I was able to toss it into the sink so nothing got burned.  But god forbid I had been holding it close to my hair, or had been forced to toss it onto carpeting or another flammable surface.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer because it has a strong fan and gets hot enough to work quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major annoying downside is that the concentrator nozzle falls off every time I use it. It&#x27;s very annoying and makes me wish I bought another type of dryer.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the many options on this dryer: low, medium and high in addition to cool, warm and hot. Unlike most dryers this one has the option to actually switch to cool rather than awkwardly holding  a button down. This is a great feature for locking a style in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is pretty easy to hold and has an appropriate cord length plus it is not any louder than it needs to be. I would definitely recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Great price, good quality.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer there are so many to choose from. I have low,  medium,  and high for heating choices.&lt;br /&gt;Also I have cold shot that actually works. The heat I don&#x27;t have to put on high and fry my hair. To top it of i got it on the site that is the return site nothing wrong with it just had been opened and returned</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  It is relatively quiet.  Not like my old one which was really loud.  I have long hair.  My hair dries in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> love the dryer, cord is very short</li>
            <li> It dries my hair well</li>
            <li> She has an old dryer for a long time. It was taking her 20 mins to dry, so I bought her this one because of the reviews. She says it works great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item in April, however my old dryer was still working. I put this in my closet and never tested it(my fault). I went to use it today, took it out of the box and wrapper...plugged it in...and it does not work. I would return it for another one, however the return window is closed.</li>
            <li> I like how light it is and the black part on the handle is made of that smooth, matte finish rubber-like material that I love so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the buttons can be changed while holding it in one hand. This was much better than my previous blow-dryer which had a sliding switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work at first but I pushed the reset button on the plug and it worked just fine afterwards, no problems.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product as it is the product of Revlon. Its so nice and have different options to use. Its convenient</li>
            <li> Love it the cord is just a little to short</li>
            <li> Pretty good hair dryer.  Good temperature control.  At the high setting, it feels like it could have used a little more air blowing.  Another minor issue is the location of the cold shot button.  When you hold the dryer, you constantly need to pay attention not to accidentally push that button (unless you want to). If you want a dryer with a big blowing power, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer and great price.  Many variations of settings.</li>
            <li> quick service, works very well</li>
            <li> With a price like this and free shipping (A-prime), it was definitely a good deal. It is powerful and does the trick.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer she&#x27;s ever had</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews although I always read many before buying a product so I feel it&#x27;s time to give my two cents back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old dryer just died and I couldn&#x27;t wait for shipping so I picked this dryer up at a local Walmart. This is a great product for the price! It&#x27;s lightweight which I love since I like to use the heat of the dryer and a round brush to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two sets of clickable buttons on the handle to include speed settings high, low, and off; temperature settings hot, warm, and cold; and then a cold shot button by itself. I had to get used to the different feel and position of the buttons since I was so used to my old dryer. The buttons felt awkward at first, but now I like that a can click through the settings without having to stop to see what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other features of this dryer that I like is that the cord is a decent length and there&#x27;s a removable door at the back so you can clean the lint trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all the nifty features I&#x27;ve listed above, the most important thing to me was how fast it dried my hair. Soaking wet and it still dried my long, thick hair in half the time!! And my hair is frizz free and silky smooth. According to the box this is do to the ceramic coils and ionic technology the put into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a blow dryer that&#x27;s super affordable, does the job, and has all the cool extras, get the Revlon RDVR5029 1875 Watt Smoothstay Ceramic Ionic Dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it works well.</li>
            <li> This stopped working completely after a few months.  Won&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer, I like that the nozel detaches so you can customize how you dry your hair. The concentrator dries efficiently without damaging your hair. Very good for the price.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is perfect especially when drying long thick hair.  It doesn&#x27;t overheat at all given the length of time it takes to dry our hair and the varying settings work well too.  We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> works fine for the price and im happy with it. No issues so far and hoping that this will last long.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great.  I love it.  The cool part is great after you dry your hair and sweat. : )</li>
            <li> Was fantastic. Dried my hair perfect and fast . Until a year later when it suddenly died on me. Worked one minute and literally the next it wouldn&#x27;t come back on (yes I tried troubleshooting and other outlets)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a month now and have only good things to say about it. It is ionic so your hair dries faster but does not have the loud, supersonic blowing power that other high wattage dryers have. The color is great, the handle is great and I would definitely recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> I picked this one based on price and reviews, because unless you plan to spend a lot of money, they are pretty similar in function.  This arrived in the original box and a few instructions/tips.  It works well and I like the adjustment options.</li>
            <li> Although my old hair dryer had three heat settings, it only operated at two levels: sort of cool and blistering hot. I was attracted to this Revlon model because of the positive reviews, the light weight (because I have arthritis in my hands), and the desire to stop burning my scalp and fingers when I dry my hair.  I like the rubberized grip and the lighter weight. There&#x27;s definitely a difference in the three heat settings; the medium setting works great on my fine hair. My only complaint was in the shipping. I have Amazon Prime, and delivery was promised for the Thursday after my order. It didn&#x27;t arrive until the following Tuesday. This is the first time Prime has failed me. I wondered if it was because after I applied my bonus points the item was free. Did this affect the shipping priority, I wonder?</li>
            <li> Love the heating options with low medium high cool&lt;br /&gt;Warm hot and shot of cold it&#x27;s a fantastic choice for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for my daughter. She really likes it. It seems to work very well for her.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a blow dryer but I thought if I was going to get one, it would be good to try this one since it says it smooths hair as it dries. Starting with damp hair, I could see that it was staying smooth as it was drying. By the end of the process, my long, thick hair did feel a little unruly but I&#x27;m a beginner at this. I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use a large round brush in the other hand while drying yet. I didn&#x27;t use any product, so that might make it work even better. I only used the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s purple, which is a superficial thing to look for but it makes me happy.</li>
            <li> works great and dry&#x27;s your hair fast.  Despite the high speed seeming more like medium this dryer has a high heat setting that will dry your hair fast.  I like the style and comfort of using this dryer, very nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a good product, for me was not useful since  many times cold air comes out even at the hot level.</li>
            <li> work 100% mi wife is very happy.</li>
            <li> Decent for the price. Love the color. Basically your basic blow dryer. Works great! I would recommend to anyone who needs a good blow dryer. Revlon is a great brand!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, Quiet, Powerful. And value priced.  What more can you ask for?  I&#x27;m thinking of buying another for a back-up and to keep in the guest room.</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer because my old one died, this design is more lightweight, and the air holes on the side of the attachment mean the dryer doesn&#x27;t overheat as often as the older models did.  I like Revlon dryers, and think this is a good dryer for the money.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after two weeks. I understand it was a cheap hair dryer but I would like to think it would have lasted a bit longer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to pick a hair dryer on the internet, so I went with what looked the most like the last two I had that were the only two that lasted over 20 years, altogether.&lt;br /&gt;I am really very pleased with it. And it&#x27;s pretty. But it has the things I need. High medium low, cool warm hot, and a cool button. And a nice hoop to hang it so it doesn&#x27;t fall on the ground and suffer a violent death like my last hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This does not pack the air flow punch you expect from a high power dryer, but it does work well for straightening hair, and slow drying. The attachment is very useful. I bought two types of dryers, and I like the one with the jet stream flow, not this one as much. I would rather have my hair dry faster, and a little fluffier than dried slow and sheek. Use this blower for sleek shiny hair. This one is not damaging like the other, so no frizzies, and less broken strands of hair. If you are maintaining long hair, good luck with the time it takes to dry it with this one, but if you are maintaining a style and you like the salon feel, then this one is your choice item. It&#x27;s got the best price for what it does. The hanger hook is perfect to keep it off the bathroom counter top too. Just use a screw in hook on the wall to hang this when not in use. It&#x27;s got a nice rubber coating over the black plastic as well. It feels nice to hold and use, it&#x27;s also more quiet than most.</li>
            <li> Works great, gets pretty hot and the attachment is perfect.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give off enough heat and unfortunately the 30 day return policy has passed so I cannot return it.  I am stuck with an item that I won&#x27;t be using</li>
            <li> I buy this blow dyer on the 13 and received it on the 16...I love it,it a really good dyer...I&#x27;ll never stop shopping at Amazon because they&#x27;re  makes me happy,,,Amazon all the way...keep up the good works&amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li> I hate buying a new hair dryer, but after reading the reviews, I decided on this.  I like it...just a regular hairdryer...nothing fancy.  Thats all I needed though :)</li>
            <li> Hi, I just receive the product by today. Mine is super noisy and smells burn inside. I think i need to change it.</li>
            <li> quiet, quick, and light weight&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and this dries it in minutes so I actually have time to flat iron after.</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking at all the great reviews, but I&#x27;m sad to say that this went bad within a year. I was super impressed in the beginning - but recently I noticed it did not turn on right away, after 10+ seconds it started with a loud sound &amp; slow operation. Then I noticed FIRE 💥 coming out of the device.&lt;br /&gt;My previous one from same brand hasn&#x27;t spoilt &amp; it&#x27;s 15 years old.</li>
            <li> The blower dryer is nice.  Light weight.  Dryes hair quickly... however would like to find a pik attachment to help straighten hair.  So far unable to find any Revlon attachment, which makes no since to me.  May have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Works very well dries hair very quickly.  One of the best hair dryers for the price.  Will buy another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> not sure how long hair dryers should last but I purchased this 12/12/2012 and was pleased with every aspect of its performance.  two days ago it started to not work- I thought nothing of it until this morning when it caught fire!  I was drying my hair and it kept shutting off - i tried the heat setting and was fine, then adjusted the speed and that worked fine. It kept shorting out so i was wiggling the cord at the base where the cord goes into the dryer - and poof - flames come shooting out!  Scared the heck out of me - I unplugged it and dropped it in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve posted something on Revlon&#x27;s FB page and will be sending an email as well.  I don&#x27;t know - should a hair dryer work for more than13 months?</li>
            <li> The end piece comes off easy. I purchased this a year ago and still works. I would purchase again- the price is good for what you get.</li>
            <li> This dryer works only in ionic mode which does make the hair smoother but you lose on volume. Some days I want volume rather than sleek hair. My fault for not checking that it lacked a switch and for throwing away the packaging before noticing. My last dryer had a switch so I could choose whether I wanted ionic drying or regular, and I assumed that all ionic dryers could be used in regular mode as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer because of the great price. when i use it ,i find it dry so fast, and feel confortable</li>
            <li> It is good. the Wind is strong. The price is reasonable.  But I think it is a little too big.</li>
            <li> works great But it is now 12-13-2015 a few months later and it started squeeling like the last one.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer is small. Works good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in a hurry when my old blowdryer started sparking. I love all of the different settings on this dryer, and I love how lightweight it is! The purple is also a nice touch!</li>
            <li> Perfect! It&#x27;s purple and it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> I had a hair dryer from Walmart for less than 3 months and it blew up. I don&#x27;t even use one more than once a week. I have had this one now for a few months and I really like it. It isn&#x27;t too heavy, the settings are nice and it does a great job</li>
            <li> Great product. After more than 2yrs of daily use by multiple people this hairdryer still works great!</li>
            <li> I have used a revlon ceramic ionic dryer for 4 years but then lost the air concentrator part on a trip.  I decided it was time to treat myself so some new great dryer technology so after reading a lot of reviews I settled on a much more expensive Babyliss dryer.  I hated it.  My hair has never looked so frizzy and upset.  I kept hoping and used it for 2 months.  But I had already spent the money on it, so I had to go with something cheaper this time.  I saw the great price on this dryer and got it, and its been soooo great.  My hair is smooth and soft and not frizzy anymore.  What a difference!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. It dries my hair so fast and I have really thick long hair. I love it</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, it is quieter than any dryer I have had, and I have very thick hair and it dries my hair in no time at all.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this blow dryer.  It has good power and is not extremely loud.  Light weight.</li>
            <li> Used it a couple of times a week for 10 months then it died. Doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Not worth the the money.</li>
            <li> I liked the way this dryer dried my hair in combination with a large round ceramic brush. I purchased this dryer in April 2014. It started to spark, smoke, and smell in May 2015 and due to obvious reasons I threw away. I got my money out of it but it is not worth the danger.</li>
            <li> Dries well, like the settings, and has a nice hand grip.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer worked great for 5 months. Then it would stop and start while I was trying to use it. I think there is a short in the wiring near the handle. I will go back to buying Conair, at least they last longer.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer quit on me and I had a long and frustrating look for another one.  Despite only having 3 reviews I settled on this one mainly because it was the only one in the store with a several heat AND blower settings and was ionic/ceramic.  I really wanted a finger diffuser too; that it doesn&#x27;t come with one is the ONLY downside to this dryer (not worth taking a star off for). Oh and it&#x27;s purple  not maroon. :)  It is LIGHTER than my old dryer, has a STRONGER blower and though doesn&#x27;t get as hot, drys my hair FASTER!!  I timed it this morning and it took about 3 minutes to almost totally dry my hair.  PLUS, it dries it from the inside out so when I was done only the top layer was slightly damp (personal preference). I can definitely tell a difference in my hair after only 2 sessions with this thing.    FYI: I have fine straight(ish) waist length hair.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Terrific blow dryer. I bought ghis to use on my six year olds hair. It&#x27;s much quieter than our old one and has better heat settings.</li>
            <li> Revlon Rvdr5029 1875 Watt Smoothstay Ceramic...not happy, as a stylist, the cord is too short, it dropped to the floor once, and the insides all fell apart and not useable.  It smelled like fire!  Not worth the money I spent.  © 2015 Jackie Paulson</li>
            <li> What a difference in my hair.  It dries fast without getting too hot that you can&#x27;t stand it.  My hair is smoother and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> Present for my oldest daughter. No complaints! Sure she liked it.</li>
            <li> Better than my old one. Much, much better!</li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer.  Its not very heavy. It&#x27;s the weight of an average hair dryer.  I don&#x27;t use temperature setting on hot because it is very hot!  My hair isn&#x27;t very thick but not thin so in the middle and the medium setting is perfect.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month so hopefully it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this cuts my drying time in half!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your outlet supports the higher voltage to get the best power.</li>
            <li> Broke in about a week. It over heated and didn&#x27;t really have a change in temperature between hot and warm.</li>
            <li> Cheap, quiet, lightweight, and ionic.&lt;br /&gt;The hot setting is too hot, but medium is just right.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this hair dryer, but unfortunately it was not that great. &#x27;Hot&#x27; air wasn&#x27;t hot and my diffuser kept sliding off, which was extremely annoying. The only thing I liked was how ergonomic the handle was, unfortunately that was not enough...  It just had to go back...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it thank you :) dries hair really fast  and leaves a soft feeling thank you :) great buy</li>
            <li> best deal for this price.was looking for a hair dryer for daily use with 3 options (normal,warm and hot) couldn&#x27;t have bargained btter at this price.I love the color too</li>
            <li> The significant other had a 15 year old hair dryer take a crap. I thought just to be considerate, I&#x27;d buy her a new one. She LOVES it and it cost me a mere 22 bucks.</li>
            <li> Well the dryer worked great until the cord, at the area where it comes out of the bottom of the dryer, caught on fire. Not just a spark either, I mean full on fire. Scared the heck out of me trying not to drop it on the bathroom rug and unplug it without being fried!  Come on manufacturers.  Use quality materials!</li>
            <li> Second Revlon buy for me...used the old one until the back came off from age and use....but it was still running!  The Hot setting is just that...I am more comfortable with the warm setting.  Love it...hope it lasts as long as the first one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last 6 months. Will not purchase this brand or this style ever again.</li>
            <li> It worked great twice. Then it stopped blowing hot air. Just cold. Nothing else. Of course this happens about 30 minutes after my return window closes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not worth the shipping costs anyway. Not sure I&#x27;d like this one replaced since I&#x27;m not the only one to have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it didn&#x27;t start a fire like other reviewers have experienced.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Really dries hair fast. Great price for such an excellent hair dryer. I have bought dryers that were more expensive that were subpar to this one</li>
            <li> The color is nice but it does NOT come with the defuser.. That is the reason I picked it. It is totally different then the one in the pic... Sadly I am back on the hunt for a ceramic ionic dryer with a defuser.. Smh very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This does the job and does everything it says. I dont use the heat that much but it does work and really heats up your hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for 10 months and it too has begun shorting out.  I have to hold the base to get it to work.  Going to buy a new one from a different brand before it catches fire!!!  Do not buy or this will happen to you in a few months too.</li>
            <li> I love the different settings, cool to hot. Great color</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement blow dryer and this was actually an upgrade to what I had. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price I paid but it works great, my hair dries fast and is quiet.</li>
            <li> So far, this dryer has been great. It&#x27;s quieter than my last dryer and seems to be blowing less air, but my hair gets dry just as quick, if not quicker.</li>
            <li> My wife had a power supply problem with a different model so we bought this as a replacement.  While it is not as powerful as others we have used it still dries just as fast as more powerful models. It is also quieter which is helpful when you have sleeping children.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old dryer was until I got this one.  Fast drying and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very nice dryer! Its also really light weight but does a great job, excellent quality!</li>
            <li> I bought one of this dryer from kmart and when my sister came to my house she use it on my hair and she thought it work very well, so she ask me to buy her one, so I did get it on amazon and she is very happy with her dryer.</li>
            <li> My fiance purchased this hairdryer for me as I had put it in a wish list of gifts I wanted for my birthday. My previous hairdryer was also a Revlon but was an older version and needed to be trashed. I had been using it since 2006 or 2007 so that shows how long it lasted! This hairdryer in general works very well and blow drys my hair in a relatively short period of time. One feature I like about it is that it&#x27;s cord is VERY long and doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle like my previous hairdryer would. It&#x27;s awesome having 3 settings: cool, warm, and hot though don&#x27;t expect the hot to be scorching hot. It&#x27;s probably better that way anyways since you don&#x27;t want your hair to be fried. Every time I use this, it leaves my hair very soft, shinny, and healthy looking. It even comes with the attachment seen in the picture which I use and was suggested to use by my hairdresser. Definitely a good buy and certainly much cheaper than some of the other hairdryers I looked at!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cord doesn&#x27;t tangle&lt;br /&gt;*Long cord&lt;br /&gt;*3 heat settings including a very cold setting&lt;br /&gt;*Comes with attachment&lt;br /&gt;*Light weight&lt;br /&gt;*Leaves hair soft and shinny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Highest heat setting might not be hot enough for some people&#x27;s liking</li>
            <li> its amazing compared to the ones i&#x27;ve had in the past. dries quickly and efficiently, couldn&#x27;t be happier to own it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hot-blooded enough not to need to inflame my scalp each morning.  This item has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting that doesn&#x27;t require holding down a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button.  My previous one lasted for years and I feared it&#x27;d be obsolete but there it was.  Exactly what I wanted/needed and delivered in two days.</li>
            <li> I had same one for many about 4 years until recently it started to produce burning smell, I like this one because it has big hook so I can hang it over in my bathroom over the shelf.</li>
            <li> I like this dry bar , the wind is comfortable. Fast dry and works well.     After six month, it was broken. I have to buy a new  one.</li>
            <li> I like it, I&#x27;ve had this for a while and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I moved from the southwest to the east coast and this definitely helped me during the winter months. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> works great love the color</li>
            <li> Good, simple hair dryer. I use it on the warm setting and finish with cool setting.</li>
            <li> After a year of use the body plastic around the button broke and the motor started to make weird scary noises. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I got the product on March 4th 2014 and it stopped working on April 27th 2014. Didn&#x27;t even last for two months. I tried hitting reset and test buttons several times but it didnt work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> feels light and cheap but is actually a really good dryer, but the attachment keeps popping off,</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  Very comfortable holding this while drying my long hair.  Very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good blow dryer so far. It doesn&#x27;t get fiery hot, but hot enough, I suppose. I do like that it comes with the concentrator. It&#x27;s good for my needs. I would recommend for someone with short, fine hair. It will get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife is delighted with this hair, she has long hair, and dry and brush 2 times a week and with this hair does in less than 15 minutes, very good air flow and heat you need, really exceeded expectations ..</li>
            <li> Great! i like it having options of wind speed and even hot, warm and cool.</li>
            <li> This is a good blow dryer for the money. The only bad thing about it is the switches. They should have located them differently, in order to keep you from accidentally pressing on them while using dryer.</li>
            <li> Could have been a bad one, but wont try again. DOA..wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I love the groovy color of the blow dryer.  It is relatively quiet and does as advertised on the box.  At first I was skeptical, but I asked my hairdresser and she  educated me on &amp;#34;ion&amp;#34; drying.</li>
            <li> Great product! I really Liked it!... Bought it to dry my hair. Very good quality of product! Great product! I really Liked it!... Bought it to dry my hair. Very good quality of product!</li>
            <li> I must say the manufacturer really timed their warranty period well to match the expected life of this dryer. Mine started making some clicking noises like the fan is sliding through some objects constantly during use and its wind speed is significantly lower than before. It&#x27;s not totally dead yet but I wasn&#x27;t going to use it anymore for fear of fire or explosion so close to my head!</li>
            <li> With hot, warm and cool as well as high and low settings, this dryer gives you all the styling options you need plus plenty of power. The ceramic-ion technology works great. My ho-hum hair is suddenly shining and bouncy and getting compliments!</li>
            <li> This was a $20 piece of junk. I would give this blow dryer zero stars if that were an option. Stopped working 5 weeks after I bought it. I would return it if I could, but the return policy only gives you 30 days after purchase to send it back.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific light-weight full size dryer. Capable of 9 separate settings and cool or blast button. Love it! My hair is just coming back in from chemotherapy. I needed a lighter weight hair dryer that enabled me to have a cool dry, warm, hot, or multiplied choices. With the 3 speeds and 3 heat settings this gives the user 9 combinations, plus, a button to provide a cool blast of air.&lt;br /&gt;Great choice. Terrific.</li>
            <li> This dryer does the obvious very well. I am Black with fairly nappy hair and it(with the help of a straightening attachment} gets my hair straight while leaving in body and  it does so quicker than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  In addition it is lightweight, so even drying the back does not tire me.  Because I have carpel tunnel I really appreciate that!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer!! It is not for professionals, cause it is not so strong. It works great to get the hair dry daily. It is really lightweight and it doesnt make much noise.</li>
            <li> love it very much!! wind is very strong and really smooth~~also very light.&lt;br /&gt;The most useful dyer I have ever~</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  Also like the adjustable settings.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to dry my hair quickly and without the frizzy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Avoid the cheap hairdryers at Walmart. Some of them heat up so much it burns you. This heats gently and the funnel controls the volume of air you want.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is a fire hazard.  The cord at the base rubbed off and it literally sparked, caught fire and burned a hole through my shirt.  I&#x27;m lucky it was not my face.  I do not recommend this product, it&#x27;s unsafe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and fast to dry the hair. And you can adjust the settings flexible according to whatever you need.</li>
            <li> This was a gift which has been enjoyed.  Everything about it was as expected. This was for a teenager who is usually hard to please, but not this time.</li>
            <li> Only used few months and it became bad connection, on and off on and off. It really bother me but can&#x27;t do anything now.</li>
            <li> This thing dried my hair from dripping wet to completely dry in less than 5 minutes. What the heck? Easy to use, the buttons are great, nothing wrong with the cord, love the different speeds and warming levels. I&#x27;m still flabbergasted it worked so fast.</li>
            <li> Have had this a while now, and it works very well, is as advertised, and expect it will last.</li>
            <li> Works great, great power and my hair is dried much faster than before.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for her birthday! She is very happy with it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Was looking for a hair dryer that would hold up for more than a year. At first it appeared this was the one. It functioned very well. Then at less than 6 months the cheap budget cord wore through just below the protective boot. The hard, sharp plastic inner edge eventually cut through the poor quality cord with a spark and puff of smoke, tripping the GFCI breaker. I&#x27;m an electrician so I look it to work, disassembled and cut about 7 inches off, getting rid of the burnt part. I re-wired it and was good to go for another 3-4 months then noticed it was cutting through again. I slipped some insulating rubber over the worn area and wrapped with electrical tape. Worked great till the other day when blower motor started sounding like a small weed eater/meat grinder cross. VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add: I wrote the above review last night while ordering a new hair dryer in preparation for the Revlon dryer to fully quit working. Didn&#x27;t have to wait long. This morning while my wife was using it, it slowed to a stop and ignited. Not burst into flames ignition but visible small flame that extinguished and smoked. Now residing in garbage.</li>
            <li> I really liked this dryer, not as much as my previous one, but I liked the different heat options and the cool shot. It did a great job drying my hair. I bought this about 6 months ago, and the dryer turned off and on while I was using it tonight. I checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidentally hit the off switch. Nope. It did it again, so I checked the cord and pushed it around...... then I hear a snap and a huge spark comes out. The protective cover cut into the cord. My fingers were just millimeters from the break when it sparked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed. I wasted $20, and only got 6 months out of it. My previous hair dryer lasted about 4 years.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My hair is getting thin and I am trying to handle it gently :) This dryer is perfect for my needs. Never gets hot---</li>
            <li> Got this bc i wanted a good hair dryer but needed it to be light weight. I narrowed my search down to 2, decided on this after read reviews, it has different heat settings, light weight &amp; quieter. Since losing function in my arm the few times I tried to dry my hair were painful &amp; basically impossible. Since getting this I have actually dried my hair 3 times, without it being extremely painful or dropping the dryer. The best part is my hair is actually soft &amp; shiny after drying it! I rarely ever dried my hair (even before the pain) bc I was always worried about drying out my hair &amp; causing heat damage. That does not seem to be an issue with this dryer, my hair actually looks so much better &amp; feels healthier when I dry it! The only thing is it is louder than I expected, especially after some reviews of it being quiet, I really wanted a quieter one but I wouldn&#x27;t return it bc of that. Highly recommend it if you want a good, light weight hair dryer with optional heat &amp; speed settings, at a fantastic price. The purple was an added bonus since my bathroom is purple.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS. I love this one better that my hair dresser&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> I had my blow dryer for about 10 years - my hair is longer and it was no longer doing the job. This has the perfect amt of power</li>
            <li> Bought this hair dryer the end of June. Just today the motor died. Save your $ for something that actually works. Should have listened to the other reviews... I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer burn out on me! Guess you get what you pay for.  smh</li>
            <li> Fire hazard!!!!!  Worked less than a year.  Shorted out today and a spark/flame shot out the bottom of the handle where the cord connects to the dryer.  The cord is visibly burned where it attaches to the dryer.  This does not appear to be a unique incident as others have complained of the same issue.  Disappointing to say the least, just glad that nothing else was damaged!</li>
            <li> the blow dryer i had was really old, then i went to visit my mother she had one like this and i loved it so much i had to buy my own. i give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dyer. Its easy to use and works good.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My wife has one of these, and she loves it, so I bought a second one for a spare.  That way if I need a drier, which happens occasionally, I still have one available when my wife goes out of town.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  It&#x27;s salon quality without the price.  I had a more expensive one that broke, so I bought this one, hoping it would do the trick.  It did, and I like it better than my more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, and it doesn&#x27;t frizz my naturally curly frizzy hair.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap!!! I have bought three since this one!!...It does not get hot at all!!!! It comes with the attachment but it slides off easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer based upon the good reviews.  I have tried to use it for over a week now, and every time my hair comes out weird.  It does not come out nice.  The dryer creates a puffiness in one area and my hair sticks up.  I tried using the dryer and combing my hair in all different ways and still the same outcome.  I have short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to trying this new hot Ionic Dryer.  But it&#x27;s a flop in my book.  Give me my old basic hair dryer...it works a lot better!</li>
            <li> It stopped working after about 1 year and 6 month.</li>
            <li> GREAT HAIR DRYER ...GETS THE JOB DONE SUPER FAST</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer as a back up to my regular blow dryer and also to take on vacation. Its not real heavy, easy to handle. dries really quickly.</li>
            <li> Blows my hurr so good!&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase and for the price can&#x27;t be matched. More quiet than my other dryer and pretty light weight so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired holding it. Also makes my hair static free.</li>
            <li> very light weight.  gets the job done. love purple</li>
            <li> Revlon Rvdr5029 1875 Watt Smoothstay Ceramic Ionic Dryer, Purple - Product is ok and working fine.Thanks - Satish K B</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has great power, three heat settings and dries my hair faster than my last model. A great purchase a good price! I&#x27;m happy that I bought this!</li>
            <li> LIke other users, mine also caught on fire.  I have been drying my hair everyday since I was able to it myself (im 32) and I have never in my life seen this happen. Scared the crap out of me. A completely worthless piece of junk. Mine lasted 8 months.</li>
            <li> I basically bought this dryer to match my bathroom decor, but it turned out to be a nice dryer! I haven&#x27;t had any issues and it&#x27;s been about 8 months!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I don&#x27;t know how the ions work, but it surely keeps my hair in place. My old dryer used to make my hair dry and frizzy and I had to use tons of leave in conditioners after, to calm it down. Not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Lost a star, because of the power on high mode. It takes a little more time for me to completely dry my hair because the fan is not as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;But I love this dryer all the same.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I ever had! And I&#x27;m 66 years old! Dries quickly and is easy to hold. Lightweight and the price is great. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one in case I ever lose this one or drop it.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old wanted purple, so that&#x27;s a bonus, but the dryer is lightweight and powerful.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Very light and powerful.</li>
            <li> I read the comments about it catching on fire but thought that was something that surely had been fixed. Apparently not. I&#x27;m frustrated because another model I bought only lasted 6 months and then this one lasted 10. Manufacturers, you can do better than that.</li>
            <li> This summer I was visiting my parents who live in another state, and I decided instead of packing my blow dryer I would simply borrow my mom&#x27;s instead. She had purchased the Revlon Smoothstay Ceramic Ionic Dryer recently, and I fell in love with it to the point that I decided to buy one exactly like it. This blow dryer dries my hair with a lovely shine. Also, as others have mentioned the dryer is lightweight. This is a nice feature for those like me who have a lot of thick hair and wind up holding the blow dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other hand to dry the hair section by section. Honestly, I would not normally write a review praising a blow dryer but this one is exceptional!</li>
            <li> Love the color and drys faster than my old hair dryer</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this hair dryer.  Its great and has a lot of power with a perfect amount of heat or cool.  I would recommend it to any of my friends that have very long hair as I do.</li>
            <li> Feel the Ceramic lonic make my hair more soft.  So far i use it ok, price right when i bought it.</li>
            <li> About 3 months after purchasing this hair dryer it caught on fire.  Worked fine up until one morning when it starting smoking and flamed up.  Needless to say, it is now useless.  Plus, I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon due to their return policy.  I would recommend not buying something that will degrade over time with wear and tear from Amazon as you are unable to return the product that is defective.</li>
            <li> Within the price range this Dryer is one of the best. It has all the necessary functions that is needed. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair blow dryer I have ever owned. I am 28 years old and have tried every product out there for blow drying. And probably at least one blow dryer a year since I was 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one I really like the best. It works great with as minimal damage to my hair as a blow dryer can be. Dries my hair quickly and makes it nice and smooth as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power chord is fairly long as well which is a nice bonus. The purple is a nice color as well! Really fast delivery got it within two days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with this and it&#x27;s a lot easier on my hair than wire hair dryers. Also, dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Ugh I love this blow dryer but the cap keeps falling off , it&#x27;s get very hot which I love &amp; I can dry my curly hair in 15 minutes only bad thing is the cap</li>
            <li> It worked only for a month</li>
            <li> used it for the first time today, it is strong enough and love the different speeds. As good or better than all those expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it was a ceramic ionic hair dryer and I had heard good things about them. I ordered this dryer and it came in about a week. It looks exactly as pictured and works fantastically. I am very pleased with this purchase, it really cuts down  the frizz when I use it.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair hair dryer I had used for 20 years and considered getting another Conair.  But I&#x27;m glad I got the Revlon.  It dries hair very well.  I has several settings so you can adjust it to your preferences.  Hair comes out much smoother.  It dries quickly with less static in the hair.  And I like the color.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairdryer! I love the multiple settings especially the cool heat option. TH nozzle is also small enough for me to fit by ion diffuser onto it.</li>
            <li> Muy Bien, el producto es para Venezuela y esta en excelentes condiciones y llego en el tiempo estimado muchas gracias</li>
            <li> Nice dryer but not what I expected. I wanted one that was smaller easy to handle with one hand&lt;br /&gt;I went by weight but did not take into account size.</li>
            <li> Seems a little cheaper made than the last one I bought from Revlon.  Overall it is decent for the price, and it appears it will last for several years.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $16.95 for it, if it&#x27;s more I would look around.</li>
            <li> This product blew me away!</li>
            <li> This hair drier has exeptionally high power for a reasonably low price. I have been very pleased with the product so far!</li>
            <li> The product is the best for the price. It is a reliable. I would advice you to go for it without a doubt</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use every day so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good to compare with who use every day.&lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful but heats well.&lt;br /&gt;I liked and recomend but my favorite is the Taiff that I bought in Brasil.</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer.  Very light, doesn&#x27;t cause frizziness, etc.  This is all if you&#x27;re ok with a possible fire hazard.  The cord started to rub with the location it where it attaches to the dryer.  If you hold it at JUST the correct angle, it stays on, turn it a little and it&#x27;s off.  This is ok if you only want to dry half of your head and if you&#x27;re ok with maybe starting a fire.  So, it&#x27;s too late for me to return this item, and it&#x27;s too cheap for the hassle.  The company made their money, hopefully, they won&#x27;t make it off of you too. (Lasted 3 months, btw.)</li>
            <li> The one is nice . I have used it many times. It is practical. I love it. I hope you can try it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as I think it should. My hair is thin but longer then my shoulders. A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> UPDATED INFO...after 7 months Blow Dryer electric cord Connection keeps shorting out and will not work properly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the size, how it fits in my hand, and the power. I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months with no change in appearance or performance.</li>
            <li> It works very well but the header is loose so it needs some taping.</li>
            <li> broke after 3 months..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer a long time, and I love it.  The Ionic heat dries my hair much faster, and my hair is not damaged at all and still in great shape.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer because of the great price and the fact that it was a ceramic dryer.  It works extremely well.  My stylist commented on how good my hair looked.  Prior to owing a ceramic dryer I used a coil dryer that essentially burnt my hair.  There are 3 heat settings, a cool button and 3 air speeds.  I have used all the settings and speeds.  The variety allows me to easily use the dryer on my 4 year old&#x27;s hair when necessary without her complaining the air is too hot.  The dryer dries my hair extremely quickly and leaves it extremely shiny and healthy looking.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is the weight.  The wattage is great, and it does a terrific job drying my hair, but it is a little heavy.    I ordered the dryer and had it at my home within a week.  I had no issues with shipping or delivery.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I does not have enough power for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer.  Bought it for a Christmas gift for my daughter but I am taking it over.  It is soo light weight its crazy.  I love the grip on it with the handle kinda silicone/rubber really helps from slipping out of hands.  Since I usually have lotion or hair product on my palms when getting ready to blowdry my hair.  Love the click/press buttons/control on this for changing the speed and temperature vs most dryers that have the sliding type button/control.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  Does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> Works great...I use it almost every day</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for my daughter for her 17th birthday.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for travel.  She used it at the YMCA, church camp and of course at home.  It works great and she said it doesn&#x27;t make her hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> My wife  had bought a hair dryer and a local store and returned it because the attachments were so big. she returned it ordered this one from Amazon. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This product just blew me away.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I don&#x27;t have much hair, but its not what I got it for.  I got it to melt crayons.  HEY, don&#x27;t judge me... I like.. uh... hot art. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well built, did the job nicely.  It gets hot enough to melt crayons so I am going to guess that it should dry your hair and then some!</li>
            <li> Loving this hair dryer!  My hair dries so quickly using it.  The weight is light.  The color is eye catching.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in May of 2014 and it just shorted out.  Sparks began shooting from the cord at the base of the dryer.  I am not overly hard on the blow dryer and I do not use it everyday.  A blow dryer should last longer than a year!  Definitely a manufacturer&#x27;s hazard to be aware of before ordering.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece and she loves it. She is heavily influenced by looks first, which this has, but she said this is the best hair dryer she ever used. Usually theses things fail quickly after heavy use, but this one still is going strong.</li>
            <li> Perfect dryer for me, the high heat is plenty hot but doesnt scorch.  Lightweight and easy to operate onehanded with thumb while holding it.  Ceramic doesnt get too hot.  So glad i ignored those who said it wasnt hot enough.  Love this dryer for my long hair and the price was a fraction of what i expected to pay.</li>
            <li> Works well, nothing too special but I like it.</li>
            <li> Works great, I was surprised at how well considering how low cost it is. Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> This blowdryer gets super hot, but it doesn&#x27;t burn the hair. It blows strongly and has lots of different settings. The cord is pretty long. The color is nice and deep. Being the artsy type, I got this blowdryer in the mail and immediately opened it up to test not on my hair but on crayons. It melted them so well and so quickly! Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer.  It dries hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my old one broke and it&#x27;s a great replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on other dryers and realized that they had a problem with catching on fire or the handle heats up too fast. I finally came across this one and decided to buy it because it was a decent price and the reviews were pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 3 temperature settings and can be used on low or high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for what I paid :)</li>
            <li> It was good till it lasted for the year. Got the job done.</li>
            <li> As a hairdryer it works fine but the cord broke within a year of usage (copper wire became exposed and eventually separated). Not a well made product.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair, but it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;. I ended up purchasing a different hair dryer that works better. This is fine though. I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, so I don&#x27;t have a ton to dry. If you have thick hair, and it&#x27;s really long..you&#x27;ll be drying for a long time.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter she loves it!!</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer a few days ago and all I can say is what a big difference from my old one. First it is light weight and easy to use. Next, my hair has never been so frizz free. It looks healthier and fuller. One thing I saw in other comments was it drys your hair 2 times faster than non ceramic dryers. I did not find this too be true on my hair and I have thin thin hair. However you could keep it on one spot to dry without it burning your scalp. I love it.</li>
            <li> The plastic cracked by the on/off switch. Three days after our &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34; closed. We&#x27;ve only had the thing a little over a month. Really cheap.</li>
            <li> For some reason this hairdryer causes my hair to tangle while blow drying it. Other than that, its ok. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, says it dries faster but is less harsh then other dryers.</li>
            <li> perfect hair dryer, does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> I just love this dryer---sturdy and reliable.  It has the cool air setting, which is what I like to use.</li>
            <li> This dryer is lightweight and dries quickly without creating hair static. Love it! It has more than one heat setting which makes it nice for styling.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to purchase this hair dryer when it was on sale. I love the color and function of this product! There are three settings--cold, warm, and hot--that can be used with a low or high air speed. It dries my hair very quickly and has saved me a lot of time in the mornings!</li>
            <li> The attachment falls off easily, but other than that I like this hairblower.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I am crazy about this dryer, as it has a tendency to switch down to cool during use, due to the placement of the temp. control right where the user&#x27;s thumb tends to hit the handle.  I paid attention to what the other reviewers said about the electrical issues; that was my experience with a precursor to this model of the Revlon.  Bought the Spectrum MyBella Over the Cabinet Folding Dryer Holder from Amazon so I would not be hanging it by that loop, which is right adjacent to the cord strain relief.</li>
            <li> good appearance and good quality!</li>
            <li> This stopped working 10 months after I bought it. And I&#x27;m pretty easy on my blowdryers - using them 10 minutes every other day or less. Pretty frustrating that it couldn&#x27;t hold up. I have an old ConAir that has been working for over 10 years but it&#x27;s not the ceramic kind. Guess I need to stick to the ConAir brand.</li>
            <li> I had bought this Revlon hair dryer a couple of months ago and I must say that it works great.I think the price is right for this hair dryer.The heat setting&#x27;s work just fine, its light weight so your hand does not get tired.I bought it in purple a nniv d I must say the color is really nice.I would recommend this product for anyone, the price is right, not heavy, easy to use, and works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a birthday gift to my mom. Can&#x27;t really say too much about it other than that she says it&#x27;s a GREAT blow dryer and it works really well. She says it dries her hair really fast and she loves it. So far, no problems. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> shipped fast.  Works great.</li>
            <li> As expected from Revlon, this hairdryer is awesome! I bought this because I am moving from Malaysia to the US for my studies, and my girlfriend and I use this everyday and so far it has not shown any sign of tear and wear, and the air blown out is comfortable and there are various different settings. All in all, best dryer for this price.</li>
            <li> It stopped working in a week, very very cheap dryer. Its good price but doesnt last long like other dryers</li>
            <li> Power on blower was poor. The nozzle attachment keeps falling off. The blow dryer motor gets extremely hot making it difficult to hold the body of the blow dryer. This was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is awesome my daughter loved it for her new hair do. Made it look really good!</li>
            <li> It has been probably 10 years since I bought my last hairdryer, so I was due. This dries my hair quickly and it feels so soft afterwards. The con is that if feels a little heavy after a couple minutes. Maybe it&#x27;s from how I hold it.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it today (after 1.5 years of occasional use) as there were flames coming out of the wire...</li>
            <li> This is actually pretty loud, I think, but it does its job :) Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the cord getting frayed.</li>
            <li> My other hair dryer finally gave out (started blowing only cold air)...&lt;br /&gt;I was shopping around and this caught my eye first because of the color (purple is my favorite) - but then the reviews made me think seriously about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have used it now for a week - and I truly didn&#x27;t expect to notice a dramatic difference in that short of a time - but let me tell you, this is the best thing my hair has seen in many years.  I color my own hair, which dries it out a bit, and I have a real problem with fly-away hair right near my forehead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it and didn&#x27;t see any, I thought &amp;#34;Okay, wonderful, but probably a fluke.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!  My hair is now more sleek than it ever has been and no flyaways!  Just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already been complimented by my kids that my hair looks differenct and they asked if I used a straightener to get rid of the flyaways!  Nope - just this wonderful hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 50 - so I have been drying my hair for a very, very long time - and I&#x27;ll never go back to a non-ceramic hair dryer again!</li>
            <li> Purchased Revlon  Ionic dryer from Amazon,Its very good  and very simple to use in affordable price. Recomending for home purpose</li>
            <li> Its good! It doesn&#x27;t turn tricks but it does dry my hair and makes it very smooth. No frizz. Its just a blow dryer though. If you are someone who just wants their hair to look nice and be dry then this is the dryer for you. I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this hairdryer would have all the qualities I needed - 3 heat settings and 2 blow levels, plus ionic, ceramic, quiet and light.  It does.  Unfortunately, the low blow setting is not low enough, and the high heat setting not quite high enough.  I have medium-length, straight fine hair, and to give it any shape at all I need to curl it around a brush while drying.  If the force of the air is too strong, however, my hair just flies away, instead of shaping around the brush.  Why, oh, why, did Vidal Sassoon stop producing the perfect machine, &amp;#34;Answers,&amp;#34; which did indeed provide the answer to my needs?</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 12 yr old granddaughter for Christmas, purple is her favorite color.  Now she has her own and doesn&#x27;t have to use her mothers!</li>
            <li> Pretty good dryer love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The blow dryer did not work at all when it arrived hence the one star rating.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference in outcome between this and my old dryer, but it&#x27;s in an attractive color and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair dryer. It&#x27;s not heavy and perfect temperature settings. My favorite hair dryer in 30 years!!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review in the past, but I depend on them when making purchases so I figured I should give this product a quick review.  When my very favorite hair dryer died a year ago I thought I would treat myself to the best hair dryer my budget would allow.  I hate drying my hair because (even tough I have fairly thin hair) it always seems to take too long. So when I purchased my $85 hair dryer I figured my enjoyment level would go up.  I was SOOO wrong.  That stupid thing was way too hot and so loud that my dog and my baby would start to fret every time I used it.  It also fried just 1 year after I bought it.  So I wanted to go much cheaper with this purchase.  I bought this product really doubting that it would be (as previous reviews stated) quieter, less hot, and make your hair shinier.  But I just used it for the first time and I am in love!  It was all of these things and more (my hair actually dried faster with less heat).  I love that it doesn&#x27;t make me pour sweat and it just seems to give me more control over the hair drying process.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
            <li> Had  an Andis dryer for 10 years and it finally died. Picked this from the reviews and the price point. Works very well and would recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful (fast drying) as my old Vidal Sassoon dryer but this is o.k. and gets the job done.  I have thick hair and it takes a little longer to dry vs my old Vidal dryer.</li>
            <li> The best hair dryer for multiple heat and blow options</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This works well for an inexpensive hair dryer.  Is powerful, has high and low settings, as well as warm and cool settings.  My only complaint is that the nozzle attachment to direct the air flow does not fit snuggly and tends to fall off if you bump it when using (i.e., accidentally hit it on your round brush).  Also, fairly lightweight which is helpful when you have a lot of hair to dry.  I also like the cool air feature as it helps with smoothing hair at the end of styling.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product work well and it did not cost a fortune.  I was not too thrilled about it being purple, but for the price, I have gotten over it.</li>
            <li> This bow dryer is terrible.  It is less than a year old and the cord connecting it to the power plug is malfunctioning.  If i don&#x27;t hold the dryer perfectly straight it loses power and shuts off.  I guess this is what I get for buying a cheap dryer.</li>
            <li> I  love this hair dryer. I had stayed at some friends house and they had one very very similar and I loved it so when I found this one, had to get it. It works great and does just what I need it todo.</li>
            <li> my Wife and I both like it, it works great and we use multiple times a day&lt;br /&gt;my 2 kids also use everyday. its been 3 months now</li>
            <li> very happy with this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  (The first one broke after a couple of years.  But it was my fault.  Oops.)  This blowdryer works well.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> i wish hair dryers were smaller -- this one seems rather bulky, but it works perfectly! dries fast, attachments stay on well, and i have TONS of hair.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just be careful if you have long hair, as the &#x27;nose&#x27; is pretty long, and has caught my hair when I bend over to fluff-dry.</li>
            <li> I do like this dryer because it&#x27;s purple :) It also has many settings, and is Iconic and ceramic, which is better for hair. Some cons are that I notice my hair is very staticy after use, and the blow isn&#x27;t very forceful. But overall, a decent dryer and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t laugh but I bought this for my dog and he loves it!  After a bath he goes right over to where I plug it in and waits for me.  I use only the cooler setting which is great and the speeds work great.  Don&#x27;t really use the high setting but tested it on me and it works great also.&lt;br /&gt;A very good unit</li>
            <li> This hair dryer gets my thick mane dry in a quick manner.  I&#x27;ve had more powerful hair dryers but this defeinitely gets the job done better than any other druer I&#x27;ve owned.  Great value.</li>
            <li> This is the second hairdryer like this that I have bought. My first one has lasted years and I was so happy to be able to get another one like it.  It is very light weight and dries my hair fast on the low setting.  Truthfully, this is the only hairdryer that I ever want.  It is also very quiet.  I get up hours before my husband and this hairdryer doesn&#x27;t seem to bother him in the morning when I am drying my hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, who used it mostly every day for 11 months. Today she told me the cord caught fire where it joins up withe body of the unit.  Not good. The selling price was too cheap to have to pay for shipping back and forth for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I wanted a dryer that would be good value, but would also be good to use for my hair.  I like having the different settings for that purpose and that it is ceramic ionic.  It has been just that!</li>
            <li> Yep, same thing happened to me, too. The cord came loose from the bottom of the hairdryer and now it doesn&#x27;t stay on. It hasn&#x27;t caught on fire yet like several other reviewers mentioned, but I am throwing it away before it does. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace  a terrible Conair, which I only used for a month before I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I went back to my brand fave w Revlon. I&#x27;ve had a Revlon for 4 years and it suddenly shot sparks out of the cord while I was using it. I was so upset that I switched to another brand but was so disappointed w the results that I am back w a Revlon. They really are the best budget blow dryer. It is light and pretty quiet. Quiet, not silent. Don&#x27;t get confused. It has 2 heat settings, 2 speeds and the cool switch. Very easy to operate. What I love most about this dryer is how soft and beautiful it leaves my hair. It dries easily and quickly. I am Puerto Rican, Italian and Irish so my hair is curly, thin, wispy, prone to frizz. Love how sleek my hair looks and how easy it us to blow my hair out. The dryer gets very hot, hotter than the Conair. Very happy I replaced that horrible Conair replacement I bought and that I got it on sale.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer on fleek!!</li>
            <li> Amazing hair dryer for the price. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is actually only the 2nd blow dryer I have owned, and this revlon completely blew my other out of the water (no pun intended). My old one was a coil dryer that broke and damaged my hair and made me swear off blow dryers. The different heat setting and speed settings are amazing for my hair, the cool switch is pretty cool as well.&lt;br /&gt;There are only two problems I have with it:&lt;br /&gt;1. I wish it came with a diffuser and a comb attachment, that would be perfect, I would even spend more money for that.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes a while for it to cool down using the cool switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, LOVE this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> quick dry easy handling so much better then I thought</li>
            <li> got this for my granddaughter because she loved mine, and she is very happy with it</li>
            <li> The price was great and it works fine however the attachment falls off every single time I use it even though I make sure I put the attachment on firmly. So it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well :/</li>
            <li> Pretty goof power supply works exactly how its suppose to</li>
            <li> It does heat up and cool down nicely, but the top keeps falling off and it does not allow for applying pressure and thus, providing a quality blow-out.</li>
            <li> Works very well and dryer fast.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Dries fast &amp; is lightweight compared to my last dryer.  Great price too!!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I had intended to spend a lot more money on a dryer because I wanted something quiet and efficient and was tired of by old noisy dryer.  When reading different reviews of various dryers I came across this Revlon Rvdr5029 at such a reasonable price at Amazon.  The reviews were great so I decided that I had nothing to lose by trying it.  Well, to say that I am impressed is an understatement.  I can&#x27;t believe that such a great dryer cost me so little and I agree entirely with the great reviews I read.  I would highly recommend this dryer as a great buy.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she thinks it is great. I would suggest this one for anyone else based on price.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast, but doesn&#x27;t damage it.  I use it farther away from my head and in a sweeping motion on high to start with. It has good power, yet can turn on low and cool to finish styling.  I like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Good quality and nice price</li>
            <li> Great dryer, works well!</li>
            <li> Love it! This is a great dryer! I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks, but am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works amazingly on my children&#x27;s and my hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good price</li>
            <li> Picture shows a diffuser. Package came with no diffuser. That was the main reason I ordered this one. Not very happy. Will see if I can find a diffuser that will fit elsewhere. If not, going to have to return it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is attractive, not bulky, easy to use, and gets the job done.  Exactly what you need for a basic hair dryer.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Sleek design, three options for heat and speed, and not too pricey. It&#x27;ll definitely be with me for some time!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old worn out hair dryer.  This one works great and is not to noisy.  The price was terrific.</li>
            <li> Bought this primarily for the color, but it seems to actually make my hair nicer too compared to my old dryer.  My hair is very dry and damaged, but has looked and felt noticeable better (smoother, softer, straighter) since getting this hair dryer.  It also dries it a lot faster than my old hair dryer, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot (doesn&#x27;t burn my head).</li>
            <li> i was skeptical at first but the first time using i noticed that it&#x27;s light and quiet.  most of all, it really works well with my round brush and made my hair looks smooth and shiny.  the cold shop really works for me to set my hair.  i am very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Im Mexican with hair down to my mid back. My hair has always taken 45min minimum to blow dry. I was very skeptical about the ceramic ion concept but let me tell you..WOW!!!! I dried my hair in under 15 min and I was frizz free and I straightened it (my hair is wavy). I got sooo many compliments! Im in love with this dryer if it ever breaks I will reorder in a heartbeat. It came with the diffuser and arrived so much sooner. Im one very happy lady</li>
            <li> This is a nice Ironic Dryer. It is not expensive at all and also works perfectly.</li>
            <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, long cord. It is powerful, and air is consistently hot, but it could be a little bit more powerful. All in all, a good purchase for price paid. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected,  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I expected it to be as good as my last Revlon hair dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as the other one. Both have the&lt;br /&gt;same 1875 watts, so there shouldn&#x27;t be any difference. There is at least a 2 - 3  minute difference in drying time and this was&lt;br /&gt;noticed the first time I used it which was about a month ago. I usually stick with a brand name until I&#x27;ve had a disappointment,&lt;br /&gt;so next time I will be choosing a different maker.</li>
            <li> Very Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace by VS 1875 Ionic blow dryer.  I had it for many years and it did an excellent job.  In fact, 2 years ago when I dropped it and it cracked I just taged it together with packaging tape.  Well it was starting to cut out and the writing was on the wall that it was not going to last much longer.  After reading many reviews, this seemed like a decent replacement.  It is not.  It does an okay job.  On hot is is warm.  It does not blow as strong as the old VS 1875.  It takes me at least twice as long to dry my hair as the old dryer.  With 3 heat settings, I would expect the hot to be hot.  Wish I had selected something else.  It works about as well as a travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Received it on time. There&#x27;s not much to say except that it does what I need it to do, and it&#x27;s not too loud!</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer for the money. Nice quality and handle is comfortable to use. I like the Revlon name behind it too.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any problems. the only thing that i&#x27;m disappointed about is that it does not come with a curl diffuser, so this isn&#x27;t great if you have curls. it&#x27;s much better for straighter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise it is fine. i will update should i experience any problems in the near future.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new hair dryer to replace my old clunky one. This one is so suprisingly light it really shocked me.  It is very light and has hardly has any weight to it.  It also dried my hair twice as fast as my old one.  What use to take me 10 minutes now takes about 6. Maybe time will tell differently but for the week I have had it, I am very impressed with this dryer.  Anything that saves me time makes me very happy!  I highly recommend it.  If it should catch on fire in the future, I will let you know!</li>
            <li> It is OK for making your hair dry but it is not powerful enough to make it flat. My hair is wavy and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Light weight dryer.  Less noisy than the other unit I have. Dries hair quickly and has multiple settings to assist with styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...10/11/13....&lt;br /&gt;On Monday of this week I began to dry my hair and the dryer blew up!  Something inside broke within a minute of starting to dry my hair, loud noise, lots of smoke!  Thankfully there was no spark to set my hair on fire.  I have never dropped the unit and it has never been packed in a suit case to be bounced around.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth having to replace a unit every 6-7 months. Unfortunately the return period has ended and I will not be able to get my $ back or get a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Not too big so it is easy to store. Surprised it had so much power for being smaller but it definitely does. Good price.</li>
            <li> Love the difference it makes with my hair - fast delivery and great packaging. Not sure how the ceramic/ionic technology  works however my hair is softer.</li>
            <li> It actually friezes my hair even more, not what I expected from from an ionic hair dryer. like the settings, it gets supper hot, which I really need since my hair is thick, I can fry it fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to replace an older model that finally died on us,  she loves it,  would buy again.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I ever owned/used.  For many years purchased Conair, then switched to a Revlon Ionic that  I liked and lasted many years but the above item is so superior to the previously  owned Revlon. I do believe Revlon is the best manufacturer for hair dryers.  I received a purple one, color doesn&#x27;t matter, performance is what counts.  Hair dries quickly, I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time drying the hair.  This dryer makes it look fuller. Hope it last a long time, if not will only purchase this model again, and if it&#x27;s not available, I&#x27;m sure whatever Revlon makes will be fine and do a great job.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels nice and soft after using it. It works great and I never have any problems. Buy it</li>
            <li> It gets hot and blows hair around. Works for me. It&#x27;s lightweight and gets my hair dry in about 3 minutes, which is approximately 15 minutes less than my old one.</li>
            <li> Nice hairdryer. Can choose to cool down when temperature is too high.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say on this hairdryer that hasn&#x27;t already been said and I have only just taken it out of the box! Anyway I have had a play around with the settings and it seems to tick every box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight and good ergonomic design&lt;br /&gt;- Great price point&lt;br /&gt;- Circuit breaker&lt;br /&gt;- Blow dry attachment&lt;br /&gt;- 2 button settings for hot or cold and low and high&lt;br /&gt;- cooler button for finishing styles&lt;br /&gt;- ionic and ceramic so better for hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the narrow nozzle which will be better suited to fine hair (perfect for me) but I think those with thicker hair might want to get a slighter wider hairdryer for blow drying larger sections of hair at a time. I will also add a quick video review as I must have looked at at least 20 reviews on hairdryers and I think it is even more helpful.</li>
            <li> so good in fact that my daughter borrowed it, last I saw of it. It is working great for her, she has long beautiful hair and find this quiet, great power and loves the cool blast it set the curl.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer.  Bought it for my 14-year-old daughter who recently had her hair cut and likes to style it straight (she has wavy hair).  She uses it on the warm setting and it is hot.  It is powerful and dries her hair quickly.  She has really thick hair and this hair dryer does the job faster than the other dryers she&#x27;s used.  What I really like about this dryer is it leaves her hair looking smooth and shiny.  I&#x27;ve never experienced that with other dryers.  Definitely recommend this hair dryer if you are looking to straighten your hair with smooth, shiny results!</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quick, and I love the shine it leaves behind.  My old coil dryer is in the trash.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is amazing!!! I am so glad that I ordered this! I read multiple reviews and knew this was the blow dryer for me. I have belly button length hair and very thick and once I used this, I noticed results immediately!! My hair was smooth, shiny and not frizzy!! It was amazing! Now I look forward to blowing my hair dry! It really does everything it promises! So happy! Buy it!!</li>
            <li> great price for what I needed!</li>
            <li> Works great. Priced great! I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love how lightweight this is and that it heats up fast! I do not like that the controls are where you put your hand and go all the way down the handle. It makes the dryer hard to hold without switching the settings accidentally.</li>
            <li> gift. no complaints yet</li>
            <li> The plastic is extremely hot after I using it</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully for one year, and then it refused to stay hot for more than 45 second at a time. I do feel that I got $16 worth of success out of it, but it is frustrating to be shopping for a hairdryer again so soon.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this hair dryer because of the concentrator attachment, because that&#x27;s what my hair dresser uses when she styles my hair.  However, the attachment easily falls off the end of the hair dryer. It is useless for me, and I will go back to using my former hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a really great hair dryer. I used this as soon as it arrived. It dried my hair really quick and there are three level of wind to select. Love it!</li>
            <li> This would be a raving review if this hair dryer hadn&#x27;t completely crapped out in after a month.  My boyfriend got it for me as a birthday present and I used it maybe twice a week for a month before it stopped working.  I have no idea why it stopped working, I&#x27;ve pressed the reset button, there are no burning smells coming from the hair dryer, it just simply won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn hair.  Great price!  I like the three different heat settings and the three settings for pressure.</li>
            <li> OK dryer - nothing special - I wanted something more powerful and this did not do it.  And, this did not do anthing special for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  My hair dries quickly and is smooth and not frizzy.  There are many different settings to choose from and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer works great for the price.  I would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> works fine, not super powerfull airflow but price is unexpensive</li>
            <li> good things, it worth</li>
            <li> She loves this model hair dryer, however, the cord frays where it meets the unit. The copper becomes exposed, which is an obvious issue in a bathroom where there are wet hands all the time. Surprisingly, this was user serviceable. I was able to take the unit apart, cut the power cord, strip the new end and re-solder it in place, good as new, however, this isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened. The original unit I got, I just assumed wasn&#x27;t serviceable and bought a new one. So, the good news is, I can keep fixing the cord until it gets too short. The bad news is, eventually, I&#x27;ll run out of cord. I&#x27;d buy this again because she loves it, but I have another Revlon model that has a swivel built into the cord at the dryer body that&#x27;s lasted for longer than I can remember that I use all the time. If you&#x27;re handy, it doesn&#x27;t seem like such a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I like how this dryer works but it is DEFINITELY a fire hazard. Cord starts on fire after a few months! Very Disappointed:(</li>
            <li> Hi powered, easy to use.  Light weight.</li>
            <li> This is a standard hair dryer. It gets my hair dry. You can buy a comb attachment for it from your beauty supply store for cheap. I like the different settings but the only thing I have a problem with is where the settings are located because my fingers tend to change the settings while I am holding the dryer. I just switch it back and try to regroup my fingers but it dose not last. If it wasn&#x27;t for that issue, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Hair Dryer works as described.  Use it on my 3yo daugter&#x27;s hair from time to time and she doesnt complain as much as before with the normal electric coil hair dryer tha its TOO HOT!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it came in different color like Black or Grey, something not so girly like the Purple it comes in.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, well-made and quiet dryer.  The settings allow you to dry your hair with high heat on a low blow.  Usually, if you want high heat, other dryers blow on high also.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight hairdryer that would also dry my hair quickly.  Very pleased with this and it is also nice looking.  A very good buy indeed.</li>
            <li> It is really light weight and dries quick, it was a great buy and the color is pretty ,go get one!</li>
            <li> Good to change cool wind to warm wind.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s not as loud as many hair dryers and it works great.  I&#x27;ve been using for for a few months and it still works as good as it did in the beginning.  My hair, though, is not that hard to work with - medium thickness and very fine.  Love it, though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and I&#x27;m happy with it.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to blow as hard as my old one....although it has the same watt level.  It may be a change in technology that makes it quieter.  Either way, it does get the job done!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant when I purchased this because I&#x27;ve never used Revlon before and the price was too good to be true. But I am very happy with this blow dryer. Super lightweight and heats up pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer.  It has many settings, and dries my hair quickly.  Nice product for the money.  Glad I looked at the reviews..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great dryer - one odd thing - when the package arrived, there was a perfumy scent, not only on the outer box, but the box the dryer came in. The inner box was pretty beat up too, When I opened everything (everything was sealed in plastic), the perfum scent was even stronger - that scent is still there to this day. Since I like the dryer, I have just accepted the perfume. It&#x27;s not a bad scent. Just very strange... I would recommend this dryer - does exactly what it says it will do.. Just wish my arms were a little longer when I have the drying tip on.. lol..</li>
            <li> While I was pretty happy with this hair dryer for a while, it died at 7 months in.  A few weeks prior, it started making rattling noises, getting louder and louder, then softer and softer as the motor seemed to be dying.  Today, it was smelling like it might catch fire, so it&#x27;s done.  I used the hair dryer about 5 or 6 times a week for about 5 to 10 minutes a day.  Previous hair dryers have all lasted more than a year each, so I consider this one to have died quite prematurely.  I will not buy another.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this hairdryer, the reviews were mixed, but considering there were more good than bad and the price point was good, I decided to try it out.  For the first month or so there were no problems, it worked excellent.  After that though, I started to get a burning sensation in my hand while holding the handle.  The smooth part of the handle (the black part) does not seem to be heat resistant as it should be.  The handle heats up as the dryer heats up and will actually burn your hand depending on how long you have to dry your hair for.  It would take me several rounds to dry my hair due to this problem because the handle would become too hot to hold.  While the hairdryer works well on hair, the design needs to be inproved to make the handle heat resistant.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas to replace my old coil dryer. I immediately noticed a difference in my hair after using it. The old coil dryer left my hair a little frizzy. This dryer does not do that. It is also much quieter and dries my hair faster.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago and am very satisfied.  I like the heat settings and it dries fast and smoothes my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.  It&#x27;s better than the Conair one I just threw out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have expensive dryers to compare it to, but it&#x27;s the best dryer under $35 I have used. My hair seems to have more shine and the power is strong. My daughter used mine and noticed a difference, so I got her one too.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy is the best in my book and this hair dryer definitely falls into that category.  It&#x27;s easy to operate and dries your hair quickly.  It has three heat options (hot, warm, cool).  Mine is always set to \\&quot;hot\\&quot; since I&#x27;m in a hurry and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes (short hair).  I have used the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button and it works great!  My hair is soft and silky after drying and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry-out my hair like my last one did.  The description said the case was maroon but it is actually purple as in the picture.  I&#x27;ve only had it a month but would highly recommend to my friends!  Time will tell but I feel confident this will be a great dryer for years to come!!  Thanks Amazon for having this great product on your site!!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer a little over a year ago. This morning, it sparked and caught fire in my hands. Obviously, I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> A few month after I wrote the original review, I discovered that the product picture now is without the diffuser. The diffuser now is shown as a product that you can buy together. So the vendor addressed their problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---below original review ----&lt;br /&gt;There is no diffuser as shown in the product picture. Like another reviewer complained, I too ordered it because of the diffuser. For the price I paid, it just does not worth my time to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered why the vendor put up such a picture? The picture does not even come close to any of the pictures shown on the actual package.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by how powerful it is! It&#x27;s made my thick hair easier to blow dry, and I love the attachment.</li>
            <li> Love the hairdryer. It does its job and for the price its great. Also like the fact that it is not as noisy as its peers. Love the cool shot function to hold the look</li>
            <li> This is an impressive blow-dryer for a great price! It dos the job quickly and effectively; what more needs to be said!</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time of my old hairdryer, with seemingly less heat. Don&#x27;t know how that works, but it really does.</li>
            <li> i do not know a lot about hair dryers, this one seems to work well. i would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I have long hair so it can take a while for my hair to dry natural, so if I want to dry it fast, I have to use a dryer. With this, my hair was dry in less than 10 minutes, usually it would take 10 to 15 minutes to dry my hair with a dryer. I like the settings that you get with this. There is an off/low/high setting, cool/warm/hot setting, and a freeze setting (for an instant of cool air). If you do a lot of styling your hair, this would be the hair dryer for you with all the settings. It is a nice hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is lighter than my last one but it also has the different heat settings of Cool/Warm/Hot. The dryer also has high / low settings and a cool shot. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and now I want it.  It is light but powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer and I love the various heat settings. I bought it as a replacement for my previous Revlon dryer which lasted for several years with daily use. I loved that this one was ceramic and ionic for less than others with the same features.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in June 2013, started to pop my GFI breaker recently, and now has completly quit working as of today.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> This blowdryer worked pretty well, good heat levels, and strength and dried my hair pretty fast (but not as fast as I expected based on other reviews). Really no complaints, until it started sparking. I looked back in my Amazon orders to see when I purchased this, and it was exactly this day last year that it was shipped... though an inexpensive product, I would&#x27;ve hoped it would&#x27;ve lasted longer than 1 year.</li>
            <li> I have owned this hair dryer for a little over a year, it takes forever to dry my long thick hair and it gets really hot while you are drying your hair and now its shorting out! Looking for a new one!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she has been using it for 2 years. It&#x27;s very powerful so it can dry the hair within minutes. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer hoping for the best and i got more than that. This is the lightest, fastest dryer ive had in a while. If i could add more stars to this rating i would. And mine came with the diffuser in the picture. So far So GREAT!</li>
            <li> A great hair dryer with 3 heat settings and isn&#x27;t really loud.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister and he tells me it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li> This works as well as my old conventional dryer, and maybe a bit better. I&#x27;d say it dried my hair more quickly and I like that it has the different heat settings.</li>
            <li> Very low power. Eventually, it does get the job done. My daughter doesnt mind it, as it was a gift for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Died a couple months ago. not a good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It only lasted a few months</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. She had one for 5 years. It just died . So I bought her this one . Same model different color. She was happy with it and says it works good</li>
            <li> We bought this hair drier for our 2nd home. It gets used a frequently, and it gets the job done. I would not hesitate to purchase it again. It dries quickly and seems to be solidly built.</li>
            <li> this is a bit clumsy for me but it works well.  has a variety of settings and leaves hair dried but not dried out.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, powerful dryer. Love it!</li>
            <li> Light weight, dries my hair quickly, good value for the price.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most powerful and yet small hand dryers that I&#x27;ve had - and I had a couple of the years ...&lt;br /&gt;I just replaced my old one with this model and I&#x27;m really happy I did my hair is dry in a wiz!</li>
            <li> Horrible. Broke after a month.</li>
            <li> Update: This cheap hair dryer died after 6 months of on and off use. I don&#x27;t use it every day and the heat and air power were both low. Today I needed to use it and it does not function at all... Would not turn on. Total junk, will not buy another Revlon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hot enough. Doesn&#x27;t do anything in my hair, it&#x27;s like dry it with cold breeze.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, drys hair twice as fast as my old dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> bought this to dry our pomeranians after giving em baths. It works, has multiple speeds, the warm setting is perfect, and was super cheap. can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li> Suits my need to dry hair in summer and winter</li>
            <li> The colour is beautiful, the wind is strong,good quality</li>
            <li> The revlon blow dryer has a nice shiny color and works well.</li>
            <li> I love the hot, warm and cool, and the high and low settings on this hair dyer. It makes my hair dry faster. It is very light and the price was very worth it.</li>
            <li> This dryer worked well until it died, just 16 months after i bought it.  With some other reviewers saying theirs caught on fire, I noticed my cord is also damaged in the same spot.  I guess I am lucky mine didn&#x27;t catch fire. Don&#x27;t bother - it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and works great. it has all the functions I desired. The price is almost half I can get from Target.</li>
            <li> My old one died so this is an exact replacement. I am very happy with this hair drying. It isn&#x27;t real noisy and I like the hot, warm, and cool settings plus the high and low. Only thing I wish it did was fold so that it could fit better into my narrow bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> I have a Conair Ceramic Ionic Dryer that I love, but it&#x27;s quite heavy and larger than this one.  I saw this one at a great price and decided to check it out to have as a back-up dryer for traveling.  Hotels always have very basic dryers, and the ceramic ionic dryers are amazing at controlling frizz and making styling easier no matter where you travel.  This one did not disappoint, and it&#x27;s extremely lightweight.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This item was bought as a gift. As i dont ever use them all i can say is that its quieter than the one it replaced and felt solid in its construction.</li>
            <li> I dont seem to know much about these because I&#x27;ve never had one but I am beyond happy with this hair dryer - it does a great job at what it needs to dry! Not too hot, has more then one heat setting (Hot, warm and cool!) and over all its impressive.</li>
            <li> Finally, an inexpensive dryer that has a high fan + medium heat setting.  I want to dry my hair quickly, but high heat just doesn&#x27;t work for my baby fine hair.  My old dryers have had a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting, but cold air doesn&#x27;t do it either.  The focusing nozzle helps keep the air where you want it so you don&#x27;t over dry everything around the target area, and you can use high heat on low fan for setting roller styles, too.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! This is the second one I have bought. The first one stopped working after a year. It stopped getting hot. But when it did work, it worked well. It drys my hair very fast, and I have very long hair. Hopefully this one lasts longer than the last one.</li>
            <li> It is nice, I got it to leave at my daughter&#x27;s house - the price was right, it does the job and that is all I needed.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, it is so quiet and dries my hair in no time at all.  This is the hairdryer I have been waiting for all my life!!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus it doesn&#x27;t burn hair like the coil hairdryers.  My hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> my old faithful finally died and this works wonders and fast and so quiet  my sounded like a truck and the price was right too.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
            <li> The motor burned out on this after only 3 months use. I would not buy another one from this company.</li>
            <li> I used to hate drying my hair, but this goes fast on my fine, medium length hair. I had read all the reviews, and agree  that it is a good hairdryer for a good price</li>
            <li> The cool button is in a weird place right were you hold it so you end up hitting it accidentally. I thought the dryer was broken at first because it was just blowing cool air until I realized the problem. Also the attachment constantly falls off I&#x27;d return it if I hadn&#x27;t already thrown away the box.</li>
            <li> This product blows air - that is the extent of this product. All temperatures are luke warm and all speeds are very low.  It just doesn&#x27;t blow dry hair fast or efficiently.</li>
            <li> a blowdryer is a blowdryer but this one does not break down or burn anyone. the goils look gorgeous after they doll up with this revlon</li>
            <li> Finally, every day is a good hair day! Read and follow the helpful hints and you will love this hair dryer! It is lightweight too.</li>
            <li> i loove this hair dryer it&#x27;s so much better than the old one. i can&#x27;t wait to get a bath or shower so i can use it.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Item as described</li>
            <li> Works like a hair dryer should.  Handle doesn&#x27;t get hot.  Low cost and efficient.</li>
            <li> My daughter had continued to use my wife&#x27;s old hair dryer.  Now she has her own and she loves it and its features.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is exactly what I wanted and is affordable. I like that there are different heats and speeds.</li>
            <li> this is a gif for my wife idont have any troubles , i dont have more to say about this article</li>
            <li> I bought one for my oldest daughter for Christmas.  She loved it so much, we purchased an extra one for the house!  It dries hair faster with no frizzies!  Would definitely buy another one and probably will when my younger daughter starts college!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the perfect size and weigh,t and dries quickly. It is portable and can be taken on trips, if necessary. The ionic function is easy on hair and prevents &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; and split ends.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer. I like that it has a cool setting in addition to the cool shot button. Light-weight and dries my hair quick. Cool purple color too.</li>
            <li> I feel this dryer is OK. It does the job. Not as much power as I would like but the extra settings are nice.</li>
            <li> I bought these blow dryer after reading good reviews about this product. I must say, this blow dryer got the job done!! The blow dryer was hot and dried my hair in no more than 10 minutes, when it usually takes a lot longer for my hair to dry with other blow dryers. This is a great steal for the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my granddaughter,she loves the color.</li>
            <li> I loved it very much.. has all the features in the best price .. cold shot button, ionic and ceramic etc..etc.. its lightweight too.. dries hairs fast..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you must be thinking - then why 4 stars only.? its just because its too big in size.. hard to fix it in your dressing drawers.. otherwise works grt..</li>
            <li> This dryer does a really good job.  The real test is how long it lasts.  For the price, it is worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> This dryer works fine.  Nothing extraordinary but it does the job.  I would buy it again or give as a gift.</li>
            <li> There is no concentrator in my package! what&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> For anybody with extremely curly hair this is the best blow dryer, dries fast &amp; no frizz.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these dryers. The first one I owned lasted about two years before the motor sounded very rough and I began to be concerned about potential sparks. Compared to all other hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned this one lasted the longest and endured the most use. The product is lightweight and high powered. I also love that it comes with the direction attachment which is great for my short hair. For the price, I am extremely satisfied and with both purchases and when my second dryer gets burned out in a year and a half, I&#x27;ll purchase another without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Well, I just have short straight hair that I need to get dried in a short period of time each morning, so I&#x27;m not super-particular about blow dryers. I&#x27;ve been getting the cheapest one that does the job. This seemed like good value for the low price, so I&#x27;m happy. If you have hair that needs extra special care, you&#x27;ll need to read other reviews to see if this is the dryer for you.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer really is professional grade.  I said &amp;#34;my old blow dryer&#x27;s high is like my new one&#x27;s low&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit bummed that the dryer was purple and black and not this cute bubblegum pink and black.&lt;br /&gt;I love it though!</li>
            <li> Great product, my wife loves it and has been using it for more than a year now.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I&#x27;m used to, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Works very nice so far!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> it isnt loud so thats a plus but it doesnt get that hot</li>
            <li> It does what it show but it is certainly not for professionals. I am a black guy and it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> A very nice compact drier.&lt;br /&gt;Does not burn my scalp even on hot set. My dried hair is shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> this dryer works great!!  it dries my long thick hair in about 7 minutes. my old dryer took closer to 20 minutes. awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same hair dryer for a long time.  It just (after dropping it a time or two) started to make a weird noise.  So I&#x27;m ordering the very same thing again!  I like having the choices that the buttons provide.</li>
            <li> It does its job and unlike old style. Its wind is evenly and not over hot. Dry the hair very fast.</li>
            <li> I can only get cold air. The hot air stopped working a month and a half after I bought it. Of course it was after the return time frame.</li>
            <li> I like this product, my hair did not fall out as much as my old hair dryer, hope it last a while. I would recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> I have really crappy hair.  but i started to take an interest in how i looked.  I found this blow-dryer for a fabulous price, given it is ceramic and ionic--  This is a  10 start item!!  My hair is still crappy---but now it has blow dry body.  GREAT PICK.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve mostly used it on Hi/warm or Lo/Hot. Hi/Hot is just a little too much. On both Hi and Lo settings, the dryer remains quiet, which is a real bonus.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and dries my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Mine did come with the diffuser. It is not as loud as other hair dryers I have owned. I am very happy with the purchase and  the price on Amazon was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I am surprised how nice this hair dryer is.  There are setting for heat (hot, warm or cool), and blower settings (high or low), and a cool burst button.  The dryer is light weight and easy to handle when you are running late for work.  The price as very reasonable and the Prime delivery was fast like usual.  Very nice buying experience all the way around!</li>
            <li> LIght weight. Easy to manage and use the cold shot. I have short, fine hair and it works beautifully!! It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Updated Review - Dryer worked well.  Used almost daily and a little after a year&#x27;s use, the wires got a short and I could no longer use.  I won&#x27;t buy this model again.  My Original Review - Works well, is easy to handle.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the placement of the middle button, which controls the speed.  When drying my hair, I often hold the hair dryer in such a way that I hit that button and accidentally change the speed.  Not a big deal though.  I would buy this model again.</li>
            <li> when using this.  love it.  quieter than expected. excellent weight - I&#x27;m tiny.&lt;br /&gt;drys my fine shoulder length hair in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;lots of air and temp options.</li>
            <li> Ordered this in January, it&#x27;s been great... until today, when it just stopped working.  I&#x27;ve tried hitting the reset button until it clicks... but it doesn&#x27;t click, so I think that&#x27;s the problem.  It&#x27;s too late to return it to amazon, but I have the warranty information.  I can pay to mail it to the manufacturer, and send $5 to have it replaced. Well, by the time I do that, I will have bought the hair dryer twice.  I think I&#x27;m just going to go buy a new one (NOT Revlon brand.) Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer; noticed an improvement in my hair once I started using it.  Multiple settings make it flexible for use and it is excellent quality especially considering the fair price.  Recommended it to my cousin and she couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how much it did to de-frizz her hair when she used it.</li>
