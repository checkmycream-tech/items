            <li>love this perfume... wish i could by it in an easy open bottle</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great year round fragrance</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of yellow</li>
            <li>worth the price for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>it has been harder to find than it used to be and it is offered at a good price here.</li>
            <li>This is a hard to find product, they had it in stock, website was good to navigate, fast shipment, ok price.</li>
            <li>WOW THIS PERFUME IS SO STRONG</li>
            <li>Like the fragrance very much</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>and I get the same many compliments as I have over the years anytime</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for keeping DKNY perfume in stock!</li>
            <li>I ordered it recently and am in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li>Very clean light fragrance  (slightly floral and fruity)</li>
            <li>In past years I&#x27;ve been able to purchase duty free when traveling and have always planned to purchase a bottle each time I travel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is supposed to be clear...and its yellow, so I think its old.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and very well packed.</li>
            <li>THE SHIPPING WAS FAST AND</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not very expensive</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted this is hard to find.i will continueTo order in the future great product</li>
            <li>This smells very very green and refreshing!</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>A strong bite of citrus and that bite is pink pepper if you wondered...</li>
            <li>...hands down a very unique scent..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, different, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It smells similar, but not as fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as strong as I expected, doesn&#x27;t last  at all.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite &amp; its hard to find.</li>
            <li>I wish stores near me carried this</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this perfume since early 2000&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve missed DKNY so much that it definitely still works for me</li>
            <li>and i bought it as a present for somebody who really like it</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume, was hard to find for a while, but seems to have come back with new packaging.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of comments when I wear it because it is also a little more unusal than your average scent..</li>
            <li>During a recent trip I was disappointed to not find even in duty free and decided to check Amazon -- YEAH it was available.  </li>

            <li> however was told since 9/11 it was pulled from stores due to resembling a tower (not sure how true that is)</li>
            <li> Expecting to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Barely can smell it after a half an hour.</li>
            <li> As most review it&#x27;s almost impossible to find this fragrance in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s a bit masculine, at least for my taste.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also a tad bit stronger than I remember and unsure if this is due to age of bottle or something else.  </li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> I guess when I ordered this I was thinking that it would be a Dinky little bottle..</li>
            <li> A LITTLE</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I could still order this, since it is my go-to perfume, but I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I use it year &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> but when applied was too heavy</li>
            <li> I have worn it for years and absolutely never get tired of it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hard to find now in a lot of places</li>
            <li> fragrance is not what I expected at all !!!!!</li>
            <li> It was disappointing to receive the pack.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t ask for a change. :(</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume years ago, and was very disappointed that it was discontinued in the US.</li>

            <li> Classic fragrance. Been wearing for years. Very clean light fragrance  (slightly floral and fruity)</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of perfumes but never used them up until I found this one. This is my favorite and I always get compliments. I do not use anything else anymore. It is more of a summer fragrance but I use it year &#x27;round. Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> It was disappointing to receive the pack.The parfum it&#x27;s kind of yellow and the scent doesn&#x27;t last for ever, like all the DKNY bottles I used before. I received the package when my trip was getting to it&#x27;s end so I couldn&#x27;t ask for a change. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne and I am a male...hands down a very unique scent..everyone will ask you what is that your wearing? If you buy this...Beautiful scent...</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE, HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR YEARS AND HADN&#x27;T FOUND IT.  ARRIVED TODAY, EARLIER THAN EXPECTED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL BE ORDERING MORE THROUGH AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> I love the light citrus fragrance of this perfume.  It&#x27;s fresh, different, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I guess when I ordered this I was thinking that it would be a Dinky little bottle.. WHOA... Its not.. I LOVE IT!  Best VALUE!!!  I had origionally ordered this for a friends birthday but when I realized how BIG OF A BOTTLE it was I ordered her a 1.7 oz and I am keeping this one!  It is my FAVORITE Fragrance of all time!!!  I couldn;t find it for a while.. but then decided to check AMAZON out.. I am so HAPPY I did!!!  THANK YOU for the PROMPT DELIVERY and GREAT VALUE!</li>
            <li> The perfume was very fresh and of course I love it. I have worn it for years and absolutely never get tired of it.  It is such a beautiful scent.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> smells exactly how i remember it! and I&#x27;ve been using this for years! :)</li>
            <li> This is an okay fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t have great staying power. I also think it&#x27;s a bit masculine, at least for my taste. Would suggest passing on this one.</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrance of DKNY with Black Cashmere. Nice perfume. Hard to find.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and very well packed. the bottle is realy big but hey no complaints from the wife. She actualy loved it, and it smells realy nice.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance! I just love it! It is so gentle and refreshing! I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied!!! A big THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I like the soft, clean, and refreshing smell of this perfume. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone sneeze when I pass them by. This bottle is surprisingly big. I wish stores near me carried this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order the perfume online.</li>
            <li> This perfume is refreshing and ideal for warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts on your skin for hours and leaves a trace behind you that is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume since early 2000&#x27;s.  I have never been able to find a scent I love as much or one that even comes close.  I am constantly complimented on this scent.  I was able to purchase it at Macy&#x27;s however was told since 9/11 it was pulled from stores due to resembling a tower (not sure how true that is) but I can no only find on line.  Please don&#x27;t stop carrying this!  EVER!</li>
            <li> This is a must buy for the price and size. I ordered it &amp; didn&#x27;t realize I ordered the larger size. Great size &amp; a great fragrance. Heads will be turning when they get a smell of you when your wearing this.</li>
            <li> My scent, yep I am getting that age where I have a scent! Lol. Well if I was gonna have a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s this one! A strong bite of citrus and that bite is pink pepper if you wondered...I did. I love it, it&#x27;s a scent I haven&#x27;t found a doppelg&amp;auml;nger to yet. D&amp; G Light Blue is awesome too, it smells just like I Love Love though so it&#x27;s nit OOAK. This IS!!! So if you find a scent that smells like this, LET ME KNOW!! ;-)</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted this is hard to find.i will continueTo order in the future great product my wife love her some dkny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is supposed to be clear...and its yellow, so I think its old.  It smells similar, but not as fresh smelling.  I tried to return it, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns on liquids that can be hazardous and flammable.  Not cool.</li>
            <li> It was such a joy for me to find this perfume. Its my favorite &amp; its hard to find. Now I know where to get it &amp; its the actual perfume &amp; not a &#x27;knock off&#x27;. I am so pleased w Amazon&#x27;s pricing of it &amp; how quick it got to me.....</li>
            <li> I just love this DKNY fragrance and have been wearing it for years.The price was extremely perfect for the holidays.</li>
            <li> As most review it&#x27;s almost impossible to find this fragrance in the U.S.  In past years I&#x27;ve been able to purchase duty free when traveling and have always planned to purchase a bottle each time I travel.  During a recent trip I was disappointed to not find even in duty free and decided to check Amazon -- YEAH it was available.  There is a slight tinted color that I&#x27;ve not seen but packaging and etc. was great.  The fragrance is also a tad bit stronger than I remember and unsure if this is due to age of bottle or something else.  But I&#x27;ve missed DKNY so much that it definitely still works for me and I get the same many compliments as I have over the years anytime I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time was awesome -- I&#x27;m a Prime member and loved having in 2 days!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Always get compliments. Tried others but always go back to this! Love it!  Hard to find now in a lot of places, glad amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!!!!</li>
            <li> I agree with most reviews that this is a rare find! My favorite perfume in the 2000..fresh smelling not over powering! you&#x27;ll never regret buying it! Will definitely order again</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as strong as I expected, doesn&#x27;t last  at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light lovely fragrance that lasts all day it&#x27;s a great year round fragrance and it&#x27;s not very expensive</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product, they had it in stock, website was good to navigate, fast shipment, ok price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited this has returned. My &amp;#34;go to &amp;#34; fragrance is back! It is so fresh and clean. Fair price too.</li>
            <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Great size and price too.</li>

            <li> By far one of the best, freshest, colognes a person can wear any time of day irigardless the job or place one has to be...... LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, was hard to find for a while, but seems to have come back with new packaging. It&#x27;s great as ever, great price here (DKNY official website lists it for a much higher price), the scent hasn&#x27;t changed (not like the ones you get at discount stores where scents have expired), and it really is A LOT of perfume. Expecting to use it for a long time. It works for all seasons, but I find it particularly great for winter. Love the musky but cool scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite, very clean and refreshing lasting all day, everybody loves it specially my husband, I couldn&#x27;t find this perfume at the store</li>
            <li> Love it, been using this product for years,  Good price compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite scents.  After all these years I still get a ton of compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Description said light fragrance but when applied was too heavy&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is not what I expected at all !!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my best Friends favorite Perfume! She can&#x27;t get it at any retailers any longer! When I saw it on your site I got really excited! I am so happy to help a friend out and make her happy! Thank you so much for keeping DKNY perfume in stock! It smells so pretty!</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume years ago, and was very disappointed that it was discontinued in the US. I ordered it recently and am in love with it all over again. Everyone that smells it on me loves it too! I will buy it agaon, and again and again!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I could still order this, since it is my go-to perfume, but I was really disappointed.I remember this perfume lasting a lot longer than this does. Barely can smell it after a half an hour.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product. worth the price for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a good perfume and i bought it as a present for somebody who really like it she enjoys it</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto, estoy satisfecho con la compra y lo recomiendo. Buen envio y rapido vale lo que compre gracias</li>
            <li> love this perfume... wish i could by it in an easy open bottle</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Light fragrance. Not over powering. Like the fragrance very much</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume since it came out in 2000...it has been harder to find than it used to be and it is offered at a good price here. This smells very very green and refreshing! It is a great summer perfume..or because of it&#x27;s lasting power..I like it in the winter when I need a pick me up scent. I get a lot of comments when I wear it because it is also a little more unusal than your average scent..love it!!</li>
