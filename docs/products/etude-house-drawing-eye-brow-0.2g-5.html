            <li>Excellent price.</li>

            <li>Very lovely product.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love love love them...</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>I love Etude house products.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s very pigmented and smooth, easy to apply, and very good for its price.</li>
            <li>I use the grey and it is the perfect color</li>
            <li>easy to draw.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best value eye brow pencil for black hair.</li>
            <li>so that is good if you want the natural eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, it lasts forever and works perfectly with my very sparse brows and jet black hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I take back what I said, I was applying way too much, now that I lightly apply this on my brows, it looks great &amp; matches</li>
            <li>What is exciting is the free shipping.</li>
            <li>The brush was so useful.</li>
            <li>It gives a more natural and lighter tint.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and look natural.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, natural color</li>
            <li>I kept coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I think the grey brown would be more of a natural shade for me, which is what I&#x27;m thinking of buying right now.</li>
            <li>cheaply made and brush cover kept falling off so sent this item back</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and stays put all day long.</li>
            <li>I decided to go for this shade, #5 Grey because I didn&#x27;t want super in your face eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>The tip of the brow pencil has a triangular shape to it which makes it easier to draw in your brows and it gives you a very natural look.</li>
            <li>I previously used Anastasia products for my brows for the last few years--ETUDE&#x27;s brow pencil is far better quality and much more affordable.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if its just me, but this eyebrow pencil doesn&#x27;t look that natural on me.</li>
            <li>(I have super dark</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t it only takes 6 or 7 days to New Zealand!</li>
            <li>overall, the price is decent and the brow pencil works well.</li>
            <li>The grey color gives my thick, black eyebrows the perfect shape with out making appear overly dark.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try the Lioele eyebrow pencil but chose this cheaper option - No regrets!</li>
            <li>Theres only about an inch or two of product in this pencil, which for the price is adequate, and will last you for a little while with continued use.</li>
            <li>The spoolie kinda just grows on you, or is just stiff at first from unuse, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Texture seems right--not too dry or too soft.</li>
            <li>it gets a little bit cakey, which i really dont like.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

            <li> However, that was my mistake buying such a grey color for my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think this color makes me looks like a grandmother with grey eyebrows..</li>
            <li> Color is subtle and realistic.</li>

            <li> I like the grey color because its really hard to find grey color eyebrow product in the US</li>
            <li> want to buy dark brown soon.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t come out as harsh and dark as a pencil tool, and the other end has a brush that you can use to even out the color.</li>
            <li> However, I have black hair</li>
            <li> I use it when do not feel like to do heavy make up.</li>
            <li> One lasts me about 2 months if used everyday.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the cover falling off, like one person did.</li>
            <li> Not too hard, not too creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sometimes, if you accidentally go heavy handed it will look weird</li>
            <li> Applying this onto my brows just made me look angry - and quite scary, if I say so myself.</li>

            <li> The product is really good. I use it when do not feel like to do heavy make up. It is easy to apply and look natural. What is exciting is the free shipping. I couldn&#x27;t it only takes 6 or 7 days to New Zealand!</li>
            <li> Best eye brow shapes ever... Love love love them...</li>
            <li> Love it! easy to draw. Not too hard, not too creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy dark brown soon.</li>
            <li> Very lovely product. The brush was so useful. The grey color gives my thick, black eyebrows the perfect shape with out making appear overly dark. It gives a more natural and lighter tint. Sometimes, if you accidentally go heavy handed it will look weird</li>
            <li> I like the grey color because its really hard to find grey color eyebrow product in the US (I have super dark hair.)&lt;br /&gt;I like it and it is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem i have with it is, hmmm, i cant draw my eyebrow with it again and again in the same area coz it gets a little bit cakey, which i really dont like.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, the price is decent and the brow pencil works well.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural eyebrow pencil. It is not that pigmented - so that is good if you want the natural eyebrows. It blends well, after you draw in your eyebrows and want to blend it with the spoolie. The spoolie is quite hard, and stiff, at first. The spoolie kinda just grows on you, or is just stiff at first from unuse, I don&#x27;t know. Theres only about an inch or two of product in this pencil, which for the price is adequate, and will last you for a little while with continued use. The triangular tip, I personally think is a genuis idea. You can fill your brows in three different ways with that shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if its just me, but this eyebrow pencil doesn&#x27;t look that natural on me. I&#x27;m asian, and have black hair and the normal blackish-grey eyebrows. I decided to go for this shade, #5 Grey because I didn&#x27;t want super in your face eyebrows. Applying this onto my brows just made me look angry - and quite scary, if I say so myself. However, this is an amazing product despite me not liking the shade! I will repurchase this, but just not in this shade. I think the grey brown would be more of a natural shade for me, which is what I&#x27;m thinking of buying right now.</li>
            <li> This is the best brow pencil I have ever used. It goes on easily and stays put all day long. I use the grey and it is the perfect color</li>
            <li> Best value eye brow pencil for black hair. One lasts me about 2 months if used everyday. I kept coming back for more.</li>
            <li> cheaply made and brush cover kept falling off so sent this item back</li>
            <li> easy to apply, natural color</li>
            <li> The only eyebrow pencil I will buy. Satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service!  I previously used Anastasia products for my brows for the last few years--ETUDE&#x27;s brow pencil is far better quality and much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this over a regular eyeliner/eyebrow pencil. The color doesn&#x27;t come out as harsh and dark as a pencil tool, and the other end has a brush that you can use to even out the color. The color #5 (grey I think) works well with black hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s very pigmented and smooth, easy to apply, and very good for its price. However, I have black hair and I think this color makes me looks like a grandmother with grey eyebrows.. However, that was my mistake buying such a grey color for my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I take back what I said, I was applying way too much, now that I lightly apply this on my brows, it looks great &amp; matches well. I will definitely buy this again. Very good price.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try the Lioele eyebrow pencil but chose this cheaper option - No regrets! I absolutely love it, it lasts forever and works perfectly with my very sparse brows and jet black hair. HG.</li>
            <li> Color is subtle and realistic. Texture seems right--not too dry or too soft. Excellent price. I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the cover falling off, like one person did. I think maybe she got a lemon.</li>
            <li> I love Etude house products. The tip of the brow pencil has a triangular shape to it which makes it easier to draw in your brows and it gives you a very natural look. It doesn&#x60;t give you a lot of product, only about 2cm when you twist the product to its max.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow pencil that I can find in grey-brown color.  I love them.</li>
