            <li>If you can&#x27;t find it here, wahl does have a dealer locater on their site, and the listed dealers are very reputable.</li>

            <li>and I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>, it works well, and the battery life on it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice thing is (and this is why I bought it) if charge runs out, you can used it plugged in.  </li>
            <li>and they are nice as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer after seeing my stylist use it on my own hair.</li>
            <li>really liked it, but the charge stand was flimsy and was getting disconnected.</li>
            <li>Great product and great price, works perfect, very useful for trimming, recommended to me from a hair salon that uses this daily..</li>
            <li>I have had this for 4 weeks now and it runs great on the original charge.</li>
            <li>Excellent professional trimmers.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautiful, beautiful, beautiful and so quiet, but also high powered and they cut the nicest, cleanest lines.</li>
            <li>Works great and makes the closest trim I&#x27;ve ever gotten from trimmers, which is great on the back of a man&#x27;s neck.</li>
            <li>They would be way better if you could just put batteries in it.</li>
            <li>Take it from a barber who uses it many, many times a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these trimmers/edgers.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I just love this trimmer</li>
            <li>Overall a great purchase!</li>
            <li>used,,,,i love the idea that you can either use them wireless or use the plug to plug into the trimmers,,,oh</li>
            <li>I do have to say that I LOVE the way they work.  </li>
            <li>(A famous one believe it or not).  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m a guy that knows nothing about famous people hair salons, and</li>
            <li>They cost more, but you get what you pay for, and after all... that&#x27;s what dad&#x27;s are for.  </li>
            <li>ok just had to repalce the blade for sanitation purposes.</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many a mustache trimmer and couldn&#x27;t get the close lineup on my mustache like I would at the barber shop.</li>
            <li>Seems to keep its charge and love the wireless</li>
            <li>Love the charger.</li>
            <li>and I was impressed how quiet it was,</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>But this one does have better performance</li>
            <li>It was quiet and cordless and the quality of cut was excellent.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>We have a Shi-tzu who hates to be groomed because of the noise emitted by most dog clippers.</li>
            <li>but when it wore out I decided to get a better made, Made in USA trimmer.</li>
            <li>just appropriate aftershave (I use Nivea or Kiehl&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li>: they&#x27;re almost perfect, and I would definitely buy them again!</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I needed a good pair of edgers that cut cleanly and smoothly and don&#x27;t knick or pull on the hair.</li>
            <li>It cuts nice and clean.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try them out!</li>
            <li>The reviews posted about this trimmer are almost universally positive - with good reason.</li>
            <li>They fall out on the counter too easy.  </li>
            <li>Love that they are so quiet and do a great job.</li>
            <li>He loves the product - easy to use - works</li>
            <li>Trims the edges fine.  </li>
            <li>I love these trimmers they get super close</li>
            <li>WAY TO MUCH FOR SOMETHING CHEAP !!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was tiny, but my boyfriend said it has a great shape and also light weight.</li>
            <li>if you are doing primarily kids cuts these</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great and has quiet motor.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about this development as it means that I will have to devote more time to care and maintenance.</li>
            <li>fit this trimmer</li>
            <li>light.</li>
            <li>if you aren&#x27;t a professional I would recommend these, they are perfect and the price is really decent for such a good quality</li>
            <li>They have a long cordless span and great for detail work.</li>
            <li>It trims my beard great, and it holds its charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Works good, takes a second effort to get through the mustache</li>
            <li>and they are good to go for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair stylist of 8 yrs, I have many male clients and I love how close of a cut these get, They run quietly, light in weight.</li>
            <li>This trimmer plows through a full beard in under a minute.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this  trimmer is the best I have seen or used and is at a decent price point.</li>
            <li>all the girls have bought them in my shop due to jealously lol.</li>
            <li>Love my new, trimmers!</li>
            <li>so I get a lot of bold fades.</li>
            <li>Luckily you can just plug the trimmers in with out the port.</li>
            <li>my husband kind of made a mess of his goatee the first time he used it,  but has gotten much better!  </li>
            <li>This trimmer trims closely (1/16&amp;#34;), but still smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the research paid off, and as a gift for a busy, professional sculptor of rich and famous peoples hair, (my lovely daughter)</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer...</li>
            <li>It trims very close and precise.  </li>
            <li>lasts me an 8 hour shift at work without charging and is as powerful with or with out the cord plugged in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and fits my hand nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it works if I forget to put it on the charger for one day, unlike my last.</li>
            <li>Plugged them in to make sure charge worked and blue light came on.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say there any more powerful than the older designs so for the money, save it and get the older design.</li>
            <li>Most clippers are loud and rattle, the Wahl Sterling produces a very quiet, smooth, and muted humming sound.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very well made and it trims better than the Panasonic did even when new.</li>
            <li>They never nick, rarely get caught up in my beard, cut consistently, do the job with far fewer strokes/much more quickly than the Wahl Peanut or the Andis that I had been using, and one charge easily lasts through multiple clippings.</li>
            <li>I like them very much.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, and arrived on time and exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have the exact same pair and paud way more for them.</li>
            <li>It is the most quiet trimmer that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that these are the most quiet ones I have ever</li>
            <li>the only reason for loosing a star was because the metal used on these could be a bit more durable.</li>
            <li>I use my trimmers to fade and my clients love the close to skin feel and my trimmers last me all day without having to charge it until night time.</li>
            <li>This is a nice and quiet trimmer, but I regret not reading more carefully about the lack of guards.  </li>
            <li>I saw someone else had the same problem, they need to have better quality control.</li>
            <li>I wish I bought this one first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for all the dogs and it is first rate.</li>
            <li>Skip going to the store and go right to wahl&#x27;s online site, and you can find a whole line of trimmers like these to choose from.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, quiet, and easy to use</li>
            <li>That said, I must remember that they can get clogged up under the blade (which is easy to pop off for cleaning) and they need to be oiled occasionally...</li>
            <li>It holds a charge, can be used with the cord attached, you can charge it in the stand (included but not necessary), and the blue light is cool, too!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll absolutely adapt.</li>
            <li>these work very well</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that this stainless steel was produced in the USA?</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I just returned mine because its not that quite as it says, I stick with my peanut cuts much cleaner and much cheaper</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I finished trimming her whole body in about an hour</li>
            <li>really well - does not hurt his face or skin at all.</li>
            <li>dont look like they could handle much</li>
            <li>I like how quiet this trimmer is, it&#x27;s effective in smaller areas&amp;</li>
            <li>it arrived on time, it is sharp and very accurate.  </li>
            <li>Super clean, sharp, fast, light, and quiet.</li>
            <li>It runs very quiet but my problem is that after trimming my beard I still need a razor to clean up my Face.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I no longer need any special scrub prior to shaving (though I continue to use it to wash my face)</li>
            <li>Nice Close shave, no vibration and very little noise.</li>
            <li>I have had many issues with snags and power outs while trimming, but these do not bog down and do not snag.  </li>
            <li>you can get better trimmers for half the price.</li>
            <li>super quiet.</li>
            <li>Very quite and cut well,  would of have it five stars but the charge port does not work properly, had to sit on there just right to charge.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccomand.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>yes, I would recommend these for sure,,,,they are sharp so go easy on the necks</li>
            <li>So far a really like it.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to groom my dog&#x27;s face, he hates the normal dog grooming clippers.    </li>
            <li>good machine, came not complete, missing heads</li>
            <li>I am going to order another one right now as a gift for a friend with a dog and the same problem.</li>
            <li>Holy cow did they come quick!</li>
            <li>Cuts nice and short on my neck, no tug and pull, and is short enough to pull off the day old scruff look.</li>
            <li>I got a used one when it suppose to be brand new</li>
            <li>The difference lies in the lithium ion battery that the new sterling mag has.  </li>
            <li>Then plugged them in later and blue light wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li>As a professional hairstylist I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it loose a charge within the month of having it, it also cuts super close.</li>
            <li>I would gladly recommend this product to anyone with a small , non shedding dog.</li>
            <li>It looks sharp sitting by the sink, I really like the blue light.</li>
            <li>If you like the stubble look then this is fine but it will not clean shave.</li>
            <li>Super sharp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, a real gem.  </li>
            <li>chose this trimmer because the man who cuts my husband&#x27;s hair and grooms his facial hair uses it and the whole shop/salon recommends it.</li>
            <li>my wife is a professional hair stylist and she uses these in her shop</li>
            <li>I have 3 boys under 4 and their skin isn&#x27;t as forgiving as an adult.  </li>
            <li>though it would last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Finally found a pair of trimmers that work and is light enough for the type of work I do on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are not as quiet as them but very close.</li>
            <li>This battery will charge fast and last for days without recharging</li>
            <li>I am a professional hairdresser.</li>
            <li>My old one had a plastic kid to keep everything covered and in.  </li>
            <li>I have an old corded Wahl professional clipper.</li>
            <li>and they make a loud buzz....</li>
            <li>So I took a chance that because it was very quiet she might not mind so much.</li>
            <li>She is really sensitive to noise.</li>
            <li>I clip my beard because I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I got this for my son who has a lot of hair and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have yet to need to recharge it, after nearly two months of weekly use.</li>
            <li>In other words, it cuts better, faster, and longer, and isn&#x27;t as heavy in the hand as the older beret model.  </li>
            <li>They also seem to do better than the Oster trimmers for blending &amp; fading on smaller heads (as in small children).  </li>
            <li>(first the beret, then the mag), and he is only on his second pair.  </li>
            <li>I have bought nearly every trimmer on the market and will never buy anything other than the higher end Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li>If you are patient and willing to be careful because it cuts so well, I would recommend this trimmer for both humans and dogs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a full time barber with a heavy clientele</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and also went to the local beauty supply store to compare new ones thinking they were used.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that when you lift out the head to clean it, it&#x27;s a little challenging to get it back in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fine teeth, small profile, nearly silent AND Lithium ion.</li>
            <li>Charges fast, long lasting battery, and so lightweight</li>
            <li>So, I guess if you are doing only adult cuts professionally you might want something different, but</li>
            <li>These are quiet and don&#x27;t vibrate to loud.</li>
            <li>My old set would last 2 or 3.  </li>
            <li>After my old trimmer finally died I decided to try this one out after seeing my barber use it.</li>
            <li>These were purchased to replace a set of wahl beret trimmers that my husband owned for years, and are literally the same trimmer as the beret, as far as body style and blades are concerned.  </li>
            <li>Then come back to amazon, and find your trimmer, because wahl doesn&#x27;t sell direct from the webpage.</li>
            <li>Also be aware that the blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li>It provides a longer life at higher power with less weight.  </li>
            <li>This does make them extremely light weight, but a little less durable if you will be using them professionally.  </li>
            <li>started rusting very quickly in the area around the cutting blades, not even worth exchanging (I have no box and am heading overseas next week).</li>
            <li>My only complaint so far is that the trimmer head is not stainless steel and rusts easily.</li>

            <li> was a great price.</li>
            <li> Great price and well made.</li>
            <li> Great tool for work.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time and in great condition as well.</li>
            <li> works great</li>
            <li> It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great clipper.</li>
            <li> Very handy.</li>
            <li> Works amazing!</li>
            <li> Best on market I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many and these are the best!!</li>
            <li> The lithium-ion battery life is surprisingly good.  </li>
            <li> A good choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t find it here, wahl does have a dealer locater on their site, and the listed dealers are very reputable.</li>
            <li> Great size, shape and ok price.  </li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer for professional edging, great for home use.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer makes a beautiful, precise line.  </li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and I absolutely love these neck trimmers!</li>
            <li> and I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> , it works well, and the battery life on it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice thing is (and this is why I bought it) if charge runs out, you can used it plugged in.  </li>
            <li> and they are nice as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after seeing my stylist use it on my own hair.</li>
            <li> really liked it, but the charge stand was flimsy and was getting disconnected.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price, works perfect, very useful for trimming, recommended to me from a hair salon that uses this daily..</li>
            <li> I have had this for 4 weeks now and it runs great on the original charge.</li>
            <li> Excellent professional trimmers.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful, beautiful, beautiful and so quiet, but also high powered and they cut the nicest, cleanest lines.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes the closest trim I&#x27;ve ever gotten from trimmers, which is great on the back of a man&#x27;s neck.</li>
            <li> They would be way better if you could just put batteries in it.</li>
            <li> Take it from a barber who uses it many, many times a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these trimmers/edgers.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I just love this trimmer</li>
            <li> Overall a great purchase!</li>
            <li> used,,,,i love the idea that you can either use them wireless or use the plug to plug into the trimmers,,,oh</li>
            <li> I do have to say that I LOVE the way they work.  </li>
            <li> (A famous one believe it or not).  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m a guy that knows nothing about famous people hair salons, and</li>
            <li> They cost more, but you get what you pay for, and after all... that&#x27;s what dad&#x27;s are for.  </li>
            <li> ok just had to repalce the blade for sanitation purposes.</li>
            <li> It was ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many a mustache trimmer and couldn&#x27;t get the close lineup on my mustache like I would at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Seems to keep its charge and love the wireless</li>
            <li> Love the charger.</li>
            <li> and I was impressed how quiet it was,</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> But this one does have better performance</li>
            <li> It was quiet and cordless and the quality of cut was excellent.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> We have a Shi-tzu who hates to be groomed because of the noise emitted by most dog clippers.</li>
            <li> but when it wore out I decided to get a better made, Made in USA trimmer.</li>
            <li> just appropriate aftershave (I use Nivea or Kiehl&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li> : they&#x27;re almost perfect, and I would definitely buy them again!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I needed a good pair of edgers that cut cleanly and smoothly and don&#x27;t knick or pull on the hair.</li>
            <li> It cuts nice and clean.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to try them out!</li>
            <li> The reviews posted about this trimmer are almost universally positive - with good reason.</li>
            <li> They fall out on the counter too easy.  </li>
            <li> Love that they are so quiet and do a great job.</li>
            <li> He loves the product - easy to use - works</li>
            <li> Trims the edges fine.  </li>
            <li> I love these trimmers they get super close</li>
            <li> WAY TO MUCH FOR SOMETHING CHEAP !!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was tiny, but my boyfriend said it has a great shape and also light weight.</li>
            <li> if you are doing primarily kids cuts these</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and has quiet motor.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this development as it means that I will have to devote more time to care and maintenance.</li>
            <li> fit this trimmer</li>
            <li> light.</li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t a professional I would recommend these, they are perfect and the price is really decent for such a good quality</li>
            <li> They have a long cordless span and great for detail work.</li>
            <li> It trims my beard great, and it holds its charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works good, takes a second effort to get through the mustache</li>
            <li> and they are good to go for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist of 8 yrs, I have many male clients and I love how close of a cut these get, They run quietly, light in weight.</li>
            <li> This trimmer plows through a full beard in under a minute.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this  trimmer is the best I have seen or used and is at a decent price point.</li>
            <li> all the girls have bought them in my shop due to jealously lol.</li>
            <li> Love my new, trimmers!</li>
            <li> so I get a lot of bold fades.</li>
            <li> Luckily you can just plug the trimmers in with out the port.</li>
            <li> my husband kind of made a mess of his goatee the first time he used it,  but has gotten much better!  </li>
            <li> This trimmer trims closely (1/16&amp;#34;), but still smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the research paid off, and as a gift for a busy, professional sculptor of rich and famous peoples hair, (my lovely daughter)</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer...</li>
            <li> It trims very close and precise.  </li>
            <li> lasts me an 8 hour shift at work without charging and is as powerful with or with out the cord plugged in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and fits my hand nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it works if I forget to put it on the charger for one day, unlike my last.</li>
            <li> Plugged them in to make sure charge worked and blue light came on.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say there any more powerful than the older designs so for the money, save it and get the older design.</li>
            <li> Most clippers are loud and rattle, the Wahl Sterling produces a very quiet, smooth, and muted humming sound.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very well made and it trims better than the Panasonic did even when new.</li>
            <li> They never nick, rarely get caught up in my beard, cut consistently, do the job with far fewer strokes/much more quickly than the Wahl Peanut or the Andis that I had been using, and one charge easily lasts through multiple clippings.</li>
            <li> I like them very much.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, and arrived on time and exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have the exact same pair and paud way more for them.</li>
            <li> It is the most quiet trimmer that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that these are the most quiet ones I have ever</li>
            <li> the only reason for loosing a star was because the metal used on these could be a bit more durable.</li>
            <li> I use my trimmers to fade and my clients love the close to skin feel and my trimmers last me all day without having to charge it until night time.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and quiet trimmer, but I regret not reading more carefully about the lack of guards.  </li>
            <li> I saw someone else had the same problem, they need to have better quality control.</li>
            <li> I wish I bought this one first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for all the dogs and it is first rate.</li>
            <li> Skip going to the store and go right to wahl&#x27;s online site, and you can find a whole line of trimmers like these to choose from.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, quiet, and easy to use</li>
            <li> That said, I must remember that they can get clogged up under the blade (which is easy to pop off for cleaning) and they need to be oiled occasionally...</li>
            <li> It holds a charge, can be used with the cord attached, you can charge it in the stand (included but not necessary), and the blue light is cool, too!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll absolutely adapt.</li>
            <li> these work very well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this stainless steel was produced in the USA?</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I just returned mine because its not that quite as it says, I stick with my peanut cuts much cleaner and much cheaper</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I finished trimming her whole body in about an hour</li>
            <li> really well - does not hurt his face or skin at all.</li>
            <li> dont look like they could handle much</li>
            <li> I like how quiet this trimmer is, it&#x27;s effective in smaller areas&amp;</li>
            <li> it arrived on time, it is sharp and very accurate.  </li>
            <li> Super clean, sharp, fast, light, and quiet.</li>
            <li> It runs very quiet but my problem is that after trimming my beard I still need a razor to clean up my Face.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I no longer need any special scrub prior to shaving (though I continue to use it to wash my face)</li>
            <li> Nice Close shave, no vibration and very little noise.</li>
            <li> I have had many issues with snags and power outs while trimming, but these do not bog down and do not snag.  </li>
            <li> you can get better trimmers for half the price.</li>
            <li> super quiet.</li>
            <li> Very quite and cut well,  would of have it five stars but the charge port does not work properly, had to sit on there just right to charge.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Would highly reccomand.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> yes, I would recommend these for sure,,,,they are sharp so go easy on the necks</li>
            <li> So far a really like it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to groom my dog&#x27;s face, he hates the normal dog grooming clippers.    </li>
            <li> good machine, came not complete, missing heads</li>
            <li> I am going to order another one right now as a gift for a friend with a dog and the same problem.</li>
            <li> Holy cow did they come quick!</li>
            <li> Cuts nice and short on my neck, no tug and pull, and is short enough to pull off the day old scruff look.</li>
            <li> I got a used one when it suppose to be brand new</li>
            <li> The difference lies in the lithium ion battery that the new sterling mag has.  </li>
            <li> Then plugged them in later and blue light wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li> As a professional hairstylist I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it loose a charge within the month of having it, it also cuts super close.</li>
            <li> I would gladly recommend this product to anyone with a small , non shedding dog.</li>
            <li> It looks sharp sitting by the sink, I really like the blue light.</li>
            <li> If you like the stubble look then this is fine but it will not clean shave.</li>
            <li> Super sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, a real gem.  </li>
            <li> chose this trimmer because the man who cuts my husband&#x27;s hair and grooms his facial hair uses it and the whole shop/salon recommends it.</li>
            <li> my wife is a professional hair stylist and she uses these in her shop</li>
            <li> I have 3 boys under 4 and their skin isn&#x27;t as forgiving as an adult.  </li>
            <li> though it would last much longer.  </li>
            <li> Finally found a pair of trimmers that work and is light enough for the type of work I do on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not as quiet as them but very close.</li>
            <li> This battery will charge fast and last for days without recharging</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairdresser.</li>
            <li> My old one had a plastic kid to keep everything covered and in.  </li>
            <li> I have an old corded Wahl professional clipper.</li>
            <li> and they make a loud buzz....</li>
            <li> So I took a chance that because it was very quiet she might not mind so much.</li>
            <li> She is really sensitive to noise.</li>
            <li> I clip my beard because I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who has a lot of hair and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have yet to need to recharge it, after nearly two months of weekly use.</li>
            <li> In other words, it cuts better, faster, and longer, and isn&#x27;t as heavy in the hand as the older beret model.  </li>
            <li> They also seem to do better than the Oster trimmers for blending &amp; fading on smaller heads (as in small children).  </li>
            <li> (first the beret, then the mag), and he is only on his second pair.  </li>
            <li> I have bought nearly every trimmer on the market and will never buy anything other than the higher end Wahl trimmer.  </li>
            <li> If you are patient and willing to be careful because it cuts so well, I would recommend this trimmer for both humans and dogs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a full time barber with a heavy clientele</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and also went to the local beauty supply store to compare new ones thinking they were used.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you lift out the head to clean it, it&#x27;s a little challenging to get it back in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fine teeth, small profile, nearly silent AND Lithium ion.</li>
            <li> Charges fast, long lasting battery, and so lightweight</li>
            <li> So, I guess if you are doing only adult cuts professionally you might want something different, but</li>
            <li> These are quiet and don&#x27;t vibrate to loud.</li>
            <li> My old set would last 2 or 3.  </li>
            <li> After my old trimmer finally died I decided to try this one out after seeing my barber use it.</li>
            <li> These were purchased to replace a set of wahl beret trimmers that my husband owned for years, and are literally the same trimmer as the beret, as far as body style and blades are concerned.  </li>
            <li> Then come back to amazon, and find your trimmer, because wahl doesn&#x27;t sell direct from the webpage.</li>
            <li> Also be aware that the blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> It provides a longer life at higher power with less weight.  </li>
            <li> This does make them extremely light weight, but a little less durable if you will be using them professionally.  </li>
            <li> started rusting very quickly in the area around the cutting blades, not even worth exchanging (I have no box and am heading overseas next week).</li>
            <li> My only complaint so far is that the trimmer head is not stainless steel and rusts easily.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I&#x27;ve experienced with them is that they can be fully charged and sit unused for a couple days and be dead when I go to use them again.</li>
            <li> They cut extremely close and yet are delicate enough to clean up my 2 year olds neck line without leaving a single mark.  </li>
            <li> Part of wahl&#x27;s pro line, these trimmers have fully replaceable blades (about $15 after shipping, also on amazon), give a sharp trim line for the goatee lover, are easy to handle, lightweight, rechargeable, and really tough.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried several other models and brands, both dog and human.</li>
            <li> I have been a hair dresser for a long long time</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> The blades are replaceable, as mentioned, but they DO stay sharp for quite a long time before they even need replaced.  </li>
            <li> Effective and close cutting, but i am not real happy with the battery life.  </li>
            <li> The big problem was the  battery, less and less time between charges and eventually...</li>
            <li> Cordless, small, and very Quiet...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because when cleaning up the hairline on children they get scared with other trimmers I used in the pass.</li>
            <li> It is small, quiet</li>
            <li> sharp too, never have any pulling with these.</li>
            <li> so I needed to be very careful not to trim too close to her skin.</li>
            <li> They are thin enough to use a regular comb for blending rather than a clipper comb.  </li>
            <li> I use them on a average of 10-15 times per week and charge them once a week.</li>
            <li> They hold a charge for a long time and the charging dock is small and compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space at my station.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I have an average of 25 clients per week and about half of them are men.</li>
            <li> half a dozen times now and still have not had to recharge.  </li>
            <li> maybe one and half shaves before it dies.  </li>
            <li> Coton de tulear and very active.</li>
            <li> Only complaint the base for it is cheap looking but does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> My only complaint- the holder for the different ends is sloppy.  </li>
            <li> It shaves my beard stubble closer then any other trimmer I have used in the past and is half the size.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little heavier than what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had trouble with other trimmers biting the skin once in a while</li>
            <li> Just go slowly and carefully.  </li>
            <li> and it saves me a few bucks when I go see my barber.</li>
            <li> If I were to make a suggestion to the manufacturers, I would request that they embed some rubber strips on the side to make it less slippery, but that&#x27;s just small change.  </li>
            <li> I really can not say this is a bad product.</li>
            <li> They all have small dents &amp; scratches on them.  </li>
            <li> and she was unbelievably cooperative.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what happened...when I opened them they looked used.</li>
            <li> Not sure why these are called trimmers.</li>
            <li> For Sterling 2 Peanut Neo Beret.&amp;#34; I have had other trimmers that worked but failed down the road.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> If the battery keeps the charge the way it&#x27;s supposed to, I&#x27;ll have this for at least five years...</li>
            <li> After my shave I pop the cutting head off and rinse it under water, shake it out and leave it to dry.</li>
            <li> I have had it bite a few people but nothing big, just annoying.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair with wahl products for 21 years, and they have never let me down.  </li>

            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who cuts hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few years ago and they really suck. If you lose the cord you out 60 dollars. They would be way better if you could just put batteries in it. This is coming from someone been doing men hair 10 plus years at a salon.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer for professional edging, great for home use.  This trimmer makes a beautiful, precise line.  It&#x27;s quiet, a real gem.  If I were to make a suggestion to the manufacturers, I would request that they embed some rubber strips on the side to make it less slippery, but that&#x27;s just small change.  It&#x27;s a great trimmer.  Take it from a barber who uses it many, many times a day.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time, it is sharp and very accurate.  my husband kind of made a mess of his goatee the first time he used it,  but has gotten much better!  Just go slowly and carefully.  Also be aware that the blades are very sharp.  My only complaint is that when you lift out the head to clean it, it&#x27;s a little challenging to get it back in.&lt;br /&gt;We chose this trimmer because the man who cuts my husband&#x27;s hair and grooms his facial hair uses it and the whole shop/salon recommends it.</li>
            <li> Excellent professional trimmers.  They have a long cordless span and great for detail work.</li>
            <li> This clipper is great.  I ordered it because another reviewer said it was so quiet he could clip his dog&#x27;s fur.  He wasn&#x27;t kidding.  I have used it on my pooch and my husband.  It works like a charm!  Lightweight, quiet, and easy to use</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard and it works incredibly well. After buying multiple trimmers, this has lasted and continues to impress. Cuts nice and short on my neck, no tug and pull, and is short enough to pull off the day old scruff look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and this is the best pair of trimmers ever. My second pair. Very quiet kids don&#x27;t mind it. Works great and close as you can get to the skin compares to a #00000 blade. all the girls have bought them in my shop due to jealously lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sterling 4 cordless trimmers for the last two years. They died on me two days ago and after some research I ordered these babies. Holy cow did they come quick! Two days and they arrived at my house and I was so excited to try them out! Needless to say I was NOT disappointed. They are incredible. They&#x27;re a little heavier than what I&#x27;m used to but I&#x27;ll absolutely adapt. They&#x27;re beautiful, beautiful, beautiful and so quiet, but also high powered and they cut the nicest, cleanest lines. As a professional hairstylist I highly recommend these. I&#x27;m absolutely in love.</li>
            <li> Cordless, small, and very Quiet... Just what I needed to groom my dog&#x27;s face, he hates the normal dog grooming clippers.    Exactly what I needed, and arrived on time and exactly as promised.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and I absolutely love these neck trimmers! They are affordable I have the exact same pair and paud way more for them. I would definitely order from this seller again and I might just get another pair just as a back up. I would highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Trimmers work well but get almost to close and cause razor burn. I wouldn&#x27;t say there any more powerful than the older designs so for the money, save it and get the older design. But as for the trimmers them self. Battery life is great  lasts me an 8 hour shift at work without charging and is as powerful with or with out the cord plugged in</li>
            <li> Works good, takes a second effort to get through the mustache but I still like it. It looks sharp sitting by the sink, I really like the blue light.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these trimmers/edgers.  I work at a great clips and do 15-20 mens haircuts a DAY.  I charge them overnight and they are good to go for the entire day.  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I just love this trimmer</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great. Nice Close shave, no vibration and very little noise. It should be noted in the seller&#x27;s description that this is a corded or none corded usable trimmer. That makes a big difference if the battery runs out in the middle of a cut. It should also be noted that It may appear as though there is hair on the trimmer when you take it out of the package. The seller has a assured me that this is some type of cloth used for testing purposes at the factory. I examined it with a jewelers lens and it is not hair.</li>
            <li> Best bet in the trimmer world. Lightweight but with the precision you are looking for. You will find this item tone a five star!!!</li>
            <li> Great machine.  Charge lasts all day  Very quiet and nice close cutting.  Would highly reccomand.  Great for mustch and  And beards.</li>
            <li> This trimmer trims closely (1/16&amp;#34;), but still smoothly.  It is the most quiet trimmer that I have ever owned.  The lithium-ion battery life is surprisingly good.  And, the exterior finish of the trimmer is really attractive.  The reviews posted about this trimmer are almost universally positive - with good reason.</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers they get super close and they are very quiet I have used penuts, wahl detailers, babyliss cordless trimmer none of these even compare to the mags I work with seven lady&#x27;s and 5 I them use these trimmers!!!!! Great great great product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A good choice.&lt;br /&gt;It was tiny, but my boyfriend said it has a great shape and also light weight. Very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist of 8 yrs, I have many male clients and I love how close of a cut these get, They run quietly, light in weight. Only complaint the base for it is cheap looking but does it&#x27;s job. Overall a great purchase!</li>
            <li> these trimmers are the BOMB!!  I have been a hair dresser for a long long time and I have to say that these are the most quiet ones I have ever used,,,,i love the idea that you can either use them wireless or use the plug to plug into the trimmers,,,oh yes, I would recommend these for sure,,,,they are sharp so go easy on the necks</li>
            <li> these work very well my wife is a professional hair stylist and she uses these in her shop and I use them to cut my hair  bald</li>
            <li> Best on market I love it I use it daily</li>
            <li> When I received these they had dents &amp; scratches on them.  I contacted the seller and also went to the local beauty supply store to compare new ones thinking they were used.  They all looked the same.  They all have small dents &amp; scratches on them.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because they use sheets of metal for the case instead of them being die cast.  This does make them extremely light weight, but a little less durable if you will be using them professionally.  I do have to say that I LOVE the way they work.  They cut extremely close and yet are delicate enough to clean up my 2 year olds neck line without leaving a single mark.  I have always used Oster clippers but they were not doing the job on my kids.  I have 3 boys under 4 and their skin isn&#x27;t as forgiving as an adult.  They also seem to do better than the Oster trimmers for blending &amp; fading on smaller heads (as in small children).  They are thin enough to use a regular comb for blending rather than a clipper comb.  So, I guess if you are doing only adult cuts professionally you might want something different, but if you are doing primarily kids cuts these are the best I&#x27;ve found &amp; the only reason for loosing a star was because the metal used on these could be a bit more durable.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a beard trimmer.  You can tell it is a solid product.  I&#x27;ve used it half a dozen times now and still have not had to recharge.  Nice thing is (and this is why I bought it) if charge runs out, you can used it plugged in.  A lot of these cordless ones don&#x27;t work that way.</li>
            <li> I really can not say this is a bad product. It runs very quiet but my problem is that after trimming my beard I still need a razor to clean up my Face. If you like the stubble look then this is fine but it will not clean shave. You still need your razor!!</li>
            <li> Bought these as a present for my daughter, who works in a uppity Nashville salon. (A famous one believe it or not).  She was really happy to get them and uses them throughout the day with almost every client she seats.  I did a lot of research before I decided on the Wahl brand because A: I&#x27;m a guy that knows nothing about famous people hair salons, and B: I&#x27;m a guy.  Anyway, the research paid off, and as a gift for a busy, professional sculptor of rich and famous peoples hair, (my lovely daughter) they are perfect.  They cost more, but you get what you pay for, and after all... that&#x27;s what dad&#x27;s are for.  Right?</li>
            <li> I work at sport clips and my store is by a military base so I get a lot of bold fades. I use my trimmers to fade and my clients love the close to skin feel and my trimmers last me all day without having to charge it until night time. Best thing I have purchased!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because when cleaning up the hairline on children they get scared with other trimmers I used in the pass. These are quiet and don&#x27;t vibrate to loud. I recommend these for stylist who need help trimming childrens hair lines. The only problem with these trimmers is when you need to replace the recharge cord. It&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> I like how quiet this trimmer is, it&#x27;s effective in smaller areas&amp; it being cordless, makes it convenient for me.it was a great price.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my pup&#x27;s pads. It&#x27;s quiet and fits my hand nicely. She is a 9lb. Coton de tulear and very active. I would gladly recommend this product to anyone with a small , non shedding dog.</li>
            <li> The blade had rust spots on it but trimmer works ok just had to repalce the blade for sanitation purposes.</li>
            <li> Also hates water. started rusting very quickly in the area around the cutting blades, not even worth exchanging (I have no box and am heading overseas next week). I can&#x27;t believe that this stainless steel was produced in the USA?</li>
            <li> It was ok.  Trims the edges fine.  Leaves a lot of stubble.  For this price I would have hoped it would have incorporated a mullilevel beard trimming capability Please let me know if you found this review helpful.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and has quiet motor. I use them on a average of 10-15 times per week and charge them once a week. I like the case it comes in as well. In the past I&#x27;ve had trouble with other trimmers biting the skin once in a while and these do not do that. So overall I would recommend them to anyone needing reliable trimmers!</li>
            <li> These are the best trimmers. I&#x27;ve had many and these are the best!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many a mustache trimmer and couldn&#x27;t get the close lineup on my mustache like I would at the barber shop. I asked my barber what he used to line up my facial hair and he uses this model. It gets the job done so well and it saves me a few bucks when I go see my barber.</li>
            <li> Love my new, trimmers! Very quite and cut well,  would of have it five stars but the charge port does not work properly, had to sit on there just right to charge.  Luckily you can just plug the trimmers in with out the port.</li>
            <li> Effective and close cutting, but i am not real happy with the battery life.  I use these for shaving my head.  I though it would last much longer.  I can get through one maybe one and half shaves before it dies.  My old set would last 2 or 3.  They are built sturdy and are very quiet.  I accidentally left them in the shower on the tub edge for about 3 weeks and the blade did rust.  One feature i did like was that you can run them while plugged in, some rechargeable clippers don&#x27;t do that.  If you can get them for 25 dollars or les or are using them to shave your beard, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Finally found a pair of trimmers that work and is light enough for the type of work I do on a daily basis. Seems to keep its charge and love the wireless</li>
            <li> This is a nice and quiet trimmer, but I regret not reading more carefully about the lack of guards.  I will take resposibility for that one though and not fault them.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer.  I have bought nearly every trimmer on the market and will never buy anything other than the higher end Wahl trimmer.  It trims very close and precise.  This trimmer plows through a full beard in under a minute.  I am a weekend warrior so kill the beard every month.  I have had many issues with snags and power outs while trimming, but these do not bog down and do not snag.  I bought  the Wahl comb kit with these and they are nice as well.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer had rust on it and just doesn&#x27;t cut close . WAY TO MUCH FOR SOMETHING CHEAP !! you can get better trimmers for half the price.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes the closest trim I&#x27;ve ever gotten from trimmers, which is great on the back of a man&#x27;s neck. The only bad thing I&#x27;ve experienced with them is that they can be fully charged and sit unused for a couple days and be dead when I go to use them again.</li>
            <li> Love the charger. Automatic. Super sharp. Buy it with the &amp;#34;Wahl Comb Kit For Sterling 2 Peanut Neo Beret.&amp;#34; I have had other trimmers that worked but failed down the road. Remington that the batteries failed and are not replaceable. This on can be. My barber uses this one.</li>
            <li> After my old trimmer finally died I decided to try this one out after seeing my barber use it. So far a really like it. It shaves my beard stubble closer then any other trimmer I have used in the past and is half the size. My only complaint so far is that the trimmer head is not stainless steel and rusts easily. After my shave I pop the cutting head off and rinse it under water, shake it out and leave it to dry. After a couple of days I noticed that rust has formed under the teeth. I am not crazy about this development as it means that I will have to devote more time to care and maintenance. As a result, I only gave the product 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that this  trimmer is the best I have seen or used and is at a decent price point.</li>
            <li> It cuts nice and clean. It reminds me of the wella contura  trimmers I had for about 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;They are not as quiet as them but very close. I&#x27;ve been using them about 2 months. I like them very much.</li>
            <li> Just received Trimmer and everything, nothing was wrapped in plastic and parts were rolling around in box there was hair around the trimmer with Fingerprints and it looked used. I saw someone else had the same problem, they need to have better quality control. Just requested refund.</li>
            <li> Super clean, sharp, fast, light, and quiet. Great price and well made. This battery will charge fast and last for days without recharging</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this trimmer and I was impressed how quiet it was, so I got one for myself.  I love it.  It holds a charge, can be used with the cord attached, you can charge it in the stand (included but not necessary), and the blue light is cool, too!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great tool for work.</li>
            <li> It trims my beard great, and it holds its charge for a long time. It&#x27;s nice that it works if I forget to put it on the charger for one day, unlike my last.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairdresser. I have an average of 25 clients per week and about half of them are men. I needed a good pair of edgers that cut cleanly and smoothly and don&#x27;t knick or pull on the hair. These are amazing. They are like butter.&lt;br /&gt;Super quiet and lightweight. They hold a charge for a long time and the charging dock is small and compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space at my station.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you aren&#x27;t a professional I would recommend these, they are perfect and the price is really decent for such a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time and in great condition as well.</li>
            <li> I just returned mine because its not that quite as it says, I stick with my peanut cuts much cleaner and much cheaper</li>
            <li> Great product and great price, works perfect, very useful for trimming, recommended to me from a hair salon that uses this daily.. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer...I wish I bought this one first&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly and as described&lt;br /&gt;Have used this for over a year...works great</li>
            <li> I got a used one when it suppose to be brand new I don&#x27;t know how and I can&#x27;t return it because I gave it as a gift before my friend said it was used I got it one time with the box but there was hair</li>
            <li> It does a great job. My only complaint- the holder for the different ends is sloppy.  They fall out on the counter too easy.  My old one had a plastic kid to keep everything covered and in.  But this one does have better performance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Contura trimmer for years - for me...and for my dogs. It was quiet and cordless and the quality of cut was excellent. The big problem was the  battery, less and less time between charges and eventually...zippo. I bought a few other trimmers with horrible results. I have an old corded Wahl professional clipper. They are indestructible....but there&#x27;s the issue with the cord and they make a loud buzz....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took a chance and bought this Wahl trimmer. Fine teeth, small profile, nearly silent AND Lithium ion. I&#x27;ve been using it for all the dogs and it is first rate. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase. If the battery keeps the charge the way it&#x27;s supposed to, I&#x27;ll have this for at least five years...</li>
            <li> good machine, came not complete, missing heads</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after seeing my stylist use it on my own hair. We have a Shi-tzu who hates to be groomed because of the noise emitted by most dog clippers. So I took a chance that because it was very quiet she might not mind so much. I finished trimming her whole body in about an hour and she was unbelievably cooperative. There are no comb attachments so I needed to be very careful not to trim too close to her skin. If you are patient and willing to be careful because it cuts so well, I would recommend this trimmer for both humans and dogs.  i don&#x27;t understand the complaints about running time and battery life. I ran this one about an hour and 45 minutes and it still had power left. This is the best trimmer I have ever used and I have tried several other models and brands, both dog and human. I am going to order another one right now as a gift for a friend with a dog and the same problem. I also don&#x27;t understand complaints that it is not quiet. Most clippers are loud and rattle, the Wahl Sterling produces a very quiet, smooth, and muted humming sound.</li>
            <li> I have used a Panasonic beard trimmer for several years. It worked well enough but when it wore out I decided to get a better made, Made in USA trimmer. After reading reviews on Amazon I decided on this model. I called up Wahl and found out that the Peanut combs (also USA made) fit this trimmer so I ordered a set of those also. The trimmer is very well made and it trims better than the Panasonic did even when new. Since I am only an occasional user this trimmer will probably last just about forever. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> really liked it, but the charge stand was flimsy and was getting disconnected. super quiet. light. kids don&#x27;t even know what hit them..</li>
            <li> Not really sure what happened...when I opened them they looked used. Plugged them in to make sure charge worked and blue light came on. Then plugged them in later and blue light wouldn&#x27;t come on. Started to use them and it shut off. Returning and really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sleek, quiet, well made. Great clipper. Not sure why these are called trimmers. I use them to fully groom my yorkie baby. She is really sensitive to noise. Love that they are so quiet and do a great job.Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works amazing! Charges fast, long lasting battery, and so lightweight</li>
            <li> *Updated* I clip my beard because I have extremely sensitive skin. I have used them for a couple of years now and still think that they are the best I have used! I experience virtually no irritation. They never nick, rarely get caught up in my beard, cut consistently, do the job with far fewer strokes/much more quickly than the Wahl Peanut or the Andis that I had been using, and one charge easily lasts through multiple clippings. Moreover, I no longer need any special scrub prior to shaving (though I continue to use it to wash my face) just appropriate aftershave (I use Nivea or Kiehl&#x27;s.) That said, I must remember that they can get clogged up under the blade (which is easy to pop off for cleaning) and they need to be oiled occasionally... Bottom line: they&#x27;re almost perfect, and I would definitely buy them again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who has a lot of hair and has sensitive skin. He loves the product - easy to use - works really well - does not hurt his face or skin at all.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. It is small, quiet, it works well, and the battery life on it is amazing. I have yet to need to recharge it, after nearly two months of weekly use. I finally had to charge it, as I need it for a trip I&#x27;m going on. The instructions say that it will trim, while being charged also. Highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Part of wahl&#x27;s pro line, these trimmers have fully replaceable blades (about $15 after shipping, also on amazon), give a sharp trim line for the goatee lover, are easy to handle, lightweight, rechargeable, and really tough.  These were purchased to replace a set of wahl beret trimmers that my husband owned for years, and are literally the same trimmer as the beret, as far as body style and blades are concerned.  The difference lies in the lithium ion battery that the new sterling mag has.  It provides a longer life at higher power with less weight.  In other words, it cuts better, faster, and longer, and isn&#x27;t as heavy in the hand as the older beret model.  The blades are replaceable, as mentioned, but they DO stay sharp for quite a long time before they even need replaced.  THESE ARE WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!! I have been cutting hair with wahl products for 21 years, and they have never let me down.  My husband has been using these trimmers exclusively for close to 10 years (first the beret, then the mag), and he is only on his second pair.  THESE LAST EVEN WITH DAILY USE IF YOU KEEP THE BATTERY CHARGED!! Skip going to the store and go right to wahl&#x27;s online site, and you can find a whole line of trimmers like these to choose from.  Then come back to amazon, and find your trimmer, because wahl doesn&#x27;t sell direct from the webpage. If you can&#x27;t find it here, wahl does have a dealer locater on their site, and the listed dealers are very reputable.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  Great size, shape and ok price.  I wish it came with a travel pouch.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 4 weeks now and it runs great on the original charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a full time barber with a heavy clientele and I love this trimmer! I haven&#x27;t had it loose a charge within the month of having it, it also cuts super close. I have had it bite a few people but nothing big, just annoying. Bottom line I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> These clippers are great.&lt;br /&gt;They dont look like they could handle much but they can handle anything&lt;br /&gt;you throw at them.&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp too, never have any pulling with these.</li>
