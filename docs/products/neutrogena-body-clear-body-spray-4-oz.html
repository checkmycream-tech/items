            <li>It is a good product.  </li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be good to inhale this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smell good, feels good, but i didn&#x27;t notice any difference in what they claimed would do to your blemish</li>
            <li>I used this for a good two weeks</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the spray method, it&#x27;s convenient.</li>
            <li>I had some kind of reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>“I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.”</li>
            <li>and I liked it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews about this.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and quite effective!</li>
            <li>Sprays easily and non-sticky and hasn&#x27;t stained clothes, and smells pleasant, etc.  </li>
            <li>This spray is awesome and it does not irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>If you are self-conscious about shoulder blemishes, use this AMAZING spray, and you&#x27;ll feel (and look) so much better.</li>
            <li>It (mostly) sprays in every direction and is somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>This works great for my back, it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin any irritation, it dries quickly, and smells wonderful</li>
            <li>but i was happy trying this out because it really does work!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll give it one more shot</li>
            <li>the body wash i use is the panoxyl 10&amp; benzyl peroxide foaming wash:)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>She and I are extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s 40% better.</li>
            <li>but this stuff made me break out more than ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve all but disappeared and I still use it on him from time to time to make sure.</li>
            <li>His skin is better than ever.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>well I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My break-outs have mostly cleared up, but I still have some problems.  </li>
            <li>: I can safely say i&#x27;ve been using the body was for over 2 months.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Now I feel more confident wearing backless dress :)</li>
            <li>Over packaged for sure.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Since using this product I have for you sure had a reduction in body acne.</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff for back acne.  </li>
            <li>This product, like many others, may work for some, but not all.</li>
            <li>More scaring than pimples.</li>
            <li>but I am glad that there are products out there like this Body Spray from Neutrogena that helps me control and get rid of it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, as a sceptic, wasn&#x27;t sure it would work,  but looking for a easier solution then having my girlfriend wash her hands and rub clearasil on my back every day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>say, although i cant speak for everyone, however it does work better then most of the products i have tried:)</li>
            <li>I used it every day for 6-months leading up to the wedding and the skin on my back/chest never looked better.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok too.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t bleach clothes and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and for the most part the 360-spray claim holds up until the product line reaches the end of the spray hose.</li>
            <li>the smell is not bad, not like some astringents that smell very strongly.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for targeting  any body acne, and it covers a wide area.</li>
            <li>Dries out the back real nice</li>
            <li>*wish i could easily find it in stores</li>
            <li>the acne on my back has greatly reduced in size and are much more spread out.  </li>
            <li>The spray is easy to use and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Strong citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>The product doesnt have a strong smell, so I can wear it during the day.  </li>
            <li>It really does spray at any angle which is great and makes it so easy to use right after a shower.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday I love how it sprays upside down best product ever especially great for people who workout and sweat</li>
            <li>The smell is like most cleaner products, and its not bad.</li>
            <li>And nothing is more attractive than a girl wearing a tank top with a pimple or two revealed on her back, right?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this because i read some encouraging reviews and they were accurate.</li>
            <li>The body wash works great, and seems like it will last longer.</li>
            <li>Works great for blemishes on your chest, shoulders, back, ect.</li>
            <li>By the end of week three, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  </li>
            <li>and I spray a light layer (2x/day).</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant smell and lasts a long time -- you don&#x27;t need much to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>but it is so much more manageable right now.</li>
            <li>I promise it works, I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li>it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Wash your sheets and blankets every 2 weeks, clean towels, spray this stuff on..</li>
            <li>This smells fresh, sprays on easily, has a 360 spray ability.</li>
            <li>I like that the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Spray has a nice light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>good for back breakouts.  </li>
            <li>but it does seem like the acne looks lighter, but the fact that the amount of acne on my body nearly doubled after using this is kind of upsetting.</li>
            <li>Just spray this on and it clears up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It dries really quickly as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from mild bacne ever since I was maybe 13</li>
            <li>After I stopped using it though, that luckily went away and so did the discoloration.</li>
            <li>Sprays well, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and use this regularly now.</li>
            <li>if you have light acne then this would work other wise get the maximum strength</li>
            <li>The upside down pray head works great</li>
            <li>Not totally gone but pretty good improvement.</li>
            <li>ive ever been able to use anything on my back because this makes it so easy to get coverage wherever you need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great item for my little one.</li>
            <li>This works great and has the exact active ingredient as proactive body lotion but about $15 cheaper.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light and drys fast...</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t magically clear up the acne on my back/chest, but it did seem to prevent more.</li>
            <li>but there are so many good reviews that I want to at least try it.</li>
            <li>The 360 sprayer works like it&#x27;s supposed to, which is really handy because I used it on my back.</li>
            <li>The only thing I worry about while using it is that I am spraying a kind of an acid solution on my skin and</li>
            <li>have been trying to switch from chemical based ingredients to more natural ingredients, but I am not going to be too picky considering this has 0.5% Salicylic Acid,</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly, I put it on in the bathroom</li>
            <li>but I ran out pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I got it, I delved right in with using it three times a day and never had an adverse reaction.</li>
            <li>He is an athlete and the spray has not discolored his clothing but he does not apply the spray RIGHT BEFORE working out.</li>
            <li>It is okay to use, but I would recommend it only as a quick aid, for instance on holidays.</li>
            <li>This spray is great, really helped clear my back from acne and even tinea versicolor.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great if its used daily in conjunction with an exfoliant in the shower prior to use.</li>
            <li>I live in the south where its hot most of the year, and I find that I easily break out on my chest and back because I&#x27;m always sweating.</li>
            <li>I did not use it more than once daily</li>
            <li>I have a pretty stubborn pimples on my face, and Neutrogena products don&#x27;t help them.</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I picked out the Neutrogena spray after considering several options and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution to an uncomfortable problem.</li>
            <li>I have problems with more severe acne on my back</li>
            <li>and it had worded pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love this product and if you have the same problem give this product a try!</li>
            <li>Anyways I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;d get better results if I used it constantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it and within the first two weeks I haven&#x27;t had a break out</li>
            <li>After the first week of using this product twice a day (morning and night)</li>
            <li>(I wouldn&#x27;t want to), but this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>Its designed well and its the first time</li>
            <li>well, Its hasnt helped in comparison to like when im able to run alcohol and zit cream on my back.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, since most products have a tendency to stain clothes or severely dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at the drug store because I seen the positive comments on here.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical about the 0.5% Salicylic acid content vs the 2% of most other products I&#x27;ve tried, but I must say I&#x27;m really impressed.  </li>
            <li>It helps clear up back acne and is very very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but now it is super clear like I have never had a problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a strong alcohol smell for a second, but it did not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a single back-zit since I started using it about 6 weeks ago, and at this point, I am absolutely sure it&#x27;s not luck</li>
            <li>If a large pimple occurs you may need a drying benzoyl peroxide cream or a sulphur mask to use as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>nd wear a loose fitting shirt then repeat at night.</li>
            <li>The absolute best aspect of this product is that the sprayer works upside down so you can spray any part of your back without breaking your arm and throwing out your back.  </li>
            <li>I had not tried much really.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Much easier than trying to apply products by hand.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t tried much product</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a scent-</li>
            <li>it all evaporates fast</li>
            <li>Does what it says it does and FAST.</li>
            <li>This body spray has helped so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to shower in the morning, or after getting sweaty walking around school and work, and this spray is a real lifesaver for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>so I give it a try since the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>But fast delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li>It really really works.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really mind that now that I see it works</li>
            <li>This is a very convient product to use.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy film and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful is acne and doesn&#x27;t harm the skin</li>
            <li>The spray mist is very light, so you don&#x27;t get very wet or too straight of a spray.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice, fine, even mist and it is very easy to spray your back, which can otherwise be hard to get with other non-spray acne products.</li>
            <li>It just kind of makes my skin stiff if I don&#x27;t apply lotion with.  </li>
            <li>Works great, just at 10$ for such a small bottle...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s, and have had acne pretty much all of my life.</li>
            <li>I just wish it came in a bigger bottle (minus one star for that), but you can&#x27;t have everything, and I&#x27;m otherwise very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used it in the past and didn&#x27;t think it was that great, but after several years I decided to give it another shot</li>
            <li>It works pretty much anywhere you want to have clear skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure skipped days here and there, but I expected a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Avoid tight fitting clothing nd if your a girl try not to wear your bra too much..</li>
            <li>Great for hard to reach spots like back</li>
            <li>I feel like I have less body breakouts for sure.</li>
            <li>I have already bought a second bottle as it runs out quickly, but it works.</li>
            <li>The cost is decent for a product that works.</li>
            <li>I used this product once and all I can remember is that it ended up making my arms super red and blotchy</li>
            <li>It was the only thing that helped my body acne while I was pregnant and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky</li>
            <li>I wish they would advertize this more as it was only sheer luck</li>
            <li>I use it religiously after every shower and it dries quick, without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>If possible lol or at least a sports bra</li>
            <li>I can certainly imagine after the bottle reaches empty point, that there will be a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I will say, the first couple of days after using it, I did get some big honking pimples, as some people have complained, but I persisted in using it to give it a fair chance of working.</li>
            <li>I have horomone problems (high testorone)</li>
            <li>i rated this high because it does the job, but the smell makes me cough when it&#x27;s suspended in the air.</li>
            <li>When I got this I had been using a clean and clear spot treatment on my back</li>
            <li>I guess its normal for neutrogena stuff.</li>
            <li>He has gotten this rash and since he&#x27;s in preschool, it was kind of common, according to his doctor.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me break out any more than usual but the blemishes that I already had didn&#x27;t really go away...</li>
            <li>Will try a few more days and review again</li>
            <li>It sprays upside down and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I go to the gym a lot and live in Florida, so the sweat assists in sporadic breakouts.</li>
            <li>This ingredient soaks into your skin to unclog pores, treat existing and prevent new acne from occurring.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it brought out more acne and it looks a little worse now.</li>
            <li>you are looking for something to clear up your acne on your back/ chest though, look up Glytone Spray too!</li>
            <li>and now it is almost completely clear!  </li>
            <li>After a week of once a day use of this clear body spray it is almost all gone!</li>
            <li>This product does what it is suppose to, it is suppose to clear acne off the body!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Grapefruit Oil-Free Acne Face Wash/Scrub &amp; Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner!).</li>
            <li>While you could use some other salicylic acid toner, this is so much more convenient, because you can simply spray it on (it sprays at all angles).</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for the first several months after each shower.  </li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t red or really colored at all!  </li>
            <li>It actually worked really well!</li>
            <li>I have determined that I have sensitive and oily skin which is quite the combo!</li>
            <li>He applies it after his nightly shower and puts on a clean, WHITE, cotton undershirt to sleep in and he wears one underneath his regular school clothing but not underneath his Under Armour heat/cold gear apparel or his Nike compression athletic shirts that he changes into during the day for weight training, baseball practice and gym</li>
            <li>it keeps ur back clear!!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry or tight feeling at all which is also nice.</li>
            <li>Shower daily and ALWAYS put on a clean shirt, never one you&#x27;ve worn previously without washing it first.</li>
            <li>I really needed something to control all the new breakouts I am getting on my back</li>
            <li>Just spray a few times and you will see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This is a must in my post-shower routine to keep my chest clear.</li>
            <li>Also no worries about staining your  clothes it goes on clear and dries clear with no residue.</li>
            <li>It has really helped keep her back clear.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin beautifully clear.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to clear my dreaded backne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost clear now.</li>
            <li>Sprays well with all angles and clear up acne.</li>
            <li>This helped clear it up within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>It doesnt magically clear your skin in  days like alot of the reviews</li>
            <li>This stuff seemed to clear it up if used diligently.</li>
            <li>i like what I see so far.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I have very problematic skin on my back and shoulders, and this is the only product that really helped.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s been 3 days so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it so far for almost a week</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was so self conscious</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t done much for me, but I don&#x27;t use it religiously.</li>
            <li>and I break out on my back and shoulders, and it&#x27;s very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>even those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I do not have sensitive skin by any means.</li>
            <li>By the end of week two, my back feels a lot smoother, looks much healthier and acne has continued to decline.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps my back acne.</li>
            <li>I would say overall, this is a good but not great product.</li>
            <li>it is easy to apply and it sprays upside down when I flip it over to spray my back.  </li>
            <li>I used this pretty regularly for a few weeks leading up to a special event and it definitely did the trick.</li>
            <li>I recently started a new birth control and</li>
            <li>The first in a long line of products I&#x27;ve tried that actually worked.</li>
            <li>I love this spray, its very hard to find though</li>
            <li>and my back is completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I broke out on my back from some medication and couldn&#x27;t get it to clear up.</li>
            <li>After years of researching how to clear up acne, specifically back acne, I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bugs me is that it doesnt spray very well when there&#x27;s only about a quarter of the liquid left.  </li>
            <li>Only 0.5% salicylic acid, does not work nearly as well as the product I was using that had 2%.  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought it, I sprayed everywhere and all over until my back was wet</li>
            <li>It took forever for my skin to calm down again, and this product definitely helped.</li>
            <li>I mainly suffer from acne on my face, but I will occasionally get some body acne on my shoulders, chest or back, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>This started to clear my back up within 3 days now its two weeks later and my back has not been this clear in 5 years</li>
            <li>Ive even tried other medications and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>it has cleared up the back acne and kept it clear of all but the occasional spot.</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s not a good idea for long term usage.</li>
            <li>The spray pump really does work upside down too.</li>
            <li>I use it along with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash in Pink Grapefruit and together my acne majorly cleared up.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the reviews that said it may take a bit to see results because the first few days I didn&#x27;t see any but after using it only once a day for a week I started to see improvement</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3 star because it pretty much didn&#x27;t do anything and in fact made it worse?</li>
            <li>Overall, this has some pretty good customer reviews, so I though I&#x27;d give it a try, despite the few horror stories I&#x27;d read from the bad reviews.</li>
            <li>I have had 0 new breakouts using this product, and it is not sticky upon application, which was a big concern with other products.  </li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be good to inhale this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smell good, feels good, but i didn&#x27;t notice any difference in what they claimed would do to your blemish</li>
            <li> I used this for a good two weeks</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked the spray method, it&#x27;s convenient.</li>
            <li> I had some kind of reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> “I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.”</li>
            <li> and I liked it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews about this.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and quite effective!</li>
            <li> Sprays easily and non-sticky and hasn&#x27;t stained clothes, and smells pleasant, etc.  </li>
            <li> This spray is awesome and it does not irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> If you are self-conscious about shoulder blemishes, use this AMAZING spray, and you&#x27;ll feel (and look) so much better.</li>
            <li> It (mostly) sprays in every direction and is somewhat effective.</li>
            <li> This works great for my back, it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin any irritation, it dries quickly, and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> but i was happy trying this out because it really does work!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll give it one more shot</li>
            <li> the body wash i use is the panoxyl 10&amp; benzyl peroxide foaming wash:)</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> She and I are extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s 40% better.</li>
            <li> but this stuff made me break out more than ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve all but disappeared and I still use it on him from time to time to make sure.</li>
            <li> His skin is better than ever.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> well I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My break-outs have mostly cleared up, but I still have some problems.  </li>
            <li> : I can safely say i&#x27;ve been using the body was for over 2 months.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Now I feel more confident wearing backless dress :)</li>
            <li> Over packaged for sure.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have for you sure had a reduction in body acne.</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff for back acne.  </li>
            <li> This product, like many others, may work for some, but not all.</li>
            <li> More scaring than pimples.</li>
            <li> but I am glad that there are products out there like this Body Spray from Neutrogena that helps me control and get rid of it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, as a sceptic, wasn&#x27;t sure it would work,  but looking for a easier solution then having my girlfriend wash her hands and rub clearasil on my back every day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> say, although i cant speak for everyone, however it does work better then most of the products i have tried:)</li>
            <li> I used it every day for 6-months leading up to the wedding and the skin on my back/chest never looked better.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok too.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t bleach clothes and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and for the most part the 360-spray claim holds up until the product line reaches the end of the spray hose.</li>
            <li> the smell is not bad, not like some astringents that smell very strongly.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for targeting  any body acne, and it covers a wide area.</li>
            <li> Dries out the back real nice</li>
            <li> *wish i could easily find it in stores</li>
            <li> the acne on my back has greatly reduced in size and are much more spread out.  </li>
            <li> The spray is easy to use and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Strong citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> The product doesnt have a strong smell, so I can wear it during the day.  </li>
            <li> It really does spray at any angle which is great and makes it so easy to use right after a shower.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday I love how it sprays upside down best product ever especially great for people who workout and sweat</li>
            <li> The smell is like most cleaner products, and its not bad.</li>
            <li> And nothing is more attractive than a girl wearing a tank top with a pimple or two revealed on her back, right?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i read some encouraging reviews and they were accurate.</li>
            <li> The body wash works great, and seems like it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Works great for blemishes on your chest, shoulders, back, ect.</li>
            <li> By the end of week three, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  </li>
            <li> and I spray a light layer (2x/day).</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell and lasts a long time -- you don&#x27;t need much to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> but it is so much more manageable right now.</li>
            <li> I promise it works, I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li> it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Wash your sheets and blankets every 2 weeks, clean towels, spray this stuff on..</li>
            <li> This smells fresh, sprays on easily, has a 360 spray ability.</li>
            <li> I like that the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Spray has a nice light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> good for back breakouts.  </li>
            <li> but it does seem like the acne looks lighter, but the fact that the amount of acne on my body nearly doubled after using this is kind of upsetting.</li>
            <li> Just spray this on and it clears up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It dries really quickly as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from mild bacne ever since I was maybe 13</li>
            <li> After I stopped using it though, that luckily went away and so did the discoloration.</li>
            <li> Sprays well, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied and use this regularly now.</li>
            <li> if you have light acne then this would work other wise get the maximum strength</li>
            <li> The upside down pray head works great</li>
            <li> Not totally gone but pretty good improvement.</li>
            <li> ive ever been able to use anything on my back because this makes it so easy to get coverage wherever you need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great item for my little one.</li>
            <li> This works great and has the exact active ingredient as proactive body lotion but about $15 cheaper.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s light and drys fast...</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t magically clear up the acne on my back/chest, but it did seem to prevent more.</li>
            <li> but there are so many good reviews that I want to at least try it.</li>
            <li> The 360 sprayer works like it&#x27;s supposed to, which is really handy because I used it on my back.</li>
            <li> The only thing I worry about while using it is that I am spraying a kind of an acid solution on my skin and</li>
            <li> have been trying to switch from chemical based ingredients to more natural ingredients, but I am not going to be too picky considering this has 0.5% Salicylic Acid,</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly, I put it on in the bathroom</li>
            <li> but I ran out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I got it, I delved right in with using it three times a day and never had an adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> He is an athlete and the spray has not discolored his clothing but he does not apply the spray RIGHT BEFORE working out.</li>
            <li> It is okay to use, but I would recommend it only as a quick aid, for instance on holidays.</li>
            <li> This spray is great, really helped clear my back from acne and even tinea versicolor.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great if its used daily in conjunction with an exfoliant in the shower prior to use.</li>
            <li> I live in the south where its hot most of the year, and I find that I easily break out on my chest and back because I&#x27;m always sweating.</li>
            <li> I did not use it more than once daily</li>
            <li> I have a pretty stubborn pimples on my face, and Neutrogena products don&#x27;t help them.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I picked out the Neutrogena spray after considering several options and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution to an uncomfortable problem.</li>
            <li> I have problems with more severe acne on my back</li>
            <li> and it had worded pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love this product and if you have the same problem give this product a try!</li>
            <li> Anyways I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;d get better results if I used it constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and within the first two weeks I haven&#x27;t had a break out</li>
            <li> After the first week of using this product twice a day (morning and night)</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t want to), but this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> Its designed well and its the first time</li>
            <li> well, Its hasnt helped in comparison to like when im able to run alcohol and zit cream on my back.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, since most products have a tendency to stain clothes or severely dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the drug store because I seen the positive comments on here.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about the 0.5% Salicylic acid content vs the 2% of most other products I&#x27;ve tried, but I must say I&#x27;m really impressed.  </li>
            <li> It helps clear up back acne and is very very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but now it is super clear like I have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a strong alcohol smell for a second, but it did not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single back-zit since I started using it about 6 weeks ago, and at this point, I am absolutely sure it&#x27;s not luck</li>
            <li> If a large pimple occurs you may need a drying benzoyl peroxide cream or a sulphur mask to use as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> nd wear a loose fitting shirt then repeat at night.</li>
            <li> The absolute best aspect of this product is that the sprayer works upside down so you can spray any part of your back without breaking your arm and throwing out your back.  </li>
            <li> I had not tried much really.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Much easier than trying to apply products by hand.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried much product</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a scent-</li>
            <li> it all evaporates fast</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does and FAST.</li>
            <li> This body spray has helped so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to shower in the morning, or after getting sweaty walking around school and work, and this spray is a real lifesaver for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> so I give it a try since the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> But fast delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li> It really really works.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really mind that now that I see it works</li>
            <li> This is a very convient product to use.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy film and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is very helpful is acne and doesn&#x27;t harm the skin</li>
            <li> The spray mist is very light, so you don&#x27;t get very wet or too straight of a spray.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice, fine, even mist and it is very easy to spray your back, which can otherwise be hard to get with other non-spray acne products.</li>
            <li> It just kind of makes my skin stiff if I don&#x27;t apply lotion with.  </li>
            <li> Works great, just at 10$ for such a small bottle...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s, and have had acne pretty much all of my life.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a bigger bottle (minus one star for that), but you can&#x27;t have everything, and I&#x27;m otherwise very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used it in the past and didn&#x27;t think it was that great, but after several years I decided to give it another shot</li>
            <li> It works pretty much anywhere you want to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure skipped days here and there, but I expected a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Avoid tight fitting clothing nd if your a girl try not to wear your bra too much..</li>
            <li> Great for hard to reach spots like back</li>
            <li> I feel like I have less body breakouts for sure.</li>
            <li> I have already bought a second bottle as it runs out quickly, but it works.</li>
            <li> The cost is decent for a product that works.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and all I can remember is that it ended up making my arms super red and blotchy</li>
            <li> It was the only thing that helped my body acne while I was pregnant and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky</li>
            <li> I wish they would advertize this more as it was only sheer luck</li>
            <li> I use it religiously after every shower and it dries quick, without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> If possible lol or at least a sports bra</li>
            <li> I can certainly imagine after the bottle reaches empty point, that there will be a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I will say, the first couple of days after using it, I did get some big honking pimples, as some people have complained, but I persisted in using it to give it a fair chance of working.</li>
            <li> I have horomone problems (high testorone)</li>
            <li> i rated this high because it does the job, but the smell makes me cough when it&#x27;s suspended in the air.</li>
            <li> When I got this I had been using a clean and clear spot treatment on my back</li>
            <li> I guess its normal for neutrogena stuff.</li>
            <li> He has gotten this rash and since he&#x27;s in preschool, it was kind of common, according to his doctor.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me break out any more than usual but the blemishes that I already had didn&#x27;t really go away...</li>
            <li> Will try a few more days and review again</li>
            <li> It sprays upside down and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I go to the gym a lot and live in Florida, so the sweat assists in sporadic breakouts.</li>
            <li> This ingredient soaks into your skin to unclog pores, treat existing and prevent new acne from occurring.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it brought out more acne and it looks a little worse now.</li>
            <li> you are looking for something to clear up your acne on your back/ chest though, look up Glytone Spray too!</li>
            <li> and now it is almost completely clear!  </li>
            <li> After a week of once a day use of this clear body spray it is almost all gone!</li>
            <li> This product does what it is suppose to, it is suppose to clear acne off the body!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Grapefruit Oil-Free Acne Face Wash/Scrub &amp; Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner!).</li>
            <li> While you could use some other salicylic acid toner, this is so much more convenient, because you can simply spray it on (it sprays at all angles).</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for the first several months after each shower.  </li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t red or really colored at all!  </li>
            <li> It actually worked really well!</li>
            <li> I have determined that I have sensitive and oily skin which is quite the combo!</li>
            <li> He applies it after his nightly shower and puts on a clean, WHITE, cotton undershirt to sleep in and he wears one underneath his regular school clothing but not underneath his Under Armour heat/cold gear apparel or his Nike compression athletic shirts that he changes into during the day for weight training, baseball practice and gym</li>
            <li> it keeps ur back clear!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry or tight feeling at all which is also nice.</li>
            <li> Shower daily and ALWAYS put on a clean shirt, never one you&#x27;ve worn previously without washing it first.</li>
            <li> I really needed something to control all the new breakouts I am getting on my back</li>
            <li> Just spray a few times and you will see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This is a must in my post-shower routine to keep my chest clear.</li>
            <li> Also no worries about staining your  clothes it goes on clear and dries clear with no residue.</li>
            <li> It has really helped keep her back clear.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin beautifully clear.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to clear my dreaded backne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost clear now.</li>
            <li> Sprays well with all angles and clear up acne.</li>
            <li> This helped clear it up within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesnt magically clear your skin in  days like alot of the reviews</li>
            <li> This stuff seemed to clear it up if used diligently.</li>
            <li> i like what I see so far.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I have very problematic skin on my back and shoulders, and this is the only product that really helped.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s been 3 days so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it so far for almost a week</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was so self conscious</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done much for me, but I don&#x27;t use it religiously.</li>
            <li> and I break out on my back and shoulders, and it&#x27;s very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> even those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I do not have sensitive skin by any means.</li>
            <li> By the end of week two, my back feels a lot smoother, looks much healthier and acne has continued to decline.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps my back acne.</li>
            <li> I would say overall, this is a good but not great product.</li>
            <li> it is easy to apply and it sprays upside down when I flip it over to spray my back.  </li>
            <li> I used this pretty regularly for a few weeks leading up to a special event and it definitely did the trick.</li>
            <li> I recently started a new birth control and</li>
            <li> The first in a long line of products I&#x27;ve tried that actually worked.</li>
            <li> I love this spray, its very hard to find though</li>
            <li> and my back is completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I broke out on my back from some medication and couldn&#x27;t get it to clear up.</li>
            <li> After years of researching how to clear up acne, specifically back acne, I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bugs me is that it doesnt spray very well when there&#x27;s only about a quarter of the liquid left.  </li>
            <li> Only 0.5% salicylic acid, does not work nearly as well as the product I was using that had 2%.  </li>
            <li> The first time I bought it, I sprayed everywhere and all over until my back was wet</li>
            <li> It took forever for my skin to calm down again, and this product definitely helped.</li>
            <li> I mainly suffer from acne on my face, but I will occasionally get some body acne on my shoulders, chest or back, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> This started to clear my back up within 3 days now its two weeks later and my back has not been this clear in 5 years</li>
            <li> Ive even tried other medications and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> it has cleared up the back acne and kept it clear of all but the occasional spot.</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s not a good idea for long term usage.</li>
            <li> The spray pump really does work upside down too.</li>
            <li> I use it along with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash in Pink Grapefruit and together my acne majorly cleared up.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the reviews that said it may take a bit to see results because the first few days I didn&#x27;t see any but after using it only once a day for a week I started to see improvement</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because it pretty much didn&#x27;t do anything and in fact made it worse?</li>
            <li> Overall, this has some pretty good customer reviews, so I though I&#x27;d give it a try, despite the few horror stories I&#x27;d read from the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I have had 0 new breakouts using this product, and it is not sticky upon application, which was a big concern with other products.  </li>
            <li> My breakouts on my back have calmed down alot since ive used this, however it hasnt disapeared completely, and i have still gotten a few (not as many as usual though) breakouts since using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of produts, especially proactive (way too expensive!) and decided to try this spray and body wash and so far it seems to be working fine!</li>
            <li> (it takes just a few moments, probably because of the high alcohol content), and then I&#x27;m ready to go, feeling much less grody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use a little tube of benzoyl peroxide, but I went through so much of that for such a large area of my body.  </li>
            <li> I use a sensitive soap with all natural ingredients as such as African Black Soap (another staple for body breakouts) and spritz this lightly over the troubled areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Trust me just have a friend or significant other rub oxi-pad acne wipes on your back and hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> If this happens, I suggest holding on to the bottle after getting a new one, use the new one until it&#x27;s down a little, and refilling it.</li>
            <li> Only problem is when you get down to about 1/5 of the bottle it almost completely stops spraying, even when the straw is submersed in the medicine.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this will really resolve my acne problem because I could not stand the smell long enough to use it properly.</li>
            <li> only gripe I have is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long..  </li>
            <li> However, as far as the clarity of my skin, I think it only slightly improved.</li>
            <li> Try it, and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, at least you won&#x27;t have shelled out so much money on something more expensive that also doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I use this spray about 3 times a week (because i usually forget to everyday) and it keeps my skin pretty clear.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would dry my back out</li>
            <li> I just spray it on my chest and back after I dry off from a shower, and I don&#x27;t break out anymore.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that you have to spray it on your body after you towel dry.  </li>
            <li> I have mild acne on my chest and after using this product for two days it gave me a rash and made my acne on my chest even worse.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to try this, because I have used other neutrogena products for my face and they didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, a few days later the pimples began to clear up, and I haven&#x27;t had such a bad breakout since.</li>
            <li> though is not completely gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was using too much of it or what, but it bleached my shirts after I sprayed it (and let it dry) on my shoulders!!</li>
            <li> My back and arms cleared up so fast and after using it everyday, I went down to every other day</li>
            <li> I usually just buy a new bottle and pour the rest in there</li>
            <li> I really want the acne gone, and Neutrogena products have a 100% failure rate with me</li>
            <li> something less irritating or not as tight fitting.</li>
            <li> When I first used this i sprayed it on and it itched pretty bad, but that went away.</li>
            <li> She lets it dry and heads to bed..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry by the time I get to my bedroom to get dressed.</li>
            <li> then let myself air dry</li>
            <li> air dry again</li>
            <li> I like to use unfragranced lotion after I towel dry.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> This spray works to eliminate acne after a single spray.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, it isn&#x27;t horrible but it isn&#x27;t anything you would use for perfume/cologne.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I love Neutrogena products especially the grapefruit cleanser.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son had pretty bad back acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough having acne, then having to ask your significant other or relative to rub a medication on it.</li>
            <li> The spray made my body acne a bit worse, and this is certainly fighting it off.</li>
            <li> After a few uses my skin looked clear, plus it isn&#x27;t messy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I think it does some, but not a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have acne on my back and shoulders - just a few zits here and there.</li>
            <li> (one of my biggest regrets).</li>
            <li> I went through 2 bottles of this product with absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> but it is a lot smaller and WAYY less noticable!</li>
            <li> not totally sure if it has actually do anything.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with back and shoulder pimples in the past.</li>
            <li> its pretty expensive at 10$ a bottle</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the salcylic acid in it and would spray him after a bath or shower and rub it in a little and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I use the pink grapefruit wash in conjunction with the spray and have seen a slight difference in breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I just give a few sprays, wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the different body washes and they hardly did a thing.  </li>
            <li> so I put it on when I get out of the shower and by the time I finish drying my hair it is dry with no sticky residue left behind like other acne products.  </li>
            <li> You can hold it upside down and get the hard to reach places on your back.</li>
            <li> It actually burns pretty bad when I Put it on after a shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to see all the waste for such a small item.</li>
            <li> but instead just grew dark?</li>
            <li> The color of the acne is slowly fading off, and remember it&#x27;s only been 3 days!</li>
            <li> works well, but sometimes the upside down spray doesn&#x27;t pump as well as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is kinda annoying to spray it on and you feel a bit strange while it dries, but it really improved my back.</li>
            <li> I must have hit adult acne or something because my back broke out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I started using this in the summer when my back and shoulders began to seriously break-out.  </li>
            <li> This thing seriously helps with my back and shoulder acne!</li>
            <li> Stops spraying at a slant after half the bottle is used up.</li>
            <li> Not cool..</li>
            <li> Slightly tacky while drying and a little slow to dry</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time finding this stuff in store!</li>
            <li> Diminished blemishes by a little.</li>
            <li> It contains a buttload of alcohol, so it stings a little, but it works.</li>
            <li> After that, I started randomly breaking out on my back, and it never really stopped.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t want the rest of his body or patchy areas to be too dried out.....</li>
            <li> If I remember, i&#x27;ll update with the results of the body wash in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> recommendation is to NOT buy the spray, It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working, but after a short while it made everything worse than it was before I even started.</li>
            <li> You have to be faithful and use everyday</li>
            <li> All you need is a few mists and no need to overdo it.</li>
            <li> a few days later:&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
            <li> using it a few days</li>
            <li> After using this product I have notice less acne!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong smell, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I also hated having to squirt myself with cold spray right after a hot shower!</li>
            <li> I was a little shy about showing my arms and back</li>
            <li> For a while, I was having these horrible breakouts on my back (worse than usual; we&#x27;re talking huge, painful zits); I had no idea why, nothing in my routine had changed, but there they were just the same, so it was time to take action.</li>
            <li> but it just wasn&#x27;t right for my skin :(</li>
            <li> but now i don&#x27;t have to worry about big ugly pimples covering my back chest and shoulders.......</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products usually never disappoint and the body spray is a genius idea but its not working as well as i had hoped, it very expensive with little close to none</li>
            <li> I started using the spray once or twice a day for the past month</li>
            <li> I have to say, I don&#x27;t usually give feedback on items via amazon.</li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s a lazy</li>
            <li> I had horrible body acne (chest and back) for years, but after using this everyday after I shower it cleared up so much.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product will work or not</li>
            <li> I use it everyday at least 2 or 3 times throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> :S</li>
            <li> Saw results within a few days!</li>
            <li> only downside is that it smells a bit weird.</li>
            <li> so I usually buy it in quantities.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while but have been having trouble finding it in stores lately.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get acne on my shoulders and chest when I&#x27;m sick (which is very often), and this takes care of it within two days.</li>
            <li> I am prone to breakouts on my back, which is just so annoying and can be embarrassing for dresses/shirts that show off my back.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really hard to find, now.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product, figuring I had nothing to lose by at least trying it.</li>
            <li> Will use this between his salicyc acid body wash bathings that are slowly helping.</li>
            <li> I suffer from really bad acne on my back.</li>
            <li> but I still get a few random blemishes here and there to this day.</li>
            <li> A really hard product to find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had problems with body acne until a few years ago when I would go to the tanning bed every week and damage the crap out of my skin</li>
            <li> it causes peeling and irritating.</li>
            <li> My acne seemed to have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> First of all it feels nasty sticky, it barely help my acne, and when I sprayed it on my arms I got a terrible rash</li>
            <li> i am 14 years old with horrible body acne!</li>
            <li> and it is suffocating to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I have terrible blackheads and whiteheads on my chest and back...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i dont have terrible back acne</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> so my skin is not the awful mess</li>
            <li> So I think I probably would have gotten those pimples regardless of whether I started using this product or not, it was just an unfortunate coincidence that the reared their ugly heads the day after I started using the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a bad experience with a hair oil (a garnier one) which made my shoulders break out LIKE CRAZY!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now but I am still getting acne on my back. Sprays one to two times daily after shower and for me the acne doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> It helps clear up back acne and is very very easy to use.  I&#x27;m a repeated buyer of this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference with this product. I liked the spray method, it&#x27;s convenient. However, as far as the clarity of my skin, I think it only slightly improved. I did not use it more than once daily and I&#x27;m sure skipped days here and there, but I expected a little bit more. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it one more shot</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this will really resolve my acne problem because I could not stand the smell long enough to use it properly. There is no way I would leave the house smelling like that and it is suffocating to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I must have hit adult acne or something because my back broke out like crazy. I had not tried much really. I bought this because i read some encouraging reviews and they were accurate. This really works. I have already bought a second bottle as it runs out quickly, but it works. About 95% of my acne has cleared up in just couple of weeks. The cost is decent for a product that works. I&#x27;m a happy consumer.</li>
            <li> Much easier than trying to apply products by hand.  Has a pleasant smell and lasts a long time -- you don&#x27;t need much to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty stubborn pimples on my face, and Neutrogena products don&#x27;t help them. But this stuff does wonders on my shoulders and chest! I tend to get acne on my shoulders and chest when I&#x27;m sick (which is very often), and this takes care of it within two days. Only problem is when you get down to about 1/5 of the bottle it almost completely stops spraying, even when the straw is submersed in the medicine. If this happens, I suggest holding on to the bottle after getting a new one, use the new one until it&#x27;s down a little, and refilling it.</li>
            <li> This is a must in my post-shower routine to keep my chest clear.</li>
            <li> Works great, just at 10$ for such a small bottle... I guess its normal for neutrogena stuff.</li>
            <li> My mom was looking for a cheaper solution rather than buying Glytone Back Spray so she got this for me (I did suffer from mild/severe acne on my back). I used this product once and all I can remember is that it ended up making my arms super red and blotchy the next morning I woke up and I never used it again. I had some kind of reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to clear up your acne on your back/ chest though, look up Glytone Spray too!</li>
            <li> I have terrible blackheads and whiteheads on my chest and back... this has helped exfoliate and expel all the blackheads. i like what I see so far. the smell is not bad, not like some astringents that smell very strongly.  “I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.”</li>
            <li> This is awesome. It worked within days. I was really surprised how well it worked. I wish i would have found this sooner. Will definitely recommend to friends/family!</li>
            <li> good for back breakouts.  It sprays upside down and is easy to use.  Perfect for targeting  any body acne, and it covers a wide area. Also no worries about staining your  clothes it goes on clear and dries clear with no residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months or so.  I like this product, but not totally sure if it has actually do anything.  I think it does some, but not a whole lot.  I use the pink grapefruit wash in conjunction with the spray and have seen a slight difference in breakouts.  I would still recommend this product.  PS:  A really hard product to find!</li>
            <li> It is okay to use, but I would recommend it only as a quick aid, for instance on holidays. It does not substitute a good cleansing by the beautician.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne on my back for years and have tried all different things.  I&#x27;ve tried all the different body washes and they hardly did a thing.  I started using the spray once or twice a day for the past month and my back is completely clear.  I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since I started using it.  The only thing that bugs me is that it doesnt spray very well when there&#x27;s only about a quarter of the liquid left.  I usually just buy a new bottle and pour the rest in there once I can though.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this! It was the only thing that helped my body acne while I was pregnant and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky</li>
            <li> My chest is the only place I get acne especially if I use my girly bath stuff. I&#x27;ve been spraying this on but haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. It actually burns pretty bad when I Put it on after a shower. I assume because my pores are open but I&#x27;m still trying to give it a good shot</li>
            <li> This works great for my back, it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin any irritation, it dries quickly, and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Finally an acne product that does what it says it does!!! This started to clear my back up within 3 days now its two weeks later and my back has not been this clear in 5 years and I have tried everything INCLUDING perscrptions!!! TRUST me on this one. I was worried it would dry my back out but it did not. you could also use unscented dove bar on your back shower then use this spray. I promise it works, I&#x27;m so excited. I wish they would advertize this more as it was only sheer luck I saw this at the grocery store while looking for hand soap. I would have never know it existted. I HOPE TO GOD THEY NEVER STOP MAKING THIS. I have horomone problems (high testorone) thats what causes my acne but this is the only thing that has worked. TRY IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I don&#x27;t usually give feedback on items via amazon. BUT, this stuff works like a gem!   I&#x27;m in my early 30s, and have had acne pretty much all of my life. I have tried everything, from on-the-spot treatments to body washes, but nothing has come close to what I have experienced with this stuff. I was hesitant at first, since most products have a tendency to stain clothes or severely dry out your skin. Not with this stuff. I use it religiously after every shower and it dries quick, without feeling sticky. Just as they advertised.   Take a leap of faith with this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this product because no one has to rub it in spots you can&#x27;t reach. It&#x27;s bad enough having acne, then having to ask your significant other or relative to rub a medication on it. Just spray this on and it clears up fairly quickly. I use it 2 to 3 times daily. It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t bleach clothes and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> i am 14 years old with horrible body acne! i haven&#x27;t tried much product but i was happy trying this out because it really does work! u will see a big difference on your back but you have to have patient and use a body wash with it and u will see a big difference! i still have a lot of scaring on my back but they will fade in time but now i don&#x27;t have to worry about big ugly pimples covering my back chest and shoulders.......i recommend this to everyone!.....BTW. the body wash i use is the panoxyl 10&amp; benzyl peroxide foaming wash:)</li>
            <li> This spray is great, really helped clear my back from acne and even tinea versicolor. While you could use some other salicylic acid toner, this is so much more convenient, because you can simply spray it on (it sprays at all angles). There isn&#x27;t much of a scent- it all evaporates fast anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day after shower.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as described. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> PERFECT SPRAY!! My son uses this for his bacne... and it has cleared up in a matter of weeks. This stuff works!!</li>
            <li> This has been a miracle product for me! Does what it says it does and FAST. The first in a long line of products I&#x27;ve tried that actually worked. Love it!!! -Amy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before but it&#x27;s really hard to find, now. Cleared up my back in days.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray because I used to buy a similar product made by Clinique but it has since been discontinued.  The Clinique spray was the only thing that ever worked on those breakouts we girls get on our upper chest and back from sweating or irritation from clothing.  I picked out the Neutrogena spray after considering several options and I am glad I did.  It works so well, it is easy to apply and it sprays upside down when I flip it over to spray my back.  It dries really quickly as well so I put it on when I get out of the shower and by the time I finish drying my hair it is dry with no sticky residue left behind like other acne products.  I appreciate the reviews that said it may take a bit to see results because the first few days I didn&#x27;t see any but after using it only once a day for a week I started to see improvement and now it is almost completely clear!  This spray is awesome and it does not irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution to an uncomfortable problem. If you are self-conscious about shoulder blemishes, use this AMAZING spray, and you&#x27;ll feel (and look) so much better. It&#x27;s not a miracle, of course; however, Neutrogena is the only brand I trust. After a few uses my skin looked clear, plus it isn&#x27;t messy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I broke out on my back from some medication and couldn&#x27;t get it to clear up. After a week of once a day use of this clear body spray it is almost all gone! The spray pump really does work upside down too. I am really pleased with this product and won&#x27;t be insecure about my &amp;#34;bacne&amp;#34; on vacation next week.</li>
            <li> This body spray has helped so much. I tend to break out on my arms and back because I work out a lot, and now after my work outs I spray this on and it prevents me from breaking out. Wish it was a bit cheaper but, thats okay it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t magically clear up the acne on my back/chest, but it did seem to prevent more. There&#x27;s no strong smell, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> This seems to help keep my body acne under control.</li>
            <li> I am so happy! I have problems with more severe acne on my back and this is clearing it up great! I use it along with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash in Pink Grapefruit and together my acne majorly cleared up. though is not completely gone. happy i can wear tank tops again!</li>
            <li> I use this on my teenage daughters back and shoulders. It has really helped keep her back clear. She was cheerleading and always had on a sports bra which I think contributed to the back acne. Those bras are great but hold a lot of sweat and oil close to the skin and rub it in. Not cool..so I got this for her and I sprayed it on her back nightly after her shower. She lets it dry and heads to bed..it has cleared up the back acne and kept it clear of all but the occasional spot. She and I are extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> Diminished blemishes by a little. I would say it&#x27;s 40% better. Not enough to rave about. Will not repurchase</li>
            <li> I love this product! the spray nozzle works in every directions! After using this product I have notice less acne!</li>
            <li> Overall, this has some pretty good customer reviews, so I though I&#x27;d give it a try, despite the few horror stories I&#x27;d read from the bad reviews. I like it, it seems to be doing the job it&#x27;s suppose to. For a while, I was having these horrible breakouts on my back (worse than usual; we&#x27;re talking huge, painful zits); I had no idea why, nothing in my routine had changed, but there they were just the same, so it was time to take action. So I bought this product, figuring I had nothing to lose by at least trying it. Now I will say, the first couple of days after using it, I did get some big honking pimples, as some people have complained, but I persisted in using it to give it a fair chance of working. Sure enough, a few days later the pimples began to clear up, and I haven&#x27;t had such a bad breakout since. So I think I probably would have gotten those pimples regardless of whether I started using this product or not, it was just an unfortunate coincidence that the reared their ugly heads the day after I started using the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I be buying this again when it runs out? Yeah, probably, since it seems to work well for me and is way cheaper than the glytone or the Murad acne body spray. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle (minus one star for that), but you can&#x27;t have everything, and I&#x27;m otherwise very satisfied. Try it, and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, at least you won&#x27;t have shelled out so much money on something more expensive that also doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time finding this stuff in store! Eventually I had to go to trusty Amazon to get it. I&#x27;d used it in the past and didn&#x27;t think it was that great, but after several years I decided to give it another shot and it ended up working surprisingly well for me! I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties so my skin is not the awful mess it was when I was a teen, but I still have my problem spots. I used this pretty regularly for a few weeks leading up to a special event and it definitely did the trick. I would definitely repurchase it and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This works great. I&#x27;m very satisfied and use this regularly now. I recommend this to everyone who needs to help control body acne.</li>
            <li> When I got this I had been using a clean and clear spot treatment on my back and it had worded pretty well. When I first used this i sprayed it on and it itched pretty bad, but that went away. But this did not do anything for my back. I&#x27;ve started using the spot treatment again.</li>
            <li> Great spray! I go to the gym a lot and live in Florida, so the sweat assists in sporadic breakouts. This helps ease that!</li>
            <li> it didnt help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;made me break out 10x more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont have terrible back acne but this stuff made me break out more than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;save money and go buy some &amp;#34; natures cure pills&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that stuffed cleared me within two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> The best product ever! I have very problematic skin on my back and shoulders, and this is the only product that really helped. You can see the difference in only a week.</li>
            <li> Great item for my little one. He has gotten this rash and since he&#x27;s in preschool, it was kind of common, according to his doctor. I ordered this because of the salcylic acid in it and would spray him after a bath or shower and rub it in a little and let it air dry. They&#x27;ve all but disappeared and I still use it on him from time to time to make sure. Great product. I also used it with Cetaphil lotion since he has excema and i didn&#x27;t want the rest of his body or patchy areas to be too dried out.....His skin is better than ever.</li>
            <li> This spray works to eliminate acne after a single spray.  I use it after every shower if I have any bumps.  The absolute best aspect of this product is that the sprayer works upside down so you can spray any part of your back without breaking your arm and throwing out your back.  LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a year now and of all the products i have used this is the easiest to apply.</li>
            <li> works so well I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t find it in stores though.</li>
            <li> I started using this in the summer when my back and shoulders began to seriously break-out.  I used it twice a day for the first several months after each shower.  I am now using it once a day.  My break-outs have mostly cleared up, but I still have some problems.  I do wish the bottle was bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong alcohol smell for a second, but it did not bother me at all.  It also did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  I am happy I bought it.  It is very good at clearing the acne on the body.</li>
            <li> This works great and has the exact active ingredient as proactive body lotion but about $15 cheaper. This is perfect because it sprays from any angle and I use it for my back.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin beautifully clear. The bottle sprays from every angle, so I don&#x27;t miss anything. A must buy.</li>
            <li> Only 0.5% salicylic acid, does not work nearly as well as the product I was using that had 2%.  Strong citrus scent.  Dries to a sort of sticky consistency and rolls off if I try to put a sunscreen lotion on afterwards.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by a good friend and so i tried it and I liked it. It works for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over use on your chest. it causes peeling and irritating.</li>
            <li> Every summer I am so embarrassed to wear tank tops because of the blemishes on my shoulders and back. I can scrub away with body was every day and that doesnt cut it. Ive even tried other medications and nothing really worked. This stuff is great!! It really does spray at any angle which is great and makes it so easy to use right after a shower. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry or tight feeling at all which is also nice. The only complaint I have is that the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, it isn&#x27;t horrible but it isn&#x27;t anything you would use for perfume/cologne. I would say it took about 3-4 uses to show improvement.</li>
            <li> This product does what it is suppose to, it is suppose to clear acne off the body! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. Sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to shower in the morning, or after getting sweaty walking around school and work, and this spray is a real lifesaver for my acne-prone skin. I just give a few sprays, wait for it to dry (it takes just a few moments, probably because of the high alcohol content), and then I&#x27;m ready to go, feeling much less grody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I delved right in with using it three times a day and never had an adverse reaction. I have oily, acne-prone skin, especially during that time of the month, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with the same issues.</li>
            <li> Dries out the back real nice</li>
            <li> No change and it&#x27;s been 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> It works. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the spray for almost a month now. It has not made any of my acne go away (used on chest and shoulders). Honestly, it brought out more acne and it looks a little worse now. It could be my imagination but it does seem like the acne looks lighter, but the fact that the amount of acne on my body nearly doubled after using this is kind of upsetting. I just ran out of this yesterday, so in case you&#x27;re wondering, the spray bottle lasts about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add on that I just purchased the body wash version of this. I really want the acne gone, and Neutrogena products have a 100% failure rate with me but there are so many good reviews that I want to at least try it. If I remember, i&#x27;ll update with the results of the body wash in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using the Body Wash since I got it, it&#x27;s been 3 days so far. Already I can see a difference. The spray made my body acne a bit worse, and this is certainly fighting it off. The color of the acne is slowly fading off, and remember it&#x27;s only been 3 days! I can certainly imagine after the bottle reaches empty point, that there will be a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to NOT buy the spray, It&#x27;s a waste of money. The body wash works great, and seems like it will last longer. Also, it has 4x the amount of saltyic acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/16/12: I can safely say i&#x27;ve been using the body was for over 2 months. Results are actually not there. It seemed to be working, but after a short while it made everything worse than it was before I even started. I&#x27;m never buying a Neutrogena acne product again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and quite effective! Good product.</li>
            <li> Seems to do what it claims.</li>
            <li> i rated this high because it does the job, but the smell makes me cough when it&#x27;s suspended in the air. It can&#x27;t be good to inhale this stuff.</li>
            <li> it works. I never thought I was going to find a product that actually helps reducing acne.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Works great for blemishes on your chest, shoulders, back, ect. It works pretty much anywhere you want to have clear skin. I use this spray about 3 times a week (because i usually forget to everyday) and it keeps my skin pretty clear. This is the only product that i will use! Everything else tends to do the opposite to my skin!! It works great for sensitive/oily based skin. I like to stock up in case i&#x27;m on vacation for a while or just want to keep it with me at all times! Again, amazing product. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry. 5 stars from me! *wish i could easily find it in stores but i cant! If anyone knows where i can get it instead of online, please let me know!</li>
            <li> Cleared up back acne in two weeks. Use this religiously once, if not twice daily. My 14 year old son had pretty bad back acne so I purchased an antibacterial body wash for him as well as the Neutrogena Body Acne Spray. He uses the spray every night after his shower but I don&#x27;t doubt that his results would have been faster if he had used it in the morning before school as well but he&#x27;s a lazy teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important: Shower daily and ALWAYS put on a clean shirt, never one you&#x27;ve worn previously without washing it first. Use an antibacterial body wash all over or the Neutrogena Body Acne Scrub containing Salicylic Acid on your acne-prone body areas. This ingredient soaks into your skin to unclog pores, treat existing and prevent new acne from occurring. A Salicylic Acid product will also fade acne scars &amp; sun damage with regular use as well as improve wrinkles (example: Neutrogena Grapefruit Oil-Free Acne Face Wash/Scrub &amp; Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner!). Also, increase your water consumption to keep toxins flushed out of your body. If a large pimple occurs you may need a drying benzoyl peroxide cream or a sulphur mask to use as a spot treatment. The sulphur mask worked best for my son. The benzoyl peroxide cream wasn&#x27;t drying enough. Some have stated that this spray will discolor clothing. My son has not had a problem with this. He is an athlete and the spray has not discolored his clothing but he does not apply the spray RIGHT BEFORE working out. He applies it after his nightly shower and puts on a clean, WHITE, cotton undershirt to sleep in and he wears one underneath his regular school clothing but not underneath his Under Armour heat/cold gear apparel or his Nike compression athletic shirts that he changes into during the day for weight training, baseball practice and gym but there hasn&#x27;t been a problem with discoloration for us when the spray is applied the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders! I had horrible body acne (chest and back) for years, but after using this everyday after I shower it cleared up so much. Granted, the results aren&#x27;t immediate, but it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I have acne back problem and I absolutely hate it. I am not sure if this product will work or not so I give it a try since the price is reasonable. I spray 1 time per day after shower. The upside down pray head works great and you do not have to ask somebody else for help. After 2 use I can see result already! Acne disappears and even my acne scars seems lighter in color. I love this product and if you have the same problem give this product a try! Now I feel more confident wearing backless dress :)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased! Not only did it arrive on time but it actually works!  I purchased this product to clear my dreaded backne and i noticed a difference after like 2 days which is amazing.  I use it everyday at least 2 or 3 times throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve been using it so far for almost a week and my backne isn&#x27;t gone but it is a lot smaller and WAYY less noticable! It also isn&#x27;t red or really colored at all!  I definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Over packaged for sure. I don&#x27;t like to see all the waste for such a small item. But fast delivery and product as described. Starting to use on schnauzer with schnauzer bumps. Will use this between his salicyc acid body wash bathings that are slowly helping. Hoping this helps too!</li>
            <li> works okay but its only 0.5 acid some creams are 2.0 acid which is the max, so if you have light acne then this would work other wise get the maximum strength</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products usually never disappoint and the body spray is a genius idea but its not working as well as i had hoped, it very expensive with little close to none results</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I haven&#x27;t had a single back-zit since I started using it about 6 weeks ago, and at this point, I am absolutely sure it&#x27;s not luck--it&#x27;s this product!</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to try this, because I have used other neutrogena products for my face and they didn&#x27;t work very well. It actually worked really well! I started out using it 2x a day morning and night and saw results in 2-3 days! The 360 sprayer works like it&#x27;s supposed to, which is really handy because I used it on my back. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell, but it goes away after it dries. It dries pretty quickly, I put it on in the bathroom and it&#x27;s dry by the time I get to my bedroom to get dressed. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Smell good, feels good, but i didn&#x27;t notice any difference in what they claimed would do to your blemish :S</li>
            <li> I use this everyday I love how it sprays upside down best product ever especially great for people who workout and sweat it keeps ur back clear!!!!</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have for you sure had a reduction in body acne. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin. I have mild acne on my chest and after using this product for two days it gave me a rash and made my acne on my chest even worse.</li>
            <li> i believe this product along with my riteaid purchase brand acne bath gel cleared up my back acne. You have to be faithful and use everyday</li>
            <li> My brother used this and it worked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Not too bad. The only thing I worry about while using it is that I am spraying a kind of an acid solution on my skin and sure it&#x27;s not a good idea for long term usage. Makes sense?</li>
            <li> Has definitely reduced the amount of breakouts on my back. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff for back acne.  Sprays easily and non-sticky and hasn&#x27;t stained clothes, and smells pleasant, etc.  It works!  Try it.</li>
            <li> I really needed something to control all the new breakouts I am getting on my back and when I do use this it seems to help a lot. I recently started a new birth control and goodness it&#x27;s wreaking havoc on my back but this has definitely helped.</li>
            <li> Oh where do I begin. I&#x27;ve suffered from mild bacne ever since I was maybe 13 I&#x27;m now 20. My self esteem was at an all time low. I was so self conscious I didn&#x27;t go to many school events even prom! I been now using this for about a month or so and I love it! Saw results within a few days! I&#x27;m almost clear now. I&#x27;ve never been this close to being so happy in my life!  I would recommend using it twice a day. I shower in the morning using neutrogena body wash then let myself air dry then spray then air dry again nd wear a loose fitting shirt then repeat at night. Avoid tight fitting clothing nd if your a girl try not to wear your bra too much.. If possible lol or at least a sports bra something less irritating or not as tight fitting. It adds irritation. Anyways I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This product, like many others, may work for some, but not all. I&#x27;m the one that it didn&#x27;t work for. I have acne prone oily skin and decided to use it for my bacne which is about moderate. More scaring than pimples. Used the entire bottle and it didn&#x27;t do one bit for my acne on my back.</li>
            <li> works well, but sometimes the upside down spray doesn&#x27;t pump as well as advertised. Great for hard to reach spots like back</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the drug store because I seen the positive comments on here. I must admit this is one of the best dance products I have ever used. I&#x27;m 25 and my back breaks out from time to time. My skin is extremely oily. I used this product for a week and it has cleared me up. I shower 2-3 times a day than I use it after I shower. Its amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Working! Thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! it clears up the acne and red marks on your back within 3 days. You can hold it upside down and get the hard to reach places on your back. It really really works. My back and arms cleared up so fast and after using it everyday, I went down to every other day and it still works. All you need is a few mists and no need to overdo it. The first time I bought it, I sprayed everywhere and all over until my back was wet but I ran out pretty quick. Just spray a few times and you will see a huge difference. I was a little shy about showing my arms and back but now it is super clear like I have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> I recommend the neutrogena body wash, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for me. And it&#x27;s only 0.5% acne medicine I&#x27;m guessing the rest is water?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with back and shoulder pimples in the past. I still can&#x27;t figure out what triggered it but I am glad that there are products out there like this Body Spray from Neutrogena that helps me control and get rid of it. The pimples still pop out of nowhere but it is so much more manageable right now. I can&#x27;t say I have acne on my back and shoulders - just a few zits here and there. But it&#x27;s enough to irritate me and make me worry on how to get rid of them. I recommend this product to people who have problems with shoulder and back pimples like myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews about this. I&#x27;ve never really had problems with body acne until a few years ago when I would go to the tanning bed every week and damage the crap out of my skin (one of my biggest regrets). After that, I started randomly breaking out on my back, and it never really stopped. It&#x27;s not severe but I still get a few random blemishes here and there to this day. And nothing is more attractive than a girl wearing a tank top with a pimple or two revealed on her back, right? Sigh but anyway, I decided to try this out. The smell/coldness didn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s medication and you just have to suck it up. I didn&#x27;t deduct stars because of that. I gave it a 3 star because it pretty much didn&#x27;t do anything and in fact made it worse? It didn&#x27;t make me break out any more than usual but the blemishes that I already had didn&#x27;t really go away... but instead just grew dark? I used this for a good two weeks and I stopped using it because the blemishes started to look like discolored scars. After I stopped using it though, that luckily went away and so did the discoloration. This may work well for others but it just wasn&#x27;t right for my skin :(</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done much for me, but I don&#x27;t use it religiously. Maybe I&#x27;d get better results if I used it constantly.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Works really great. Sprays well with all angles and clear up acne.</li>
            <li> This thing seriously helps with my back and shoulder acne! I would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it smells a bit weird. But I don&#x27;t really mind that now that I see it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10. (:</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, as a sceptic, wasn&#x27;t sure it would work,  but looking for a easier solution then having my girlfriend wash her hands and rub clearasil on my back every day. I decided to try it.. its pretty expensive at 10$ a bottle but it DOES work. Wash your sheets and blankets every 2 weeks, clean towels, spray this stuff on.. it will work.. only gripe I have is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long..  will be a buy again..</li>
            <li> This product sprays as described (360). Slightly tacky while drying and a little slow to dry but I have noticed an improvement in my skin where I have used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was using too much of it or what, but it bleached my shirts after I sprayed it (and let it dry) on my shoulders!!</li>
            <li> Itbdidnt work for me. I also hated having to squirt myself with cold spray right after a hot shower! No thanks!</li>
            <li> I waited until the bottle was finished to write my review and I&#x27;m glad I did, I have oily skin and I break out on my back and shoulders, and it&#x27;s very embarrassing. I&#x27;ve been using it and within the first two weeks I haven&#x27;t had a break out and it&#x27;s light and drys fast... I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it&#x27;s a must have for the summer</li>
            <li> I suffer from really bad acne on my back. This helped clear it up within a couple of weeks. It is kinda annoying to spray it on and you feel a bit strange while it dries, but it really improved my back.</li>
            <li> I live in the south where its hot most of the year, and I find that I easily break out on my chest and back because I&#x27;m always sweating. This product works wonders.  I just spray it on my chest and back after I dry off from a shower, and I don&#x27;t break out anymore.  I recommend it to anyone...even those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a couple weeks now, twice a day. My breakouts on my back have calmed down alot since ive used this, however it hasnt disapeared completely, and i have still gotten a few (not as many as usual though) breakouts since using it. I would say overall, this is a good but not great product. It doesnt magically clear your skin in  days like alot of the reviews say, although i cant speak for everyone, however it does work better then most of the products i have tried:)</li>
            <li> First of all it feels nasty sticky, it barely help my acne, and when I sprayed it on my arms I got a terrible rash and I do not have sensitive skin by any means. Trust me just have a friend or significant other rub oxi-pad acne wipes on your back and hard to reach places. That works much better!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I am prone to breakouts on my back, which is just so annoying and can be embarrassing for dresses/shirts that show off my back. I bought this body spray after buying my dream wedding dress, which was backless. I used it every day for 6-months leading up to the wedding and the skin on my back/chest never looked better. This product has been added to my daily skincare routine. It&#x27;s easy to apply and for the most part the 360-spray claim holds up until the product line reaches the end of the spray hose. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> We have a teenager with a bit of back acne.  This stuff seemed to clear it up if used diligently.</li>
            <li> I have started getting acne on my back and shoulders and its the hardest thing to get rid of because you can&#x27;t reach it! I love this spray, its very hard to find though so I usually buy it in quantities. Sprays well, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. The smell is like most cleaner products, and its not bad. Find the bottom never sprays, but I just dump all the remainders together and use the rest as toner.</li>
            <li> It (mostly) sprays in every direction and is somewhat effective.</li>
            <li> This is a very convient product to use.  It does not leave a greasy film and works very well.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I went through 2 bottles of this product with absolutely no results. My acne seemed to have gotten worse. I was disappointed because I love Neutrogena products especially the grapefruit cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with back acne for years now and have tried just about everything short of accutane. I heard about body acne sprays, and tried several brands before coming across this one. At first I was skeptical about the 0.5% Salicylic acid content vs the 2% of most other products I&#x27;ve tried, but I must say I&#x27;m really impressed.  After the first week of using this product twice a day (morning and night) the acne on my back has greatly reduced in size and are much more spread out.  By the end of week two, my back feels a lot smoother, looks much healthier and acne has continued to decline.  By the end of week three, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I have had 0 new breakouts using this product, and it is not sticky upon application, which was a big concern with other products.  Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this product for some chest and back breakouts.  I usually use a little tube of benzoyl peroxide, but I went through so much of that for such a large area of my body.  I&#x27;ve only used this stuff for a few days now, but my chest and back are much prettier and smoother.  It just kind of makes my skin stiff if I don&#x27;t apply lotion with.  It can also burn the skin and the smell can burn my nose.  I will continue to use and purchase this product!</li>
            <li> sprays at all angles. I could tell a difference within 24 hrs. Will use for the occasional disruption. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly can&#x27;t believe how great this product was. Cleared up my back and I&#x27;ve only used it 4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my chest and back for about 2 weeks and definitely see a difference. Not totally gone but pretty good improvement. The spray is easy to use and dries very quickly. The smell is ok too.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is very helpful is acne and doesn&#x27;t harm the skin</li>
            <li> It works. It contains a buttload of alcohol, so it stings a little, but it works.</li>
            <li> After years of researching how to clear up acne, specifically back acne, I decided to purchase this product. Thank God I have never had to use prescription drugs for it (I wouldn&#x27;t want to), but this stuff really works! I have determined that I have sensitive and oily skin which is quite the combo! I use a sensitive soap with all natural ingredients as such as African Black Soap (another staple for body breakouts) and spritz this lightly over the troubled areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to switch from chemical based ingredients to more natural ingredients, but I am not going to be too picky considering this has 0.5% Salicylic Acid, and I spray a light layer (2x/day).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. Applied twice a day, dries out the skin. Stops spraying at a slant after half the bottle is used up.</li>
            <li> great product! really works!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all save your money</li>
            <li> The product doesnt have a strong smell, so I can wear it during the day.  The spray mist is very light, so you don&#x27;t get very wet or too straight of a spray. Its designed well and its the first time ive ever been able to use anything on my back because this makes it so easy to get coverage wherever you need it.&lt;br /&gt;----edit a few days later:&lt;br /&gt;been using it a few days and it hasnt helped any. well, Its hasnt helped in comparison to like when im able to run alcohol and zit cream on my back.  But that isnt convenient. Will try a few more days and review again</li>
            <li> It works.  The only issue I have is that you have to spray it on your body after you towel dry.  I like to use unfragranced lotion after I towel dry.  This leaves me having to decide whether to lotion or spray.  I use spray on some parts and lotion the others. LoL</li>
            <li> I used to use Clinique body spray and they stopped making the product so I did lots of research on what I could use. This smells fresh, sprays on easily, has a 360 spray ability. It really helps my back acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of produts, especially proactive (way too expensive!) and decided to try this spray and body wash and so far it seems to be working fine! Second day and my back looks like it is clearing up!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while but have been having trouble finding it in stores lately.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found it here!  I am one of those people that never had facial acne but struggle with it on my back.  This stuff works great if its used daily in conjunction with an exfoliant in the shower prior to use.</li>
            <li> I mainly suffer from acne on my face, but I will occasionally get some body acne on my shoulders, chest or back, especially in the summer. Working out every day doesn&#x27;t help either! I bought this product after a bad experience with a hair oil (a garnier one) which made my shoulders break out LIKE CRAZY!!!!!! It took forever for my skin to calm down again, and this product definitely helped. I like that the Neutrogena Body Clear Body Spray has a nice light citrus scent. It is has a great sprayer/pump! It gives a nice, fine, even mist and it is very easy to spray your back, which can otherwise be hard to get with other non-spray acne products. I think I will probably purchase this product every spring, and use it throughout summer. I feel like I have less body breakouts for sure. It is a great (although not a miracle) product!!!</li>
