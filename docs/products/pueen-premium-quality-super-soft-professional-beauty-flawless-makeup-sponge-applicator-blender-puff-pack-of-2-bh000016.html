    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I kept reading about how great they were, but the &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; ones were like $25 each!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That has got the perfect finish!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product - GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li>The result is flawless.  </li>
            <li>and it applies concealer and foundation perfectly!</li>
            <li>These are cheaper and just as great!</li>
            <li>Now my make-up application is almost flawless.</li>
            <li>Good quality product!</li>
            <li>This sponge blends my concealer beautifully.</li>
            <li>However, I can say this blender gives great coverage.</li>
            <li>This one works just as well for the price and its even better because I got TWO!!</li>
            <li>It did what is was supposed to, but it didn&#x27;t blend very nice on me.</li>
            <li>The sponge applicator has an ergonomic shape that is great for a good grip while putting on foundation and/or bb cream.  </li>
            <li>The BB side just looked so much more flawless and airbrushed, The Pueen side just didn&#x27;t look good.  </li>
            <li>Which Is Really Good</li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>This is just as good as the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had a beauty blender, but this is a darn good option at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it could be a good dupe for the Beauty Blender...  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>and now I love them!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>Really flawless, smooth, easy coverage with a variety of cream and liquid foundations and concealers.</li>
            <li>I kind of feel ripped off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and the product looked great.</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist, always leaned toward perfect brushes.  </li>
            <li>Now, you do need good brushes, however, these sponges are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean (I just use some hand soap) and a great tool to use for foundation, blush, highlighter, bronzer, whatever you would like.</li>
            <li>perfectly puts any make up on without streaks, even better than using my own finger or other sponges, love it!</li>
            <li>I like the material of the Beautyblender better, but it wasn&#x27;t that durable and a chunk fell off.</li>
            <li>Cute packaging</li>
            <li>and I thought I would love them.</li>
            <li>They are cute and they get the job done</li>
            <li>and they take more makeup to cover your face than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Sure it may seem like a good deal, but I would rather spend the money on something worth it.</li>
            <li>It works better than my brush (to me).</li>
            <li>even though its cheap do not buy!</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad</li>
            <li>I was able to squeeze out any excess with no issues.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the actual beauty blender, but I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the sponges are great, very soft.  </li>
            <li>and I get better coverage with my BB cream using them then I did using my fingers or the cheap disposable sponges.</li>
            <li>A Must Get Its Easy</li>
            <li>Of all the knock off beauty blenders that I&#x27;ve tried, these are hands down the best!</li>
            <li>It covers well and works fine.  </li>
            <li>They took water just fine.</li>
            <li>Well, they come in super cute colors</li>
            <li>honestly - I don&#x27;t care to spend my money on something else just to see when I already have a great product that cost me much less for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are cheap.</li>
            <li>These things are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I purchased a original beauty blender on sale and I absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I seem to have to blow my nose every time i complete my make up regimen and these sponges are nice because I can easily touch up around my nose to make it look even with the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>I am THRILLED with my 2 new sponges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so amazingly it looked like it was done by a professional!</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried the real beauty blender you might not be able to tell the difference</li>
            <li>I dont know why anyone would purchace the beauty blender for full price.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be super amazed at the difference.</li>
            <li>The makeup application was so easy and blended very well.</li>
            <li>I especially like it because it is nice for those times when you smudge your make up and need a quick fix up.</li>
            <li>Ive Been Looking For The Right Sponge</li>
            <li>Gets in all the right places and the make-up does not absorb into the sponge like some do.</li>
            <li>and they were shipped super fast</li>
            <li>I like these sponges, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used them</li>
            <li>First-</li>
            <li>The sponge colors are pretty too.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, those reasons alone are not enough to get me to ever purchase this over the Beauty Blender.  :-)  </li>
            <li>I only gave it a 3 because I wish it was more pointy in order to better reach in some spots, like around the eyes; and also because I wish it became even softer when wet.</li>
            <li>Super soft and durable</li>
            <li>The quality is good... and if you soak them enough, as recommended, they become much softer than dry.</li>
            <li>clean up very easily and dry in no time &amp;#60;I live in Texas where it&#x27;s hot in the winter!&amp;#62; and they go back nicely in the little zipper bag they were delivered to me</li>
            <li>Two nice blenders and come in a little pouch.</li>
            <li>Even when wet it is hard and not flexable at all, it does not blend my makeup flawlessly and hurts your face in the process.</li>
            <li>I got them fast..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Putting on foundation was so much easier</li>
            <li>but I think I will have to invest in the real Beauty</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really even quite describe it.  </li>
            <li>The material is super dense and even after 24 hours does not completely dry out.</li>
            <li>but so far I really like them!</li>
            <li>they seem like they are decent quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MUCH denser than the BB, it feels like you&#x27;re punching yourself in the face with it as opposed to the BB which is very soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>They are no where near the quality of the real thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased the sponge that costs twice as much, so I can&#x27;t weigh in there, but I see no reason so far to bother.</li>
            <li>got a Pink one and a light Tan one.</li>
            <li>It allows me to cover my face evenly with the bb cream or foundation that i normally use.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin dry in many when applying my foundation, definitely prefer brushes over these sponges</li>
            <li>I was new to the BB world, so I bought both just to compare...  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and absorb water well.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend and will absolutely purchase again!</li>
            <li>They do an okay job, but I&#x27;m unhappy enough to be searching for something more like the Beautyblender.</li>
            <li>If you have ever tried the actual real deal beauty blender, don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li>Yes they expanded but no so much that they took on a different shape.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have seriously sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They felt so soft on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>It seems a little more dense/hard, but softens up well when you get it wet.</li>
            <li>although I prefer black as the stains dnt show up as much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> have seriously sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They felt so soft on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little more dense/hard, but softens up well when you get it wet.</li>
            <li> although I prefer black as the stains dnt show up as much</li>
            <li> and this adds extra moisture to my foundation so that it doesn&#x27;t look dry and cracked by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> They are especially helpful for use under the eyes where you don&#x27;t drag or roll the sponge you simply press.  </li>
            <li> These are hard no matter how much you try and soak them with water</li>
            <li> Also, if you get the sponge wet it grows like 4 times it&#x27;s regular size</li>
            <li> but the title is so long, it gets cut off on this review, and on amazon&#x27;s app.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> These are so dense that even when wet they don&#x27;t seem to dab/blend foundation that well.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> They are probably worth the expensive price, so these are a steal.</li>
            <li> Not very fond of it.</li>
            <li> This was not at all what i expected.</li>
            <li> One is shaped like an Egg &amp;#60;4th one in in the photo&amp;#62; and the other looks just like the pink one &amp;#60;1st</li>
            <li> They are like any other beauty blender without the expense.</li>
            <li> I did half of my face with my BB and the other half with this.  </li>
            <li> They are hard and not soft at all.</li>
            <li> Just spay a little water on it and use.</li>
            <li> The point is sharper on the Pueen, so it&#x27;s a little easier to get under the eyes with it as opposed to the BB.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t absorb any water and are very firm.  </li>
            <li> This makes it hard to use for make up.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> However, they are very hard and thick.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not impressed in the least.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell and the material is also very thick.</li>
            <li> and that makes it a bit complicated to use.</li>
            <li> Sorry, wanted to like it...</li>
            <li> I got these as a replacement for my Beautyblender, but they were disappointing.</li>
            <li> They do a horrible job applying makeup, even when wet they blend terribly.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Super soft and durable</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype on these things. It did what is was supposed to, but it didn&#x27;t blend very nice on me. Also, if you get the sponge wet it grows like 4 times it&#x27;s regular size and that makes it a bit complicated to use. The package arrived quickly and the product looked great.</li>
            <li> I like these sponges, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used them and I get better coverage with my BB cream using them then I did using my fingers or the cheap disposable sponges.</li>
            <li> Meet expectations. Durable.</li>
            <li> The quality is good... and if you soak them enough, as recommended, they become much softer than dry. I only gave it a 3 because I wish it was more pointy in order to better reach in some spots, like around the eyes; and also because I wish it became even softer when wet.</li>
            <li> I got these as a replacement for my Beautyblender, but they were disappointing. The material is super dense and even after 24 hours does not completely dry out. I like the material of the Beautyblender better, but it wasn&#x27;t that durable and a chunk fell off. These are so dense that even when wet they don&#x27;t seem to dab/blend foundation that well. They do an okay job, but I&#x27;m unhappy enough to be searching for something more like the Beautyblender.</li>
            <li> I purchased a original beauty blender on sale and I absolutely fell in love with it! When I found these for such a low price I jumped on the opportunity. I got them fast.. Just to toss them in the TRASH. They are hard and not soft at all. They do a horrible job applying makeup, even when wet they blend terribly. This was a total waste of money. If you haven&#x27;t tried the real beauty blender you might not be able to tell the difference but these are not, I repeat NOT a f</li>
            <li> Ive Been Looking For The Right Sponge n Tbh I Think I Found It The Fact That They Give You two Is a Plus! A Must Get Its Easy To Apply My Foundation With Since One Of The Sponges Is Bigger n Fatter Which Is Really Good</li>
            <li> First- I&#x27;ve never used the name brand beauty blender. However, I can say this blender gives great coverage. It expands and absorbs water so as to not absorb your foundation into it. It is easy to clean (I just use some hand soap) and a great tool to use for foundation, blush, highlighter, bronzer, whatever you would like.</li>
            <li> No issues, came as advertised</li>
            <li> I actually like this sponge.  It covers well and works fine.  Gets in all the right places and the make-up does not absorb into the sponge like some do.</li>
            <li> I dont know why anyone would purchace the beauty blender for full price. This one works just as well for the price and its even better because I got TWO!!</li>
            <li> Cute packaging and I thought I would love them. However, they are very hard and thick. This makes it hard to use for make up. It just absorbs every product.</li>
            <li> They are like any other beauty blender without the expense. Really good. Fast shipping although I prefer black as the stains dnt show up as much</li>
            <li> These are pretty bad.  They don&#x27;t absorb any water and are very firm.  I don&#x27;t suggest them</li>
            <li> They came on time. The makeup application was so easy and blended very well. Definitely a future repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love these! I kept reading about how great they were, but the &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; ones were like $25 each! I found these, thought &#x27;what the heck&#x27; and now I love them! They are probably worth the expensive price, so these are a steal. Really flawless, smooth, easy coverage with a variety of cream and liquid foundations and concealers. Worth it!</li>
            <li> This seller needs to change the default image to show only 2 sponges, since that&#x27;s all you get. Just TWO! I realize it is in the title (pack of 2). but the title is so long, it gets cut off on this review, and on amazon&#x27;s app. I kind of feel ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the sponges are great, very soft.  I&#x27;ve only used them once but so far I really like them! they seem like they are decent quality.</li>
            <li> Two nice blenders and come in a little pouch. They are cute and they get the job done and they were shipped super fast</li>
            <li> Good quality product! Doesn&#x27;t absorb a lot of foundation.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all. It has a weird smell and the material is also very thick. Doesn&#x27;t give you an airbrush look. Nothing beats beauty blender</li>
            <li> If you have ever tried the actual real deal beauty blender, don&#x27;t buy these. They are no where near the quality of the real thing. These are hard no matter how much you try and soak them with water and they take more makeup to cover your face than the beauty blender. Sure it may seem like a good deal, but I would rather spend the money on something worth it. These are cheap. Maybe someone who hasn&#x27;t used a beauty blender would like them. I know I&#x27;m not impressed in the least. I used it once and now they&#x27;re in the trash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how on earth I managed to apply makeup before this. These things are fantastic. Putting on foundation was so much easier and I had coverage that lasted all day. I&#x27;ve never purchased the sponge that costs twice as much, so I can&#x27;t weigh in there, but I see no reason so far to bother.</li>
            <li> Not very fond of it. It made my skin dry in many when applying my foundation, definitely prefer brushes over these sponges</li>
            <li> Good but I think I will have to invest in the real Beauty Blenders.&lt;br /&gt;That has got the perfect finish!</li>
            <li> The sponge applicator has an ergonomic shape that is great for a good grip while putting on foundation and/or bb cream.  It allows me to cover my face evenly with the bb cream or foundation that i normally use.  It is durable enough to be washed after using it and also it retains the shape afterwards.  The sponge colors are pretty too.</li>
            <li> I use this to blend in my foundation. It works better than my brush (to me). Just spay a little water on it and use. This is just as good as the beauty blender. If I can figure out how to add a video to this review . I&#x27;ve washed this and reused with no problems.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like it helped at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had a beauty blender, but this is a darn good option at a fraction of the price.  It seems a little more dense/hard, but softens up well when you get it wet.</li>
            <li> perfectly puts any make up on without streaks, even better than using my own finger or other sponges, love it!</li>
            <li> This was not at all what i expected. I was expecting the quality of a beauty blender and this did not deliver. Even when wet it is hard and not flexable at all, it does not blend my makeup flawlessly and hurts your face in the process. even though its cheap do not buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Beauty Blender and I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $25 on ONE sponge so I wanted to give these a try. Boy am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;My makeup went on so amazingly it looked like it was done by a professional! I am THRILLED with my 2 new sponges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Pink one and a light Tan one. One is shaped like an Egg &amp;#60;4th one in in the photo&amp;#62; and the other looks just like the pink one &amp;#60;1st one in the photo&amp;#62;. They took water just fine. I was able to squeeze out any excess with no issues. Yes they expanded but no so much that they took on a different shape.&lt;br /&gt;I have seriously sensitive skin plus I&#x27;m allergic to all latex and bandages...and these were no issue at all. They felt so soft on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;They clean up very easily and dry in no time &amp;#60;I live in Texas where it&#x27;s hot in the winter!&amp;#62; and they go back nicely in the little zipper bag they were delivered to me in.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly - I don&#x27;t know what the big difference is between these sponges and the B.B. sponges - and honestly - I don&#x27;t care to spend my money on something else just to see when I already have a great product that cost me much less for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - GREAT PRICE! I would definitely recommend and will absolutely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge it allows me to apply foundation that looks even. I especially like it because it is nice for those times when you smudge your make up and need a quick fix up. I seem to have to blow my nose every time i complete my make up regimen and these sponges are nice because I can easily touch up around my nose to make it look even with the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist, always leaned toward perfect brushes.  Now, you do need good brushes, however, these sponges are fantastic.  They are especially helpful for use under the eyes where you don&#x27;t drag or roll the sponge you simply press.  The result is flawless.  You&#x27;ll be super amazed at the difference.</li>
            <li> A+ Service and Product!</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product.  Compared to similar, they are very low quality. Will not buy these again, and wish I could return them.</li>
            <li> Of all the knock off beauty blenders that I&#x27;ve tried, these are hands down the best! They are very soft and absorb water well. Love them!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to see how well they worked compared to the Beauty Blender and I love them! The key is to use these while damp and it applies concealer and foundation perfectly! These are cheaper and just as great!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it could be a good dupe for the Beauty Blender...  It&#x27;s not.  I was new to the BB world, so I bought both just to compare...  Wow.  I did half of my face with my BB and the other half with this.  I could not believe the difference.  The BB side just looked so much more flawless and airbrushed, The Pueen side just didn&#x27;t look good.  I can&#x27;t really even quite describe it.  It&#x27;s MUCH denser than the BB, it feels like you&#x27;re punching yourself in the face with it as opposed to the BB which is very soft and supple.  I guess it&#x27;s just the material that must make such a difference in how the application goes...  Not sure.  Up side to Pueen?  Well, they come in super cute colors and you get 2 different shapes...  The point is sharper on the Pueen, so it&#x27;s a little easier to get under the eyes with it as opposed to the BB.  HOWEVER, those reasons alone are not enough to get me to ever purchase this over the Beauty Blender.  :-)  Sorry, wanted to like it...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the actual beauty blender, but I am very happy with this product. I feel that it applies my make up wonderfully, especially my concealer. I have very dry skin and this adds extra moisture to my foundation so that it doesn&#x27;t look dry and cracked by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This sponge blends my concealer beautifully. Now my make-up application is almost flawless. I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
