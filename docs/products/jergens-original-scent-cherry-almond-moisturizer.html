            <li>She had no more complaints afterwards and it smells great! :)</li>
            <li>It came quickly and just as promised!</li>
            <li>Product came in real fast as needed so easy and love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love Jergens&#x27; products and I love this particular scent!  </li>
            <li>My skin is always smooth and hydrated with Jergens.  </li>
            <li>I find that it is cheaper if not just as cheap as Target when they have it on sale.</li>
            <li>Smell great,it makes my skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still the same great product &amp; just as when I was a kid</li>
            <li>i never bought the 32 ounce for such a great value.</li>
            <li>My adult daughter had never smelled it before and loved the scent.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ruin a good old product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a fantastic lotion with a rich, non-greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>plus for me was when I saw it was the original scent.</li>
            <li>DO NOT buy this lotion based on the descriptive \\&quot;original scent.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Says &amp;#34;original fragrance&amp;#34; but does not smell like the original from years ago</li>
            <li>This source is sending the ORIGINAL scent, which I don&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t think I was ordering....</li>
            <li>gave the 1st bottle away, thinking I had made a mistake in ordering, and ordered again, receiving, once again, the ORIGINAL scent and NOT the advertised CHERRY ALMOND, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the original cherry almond scent.</li>
            <li>came in original packaging</li>
            <li>I ordered both the Original Lotion and the Ultra Healing</li>
            <li>and I think the Original Lotion is just as moisturizing as the Ultra</li>
            <li>The pump keeps the bottle clean and the lotion has a clean smell that lasts throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying the true original lotion as pictured.</li>
            <li>so it brings back lots of good memories.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion so much I keep one on my desk at work and one at home.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very effective for dry skin and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting moisture and a great smell, this is the lotion for you!</li>
            <li>Plus they have other scents if you&#x27;re not a fan of the original cherry almond, but I AM!!!</li>
            <li>was the only way it worked and had a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will be smooth but not slick as it is readily absorbed.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it works very well to keep my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle, soft cherry almond scent and it moisturizes my hands without making them greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I have ordered this product several times and I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li>After putting this on for just about a week every morning after my showers, i could tell a difference on how smooth and soft my pressure points were.</li>
            <li>I might be the only one buying it online :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE be aware that this will not be the cherry almond scented hand lotion if you order.</li>
            <li>The scent of it brings back memories of days gone by for most of my friends who smell it.  </li>
            <li>The bottle says &amp;#34;long lasting moisture&#x27; and this is definitely true!</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and keeps my skin smooth and not dry in the winter and summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong of a smell and it faints after a short while.</li>
            <li>Came in the large pump bottles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in stores but Amazon has the large bottles at a good price.</li>
            <li>Amazon prices this product very competitively.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this Jergens lotion, and the fact that it&#x27;s not really greasy.</li>
            <li>Then I need something stronger, like Eucerin - the Jergens won&#x27;t cut it no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li>but it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>The lotion work very well and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love the clean smell of cherry almond and definitely need the lotion for my hands during this endless winter.</li>
            <li>I started using this a few years ago and at first my boyfriend at the time wasn&#x27;t so sure of the smell</li>
            <li>I hope they continue to make this classic lotion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>(that was worth every extra penny).</li>
            <li>When I became pregnant the scent was too strong, I couldn&#x27;t be in the same room when my husband used it until it had a few minutes to fade.</li>
            <li>This is the new one smells like chemicals</li>
            <li>There is a slight scent, not cloying or overpowering but, it is not the original Jergen&#x27;s cherry/ almond.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>smells like an old stock...</li>
            <li>Was delivered early and shipped in 1 day (arrived 2 days after order).</li>
            <li>However, I did not have to battle traffic and crowds near Christmas time</li>
            <li>Does well on my sensitive skin and eczema (your mileage may vary).  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but my sister does</li>
            <li>If you tend to have sensitive skin, find the ingredients listing on Jergens&#x27; website before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my regular purchase is usually the 21 oz with the 25% more for 7.99.</li>
            <li>The lotion moisturize well, but i am not a big fan of the smell, will buy a different one the next time, but other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li>no trouble w/credit..this is NOT the samne &#x27;white bottle&#x27;</li>
            <li>Excellent value for dry skin, especially for the cold winter months!</li>
            <li>The only down side was the price was a few bucks more than in stores.</li>
            <li>With Jergens, my skin stays soft and moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>I get really, REALLY dry skin sometimes and this is the only lotion that keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion so much I keep one on my desk at work and one at home.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very effective for dry skin and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting moisture and a great smell, this is the lotion for you!</li>
            <li> Plus they have other scents if you&#x27;re not a fan of the original cherry almond, but I AM!!!</li>
            <li> was the only way it worked and had a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will be smooth but not slick as it is readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works very well to keep my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle, soft cherry almond scent and it moisturizes my hands without making them greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I have ordered this product several times and I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> After putting this on for just about a week every morning after my showers, i could tell a difference on how smooth and soft my pressure points were.</li>
            <li> I might be the only one buying it online :)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE be aware that this will not be the cherry almond scented hand lotion if you order.</li>
            <li> The scent of it brings back memories of days gone by for most of my friends who smell it.  </li>
            <li> The bottle says &amp;#34;long lasting moisture&#x27; and this is definitely true!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and keeps my skin smooth and not dry in the winter and summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong of a smell and it faints after a short while.</li>
            <li> Came in the large pump bottles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores but Amazon has the large bottles at a good price.</li>
            <li> Amazon prices this product very competitively.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this Jergens lotion, and the fact that it&#x27;s not really greasy.</li>
            <li> Then I need something stronger, like Eucerin - the Jergens won&#x27;t cut it no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> but it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> The lotion work very well and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love the clean smell of cherry almond and definitely need the lotion for my hands during this endless winter.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few years ago and at first my boyfriend at the time wasn&#x27;t so sure of the smell</li>
            <li> I hope they continue to make this classic lotion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> (that was worth every extra penny).</li>
            <li> When I became pregnant the scent was too strong, I couldn&#x27;t be in the same room when my husband used it until it had a few minutes to fade.</li>
            <li> This is the new one smells like chemicals</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent, not cloying or overpowering but, it is not the original Jergen&#x27;s cherry/ almond.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> smells like an old stock...</li>
            <li> Was delivered early and shipped in 1 day (arrived 2 days after order).</li>
            <li> However, I did not have to battle traffic and crowds near Christmas time</li>
            <li> Does well on my sensitive skin and eczema (your mileage may vary).  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but my sister does</li>
            <li> If you tend to have sensitive skin, find the ingredients listing on Jergens&#x27; website before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my regular purchase is usually the 21 oz with the 25% more for 7.99.</li>
            <li> The lotion moisturize well, but i am not a big fan of the smell, will buy a different one the next time, but other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> no trouble w/credit..this is NOT the samne &#x27;white bottle&#x27;</li>
            <li> Excellent value for dry skin, especially for the cold winter months!</li>
            <li> The only down side was the price was a few bucks more than in stores.</li>
            <li> With Jergens, my skin stays soft and moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I get really, REALLY dry skin sometimes and this is the only lotion that keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I only need a couple pumps a day, this 32 ounce bottle is gonna last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also long lasting meaning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for those who live in dry climates or areas with cold, windy winters.</li>
            <li> Dry skin contributes to potential skin infections.</li>
            <li> Lotion works well here in mid states because it is so dry in the winter and this helps to relieve and prevent chapped hands and skin.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for years and although you can finds lots of Jengens Products out there, it is very difficult to find this one, the original, at least, it is for me!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using any other lotion.</li>
            <li> It has been around for a very long time and that&#x27;s because it works.</li>
            <li> In winter, sometimes my hands get really dry</li>
            <li> So my elbows and knees are usually dry and rough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a heavy-duty lotion though.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of this and gave it to my grandmother to use because she has very dry skin which tends to be extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> With other lotions, I find myself having to apply it every half hour or hour because I can feel my skin getting dry.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe that you can still find this lotion and that it still smells the same.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m not pregnant I can use it again.  </li>
            <li> I remember it from when I was a little girl</li>
            <li> and its a few bucks cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion everyday.</li>
            <li> Living in a place with brutal winters, my skin quickly gets dry.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy these from rite aid or cvs</li>
            <li> I got so tired of trying to find a moisterizing lotion that worked when I put it on, was not so heavy that rubbing in then rubbing off</li>
            <li> It has a thick, creamy feel and an unobtrusive scent.  </li>
            <li> After a few years i became sick of either waiting for deals or going to the store to purchase the product, so i started to look at alternatives.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;do other people around u a favor and do NOT wear this horrible scent!</li>
            <li> It does not smell artificial and you won&#x27;t annoy anyone by using it.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed I promise.</li>
            <li> This product had a terrible vinyl industrial solvent smell..</li>

            <li> I love this product and I have ordered this product several times and I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> Great seller... AAA+++</li>
            <li> Great for the whole family!  This is a very good lotion. It absorbs well and smell absolutely amazing! It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I only bought it from here b/c I had a gc that I wanted to use up.  I love the product (always have) but it&#x27;s 2 times what it costs in Walmart!</li>
            <li> Brings back childhood memories!  Love the clean smell of cherry almond and definitely need the lotion for my hands during this endless winter.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works very well to keep my skin feeling soft. Dry skin contributes to potential skin infections.</li>
            <li> I never put lotion on my body. So my elbows and knees are usually dry and rough. After putting this on for just about a week every morning after my showers, i could tell a difference on how smooth and soft my pressure points were. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of this and gave it to my grandmother to use because she has very dry skin which tends to be extremely itchy. She had no more complaints afterwards and it smells great! :)</li>
            <li> I love the jergens original scent lotion. use it allways.  and its a few bucks cheaper on amazon. nuff said</li>
            <li> I love Jergens&#x27; products and I love this particular scent!  I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> What can say except that I&#x27;ve been using this product since the beginning of  time. LOL That being said Jergens Lotion has not changed one bit it has been a consistently great product that delivers exactly what it says it does. A great lotion that helps keep your skin soft and non-greasy. I recommend everyone to buy this Lotion you won&#x27;t be disappointed I promise.Great quality.Great price.</li>
            <li> Great product..fast shipping</li>
            <li> I got so tired of trying to find a moisterizing lotion that worked when I put it on, was not so heavy that rubbing in then rubbing off was the only way it worked and had a nice scent.  Jergens has been around for decades so I took the chance on maybe it was still the lightweight lotion I remembered.  It is!  I got the larger bottle and divided some of it into smaller bottles.  One in my purse, at work, the bathroom, etc.  Love the feel, love the texture.  Not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;A plus for me was when I saw it was the original scent. The women in my family all used this lotion and I would be able to recognize the beautiful scent.  DO NOT buy this lotion based on the descriptive \\&quot;original scent.\\&quot;  It is not there. There is a slight scent, not cloying or overpowering but, it is not the original Jergen&#x27;s cherry/ almond. Oh well.  I love the lotion. Wearing a memory would have been a plus.</li>
            <li> I used to only use Bath and Body Works all of the time.  After a few years i became sick of either waiting for deals or going to the store to purchase the product, so i started to look at alternatives.  I love this product.  My skin is always smooth and hydrated with Jergens.  It also has a nice scent to it as well.  Amazon prices this product very competitively.  I find that it is cheaper if not just as cheap as Target when they have it on sale.</li>
            <li> Says &amp;#34;original fragrance&amp;#34; but does not smell like the original from years ago</li>
            <li> This will forever be my favorite lotion. Most hydrating and I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li> Nothing better for hands, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, use it all the time and have for many years.  It came quickly and just as promised!</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer, perhaps not THE best one out there but the smell of this is just wonderful.  It&#x27;s a light cherry-almond scent that is not overpowering but very light and sensual.  It does not smell artificial and you won&#x27;t annoy anyone by using it.  Your skin will be smooth but not slick as it is readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion ever.</li>
            <li> You can smell it right way from across the room it has a really great scent and works.  We used this lotion before I became pregnant and we loved the smell, we do buy two scents and switch so we don&#x27;t tire of one scent.  When I became pregnant the scent was too strong, I couldn&#x27;t be in the same room when my husband used it until it had a few minutes to fade. Now that I&#x27;m not pregnant I can use it again.  During pregnancy we switched to the coco butter scented one.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years now. Pleasant scent, no oily after-feeling. And for some reason my neices like saying &amp;#34;cherry almond&amp;#34; whenever they smell it.</li>
            <li> favorite lotion. I love the smell and the feel..</li>
            <li> I use this lotion everyday. The pump keeps the bottle clean and the lotion has a clean smell that lasts throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Smell great,it makes my skin feel smooth but if you want to save $9.00 get it at Wal-Mart the same size but cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love Jergens Original Scent??</li>
            <li> smells like an old stock...I might be the only one buying it online :)..won&#x27;t do the mistake again... .. ;</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for years.  It has a wonderful fragrance and is velvet glove smooth.</li>
            <li> Was as described. Came in the large pump bottles. Was delivered early and shipped in 1 day (arrived 2 days after order). The only down side was the price was a few bucks more than in stores. However, I did not have to battle traffic and crowds near Christmas time (that was worth every extra penny). Lotion works well here in mid states because it is so dry in the winter and this helps to relieve and prevent chapped hands and skin. Would recommend if you cant make it to store or would rather not go to store. both were packaged with bubble wrap and were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> this stuff STINKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;smells like ferilizer and a bunch of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;do other people around u a favor and do NOT wear this horrible scent!</li>
            <li> The lotion moisturize well, but i am not a big fan of the smell, will buy a different one the next time, but other than that it is ok.</li>
            <li> Product came in real fast as needed so easy and love the scent.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion</li>
            <li> The smell is incredulous!</li>
            <li> The lotion is a staple in our home.  I love the gentle, soft cherry almond scent and it moisturizes my hands without making them greasy.  I hope they continue to make this classic lotion.  It has been around for a very long time and that&#x27;s because it works.</li>
            <li> This product had a terrible vinyl industrial solvent smell..one pump and I called Amazon...no trouble w/credit..this is NOT the samne &#x27;white bottle&#x27; Jergens my Mom always used. that was silky and fragrant...I&#x27;m 61...</li>
            <li> This is NOT the Cherry Almond scent...This source is sending the ORIGINAL scent, which I don&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t think I was ordering....&lt;br /&gt;I gave the 1st bottle away, thinking I had made a mistake in ordering, and ordered again, receiving, once again, the ORIGINAL scent and NOT the advertised CHERRY ALMOND, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shame, I was trying to get cherry almond as I love that scent and use the hand soap with the fragrance......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE be aware that this will not be the cherry almond scented hand lotion if you order.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing, but the scent is rather strong and of baby lotion smell. I&#x27;m not fond of the smell but the lotion is good.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but when I went to use one of them, the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  I had to put it in another bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for dry skin, especially for the cold winter months! Moisturizer works instantly. I don&#x27;t mind the original cherry almond scent.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I was a child and it&#x27;s still the same great product &amp; just as when I was a kid I LOVE the smell.  It smells so yummy.</li>
            <li> Giant size bottle!  I love the smell of this Jergens lotion, and the fact that it&#x27;s not really greasy. I use it all day at work.  It&#x27;s not really a heavy-duty lotion though.  In winter, sometimes my hands get really dry and my fingertips even crack. Then I need something stronger, like Eucerin - the Jergens won&#x27;t cut it no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> came in original packaging</li>
            <li> This is the original unostentatious cherry-almond Jergens that I have always loved.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the expensive lotions, (mostly gifts), but always prefer to buy the Jergens.  This was a good price too!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for years and although you can finds lots of Jengens Products out there, it is very difficult to find this one, the original, at least, it is for me! Now I have it!  Hurray !!!!!  :)  :)</li>
            <li> I usually buy these from rite aid or cvs but I recently saw these on amazon and i know buying these would turn out to be a great purchase. i never bought the 32 ounce for such a great value. my regular purchase is usually the 21 oz with the 25% more for 7.99. Whereas on amazon you get the 32 oz for the same 7.99. my fianc&amp;eacute; and i love Jergens and now i know where i can get my money worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York</li>
            <li> The item delivered was not the same lotion as pictured. Jergens recently changed their lotion. I thought I was buying the true original lotion as pictured.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe that you can still find this lotion and that it still smells the same.  I remember it from when I was a little girl and my mother used it and that was 70 years ago.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores but Amazon has the large bottles at a good price. I ordered both the Original Lotion and the Ultra Healing and I think the Original Lotion is just as moisturizing as the Ultra and I like the scent a lot better.</li>
            <li> Best product ever made.  I LOVE Jergen&#x27;s original cherry almond scent.  It moisturizes wonderfully and everyone I know recognizes the smell.  The scent of it brings back memories of days gone by for most of my friends who smell it.  My nieces always knew it it as &amp;#34;Mary&#x27;s smell&amp;#34;.  It works great!</li>
            <li> This was a really good price for the quantity.  My adult daughter had never smelled it before and loved the scent.  I grew up with my aunts and grandmothers using this  so it brings back lots of good memories.  The lotion is very effective for dry skin and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> great love the product will continue to order, have used in for many years, will continue to order this idem</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good lotion. The smell is really nice at first but once it&#x27;s all rubbed into your skin it just smells like baby powder which I don&#x27;t like. But it works well so I&#x27;m not going to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion that I have ever used. I get really, REALLY dry skin sometimes and this is the only lotion that keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I love the way it smells, the original cherry almond scent has a very pleasant smell. The bottle says &amp;#34;long lasting moisture&#x27; and this is definitely true! With other lotions, I find myself having to apply it every half hour or hour because I can feel my skin getting dry. With Jergens, my skin stays soft and moisturized all day long. It&#x27;s also long lasting meaning I only need a couple pumps a day, this 32 ounce bottle is gonna last for a very long time. I love this lotion so much I keep one on my desk at work and one at home. I will never go back to using any other lotion. If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting moisture and a great smell, this is the lotion for you! Plus they have other scents if you&#x27;re not a fan of the original cherry almond, but I AM!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I started using this a few years ago and at first my boyfriend at the time wasn&#x27;t so sure of the smell but now he likes it too. It&#x27;s not too strong of a smell and it faints after a short while. It&#x27;s not a greasy lotion but it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of those, and the help it provides to keep my body moist in the winter. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my all time favorite. I can&#x27;t get enough of the perfect Cherry-Almond smell. I love it. I&#x27;ve tried to buy store brand copy of the this type of lotion before and it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Good product for everyone here at the office.</li>
            <li> I love the original scent of Jergens.  I don&#x27;t wear perfume any longer but this gives me a very clean scent.  It is also wonderful for my hands, elbows and heels.  Can&#x27;t ruin a good old product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and keeps my skin smooth and not dry in the winter and summer.&lt;br /&gt;The cherry almond smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> This lotion has been a household staple for many many years and will always be in the house at any and all times, thank you very much for the quickness of getting it sent out and the price was great also.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean scent and absorbs quickly.  Does well on my sensitive skin and eczema (your mileage may vary).  The price is good for the huge size.</li>
            <li> This is the new one smells like chemicals</li>
            <li> Living in a place with brutal winters, my skin quickly gets dry.  Jergens is my go-to basic body lotion.  It has a thick, creamy feel and an unobtrusive scent.  I use it every day after I shower to keep my skin supple and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but my sister does and I know she uses this product without problems.  If you tend to have sensitive skin, find the ingredients listing on Jergens&#x27; website before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fantastic lotion with a rich, non-greasy feel.  It&#x27;s fantastic for those who live in dry climates or areas with cold, windy winters.</li>
            <li> The classic original scent which is as marvelous as it was when my Mom used it about 50 years ago.  A smell that is wonderful and full of great memories.  The lotion work very well and is not greasy.  Skin feels wonderful.</li>
