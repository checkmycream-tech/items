            <li>The best part are the two large zippers pockets that are the length of the organizer.  </li>

            <li>Cute and handy.  </li>
            <li>It took a while to arrive, but is bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li>Good buy, super handy.</li>
            <li>well considering I&#x27;ve got a good couple pounds worth of nail polish stored in there!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and the handle on top was torn and one snap does not work.  </li>
            <li>I love my bag.</li>
            <li>Too big for my purse, but great for traveling!</li>
            <li>but I thought it would be made better.</li>
            <li>but I think I will order a couple more and then give them to her for her doll clothing.</li>
            <li>Fits in my slouch purse perfectly and keeps all my stuff from getting all mixed together.</li>
            <li>It was great to have so much room.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was more durable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in my purse, but I love it as portable storage for stationary items.</li>
            <li>love the compartments and how you can expand it or snap the ends to it lays</li>
            <li>I LOVE these.</li>
            <li>I love using it in my purses, helps out a lot.</li>
            <li>I just love this</li>

            <li>Even better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it and it is just like described.</li>
            <li>Love the color as well.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I like to be organized and found myself digging around in my purse and never being able to find what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d ordered more for gifts.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this bag.</li>
            <li>love this product :)</li>
            <li>have found the smaller of the interior zippered pouches makes a perfect makeup case, with my more often used lipstick tucked in a mesh side pocket.</li>
            <li>I am gong to buy a couple more as gifts.</li>
            <li>I got this product cheap to do an honest review.</li>
            <li>You can fit all kinds of stuff in this thing!</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li>If you have to search for a specific item in your purse for more than 30 seconds you have to get one of these!!!</li>
            <li>I originally bought one to put all my Geocaching supplies in and ended up getting another one for my purse!</li>
            <li>When I made my original purchase, the price was under $2.00!  </li>
            <li>Great new colors.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the insert and am using it right now.</li>
            <li>I can easily find things in my bag--No more embarrassing moments when I&#x27;m locking for my coupon, my change, my pen.</li>
            <li>The handles at the top make it so easy to change from purse to purse (or pocketbook to pocketbook).</li>
            <li>Anyone looking for a large size insert/purse organizer may find this to be a good product.  </li>
            <li>It has a great middle area that is open, but perfectly sized for me to put both my Kindle and Kindle Fire into it.  </li>
            <li>very handy and has even help up to frequent washing.</li>
            <li>So far this is working out very nicely.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is perfect.</li>
            <li>easy to move from purse to purse.  </li>
            <li>Easy to transfer from purse to purse.</li>
            <li>There are lots of pockets, which is the main reason why I bought three of them, and it&#x27;s a good price.  </li>
            <li>the rest of the bag is fine.  </li>
            <li>Although some people have commented on the stitching, my bag was fine.</li>
            <li>I seen where people were commenting that it was cheap and sewn crappy.</li>
            <li>It has several nice sized mesh pockets on the outside that are perfect for lip glosses, packs of gum, lotions etc.  </li>
            <li>This thing was really, really cheap.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and pockets that will fit my items.</li>
            <li>Holds so much and keeps it all nice and organized.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they ship this all the way from China for free for that price, but they did.</li>
            <li>I love this organizer so much, so I bought 8 others for my friends and family!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I love all the pockets and the two large interior sections too.</li>
            <li>The item is exactly as advertised - I really love the colors and it&#x27;s a fun way to keep purse organized.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great piece, not the color i expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this nylon handbag as a purse insert/organizer for a couple months and has held up very well, I love all the pockets and 2 zip up compartments.</li>
            <li>Loved it entirely, and love how much can be placed into it.</li>
            <li>overall a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;once items are added to the organizer, it maintains its shape pretty well, but otherwise folds up easily for stashing away elsewhere when not in use.</li>
            <li>Now I can find what I need quickly without fumbling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exactly what I wanted - everything in place for a quick change of pocketbook.</li>
            <li>This bag is perfect for those who don&#x27;t have alot to hold, this bag does open up bigger than when you recieve it.</li>
            <li>By far, one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought for myself to keep me from having a purse that weighs me down or having everything but the kitchen sink in my purse.</li>
            <li>Love this ....makes it easy to find things in my big purses.  </li>
            <li>Love this -- fits right in my new bag -- holds everything i need it to -- waited about two months to get -- so be prepared to wait for shipment ..</li>
            <li>Instead I created my own dividers for the middle section and put my coupons between the dividers.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that the quality of the product better than the price would have led me to believe.</li>
            <li>It was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I thought it was bigger, my own fault for not reading description of the product.</li>
            <li>its definitely worth the three bucks</li>
            <li>so far is the bright green color, very easy to see at the bottom of my purse.</li>
            <li>This is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It fits right into the bottom of a light-green travel tote I made.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can use this instead of trying to struggle switching purses, and I&#x27;m super picky about purses so this definitely works.</li>
            <li>great item for the small price</li>
            <li>Price/shipping was also great compared to some that are small and not made well.  </li>
            <li>It keeps all your tiny essentials at place and easy transfers them to another bag, in a matter of seconds!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy this---not at all the size shown--very very very small--no way</li>
            <li>I own the pink one.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture and fits all expectations.</li>
            <li>I would have rated it higher if it didn&#x27;t start to fray after two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>It allows me to keep my things organized, it holds everything I need it too, and it makes switching bags very convenient!</li>
            <li>It was exactly how it was pictured.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>She carries those limp canvas bags with zero pockets and I thought this would be a good introductory organizer so she could try it out and possibly order a better one</li>
            <li>Thank you guys soo much!</li>
            <li>It has snaps at the top and bottom on the sides to open up like a square..</li>
            <li>I think it is well/sturdy made yet light (soft padding).  </li>
            <li>/&gt; very spacious compartments fits just right</li>
            <li>, they make it easy to pull the entire organizer up and out of the bag if needed.</li>
            <li>but it is too large.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a purse that large.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a purse organizer for a while now that has zippers because when you&#x27;re carrying a large purse and it tips over.....</li>
            <li>It fits in my large purse.  </li>
            <li>i actually accidentally bought two of these and one seems to be holding up fine.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that within three weeks of having it, one of the little handles on top (which are really great for easy transfer to another purse) ripped off and frayed to pieces.  </li>
            <li>Nice little bag, has held together well for the price.</li>
            <li>ROOMY AND LOTS OF NICE LITTLE POCKETS AND ZIPPERED SECTIONS</li>
            <li>The bag is more than what I expected lots of pockets</li>
            <li>Really like this to put inside my purse</li>
            <li>It fit into my larger purse, no problem.  </li>
            <li>I just received it and its a better quality than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks I been looking for something like this</li>
            <li>I really like my handbag insert.</li>
            <li>When I received it I was ready to throw it away.</li>
            <li>I really like the way I can move it from one puse to another.</li>
            <li>Very convienent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not dumping my whole purse out trying to find things anymore.</li>
            <li>It has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight, but well made.  </li>
            <li>Makes it soooo much easier to change purses and helps you organize.</li>
            <li>fortunately i don&#x27;t really need the handles as i just use it to put stuff in my suitcase or purse.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>I did notice, as others have mentioned, that the plastic zippers don&#x27;t seem to be very sturdy at all</li>
            <li>and it holds so much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this for my coupons and scissors and things like that</li>
            <li>The fabrick is light  and looks fragile.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a generous zipper on two sides and they are big plastic prongs (not regular kind for clothing).</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Very useful in a purse without pockets (especially if you like to change purses often) or in a child&#x27;s activity bag to keep some order!</li>
            <li>The price was right, and it exceeded my expectations as far as quality and function as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pockets are arranged pretty well and allow relatively thorough organization of most things that purses contain on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, there were some loose threads, but nothing major.</li>
            <li>I feel like it could be made with a little more durable fabric........</li>
            <li>It even has snaps on each end to reduce the size if you have a more narrow purse.  </li>
            <li>Not a time saver for daily access, but to switch Purses, very quick if you can find the tiny handles.</li>
            <li>I like the color/s but one side of the mesh pocket is not sewn as secure as the other sides.</li>
            <li>previously mentioned, she carries the limp canvas bags and this fits it almost perfectly and still allows the bag to fall closed when she sets it</li>
            <li>There is more than enough room for wallet, brush, makeup, glasses, kindle PaperWhite or my kindle fire, small phone charger, phone, and all the rest of the must haves that are important enough to live in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It came in a reasonable amount of time considering the thousands of miles it traveled, and I love the zippered compartments for receipts and such, and all the little pockets for everything else.</li>
            <li>Since this is shipped from overseas it takes a long time to arrive, but is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>This handbag insert is exactly what I needed: sturdy, roomy, lightweight, and multiple compartments.</li>
            <li>I use this in my trunk to organize first aid, extra supplies for kids, etc.</li>
            <li>I will use the new one in the bathroom to store brushes, face cleansers, makeup, and hopefully clear up some of the clutter on my countertop!mething up at Target or Wallyworld.</li>
            <li>Good design, well made and just a little thing that just makes a busy life a little easier.</li>
            <li>The color is fairly accurate but a bit brighter than I was expecting - almost neon green.  </li>
            <li>it made a whole of a different in my purse.</li>
            <li>so I added an old lightweight keyring to the zipper pull on one side</li>
            <li>That was an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li>I really like the concept of this bag however after only using it for 1 week the stitching is coming out.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more, one in pink, and the other in orange.</li>
            <li>I also like the bright lime green though a lighter grey color inside is better for me as i can find things easier but at least it isn&#x27;t black inside.  </li>
            <li>It is small, but I feel that it does the job for a newbie couponer, for when you don&#x27;t want to carry a huge coupon binder into the store.</li>
            <li>the older I get, and the old organizer I have gets turned upside down in my new purses.</li>
            <li>I have large purses and have spent a lot of time trying to dig out things that I knew were somewhere inside.  </li>
            <li>I put bulky zipper pulls on each side, so I know which pocket holds what and can access them in low light, like my car at the drive through window when I need cash for my monthly small fries.</li>
            <li>When I am not careful, stuff ends up all over the purse&#x27;s bottom anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t spend much so if it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>All the cords fit in the mesh pockets and there is room in the center for larger items, plus all the other pockets including the two zippers.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased one to try it out and have since purchased 5 more!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re purse organizers, but there is so much more you can use it for!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought more for gifts!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I feel so much more organized!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> The best part are the two large zippers pockets that are the length of the organizer.  </li>
            <li> This fits in my large totes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice bag with lots of pockets.</li>
            <li> Loved these and orderd for my coupons may order more goodquality</li>
            <li> It was a nice, inexpensive way to let a friend know I&#x27;m thinking of her.</li>
            <li> This is great for organization and finding things quickly.  </li>
            <li> It holds all of my makeup and more, and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it!</li>
            <li> Cute and handy.  </li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive, but is bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li> Good buy, super handy.</li>
            <li> well considering I&#x27;ve got a good couple pounds worth of nail polish stored in there!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and the handle on top was torn and one snap does not work.  </li>
            <li> I love my bag.</li>
            <li> Too big for my purse, but great for traveling!</li>
            <li> but I thought it would be made better.</li>
            <li> but I think I will order a couple more and then give them to her for her doll clothing.</li>
            <li> Fits in my slouch purse perfectly and keeps all my stuff from getting all mixed together.</li>
            <li> It was great to have so much room.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was more durable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in my purse, but I love it as portable storage for stationary items.</li>
            <li> love the compartments and how you can expand it or snap the ends to it lays</li>
            <li> I LOVE these.</li>
            <li> I love using it in my purses, helps out a lot.</li>
            <li> I just love this</li>
            <li> If you love organization like me</li>
            <li> more searching for keys, etc.</li>
            <li> There are snaps on the ends at top and bottom for if you don&#x27;t have a lot in it....</li>
            <li> Even better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it and it is just like described.</li>
            <li> Love the color as well.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I like to be organized and found myself digging around in my purse and never being able to find what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d ordered more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this bag.</li>
            <li> love this product :)</li>
            <li> have found the smaller of the interior zippered pouches makes a perfect makeup case, with my more often used lipstick tucked in a mesh side pocket.</li>
            <li> I am gong to buy a couple more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I got this product cheap to do an honest review.</li>
            <li> You can fit all kinds of stuff in this thing!</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li> If you have to search for a specific item in your purse for more than 30 seconds you have to get one of these!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought one to put all my Geocaching supplies in and ended up getting another one for my purse!</li>
            <li> When I made my original purchase, the price was under $2.00!  </li>
            <li> Great new colors.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the insert and am using it right now.</li>
            <li> I can easily find things in my bag--No more embarrassing moments when I&#x27;m locking for my coupon, my change, my pen.</li>
            <li> The handles at the top make it so easy to change from purse to purse (or pocketbook to pocketbook).</li>
            <li> Anyone looking for a large size insert/purse organizer may find this to be a good product.  </li>
            <li> It has a great middle area that is open, but perfectly sized for me to put both my Kindle and Kindle Fire into it.  </li>
            <li> very handy and has even help up to frequent washing.</li>
            <li> So far this is working out very nicely.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is perfect.</li>
            <li> easy to move from purse to purse.  </li>
            <li> Easy to transfer from purse to purse.</li>
            <li> There are lots of pockets, which is the main reason why I bought three of them, and it&#x27;s a good price.  </li>
            <li> the rest of the bag is fine.  </li>
            <li> Although some people have commented on the stitching, my bag was fine.</li>
            <li> I seen where people were commenting that it was cheap and sewn crappy.</li>
            <li> It has several nice sized mesh pockets on the outside that are perfect for lip glosses, packs of gum, lotions etc.  </li>
            <li> This thing was really, really cheap.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and pockets that will fit my items.</li>
            <li> Holds so much and keeps it all nice and organized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they ship this all the way from China for free for that price, but they did.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer so much, so I bought 8 others for my friends and family!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I love all the pockets and the two large interior sections too.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as advertised - I really love the colors and it&#x27;s a fun way to keep purse organized.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a great piece, not the color i expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nylon handbag as a purse insert/organizer for a couple months and has held up very well, I love all the pockets and 2 zip up compartments.</li>
            <li> Loved it entirely, and love how much can be placed into it.</li>
            <li> overall a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;once items are added to the organizer, it maintains its shape pretty well, but otherwise folds up easily for stashing away elsewhere when not in use.</li>
            <li> Now I can find what I need quickly without fumbling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exactly what I wanted - everything in place for a quick change of pocketbook.</li>
            <li> This bag is perfect for those who don&#x27;t have alot to hold, this bag does open up bigger than when you recieve it.</li>
            <li> By far, one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought for myself to keep me from having a purse that weighs me down or having everything but the kitchen sink in my purse.</li>
            <li> Love this ....makes it easy to find things in my big purses.  </li>
            <li> Love this -- fits right in my new bag -- holds everything i need it to -- waited about two months to get -- so be prepared to wait for shipment ..</li>
            <li> Instead I created my own dividers for the middle section and put my coupons between the dividers.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that the quality of the product better than the price would have led me to believe.</li>
            <li> It was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I thought it was bigger, my own fault for not reading description of the product.</li>
            <li> its definitely worth the three bucks</li>
            <li> so far is the bright green color, very easy to see at the bottom of my purse.</li>
            <li> This is just the right size.</li>
            <li> It fits right into the bottom of a light-green travel tote I made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can use this instead of trying to struggle switching purses, and I&#x27;m super picky about purses so this definitely works.</li>
            <li> great item for the small price</li>
            <li> Price/shipping was also great compared to some that are small and not made well.  </li>
            <li> It keeps all your tiny essentials at place and easy transfers them to another bag, in a matter of seconds!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this---not at all the size shown--very very very small--no way</li>
            <li> I own the pink one.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture and fits all expectations.</li>
            <li> I would have rated it higher if it didn&#x27;t start to fray after two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> It allows me to keep my things organized, it holds everything I need it too, and it makes switching bags very convenient!</li>
            <li> It was exactly how it was pictured.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> She carries those limp canvas bags with zero pockets and I thought this would be a good introductory organizer so she could try it out and possibly order a better one</li>
            <li> Thank you guys soo much!</li>
            <li> It has snaps at the top and bottom on the sides to open up like a square..</li>
            <li> I think it is well/sturdy made yet light (soft padding).  </li>
            <li> /&gt; very spacious compartments fits just right</li>
            <li> , they make it easy to pull the entire organizer up and out of the bag if needed.</li>
            <li> but it is too large.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a purse that large.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a purse organizer for a while now that has zippers because when you&#x27;re carrying a large purse and it tips over.....</li>
            <li> It fits in my large purse.  </li>
            <li> i actually accidentally bought two of these and one seems to be holding up fine.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that within three weeks of having it, one of the little handles on top (which are really great for easy transfer to another purse) ripped off and frayed to pieces.  </li>
            <li> Nice little bag, has held together well for the price.</li>
            <li> ROOMY AND LOTS OF NICE LITTLE POCKETS AND ZIPPERED SECTIONS</li>
            <li> The bag is more than what I expected lots of pockets</li>
            <li> Really like this to put inside my purse</li>
            <li> It fit into my larger purse, no problem.  </li>
            <li> I just received it and its a better quality than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks I been looking for something like this</li>
            <li> I really like my handbag insert.</li>
            <li> When I received it I was ready to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I really like the way I can move it from one puse to another.</li>
            <li> Very convienent.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not dumping my whole purse out trying to find things anymore.</li>
            <li> It has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight, but well made.  </li>
            <li> Makes it soooo much easier to change purses and helps you organize.</li>
            <li> fortunately i don&#x27;t really need the handles as i just use it to put stuff in my suitcase or purse.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> I did notice, as others have mentioned, that the plastic zippers don&#x27;t seem to be very sturdy at all</li>
            <li> and it holds so much.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this for my coupons and scissors and things like that</li>
            <li> The fabrick is light  and looks fragile.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a generous zipper on two sides and they are big plastic prongs (not regular kind for clothing).</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Very useful in a purse without pockets (especially if you like to change purses often) or in a child&#x27;s activity bag to keep some order!</li>
            <li> The price was right, and it exceeded my expectations as far as quality and function as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pockets are arranged pretty well and allow relatively thorough organization of most things that purses contain on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, there were some loose threads, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I feel like it could be made with a little more durable fabric........</li>
            <li> It even has snaps on each end to reduce the size if you have a more narrow purse.  </li>
            <li> Not a time saver for daily access, but to switch Purses, very quick if you can find the tiny handles.</li>
            <li> I like the color/s but one side of the mesh pocket is not sewn as secure as the other sides.</li>
            <li> previously mentioned, she carries the limp canvas bags and this fits it almost perfectly and still allows the bag to fall closed when she sets it</li>
            <li> There is more than enough room for wallet, brush, makeup, glasses, kindle PaperWhite or my kindle fire, small phone charger, phone, and all the rest of the must haves that are important enough to live in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came in a reasonable amount of time considering the thousands of miles it traveled, and I love the zippered compartments for receipts and such, and all the little pockets for everything else.</li>
            <li> Since this is shipped from overseas it takes a long time to arrive, but is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> This handbag insert is exactly what I needed: sturdy, roomy, lightweight, and multiple compartments.</li>
            <li> I use this in my trunk to organize first aid, extra supplies for kids, etc.</li>
            <li> I will use the new one in the bathroom to store brushes, face cleansers, makeup, and hopefully clear up some of the clutter on my countertop!mething up at Target or Wallyworld.</li>
            <li> Good design, well made and just a little thing that just makes a busy life a little easier.</li>
            <li> The color is fairly accurate but a bit brighter than I was expecting - almost neon green.  </li>
            <li> it made a whole of a different in my purse.</li>
            <li> so I added an old lightweight keyring to the zipper pull on one side</li>
            <li> That was an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li> I really like the concept of this bag however after only using it for 1 week the stitching is coming out.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more, one in pink, and the other in orange.</li>
            <li> I also like the bright lime green though a lighter grey color inside is better for me as i can find things easier but at least it isn&#x27;t black inside.  </li>
            <li> It is small, but I feel that it does the job for a newbie couponer, for when you don&#x27;t want to carry a huge coupon binder into the store.</li>
            <li> the older I get, and the old organizer I have gets turned upside down in my new purses.</li>
            <li> I have large purses and have spent a lot of time trying to dig out things that I knew were somewhere inside.  </li>
            <li> I put bulky zipper pulls on each side, so I know which pocket holds what and can access them in low light, like my car at the drive through window when I need cash for my monthly small fries.</li>
            <li> When I am not careful, stuff ends up all over the purse&#x27;s bottom anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spend much so if it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> All the cords fit in the mesh pockets and there is room in the center for larger items, plus all the other pockets including the two zippers.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted except I wish there was a hard insert for the bottom to keep it open.  </li>
            <li> do like the two side flat zipper pockets, for cash and gift cards and receipts.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but works for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> More pockets than others of similar design, and less expensive!  </li>
            <li> I came earlier in the mail than expected as well!!</li>
            <li> There likely are other nicer organizers out there, but for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that there is a part in one of zipper pockets that wasn&#x27;t sewn, but it&#x27;s such a small thing I still rated it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this little hand bag.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in several colors as gifts for workmates as a little morale booster.  </li>
            <li> This little organizer is a must for every woman, especially for an unorganized, like me.</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> so I know I will have to be careful with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One even zippers closed,</li>
            <li> didnt happen with my other three bags must of been a lemon</li>
            <li> this are too big for your purse but too small for anything else.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble knowing which long zippered compartment had my wallet in it</li>
            <li> One for my purse &amp; the other for my daughter&#x27;s locker.</li>
            <li> and i can use it for couponing and other things</li>
            <li> It has plenty of pockets and when expanded is extremely roomy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the price was cheaper than other ones I saw.</li>
            <li> (you can therefore use only the side pockets and/or 2 zippered pockets and use the center to put in flat thin things).</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I am not sure if it will hold up well long term.</li>
            <li> I also how you can also enlarge the center area by unsnapping a few side snaps.</li>
            <li> Then I put it down in my purse and it helps keep my purse in check.</li>
            <li> that way you can slim it down if needed.  </li>
            <li> flashlight(a little one) and other little pesky stuff in the side pockets but</li>
            <li> But at this price, I was expecting less.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all and its a dark green not the color in the picture!</li>
            <li> I purchased this (the green one) for less than four dollars</li>
            <li> I put a little bit of everything in this bag.</li>
            <li> NEAT LITTLE ORGANIZER,  </li>
            <li> There is a little bit of padding on each side.  </li>
            <li> on the other one, one of the small handles has detached and begun to unravel.</li>
            <li> So if this is what you looking for to carry to a party with little fuss then this is your bag, It&#x27;s also you bag for couponers....</li>
            <li> If you look around a little on Amazon, you can find almost any color.</li>
            <li> The green is not lime as the picture leaves you to be, it is a kelly grass green.</li>
            <li> I chose the lime green..</li>
            <li> I have grown tired of constant searching and keys falling to the &amp;#34;black hole&amp;#34; of the bottom of my purse…no more/problem solved!!!</li>
            <li> Not cheap like I thought.  </li>
            <li> This purse organizer is a bit on the thin side so time will tell how well this holds up with daily use.</li>
            <li> organizer isn&#x27;t stiff but the lightweight fiberfill lining helps it to stand up by itself and keep its shape.</li>
            <li> Lots of pockets to organize and interior space for my wallet and small make-up bag.</li>
            <li> no more searching.</li>
            <li> My purse used to be very heavy as soon</li>
            <li> The Zippers are thick.  </li>
            <li> I mean come on, for what you pay for this</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with it....</li>
            <li> the organizer is useless if everything falls out.  </li>
            <li> Was not impressed and then the color was not correct.  </li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend whose purse is always a horrible mess.  </li>
            <li> I was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I like the color/s but one side of the mesh pocket is not sewn as secure as the other sides.</li>
            <li> love it!  arrived way sooner than estimated.  great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I love my bag. I put a little bit of everything in this bag. Then I put it down in my purse and it helps keep my purse in check.</li>
            <li> Too big for my purse, but great for traveling!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and the handle on top was torn and one snap does not work.  It will hold my coupons but I thought it would be made better.</li>
            <li> The bag is more than what I expected lots of pockets and I actually ordered 2 at that price..I was going to give one to my daughter but I think I will order a couple more and then give them to her for her doll clothing. I came earlier in the mail than expected as well!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this---not at all the size shown--very very very small--no way could it hold a book--maybe pocket size--very flimsy too</li>
            <li> Really like this to put inside my purse</li>
            <li> Fits in my slouch purse perfectly and keeps all my stuff from getting all mixed together.</li>
            <li> loves my bag but the handle broke 3 days after ! didnt happen with my other three bags must of been a lemon</li>
            <li> great item for the small price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made well, and is perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bag! I use it to carry my coupons and it&#x27;s great. I own the pink one. I am a couponer and it&#x27;s a great way to carry my coupons in a discreet way. I use to carry a big notebook with baseball card holders...but it was too bulky. Instead I created my own dividers for the middle section and put my coupons between the dividers. The price is awesome and it&#x27;s totally worth it! Recommend for sure!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger but it was perfect... I use it for my coupons... I would recommend it..</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is well made and everything that I own fit in it perfectly.  It fit into my larger purse, no problem.  I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Very useful in a purse without pockets (especially if you like to change purses often) or in a child&#x27;s activity bag to keep some order! I&#x27;ve also used it when traveling for multiple uses, makeup/toiletry items, electronic plugs and devices. The options are endless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> this are too big for your purse but too small for anything else.  Durability seems to be good and colors were great.  Just have to find a use for it now</li>
            <li> Since this is shipped from overseas it takes a long time to arrive, but is worth the wait.  The price is great and so is the organizer.  Now I can find what I need quickly without fumbling.</li>
            <li> product came as described. A++</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture and fits all expectations. Smaller than expected but works for what I needed it for. Would recommend for small-medium purses only, if using for handbag insert.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as advertised - I really love the colors and it&#x27;s a fun way to keep purse organized. Will also make a great gift</li>
            <li> It was great to have so much room. I would have rated it higher if it didn&#x27;t start to fray after two weeks of using it. I use it for coupons and shopping. Compartments are great, love that it expands. Just wish it was more durable.</li>
            <li> This helps me with finding things in my purse.  I have large purses and have spent a lot of time trying to dig out things that I knew were somewhere inside.  This is great for organization and finding things quickly.  I am very happy with it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I make crocheted tote bags and put one of these inside.  Makes a very nice gift for my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I love this thing, and it&#x27;s my favorite color, so even better. I&#x27;m glad I can use this instead of trying to struggle switching purses, and I&#x27;m super picky about purses so this definitely works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nylon handbag as a purse insert/organizer for a couple months and has held up very well, I love all the pockets and 2 zip up compartments. very handy and has even help up to frequent washing. great product.</li>
            <li> I just received it and its a better quality than expected for the price. we will see if it holds up over time</li>
            <li> Amazing. No complaints at all. Loved it entirely, and love how much can be placed into it. A great buy.</li>
            <li> Best place to get these are right here! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son to put all his gadgets in and he&#x27;s very happy with it. I seen where people were commenting that it was cheap and sewn crappy. I didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with it....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in my purse, but I love it as portable storage for stationary items.</li>
            <li> I use it to switch back in forth between purses and I love it! Lots of pockets to organize and interior space for my wallet and small make-up bag.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that the quality of the product better than the price would have led me to believe. Good buy, super handy.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a zipper in the middle, or  some way to keep it open while in my purse. When I am not careful, stuff ends up all over the purse&#x27;s bottom anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the two side flat zipper pockets, for cash and gift cards and receipts. I also can keep lip stuff, a pen, earphone buds, flashlight(a little one) and other little pesky stuff in the side pockets but the mesh can catch stuff while sliding it in. Not a time saver for daily access, but to switch Purses, very quick if you can find the tiny handles. I put bulky zipper pulls on each side, so I know which pocket holds what and can access them in low light, like my car at the drive through window when I need cash for my monthly small fries. Lol.</li>
            <li> Love this -- fits right in my new bag -- holds everything i need it to -- waited about two months to get -- so be prepared to wait for shipment ..</li>
            <li> Nice bag with lots of pockets.</li>
            <li> great saves a lot of room and has tons of storage space great color&lt;br /&gt; very spacious compartments fits just right</li>
            <li> I bought it to put my coupons in so that I don&#x27;t have to carry a binder all the time. The material is of good quality. It appears to be durable. It is small, but I feel that it does the job for a newbie couponer, for when you don&#x27;t want to carry a huge coupon binder into the store. It&#x27;s great as a travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;I love the compartments and how you can expand it or snap the ends to it lays flat.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this little hand bag.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these. I purchased one to try it out and have since purchased 5 more! They&#x27;re purse organizers, but there is so much more you can use it for! I use it for EVERYTHING, and have one in each of my rooms to hold all my &amp;#34;misc&amp;#34; stuff! It works perfect!! Would definitely recommend and HAVE recommended it to a lot of people. A+!</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected.  I love using it in my purses, helps out a lot. A ++</li>
            <li> It has a lot of pockets and zipper compartments but it is too large. I don&#x27;t have a purse that large. I probably won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted except I wish there was a hard insert for the bottom to keep it open.  Other than that it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I just love this it made a whole of a different in my purse. My purse used to be very heavy as soon I use this to organize my purse WOW!!! it made my purse lighter what a find.Thanks I been looking for something like this I am overjoyed .......</li>
            <li> If you love organization like me this a great product, has pockets for every thing.&lt;br /&gt;No more searching for keys, etc.</li>
            <li> Loved these and orderd for my coupons may order more goodquality</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a purse organizer for a while now that has zippers because when you&#x27;re carrying a large purse and it tips over.....the organizer is useless if everything falls out.  That is NOT the case with this organizer.  It has several nice sized mesh pockets on the outside that are perfect for lip glosses, packs of gum, lotions etc.  It has a great middle area that is open, but perfectly sized for me to put both my Kindle and Kindle Fire into it.  There are snaps on the ends at top and bottom for if you don&#x27;t have a lot in it....that way you can slim it down if needed.  The best part are the two large zippers pockets that are the length of the organizer.  I like these for my wallet and checkbook and anything else that I feel needs to be extra secure.&lt;br /&gt;It really is a great organizer.  My only complaint is that within three weeks of having it, one of the little handles on top (which are really great for easy transfer to another purse) ripped off and frayed to pieces.  I would have given this a 5 except for that.  I feel like it could be made with a little more durable fabric........overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I really like my handbag insert. It allows me to keep my things organized, it holds everything I need it too, and it makes switching bags very convenient!</li>
            <li> Great new colors. Even better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for medium to larger bags that I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I wanted - everything in place for a quick change of pocketbook.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be big. When I received it I was ready to throw it away. It is only big enough to put coupons in. I thought it was gonna be big enough to put my binder in it. I was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Good quality and a great price! this works great for my beach bag and workout bag! I wish I would have bought more for gifts!</li>
            <li> Cute and handy.  I gave it 4 stars because I am not sure if it will hold up well long term.</li>
            <li> I love it. It was exactly how it was pictured. I bought two, one for me and one for my mom.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I love being organized and this has been awesome. It has a lot of options with different sized pockets, two zipper compartments, etc. I can swap it out to different bags and still keep all of my necessities together. By far, one of the best things I&#x27;ve bought for myself to keep me from having a purse that weighs me down or having everything but the kitchen sink in my purse. Love it!</li>
            <li> The green is not lime as the picture leaves you to be, it is a kelly grass green. But it&#x27;s a great piece, not the color i expected.</li>
            <li> Nice little bag, has held together well for the price. Been using it for my couponing.</li>
            <li> Organizes like it says..&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I needed a larger one than I had. It seems that purses get bigger the older I get, and the old organizer I have gets turned upside down in my new purses. This is just the right size. It took a while to arrive, but is bright and cheerful. It was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!!!  Gave as a gift and it&#x27;s so functional!</li>
            <li> gave one to all the girls - they use these bags everyplace they go.</li>
            <li> I really like the way I can move it from one puse to another. Very convienent. I chose the lime green.. Thank you for a nice product at a great plrice</li>
            <li> This thing was really, really cheap.  I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend whose purse is always a horrible mess.  She carries those limp canvas bags with zero pockets and I thought this would be a good introductory organizer so she could try it out and possibly order a better one later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As previously mentioned, she carries the limp canvas bags and this fits it almost perfectly and still allows the bag to fall closed when she sets it down.&lt;br /&gt;The material feels like it will last a while, but we will see how the stitching holds up since the thing was so inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;The pockets are arranged pretty well and allow relatively thorough organization of most things that purses contain on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;once items are added to the organizer, it maintains its shape pretty well, but otherwise folds up easily for stashing away elsewhere when not in use.</li>
            <li> With this purse insert I don&#x27;t have to search for anything in the bottomless void ever again!!! If you have to search for a specific item in your purse for more than 30 seconds you have to get one of these!!!</li>
            <li> Got my bag today! Love it and it is just like described. Thank you. Love the color as well. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I received a purse for Christmas that has NO pockets. I like to be organized and found myself digging around in my purse and never being able to find what I was looking for. Ever since I got this insert I feel so much more organized! Everything has it&#x27;s place and I&#x27;m not dumping my whole purse out trying to find things anymore. Thank you guys soo much!</li>
            <li> NEAT LITTLE ORGANIZER,  ROOMY AND LOTS OF NICE LITTLE POCKETS AND ZIPPERED SECTIONS</li>
            <li> For the price i loved this thing. It holds well considering I&#x27;ve got a good couple pounds worth of nail polish stored in there!</li>
            <li> I have to give this five stars.  Not because it is the highest-quality product.  But at this price, I was expecting less.  It fits right into the bottom of a light-green travel tote I made.  I got it to organize all my cords and electronics when I travel.  There is a little bit of padding on each side.  All the cords fit in the mesh pockets and there is room in the center for larger items, plus all the other pockets including the two zippers.  The color is fairly accurate but a bit brighter than I was expecting - almost neon green.  No rips or tears and the seams all appear to be sewn properly, contrary to some of the reviews.  Zippers work perfectly.  This product took 11 days to arrive in my mailbox from overseas.  I&#x27;m very happy with this item and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I thought the bag was larger. Was not impressed and then the color was not correct.  Why does this field require a number of words?</li>
            <li> Ideal. Lightweight and pockets that will fit my items. Recommend them for all handbags. Wish I&#x27;d ordered more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Wish i had bought one of these years ago. It has made my life so much easier. I can easily find things in my bag--No more embarrassing moments when I&#x27;m locking for my coupon, my change, my pen. The price was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer isn&#x27;t stiff but the lightweight fiberfill lining helps it to stand up by itself and keep its shape. I had trouble knowing which long zippered compartment had my wallet in it so I added an old lightweight keyring to the zipper pull on one side and now i know which zipper compartment has my wallet.  Good design, well made and just a little thing that just makes a busy life a little easier. I&#x27;ve got a great collection of handbags and now I&#x27;m switching much more often.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It helps me feel organized because I&#x27;m not having to dig through my purse to find things.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Works well as a travel kit. I purchased 2. One for my purse &amp; the other for my daughter&#x27;s locker. The handle broke after two days. However,  it&#x27;s still great for organizing.</li>
            <li> I love this bag. I originally bought one to put all my Geocaching supplies in and ended up getting another one for my purse! Holds so much and keeps it all nice and organized.</li>
            <li> This is the best purse organizer I have ever purchased.  It fits in my purses, yet is big enough to hold all of my stuff.  It even has snaps on each end to reduce the size if you have a more narrow purse.  It is very lightweight, but well made.  When I made my original purchase, the price was under $2.00!  Unbeatable!  I ordered another for my daughter…best purchase I&#x27;ve made this year for the price!!!  I have grown tired of constant searching and keys falling to the &amp;#34;black hole&amp;#34; of the bottom of my purse…no more/problem solved!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in several colors as gifts for workmates as a little morale booster.  The price was right, and it exceeded my expectations as far as quality and function as well. They arrived on schedule, as promised. Would definitely recommend this seller and product.</li>
            <li> I love this!! My purse is so organized now!!! I use this everyday!!! I want to buy more in more colors!!</li>
            <li> I like it.  It fits in my large purse.  It has lots of pockets and two zippered pouches on the side.  That was an unexpected surprise.  There is nothing to put together.  The packaging was in Chinese or Japanese.  It took months for the order to arrive.  I purchased my for $3.xx including shipping and handling.  So, I wasn&#x27;t upset about the delay.  The quality is good.  Not cheap like I thought.  It is vinyl and netting.  The Zippers are thick.  The handles at the top make it so easy to change from purse to purse (or pocketbook to pocketbook).</li>
            <li> this fits perfectly in my purse and i can use it for couponing and other things love this product :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I thought it was bigger, my own fault for not reading description of the product. Not fault of seller</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get them but you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Makes it soooo much easier to change purses and helps you organize.</li>
            <li> i actually accidentally bought two of these and one seems to be holding up fine. on the other one, one of the small handles has detached and begun to unravel. fortunately i don&#x27;t really need the handles as i just use it to put stuff in my suitcase or purse. and this wasn&#x27;t surprising considering the price. its definitely worth the three bucks</li>
            <li> This purse organizer is a bit on the thin side so time will tell how well this holds up with daily use. I didn&#x27;t spend much so if it doesn&#x27;t last very long it won&#x27;t bother me too much. I did notice, as others have mentioned, that the plastic zippers don&#x27;t seem to be very sturdy at all so I know I will have to be careful with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like so far is the bright green color, very easy to see at the bottom of my purse. I also like the handles, they make it easy to pull the entire organizer up and out of the bag if needed. I also like all the pockets and dividers,... even if the zippers don&#x27;t hold up I will probably still continue to use this for the pockets. There is more than enough room for wallet, brush, makeup, glasses, kindle PaperWhite or my kindle fire, small phone charger, phone, and all the rest of the must haves that are important enough to live in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the smaller of the interior zippered pouches makes a perfect makeup case, with my more often used lipstick tucked in a mesh side pocket. The interior is lined so makeup doesn&#x27;t get all over  if it happens to break. I also how you can also enlarge the center area by unsnapping a few side snaps. This purse organizer gives me the extra pockets and dividers that my bag was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Updated 10/22/14 So far this is working out very nicely. I love all the pockets and the two large interior sections too. One even zippers closed,...very roomy! I just ordered two more, one in pink, and the other in orange. I will let my daughter choose one, and since I already have one being used in my bag I will use the new one in the bathroom to store brushes, face cleansers, makeup, and hopefully clear up some of the clutter on my countertop!mething up at Target or Wallyworld.</li>
            <li> This fits in my large totes perfectly. I like the bright color and it holds so much. I am gong to buy a couple more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Works great. Sides don&#x27;t always stay snapped.</li>
            <li> This little organizer is a must for every woman, especially for an unorganized, like me. It keeps all your tiny essentials at place and easy transfers them to another bag, in a matter of seconds! I love this organizer so much, so I bought 8 others for my friends and family!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all and its a dark green not the color in the picture!</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of this bag however after only using it for 1 week the stitching is coming out.  It is not constructed well at all.</li>
            <li> I got this product cheap to do an honest review. This bag is perfect for those who don&#x27;t have alot to hold, this bag does open up bigger than when you recieve it. It has snaps at the top and bottom on the sides to open up like a square.. there are side pockets to hold extras. I really wanted to try this for my coupons and scissors and things like that and it is perfect for that.... So if this is what you looking for to carry to a party with little fuss then this is your bag, It&#x27;s also you bag for couponers....</li>
            <li> This handbag insert is exactly what I needed: sturdy, roomy, lightweight, and multiple compartments.</li>
            <li> Love this ....makes it easy to find things in my big purses.  I was always looking for my cell phone...now it has a pocket for that....no more searching.</li>
            <li> I purchased this (the green one) for less than four dollars and I love it! I don&#x27;t know how they ship this all the way from China for free for that price, but they did. There likely are other nicer organizers out there, but for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it! It came in a reasonable amount of time considering the thousands of miles it traveled, and I love the zippered compartments for receipts and such, and all the little pockets for everything else.</li>
            <li> easy to move from purse to purse.  More pockets than others of similar design, and less expensive!  I like this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the insert and am using it right now. Easy to transfer from purse to purse.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!! You can fit all kinds of stuff in this thing! trust me you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Plenty of storage and pockets. I use this in my trunk to organize first aid, extra supplies for kids, etc. The handles are sturdy. One of the pockets was not sewn correctly so the lining wasnt attached but the rest of the bag is fine.  It has plenty of pockets and when expanded is extremely roomy. I purchased this because the price was cheaper than other ones I saw. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Smaller then it looks. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Anyone looking for a large size insert/purse organizer may find this to be a good product.  I think it is well/sturdy made yet light (soft padding).  I also like the bright lime green though a lighter grey color inside is better for me as i can find things easier but at least it isn&#x27;t black inside.  I use it for cosmetics by the sink and holds alot of nick nacks.  There&#x27;s a generous zipper on two sides and they are big plastic prongs (not regular kind for clothing). Bonus:  there is also a pair of snaps on both sides so you can flatten the bag (you can therefore use only the side pockets and/or 2 zippered pockets and use the center to put in flat thin things). Price/shipping was also great compared to some that are small and not made well.  I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Took a While longer to arrive. The fabrick is light  and looks fragile. It does hold a LOT of elements</li>
            <li> I love this. The only thing is that there is a part in one of zipper pockets that wasn&#x27;t sewn, but it&#x27;s such a small thing I still rated it 5 stars. It holds all of my makeup and more, and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it! The pockets are in each side, and there are zipper pockets inside on both sides. I&#x27;m going to college soon, so this is the perfect fit for me!</li>
            <li> Although some people have commented on the stitching, my bag was fine. Sure, there were some loose threads, but nothing major. I mean come on, for what you pay for this, it&#x27;s totally worth it! The shipping was also quicker than the estimate. Yay! I plan to order more of these as gifts. If you look around a little on Amazon, you can find almost any color. Love them!</li>
            <li> There are lots of pockets, which is the main reason why I bought three of them, and it&#x27;s a good price.  The extras were for friends.  It was a nice, inexpensive way to let a friend know I&#x27;m thinking of her.</li>
