            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I wore it one day and found it some what appealing.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>i just love this parfum</li>
            <li>A LOT, it is SCENT it is VERY RICH, it LIKES ME TO MI</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s an incredible value, and the full size bottle is very competitively priced.</li>
            <li>My review of the perfume in general is 5 stars because Siren smells incredible, like sunshine in a bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be shaped like a mermaid&#x27;s tail which does make it easy to hold, but isn&#x27;t cute.  </li>
            <li>smells good and big bottle for a good price</li>
            <li>A very light sandalwood/vanilla smell with a touch of light floral.</li>
            <li>good (not anything GREAT, I have other perfumes</li>
            <li>The best part was that the shipping from the seller was so quick it arrived the next day :)</li>
            <li>I am a Huge Paris Hilton Fan, and i love almost all of her perfumes, except for Just me.</li>
            <li>It puts me in a good mood wherever I have it on, and just is a very sunshine type of a scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, fresh scent...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique and I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the nose and doesn&#x27;t linger when she leaves the room.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be strong at all</li>
            <li>As a strong metallic smell</li>
            <li>It is light, yet very full bodied.  </li>
            <li>I bought this perfume based on other reviews and because I really liked the bottle and thought it would look great on my vanity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this really smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all or a cheap brand.</li>
            <li>Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li>You get a huge bottle for the price and</li>
            <li>It smells great,  but doesn&#x27;t last all day which is something that&#x27;s important for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally found this in Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s cheap didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.  </li>
            <li>But the charm is so cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li>Overall she seems happy, so I guess whatever floats his boat</li>
            <li>I do wish it was a tad stronger for a longer amount of time, but it is cheap perfume</li>
            <li>I love that this seller shipped my packaged right away.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as they stated it would be and the price was unbeatable!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new scent as my stores have a habit of taking the ones I love and not selling them anymore after I buy them!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff didn&#x27;t expect a big bottle when it came in but love the size!</li>
            <li>Paris products are always sweet and light.</li>
            <li>i Fell in love with this fragrance, when it was first released.</li>
            <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of sweet but subtle and it just smells sooo good!</li>
            <li>this is a beautiful blend of white floral, fruity, powdery, citrus and sweet, it is a light fragrance with gentle notes.</li>
            <li>i love this sooo much</li>
            <li>I read several good reviews about this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume SO much that I am searching for it online since I can&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>This is also a good \\&quot;starter\\&quot; perfume for younger girls and teenagers who are getting into perfumes.</li>
            <li>cool fragance for my wife, i like it</li>
            <li>But The smells is a bit too sweet</li>
            <li>I am sure a pricey version would be much stronger, longer.</li>
            <li>Oh well it smells good on her and makes me want to smell her naked.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and subtle, perfect for a day at the office or a nice pick up me after a shower.</li>
            <li>I have a huge purse, but this glass bottle is large and I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable carrying it with me.  </li>
            <li>I dont think its smells as Great as her other Brands , But its not a miss either..</li>
            <li>I Love the Theme for this perfume, The Bottle Design, the Box Artwork, The Scent, Everything, about this perfume i love, except for the lasting power.</li>
            <li>I actually think it smells better than Viva because it has more vanilla notes.  </li>
            <li>She loved it and wants another bottle, the only problem is it is kinda strong.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I DO get many compliments from this scent, one in particular stood out from the others.</li>
            <li>Siren is MY personal favorite, though my husband likes heiress better.</li>
            <li>I immediately put it on when it arrived, and at first I thought I had made a huge mistake or the perfume</li>
            <li>In my opinion, I don&#x27;t care whose name is on the bottle as long as it smells good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any strong feelings either way towards her, but I&#x27;m leaning more positive as far as her products go.  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied!!</li>
            <li>It does not last very long, but the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This perfume is amazing and definitely one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>great price for a everyday perfume....</li>
            <li>Paris is probably my least favorite celebrity out there, but she makes good perfumes.</li>
            <li>I tried it and my husband went wild and told me to get some more.</li>
            <li>its worth the money..</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>Add to that my boyfriend who thinks most everything smells like \\&quot;old lady funeral home\\&quot;, and I have a dickens of a time finding something to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth buying..</li>
            <li>I feel like reapplying it  more frequently.</li>
            <li>Siren is my 2nd favorite, after the original.</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled this perfume, it instantly became my favorite!</li>
            <li>The fragrance was way better then expected &amp; this might be my new favorite!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t compare to my dior gucci or burberry perfumes but good enough for normal day to day wear.</li>
            <li>I am also very sensitive to strong scents and this one did not make my throat or head hurt like a lot of the designer brands.</li>
            <li>From the most expensive brands---to the cheapest and this one is by far the best for me right now.  </li>
            <li>even the small bottle is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;The stay-powering.  </li>
            <li>Siren is a high quality fragrance, with a very pleasant scent, and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li>You have to give credit to Amazon, they replaced the original bottle for free because I simply told them what happened.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys sweet fragrances.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more items from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading reviews where people said it smells similar to Viva La Juicy (which I love, but refuse to pay $80 a bottle for).  </li>
            <li>If so, I&#x27;d give this a higher rating.</li>
            <li>The funny thing is that when I was in the store, almost everyone after me in the perfume aisle stopped at this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>love this perfume 2nd time buying this perfume</li>
            <li>at third the price :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love her perfumes and have several now.</li>
            <li>I bought this after researching scents similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret Good Day Sunshine body spray (which I loved but is now discontinued).</li>
            <li>Nothing special  about this perfume, the fragrance is kind of ordinary.  </li>
            <li>pretty, fresh &amp; feminine .. just right for everyday uses :)</li>
            <li>, it is very pungent at first spray.</li>
            <li>This perfume smell sweet and floral then soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as strong or long lasting as some scents, but it goes for most of a workday</li>
            <li>to be certain it was her then asked what scent she was wearing.  </li>
            <li>My box of perfume had Paris on the outside and a cute little mermaid on the box in the inside so just remove the top cover if you don&#x27;t want to gift it that way.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a rich perfume and I have received several positive comments.</li>
            <li>I was really scared when I purchased this because I had never smelt this fragrance.</li>
            <li>its a light scent and it last all day.</li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t really do much with it and it falls off the bottle if you are using it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about her and don&#x27;t really care anyway.</li>
            <li>this is the real thing too came fully wrapped and all</li>
            <li>I am very picky about perfumes and it takes forever to find one I can wear without sneezing or gassing my workplace neighbors.  </li>
            <li>I think what I really like are the honeysuckle and peachy notes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like paris hilton at all,</li>
            <li>When I looked it up online and found it for so cheap, regardless of the name plastered to it, I purchased it as a back up perfume when my others are out.</li>
            <li>I do not really know about the specific tones that it possess, but I know that it smells good.</li>
            <li>This is a nice scent for everyday.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I stumbled upon this perfume at a local department store.  </li>
            <li>and I think it is my favorite.. long lasting fresh sexy...value for money</li>
            <li>It lasts long, smells fantastic, and I always get compliments!(Well</li>
            <li>It is lightly sweet yet musky at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Also, the packaging is less than appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and instantly met my expectations for design.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, my main point is ...</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume because other users said it smelled a lot like Viva la Juicy--and they were right!!  </li>
            <li>i am looking forward to this being me new scent</li>
            <li>This will be my new go-to scent.</li>
            <li>As I have entered my 30s, my tastes have matured and so I needed a new signature scent.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly like the last!</li>
            <li>Which brings me to my next pro--you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
            <li>It smells fine and the scent slightly fades over time.</li>
            <li>Next, it comes with a cute little mermaid charm that detaches from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing but the spraying button was broken</li>
            <li>Me and my boyfriend were kind of shocked when we opened it because it looks like a bottle of booze or cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li>I must say after I smelled it, I was like Wow</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did arrive on time and was packaged properly, so the seller did their job very well.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and not spicy with a tad a fruitiness.  </li>
            <li>do not like Paris Hilton, and would never have considered any of her perfumes, but I received a sample and was completely captivated.  </li>
            <li>It is a classy fragrance that is a lot of people seem to like.</li>
            <li>Does not smell fruity but not like an old lady either.</li>
            <li>Also, as it wears through the day, it changes slightly but is still super yummy.  </li>
            <li>I personally said it smelled like an older woman&#x27;s boot .</li>
            <li>It is mature and young at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I like this when it first goes on but doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes me weak in the knees when I smell it on a girl &amp; makes me a hell of a lot more attracted to them.</li>
            <li>, I received it the date was expected and very well packed.</li>
            <li>It is a soft, deep scent.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to get it at a fraction of the price the department stores charge, it was such a steal.</li>
            <li>No other scent is present.</li>
            <li>Its not too weak and its not too strong.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> i just love this parfum</li>
            <li> A LOT, it is SCENT it is VERY RICH, it LIKES ME TO MI</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an incredible value, and the full size bottle is very competitively priced.</li>
            <li> My review of the perfume in general is 5 stars because Siren smells incredible, like sunshine in a bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be shaped like a mermaid&#x27;s tail which does make it easy to hold, but isn&#x27;t cute.  </li>
            <li> smells good and big bottle for a good price</li>
            <li> A very light sandalwood/vanilla smell with a touch of light floral.</li>
            <li> good (not anything GREAT, I have other perfumes</li>
            <li> The best part was that the shipping from the seller was so quick it arrived the next day :)</li>
            <li> I am a Huge Paris Hilton Fan, and i love almost all of her perfumes, except for Just me.</li>
            <li> It puts me in a good mood wherever I have it on, and just is a very sunshine type of a scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, fresh scent...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique and I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the nose and doesn&#x27;t linger when she leaves the room.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be strong at all</li>
            <li> As a strong metallic smell</li>
            <li> It is light, yet very full bodied.  </li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based on other reviews and because I really liked the bottle and thought it would look great on my vanity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this really smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all or a cheap brand.</li>
            <li> Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li> You get a huge bottle for the price and</li>
            <li> It smells great,  but doesn&#x27;t last all day which is something that&#x27;s important for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally found this in Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s cheap didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.  </li>
            <li> But the charm is so cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li> Overall she seems happy, so I guess whatever floats his boat</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a tad stronger for a longer amount of time, but it is cheap perfume</li>
            <li> I love that this seller shipped my packaged right away.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as they stated it would be and the price was unbeatable!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new scent as my stores have a habit of taking the ones I love and not selling them anymore after I buy them!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff didn&#x27;t expect a big bottle when it came in but love the size!</li>
            <li> Paris products are always sweet and light.</li>
            <li> i Fell in love with this fragrance, when it was first released.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of sweet but subtle and it just smells sooo good!</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful blend of white floral, fruity, powdery, citrus and sweet, it is a light fragrance with gentle notes.</li>
            <li> i love this sooo much</li>
            <li> I read several good reviews about this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume SO much that I am searching for it online since I can&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> This is also a good \\&quot;starter\\&quot; perfume for younger girls and teenagers who are getting into perfumes.</li>
            <li> cool fragance for my wife, i like it</li>
            <li> But The smells is a bit too sweet</li>
            <li> I am sure a pricey version would be much stronger, longer.</li>
            <li> Oh well it smells good on her and makes me want to smell her naked.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and subtle, perfect for a day at the office or a nice pick up me after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have a huge purse, but this glass bottle is large and I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable carrying it with me.  </li>
            <li> I dont think its smells as Great as her other Brands , But its not a miss either..</li>
            <li> I Love the Theme for this perfume, The Bottle Design, the Box Artwork, The Scent, Everything, about this perfume i love, except for the lasting power.</li>
            <li> I actually think it smells better than Viva because it has more vanilla notes.  </li>
            <li> She loved it and wants another bottle, the only problem is it is kinda strong.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I DO get many compliments from this scent, one in particular stood out from the others.</li>
            <li> Siren is MY personal favorite, though my husband likes heiress better.</li>
            <li> I immediately put it on when it arrived, and at first I thought I had made a huge mistake or the perfume</li>
            <li> In my opinion, I don&#x27;t care whose name is on the bottle as long as it smells good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any strong feelings either way towards her, but I&#x27;m leaning more positive as far as her products go.  </li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied!!</li>
            <li> It does not last very long, but the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing and definitely one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> great price for a everyday perfume....</li>
            <li> Paris is probably my least favorite celebrity out there, but she makes good perfumes.</li>
            <li> I tried it and my husband went wild and told me to get some more.</li>
            <li> its worth the money..</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> Add to that my boyfriend who thinks most everything smells like \\&quot;old lady funeral home\\&quot;, and I have a dickens of a time finding something to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth buying..</li>
            <li> I feel like reapplying it  more frequently.</li>
            <li> Siren is my 2nd favorite, after the original.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this perfume, it instantly became my favorite!</li>
            <li> The fragrance was way better then expected &amp; this might be my new favorite!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare to my dior gucci or burberry perfumes but good enough for normal day to day wear.</li>
            <li> I am also very sensitive to strong scents and this one did not make my throat or head hurt like a lot of the designer brands.</li>
            <li> From the most expensive brands---to the cheapest and this one is by far the best for me right now.  </li>
            <li> even the small bottle is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;The stay-powering.  </li>
            <li> Siren is a high quality fragrance, with a very pleasant scent, and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> You have to give credit to Amazon, they replaced the original bottle for free because I simply told them what happened.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys sweet fragrances.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more items from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews where people said it smells similar to Viva La Juicy (which I love, but refuse to pay $80 a bottle for).  </li>
            <li> If so, I&#x27;d give this a higher rating.</li>
            <li> The funny thing is that when I was in the store, almost everyone after me in the perfume aisle stopped at this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> love this perfume 2nd time buying this perfume</li>
            <li> at third the price :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love her perfumes and have several now.</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching scents similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret Good Day Sunshine body spray (which I loved but is now discontinued).</li>
            <li> Nothing special  about this perfume, the fragrance is kind of ordinary.  </li>
            <li> pretty, fresh &amp; feminine .. just right for everyday uses :)</li>
            <li> , it is very pungent at first spray.</li>
            <li> This perfume smell sweet and floral then soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as strong or long lasting as some scents, but it goes for most of a workday</li>
            <li> to be certain it was her then asked what scent she was wearing.  </li>
            <li> My box of perfume had Paris on the outside and a cute little mermaid on the box in the inside so just remove the top cover if you don&#x27;t want to gift it that way.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a rich perfume and I have received several positive comments.</li>
            <li> I was really scared when I purchased this because I had never smelt this fragrance.</li>
            <li> its a light scent and it last all day.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t really do much with it and it falls off the bottle if you are using it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about her and don&#x27;t really care anyway.</li>
            <li> this is the real thing too came fully wrapped and all</li>
            <li> I am very picky about perfumes and it takes forever to find one I can wear without sneezing or gassing my workplace neighbors.  </li>
            <li> I think what I really like are the honeysuckle and peachy notes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like paris hilton at all,</li>
            <li> When I looked it up online and found it for so cheap, regardless of the name plastered to it, I purchased it as a back up perfume when my others are out.</li>
            <li> I do not really know about the specific tones that it possess, but I know that it smells good.</li>
            <li> This is a nice scent for everyday.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I stumbled upon this perfume at a local department store.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is my favorite.. long lasting fresh sexy...value for money</li>
            <li> It lasts long, smells fantastic, and I always get compliments!(Well</li>
            <li> It is lightly sweet yet musky at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Also, the packaging is less than appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and instantly met my expectations for design.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, my main point is ...</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because other users said it smelled a lot like Viva la Juicy--and they were right!!  </li>
            <li> i am looking forward to this being me new scent</li>
            <li> This will be my new go-to scent.</li>
            <li> As I have entered my 30s, my tastes have matured and so I needed a new signature scent.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly like the last!</li>
            <li> Which brings me to my next pro--you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
            <li> It smells fine and the scent slightly fades over time.</li>
            <li> Next, it comes with a cute little mermaid charm that detaches from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing but the spraying button was broken</li>
            <li> Me and my boyfriend were kind of shocked when we opened it because it looks like a bottle of booze or cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li> I must say after I smelled it, I was like Wow</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did arrive on time and was packaged properly, so the seller did their job very well.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and not spicy with a tad a fruitiness.  </li>
            <li> do not like Paris Hilton, and would never have considered any of her perfumes, but I received a sample and was completely captivated.  </li>
            <li> It is a classy fragrance that is a lot of people seem to like.</li>
            <li> Does not smell fruity but not like an old lady either.</li>
            <li> Also, as it wears through the day, it changes slightly but is still super yummy.  </li>
            <li> I personally said it smelled like an older woman&#x27;s boot .</li>
            <li> It is mature and young at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I like this when it first goes on but doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes me weak in the knees when I smell it on a girl &amp; makes me a hell of a lot more attracted to them.</li>
            <li> , I received it the date was expected and very well packed.</li>
            <li> It is a soft, deep scent.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to get it at a fraction of the price the department stores charge, it was such a steal.</li>
            <li> No other scent is present.</li>
            <li> Its not too weak and its not too strong.  </li>
            <li> must be from a very old batch (very harsh and old lady smelling).</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as more expensive perfume -</li>
            <li> and so the did the perfume which made the perfume not smell the same or last long at all.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I really like the small of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long on me.</li>
            <li> I get complimented all the time when I wear it and it has a long lasting scent</li>
            <li> would probably buy again, maybe a smaller one to keep in my bag because I dont use it as often as I use other ones.</li>
            <li> (I typically wear, Euphoria, Viva La Juicey, and Forever Red from Bath and Body).</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long--</li>
            <li> I usually only go for fruity fragrances, but this one is me stepping out of the box a little.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the scent was longer lasting...</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not regret my decision.</li>
            <li> Never really knew why anyone would buy them.</li>
            <li> but not what I was expected</li>
            <li> My fiance had given it to me for my bday and ever since then i had bought 2 already one for me and the other for my soon to be mother in law</li>
            <li> I have other perfumes that I wear that cost a ton</li>
            <li> I cannot find this in any other size bottle that .5 oz in any retail outlet.</li>
            <li> The mist is very full-bodied and even so it covers you when sprayed up in the air.  </li>
            <li> it almost reminds me of SNOOKI For Women By NICOLE POLIZZI or the pink bottle with the black pin stripes by Paris Hilton as well.</li>
            <li> I was sitting down, he started asking questions ...</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like it and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the notes are, but I feel like I can detect a slight hint of vanilla, maybe some apricot, as well as something musky, almost woody.  </li>
            <li> (maybe just a little sweeter smelling,</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I think it&#x27;s a little strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sensual, with a little heat and sweetness to it but not at all cloying.</li>
            <li> None of that heavy overbearing stuff for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchase this once every few months.</li>
            <li> I bought few of these for a Gift at work.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say this fragrance is another self-promoting fragrance by a fading &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; who&#x27;s seeking a way to make a few bucks.</li>
            <li> She loves it will buy again in few months</li>
            <li> Got my package in less than 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> The only perfume ill wear for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming, though.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to spray excessively, but this is Paris HIlton&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to explain this one because it is sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get migraines when i even walk behind someone who wears perfume, but i dont know what it is about Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfumes that dont effect me that way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not good at explaining the \\&quot;notes\\&quot; in a perfume, but</li>
            <li> I can see how a personal chemical balance could throw this fragrance off and make it pungent though, or someone unwilling to let it air may hate it</li>
            <li> I recommend it for 25-85, seriously!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that i wish it lasted longer than it does, the silage is horrible.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is very hard to find!</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s an expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> The bottle shape also would make it incredibly difficult to travel with.  </li>
            <li> #34;I bet it&#x27;s something expensive, and you didn&#x27;t even have to put a lot on.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;It smells like you just need a dab&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Expensive?</li>
            <li> This is a fake.</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> u can&#x27;t go wrong especillay for the price!</li>
            <li> I think the packaging is ugly</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in my selection, however my choice out stock.</li>
            <li> But it doesnt smell bad!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled tons of celebrity perfumes and have thought they all smelled disgusting.</li>

            <li> C&#x27;mon Paris--what&#x27;s up with this scent? Truly horrendous perfume. Bought for mom--she gave it to grandma and she won&#x27;t even wear it!</li>

            <li> Thank you! your product is just as you described, I&#x27;m so pleased with it, I received it the date was expected and very well packed.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in perfect condition, brand new with the original packaging. I think it&#x27;s an incredible value, and the full size bottle is very competitively priced. I had a sample of this scent, and have always loved it, and am very happy to have a full bottle. This would make a great gift (to you!) for a friend or daughter.</li>
            <li> i love this sooo much it is great i luv paris hilton perfumes and i am looking forward to this being me new scent</li>
            <li> I love that this seller shipped my packaged right away. The perfume is not opened nor has damaged. In fact, the perfume box is covered with plastic and has another covering of Paris Hilton. This perfume smells floral to me. Copy the link below to get more description of the perfume smell. I ALWAYS check my perfumes here to make sure I&#x27;ll love the sent. Got my package in less than 4 weeks! That is awesome ! I will definitely purchase more items from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Perfect gift, smell really good.</li>
            <li> A colleague came into work one day smelling like a field of beautiful fragrant flowers.  I followed her around for a while to be certain it was her then asked what scent she was wearing.  I searched every store in my area for it but didn&#x27;t find it so looked on Amazon &amp; there it was!  Every time I wear it my daughter follows me around saying &amp;#34;I Love That Perfume Mom, it smells So Pretty&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff didn&#x27;t expect a big bottle when it came in but love the size! Will be buying this agein when i run out!</li>
            <li> I was really scared when I purchased this because I had never smelt this fragrance. I just took the advice of all the comments from here, then I bought it. I absolutely do not regret my decision. It&#x27;s the cutest bottle and smells incredible! You should defiantly buy this! It smells almost like roses. I love it!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Paris scents. Paris products are always sweet and light. None of that heavy overbearing stuff for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was packaged accordingly, with no damage to the product. It arrived on time as promised. Great price for the bottle size. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Siren is a high quality fragrance, with a very pleasant scent, and is very long lasting. The store price for the 3.4 is about $55, so Amazon had a great deal on this! I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys sweet fragrances.</li>
            <li> This perfume smell sweet and floral then soft. It doesn&#x27;t hold a scent all day but it&#x27;s a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally found this in Amazon. I was looking for this fragrance in stores like marshalls, BCF. This is my favorite from Paris&#x27; perfume line.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and sealer</li>
            <li> very good product as described by the seller</li>
            <li> Big bottle. Smells amazing love it!</li>
            <li> Paris is probably my least favorite celebrity out there, but she makes good perfumes. Siren is my 2nd favorite, after the original. It has a very strong note of honeysuckle in it, as well as apricot. Definitely do get a vanilla note as well. This is a go to fragrance in the spring/summer for me because it just smells happy. It puts me in a good mood wherever I have it on, and just is a very sunshine type of a scent. I don&#x27;t find it to be strong at all, it&#x27;s a very light non offensive scent which I get complimented on a lot. My only gripe with it is the last power, this doesn&#x27;t last longer than 2-3 hrs on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very good product, recommended 100 %.</li>
            <li> I purchase this once every few months. I have $400 fragrances but this one is the one that gets the most compliments on me. I guess it works the best with my chemistry! I am hooked!</li>
            <li> Nothing special  about this perfume, the fragrance is kind of ordinary.  I was disappointed in my selection, however my choice out stock.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because other users said it smelled a lot like Viva la Juicy--and they were right!!  It&#x27;s really similar to it (maybe just a little sweeter smelling, possibly more honeysuckle/vanilla?), for a fraction of the price.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long--but I guess since you&#x27;re not paying $80 a bottle you can afford to reapply it a couple of times if need be!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good.... My fiance had given it to me for my bday and ever since then i had bought 2 already one for me and the other for my soon to be mother in law she loved it :)</li>
            <li> I am a Huge Paris Hilton Fan, and i love almost all of her perfumes, except for Just me. I Love the Theme for this perfume, The Bottle Design, the Box Artwork, The Scent, Everything, about this perfume i love, except for the lasting power. It doesn&#x27;t last that long on me. i Fell in love with this fragrance, when it was first released. Even before i smelled it. It is amazing, and my signature fragrance. Everyone should wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was a really good deal, i ordered this for my Girl friend, and she loves it, smells really good</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells good (not anything GREAT, I have other perfumes I prefer)&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap compared to others&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts awhile&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I think it&#x27;s a little strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably buy again, maybe a smaller one to keep in my bag because I dont use it as often as I use other ones.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. It&#x27;s unique and I get many compliments on it. The only perfume ill wear for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> I bought few of these for a Gift at work. I never buy cheap Perfumes, but since I had to&lt;br /&gt;buy 5 of them, this looked good. I took one extra, to give to a friend, and wanted to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s cheap didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I must say after I smelled it, I was like Wow&lt;br /&gt;this really smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all or a cheap brand. Great smell, and people&lt;br /&gt;will think it&#x27;s an expensive perfume. Your for sure get complements Ladies..:)</li>
            <li> The perfume smells like rubbing alcohol. No other scent is present. Very dissatisfied!!</li>
            <li> This product is truly a horror!  It was not as described, in my opinion, it is just not wearable.  One whiff and that&#x27;s all it took, yuck!&lt;br /&gt;It did arrive on time and was packaged properly, so the seller did their job very well.  It&#x27;s the product that didn&#x27;t come through on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something inexpensive.  The fragrance was way better then expected &amp; this might be my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but the spraying button was broken</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews where people said it smells similar to Viva La Juicy (which I love, but refuse to pay $80 a bottle for).  I actually think it smells better than Viva because it has more vanilla notes.  I agree with others that the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as more expensive perfume - but that&#x27;s why you just reapply if needed!! I have gotten numerous compliments on this perfume and after smelling it on me, my best friend immediately went home and bought her own bottle.  This will be my new go-to scent.</li>
            <li> A while back my daughter gave me a bottle of this that was almost all used. I tried it and my husband went wild and told me to get some more. This product arrived on time and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> well packaged product must test the quality of the perfume</li>
            <li> This smells really good! And the bottle is so cute!  My only complaint is that I wish the scent was longer lasting... If so, I&#x27;d give this a higher rating. Other than that, I like it and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I dont think its smells as Great as her other Brands , But its not a miss either.. its worth the money..</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite perfumes, i have loved it since it came out. A very light sandalwood/vanilla smell with a touch of light floral. My only complaint is that i wish it lasted longer than it does, the silage is horrible.</li>
            <li> I love the Flowery smell this has. I do not really know about the specific tones that it possess, but I know that it smells good. I think I am beginning to become a fan of Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfumes</li>
            <li> Smells great and it is a huge bottle, really worth the money.  I always am told that I smell great when I wear it. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t like the smell I  would expect more from Paris perfume line thought it smelled like a generic juicy couture</li>
            <li> satisfied with the quality of prducto.</li>
            <li> beautiful musky woody smell. Love it. can&#x27;t compare to my dior gucci or burberry perfumes but good enough for normal day to day wear.</li>
            <li> Siren has a great scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.  It is a soft, deep scent.  It is soft and not spicy with a tad a fruitiness.  Not overwhelming, though.  I have people asking me all the time \\&quot;what are you wearing\\&quot; or say \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;.  I have other perfumes that I wear that cost a ton and nobody has commented on it.  This is a nice scent for everyday.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, my favorite Paris Hilton scent....my only problem is that the ups box that came felt 100 degrees and so the did the perfume which made the perfume not smell the same or last long at all.  I&#x27;ll be putting that in my packaging review.  My review of the perfume in general is 5 stars because Siren smells incredible, like sunshine in a bottle. You have to give credit to Amazon, they replaced the original bottle for free because I simply told them what happened.  No questions or comments about it.</li>
            <li> Great and beauty product!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim, but everybody compliments me on it. Great buy and great price. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Sensual, with a little heat and sweetness to it but not at all cloying. Go ahead and spend the money on this.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s go-to perfume and she loves it. It&#x27;s easy on the nose and doesn&#x27;t linger when she leaves the room.</li>
            <li> This smells like something I&#x27;ve bought before but I forgot the name. It&#x27;s kind of sweet but subtle and it just smells sooo good! I love it will buy again!</li>
            <li> This became another one of my favorites by Paris. I have smelled and used 7 of her perfumes and I love them.</li>
            <li> I had bought one of these years ago at a perfume store and when it ran out I ordered this one. It was exactly like the last!</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> I love the size, you get a lot of product for your money. And the fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li> This sent left a lot to be desired. As a strong metallic smell</li>
            <li> I love all of Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfume, but Siren has to be my favorite. Unfortunately it is very hard to find! I&#x27;m very pleased with the product I received, shipping time, and price. Thank You!</li>
            <li> It smell great but it don&#x27;t last at all I put it on and in five min its gone and its very light</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based on other reviews and because I really liked the bottle and thought it would look great on my vanity. I&#x27;m more of a d√©cor than a fragrance gal. It arrived quickly and instantly met my expectations for design. In addition, I really like the small of the fragrance. It is soft and subtle, perfect for a day at the office or a nice pick up me after a shower. It smells like a rich perfume and I have received several positive comments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy &amp; girls smell freaking amazing when I smell this on them. This stuff makes me weak in the knees when I smell it on a girl &amp; makes me a hell of a lot more attracted to them. I&#x27;d recommended it for any girl out there (or a close 2nd Viva La Juicy, that stuff is amazing too).</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!!! its a light scent and it last all day. it almost reminds me of SNOOKI For Women By NICOLE POLIZZI or the pink bottle with the black pin stripes by Paris Hilton as well. i will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li> It,s delicius, and the price is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, for Christmas time. She loved it and wants another bottle, the only problem is it is kinda strong. But it doesnt smell bad!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  Nice and light. I have been wearing it for 3 years and had had problems finding it in the local stores since moving.  Amazon just made it a no trip to the mall rebuy.  I will be ordering my supply each time I run out from now on.</li>
            <li> I read several good reviews about this perfume. So, I gave it a try. Ho hum. Let&#x27;s just say this fragrance is another self-promoting fragrance by a fading &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; who&#x27;s seeking a way to make a few bucks. By accident, I ordered two bottles ... I have no idea what I&#x27;m going to do with them ... probably unload them on Craig&#x27;s List.</li>
            <li> I ARRIVE EVERYTHING IN PERFECT STATE, MY WIFE LIKES PERFUME A LOT, it is SCENT it is VERY RICH, it LIKES ME TO MI WHEN it USES IT BECAUSE SHE FEELS MORE FEMININE 100 RECOMMENDED%.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing and definitely one of my favorites! I was surprised to get it at a fraction of the price the department stores charge, it was such a steal. The best part was that the shipping from the seller was so quick it arrived the next day :)</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume....great price for a everyday perfume....</li>
            <li> She loves it will buy again in few months</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product! Would recommend to any female with a great since of smell! Shipped sooner and received sooner than anticipated!</li>
            <li> As I have entered my 30s, my tastes have matured and so I needed a new signature scent.  I have always been a fan of sugary perfumes, but they didn&#x27;t suit me anymore.  I was so excited when I stumbled upon this perfume at a local department store.  I sprayed it on and went home to decide if I liked it.  I went back and got it for Christmas.  The funny thing is that when I was in the store, almost everyone after me in the perfume aisle stopped at this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  The price.  You get a huge bottle for the price and even the small bottle is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;The stay-powering.  Saying this perfume lasts all day is an understatement.  I walk under one squirt in the air and can smell it on my clothes until they are washed.  Which brings me to my next pro--you don&#x27;t need much!  One or two sprays and you are good for the day.  The mist is very full-bodied and even so it covers you when sprayed up in the air.  Finally, the scent.  It is mature and young at the same time.  I recommend it for 25-85, seriously!  It is lightly sweet yet musky at the same time.  Also, as it wears through the day, it changes slightly but is still super yummy.  I have no idea what the notes are, but I feel like I can detect a slight hint of vanilla, maybe some apricot, as well as something musky, almost woody.  I don&#x27;t know!  It&#x27;s really hard to explain this one because it is sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I didn&#x27;t find the bottle attractive.  Me and my boyfriend were kind of shocked when we opened it because it looks like a bottle of booze or cheap perfume.  It&#x27;s supposed to be shaped like a mermaid&#x27;s tail which does make it easy to hold, but isn&#x27;t cute.  The bottle shape also would make it incredibly difficult to travel with.  I have a huge purse, but this glass bottle is large and I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable carrying it with me.  I also I like to keep my perfume in my car, so if you do too--go for the smaller version (or buy both).  Next, it comes with a cute little mermaid charm that detaches from the bottle.  But the charm is so cheap and flimsy, you can&#x27;t really do much with it and it falls off the bottle if you are using it.  The last con would be if you are embarrassed to be seen with a Paris Hilton perfume.  In my opinion, I don&#x27;t care whose name is on the bottle as long as it smells good.  I don&#x27;t have any strong feelings either way towards her, but I&#x27;m leaning more positive as far as her products go.  All her scents seem good.  My box of perfume had Paris on the outside and a cute little mermaid on the box in the inside so just remove the top cover if you don&#x27;t want to gift it that way.  Also, the packaging is less than appealing to me.  I like when perfumes come in beautiful packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s tastes are different, but you should totally give this one a try.  I have sampled tons and tons of perfumes.  From the most expensive brands---to the cheapest and this one is by far the best for me right now.  I am also very sensitive to strong scents and this one did not make my throat or head hurt like a lot of the designer brands.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product on time during the Christmas holiday rush which was amazing!! I cannot find this in any other size bottle that .5 oz in any retail outlet. I have been looking for 2 years.  I was amazed to find it here.  It is exactly as they stated it would be and the price was unbeatable!! I love it!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this perfume, it instantly became my favorite! I was looking for a new scent as my stores have a habit of taking the ones I love and not selling them anymore after I buy them! Of course, this happened to me again with Siren!! Here&#x27;s the difference....I love this perfume SO much that I am searching for it online since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris Hilton - meh. Don&#x27;t know much about her and don&#x27;t really care anyway. Paris Hilton perfume - Yes, please! Especially this one! I&#x27;ve smelled tons of celebrity perfumes and have thought they all smelled disgusting. Never really knew why anyone would buy them. But seriously...Paris put her name on an amazing product! It lasts long, smells fantastic, and I always get compliments!(Well, I always get compliments with all of my perfumes! I must have good taste! &#x3D;P)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this one! Buy it! I know I&#x27;m going to!! W00t!</li>
            <li> Great perfume, light smelling ...Don&#x27;t expect to lure sailors to their demise with this Siren. With that being said, I DO get many compliments from this scent, one in particular stood out from the others. I was applying for a credit card one day (in person at the bank), and you know how that goes. They call your name you go to a room or cubicle blah blah etc. That specific bank it was a room that you went into. I was sitting down, he started asking questions ... (What kind of card do you want to apply for today?) blah blah etc. Then when everything was processing he asked, &amp;#34;what kind of perfume do you have on?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;It fills up the room it smells so good (emphasis on so good). I&#x27;m saying thank you, not giving him the answer to what kind of perfume it is. He goes on to say &amp;#34;I bet it&#x27;s something expensive, and you didn&#x27;t even have to put a lot on.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;It smells like you just need a dab&amp;#34;. His wife&#x27;s birthday was coming up and he said it smelled like a great gift. I played it off like I was one of those people that didn&#x27;t want you to know what I was wearing because I don&#x27;t like to smell like everybody else etc. Nevertheless, my main point is ... Expensive? Hell no. Just a dab, definitely not. You don&#x27;t have to spray excessively, but this is Paris HIlton&#x27;s perfume. It does not last very long, but the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
            <li> is very good thank you very much.</li>
            <li> smells good and big bottle for a good price you get excatally&lt;br /&gt;everything it says&lt;br /&gt;will totally buy agian.&lt;br /&gt;happy</li>
            <li> My wife gets multiple compliments when she wears this perfume.  Its not too weak and its not too strong.  The aroma lasts all day.  I think the packaging is ugly but what do I know about Perfume bottles and Boxes?</li>
            <li> This is a fake. The scent does not last longer than an hour. I bought my last bottle from Macy&#x27;s and it lasts all day. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of perfume. Wanted bottle!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this fragrance!!!! It&#x27;s a nice, fresh scent...u can&#x27;t go wrong especillay for the price! Love it :)</li>
            <li> hermoso, buena calidad.. cumple con lo que pedi, buena espectativa, llego en buen estado.&lt;br /&gt;satisfecha con el collar, ya quiero comprar mas.</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching scents similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret Good Day Sunshine body spray (which I loved but is now discontinued). It is a close match but unfortunately Siren is a bit sweeter and more agressive than I was hoping for. It smells fine and the scent slightly fades over time. Which is a good thing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> love this perfume 2nd time buying this perfume&lt;br /&gt;so pretty, fresh &amp; feminine .. just right for everyday uses :)</li>
            <li> I like the perfume and the bottle is big so it&#x27;s really worth it. I fact this is almost my best deal yet</li>
            <li> Very good my cougar loved it it&#x27;s smells good</li>
            <li> Bottle is gorgeous this is the real thing too came fully wrapped and all</li>
            <li> muy buen producto la mujer encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas peque√±o para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
            <li> I am very picky about perfumes and it takes forever to find one I can wear without sneezing or gassing my workplace neighbors.  Add to that my boyfriend who thinks most everything smells like \\&quot;old lady funeral home\\&quot;, and I have a dickens of a time finding something to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like Paris Hilton, and would never have considered any of her perfumes, but I received a sample and was completely captivated.  It is light, yet very full bodied.  I always get told that I smell wonderful when I&#x27;m wearing it, and it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.  The boyfriend actually likes it and compliments it, and this is a guy that thought Chanel No 5 smelled, and I quote, \\&quot;like bug spray\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not good at explaining the \\&quot;notes\\&quot; in a perfume, but I think what I really like are the honeysuckle and peachy notes.  It reminds me of summer and the outdoors, and it&#x27;s different from a lot of vanilla and jasmine-y scents that are so popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as strong or long lasting as some scents, but it goes for most of a workday and that&#x27;s good enough for me.  This is also a good \\&quot;starter\\&quot; perfume for younger girls and teenagers who are getting into perfumes.</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful blend of white floral, fruity, powdery, citrus and sweet, it is a light fragrance with gentle notes. i bought this from amazon and not a seller. and i absolutely love it</li>
            <li> i have worn this scent for a while now and this is my second bottle.  not only does a bottle last a while, but even at the end of the day the scent hasn&#x27;t worn off like others tend to do. many people, guys and girls, comment and ask all the time what i am wearing.  I don&#x27;t really like paris hilton at all, but i love this perfume!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter who is 20.  She loves this perfume and receives compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> buy this for me is one of my favorite perfumes smells delicious and is very practical size for loading into bag recommend</li>
            <li> I personally said it smelled like an older woman&#x27;s boot . Overall she seems happy, so I guess whatever floats his boat</li>
            <li> My daughter loves mermaids, so when I seen this I had to get it for her birthday, she loved it</li>
            <li> It smells great,  but doesn&#x27;t last all day which is something that&#x27;s important for me but if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying it from time to time during the day this would be a great choice.</li>
            <li> cool fragance for my wife, i like it and she love it</li>
            <li> Has good price &amp; it smells good! But The smells is a bit too sweet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not what I was expected</li>
            <li> Recommended 100% excellent ... responsible pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Love love this perfume...its smells so good...i get a lot of compliments when im out running errands...its just the perfect scent...</li>
            <li> It burned my skin! Fragrance is good though.</li>
            <li> I like several of Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfumes and this one happens to be one of my favorites. I make sure that I always keep a bottle in my collection. It is a classy fragrance that is a lot of people seem to like. I usually only go for fruity fragrances, but this one is me stepping out of the box a little. Try it it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> It IS impressive how close this perfume resembles Viva La Juicy from Juicy Couture, which I&#x27;d found out from people&#x27;s comments in another site. A great alternative for Viva...at third the price :)</li>
            <li> Love it. Does not smell fruity but not like an old lady either.</li>
            <li> Everyone loved how it smelled</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Worth buying..I get complimented all the time when I wear it and it has a long lasting scent</li>
            <li> Love this scent, regardless of who makes it! LOL</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this perfume at Sephora. I wore it one day and found it some what appealing. When I looked it up online and found it for so cheap, regardless of the name plastered to it, I purchased it as a back up perfume when my others are out. (I typically wear, Euphoria, Viva La Juicey, and Forever Red from Bath and Body). I immediately put it on when it arrived, and at first I thought I had made a huge mistake or the perfume must be from a very old batch (very harsh and old lady smelling). BUT within an hour, it softened to a very warm, fragrance. Glad I bought it. I can see how a personal chemical balance could throw this fragrance off and make it pungent though, or someone unwilling to let it air may hate it, it is very pungent at first spray. So maybe pick up a sample. I do wish it was a tad stronger for a longer amount of time, but it is cheap perfume I am sure a pricey version would be much stronger, longer.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SELLER RECOMMENDABLE 100 %</li>
            <li> It is a very good smell.</li>
            <li> I like this when it first goes on but doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.  I feel like reapplying it  more frequently.</li>
            <li> Good buy. Very light scent</li>
            <li> I usually get migraines when i even walk behind someone who wears perfume, but i dont know what it is about Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfumes that dont effect me that way. I absolutely love her perfumes and have several now. Siren is MY personal favorite, though my husband likes heiress better. Love this!</li>
            <li> i just love this parfum i spend hundreads of dollars on parfum and nothing stays on like this one.if your on the fence about it just order it you will not be sorry you can&#x27;t beat the price,thank you paris job well done. ELANA</li>
            <li> My wife loves the Paris Hilton line but doesn&#x27;t care for Paris Hilton, go figure.  Oh well it smells good on her and makes me want to smell her naked.  Isn&#x27;t that the purpose of perfume?  Lol.</li>
            <li> this is my fifth fragrance from PH and I think it is my favorite.. long lasting fresh sexy...value for money</li>
