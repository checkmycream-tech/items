    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Called dental clinic emergency number and good news</li>
            <li>I see a bunch of good reviews about this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good idea,</li>
            <li>The reviews were good.</li>
            <li>it off, cleaned it out again, and this time I decided to use a good fat dab from the bottom of the tub, using the flattened, wider end of a toothpick to get it out of the tub</li>
            <li>/&gt;The temp filling/crown products are good for what they do, but be sure and get the&lt;br /&gt;PURPLE</li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>is they should be able to get me in tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>but I think you would be better buying a bottle of snake oil :)</li>
            <li>or damaged in some way but one thing I know for sure</li>
            <li>I think I ate more of the product than stayed in the lost filling.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure you get the maximum strength brand.</li>
            <li>So the more I tried to spread the material in the crown, the more it balled up and stuck to the applicator --</li>
            <li>A flat-ended toothpick worked MUCH better than the included applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They just need to package it better.</li>
            <li>I still had 2 more weeks to go before getting the permanent crown.</li>
            <li>I was even able to floss my teeth and it didn&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>think a dentists invented this to create more business.&lt;br /&gt;GAR&#x27;BAGE</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and stays put.  </li>
            <li>found it to be exceptionally easy to use, and it worked 1st time for re-attaching my crown.</li>
            <li>but I should sue for this huge cavity in my damn</li>
            <li>It remained secure for the 2 weeks till I got my permanent crown.</li>
            <li>Way cheaper and more convenient than a trip to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, Recapit (a competing brand with &amp;#34;a unique formula&amp;#34;) didn&#x27;t hold at all for me.  </li>
            <li>In this case you can swish with neutral-temp water to clean it, futz with the crown and stick it on.</li>
            <li>It did not work right!  </li>
            <li>On the positive side,&lt;br /&gt;this one seems to have more eugenol (or similar) in it, making it a good choice</li>
            <li>I did a fair bit of research, and Dentemp OS seems to be the highest rated of the options (though it seems they are all made by Majestic Drug, except for one) and Dentemp OS was the only one I found at two drug stores I went</li>
            <li>Strength with good reviews on the web (not necessarily on Amazon).</li>
            <li>so you need to get it in quick.</li>
            <li>It sets quickly, and holds for 4-6 months.  </li>
            <li>It went it well the very first time and after an hour, it harden.</li>
            <li>My dentist actually thought it was a professional temporary, lol.</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>and I found the right tool in the form of a flat-ended toothpick to spread it, it seemed to work well.</li>
            <li>applicator was very easy to use for grabbing a tiny bit of cement and spreading the cement  onto the crown&#x27;s interior pocket.</li>
            <li>Not enough pressure and the dentemps will NOT form as it should for best biting experience once dried.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>Besides it tasted sort of funny.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know exactly what the consistency was supposed to be, but I could not get it to spread *or</li>
            <li>So wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
            <li>: On the downside, the container does not keep the cement fresh and the top layer in my case was too dried out to be sticky or useable (plus the applicator wasn&#x27;t useful at all).</li>
            <li>Make sure the tooth is DRY.</li>
            <li>I made sure I kept it closed while I applied it.  </li>
            <li>after dropping in a fresh dab from the bottom of the tub, and using the wooden toothpick to smear it against all the walls and top sort of like sticky frosting, I removed the excess (by again using the toothpick), and put the crown back on.</li>
            <li>Gently checked the bite.</li>
            <li>The tub is only filled halfway with cement, so the air sitting on top of that cement dries it out, even when the tub is closed.</li>
            <li>My temporary crown fell off while using my WaterPik water flosser ( too much water pressure, I guess, for a temporary crown.)</li>
            <li>Lightly and shortly bite the application</li>
            <li>Too much pressure and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very sticky.</li>
            <li>Allowing mouth to be damp, gently clench and grind your teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a great advantage over other cements that require you to have the post completely dry!  </li>
            <li>Drink only cool liquids and give it hour before eating.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the main reasons I wanted to use cement and not just &amp;#34;be careful&amp;#34; for two days.</li>
            <li>The post is supposed to be wet (not dry) which makes for a very easy application.</li>
            <li>one thing in common they have ifs their application which is roughly about the same and in my experience for best application is:&lt;br /&gt;1-</li>
            <li>But it was also because the entire top layer of cement in the tub was too dry and no</li>
            <li>It was a chunky mess inside the tiny container, and didn&#x27;t provide me with any kind of temp filling at all - it just fell apart.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky and kind of difficult to use at first.</li>
            <li>And if your crown was made well and is a tight fit, there is no room for putty without affecting your bite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4- press hard with a finger, then adjust sides  if too much go out of tooth shape, then press again,until your are satisfied with visual application</li>
            <li>It was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>The product was apparently old.  </li>
            <li>What that tell me is that it was probably old.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this for a tooth that lost its filling and is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>When you eat, eat something soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It already didn&#x27;t last more than a few days</li>
            <li>I tried three different times and each time the crown fell right back off within an hour.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions as carefully as possible, though I may have put too much of the putty/glue inside the temp crown, the directions say to put a width of 2-3 sheets of paper around the upper inside edge... due to the consistency of the putty, this is nearly impossible, but I did the best I could, not wanting to put too much pressure on the edge of the crown with the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it did not work for me does not mean that it will not work for the next person.</li>
            <li>It is thick and gummy and does not spread easily.  </li>
            <li>I got a temporary crown on Friday, it came off Friday night, my dentist isn&#x27;t open again until Tuesday and is located far from where I now work.</li>
            <li>The tiny blue plastic jar looks way bigger online than it really is.  </li>
            <li>In my experience I would also say, try not to drink hot beverages for next hour or so, though cold water seems to be ok 30 minutes after.</li>
            <li>Then gently bit down on a washcloth and held that for 15 secs or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Then gently bit down on a washcloth and held that for 15 secs or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dentist who is now out of business - long story short</li>
            <li> 30 minutes later the crown was loose</li>
            <li> My dental assistant had warned a long time ago not to use too much of these products if I ever needed to use them... (implying it can be hard for the dentist to get the crown off again).</li>
            <li> Put the crown back, checked the bite, and gently applied just a little pressure by biting down on a cotton ball for about 30 sec&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The packaging I got looks different (dark blue) but it says Dentemp Maximum Strength for fillings and crowns, 12+ applications.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product, but carry it on long hiking trips in case.  </li>
            <li> long to set up, if ever.</li>
            <li> have well cleaned hands and fingers with no natural skin oil.</li>
            <li> final small plus, it says the tooth should be wet, not dry, when you put the crown back on.</li>
            <li> I pushed down pretty hard with my fingertip to seat the crown and push out any excess cement.</li>
            <li> No need to dry the crown&#x27;s post (or area around the post).</li>
            <li> For one thing, on dry fingers</li>
            <li> I use a cotton swab to dry the hole and a tissue to dry the tooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the stuff in the blue tub is not worth bringing home.</li>
            <li> So now I am worse off than I was in the first place.</li>
            <li> your tooth is having pain along with the loose filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> temporary crown stayed in my mouth for about 3 hours, then came loose...</li>
            <li> I placed the crown onto the post ( a bit difficult to manipulate) and pressed it down, and bit down to secure it properly.</li>
            <li> Comes in a little blue tub with a plastic applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Damp fingers make it easier to roll into a ball a little bigger than the cavity.</li>
            <li> This is probably why it gets so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Uber careful and clean...doesn&#x27;t hold when you eat.  </li>
            <li> money I have spent.</li>
            <li> Just remember as soon as it gets wet</li>
            <li> What oozes out around, try to pack back in.</li>
            <li> and maybe that&#x27;s partly why the first attempt failed to work.</li>
            <li> So, I looked up how to &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; back the crown, and found at least a half dozen products devoted to this happenstance.</li>
            <li> This company makes a few other types of this product</li>
            <li> I found that Dentemp not adequate \\&quot;cement\\&quot; for even temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I spit it out into my hand and it broke in half.</li>
            <li> After reading the directions and applying Dentemp on my cap, it stayed on less than five minutes and dropped out thank goodness on to the palm of my hand, I reacted and caught it.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;3- Make a rough small ball of dentemp, place the dentemp onto the cavity</li>
            <li> The next day it had become very hard,  I had to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> Waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how some others have had such poor experience with the product.</li>
            <li> With firm pressure and damp fingers, push it into the hole.</li>
            <li> and will come out with very little pressure.</li>
            <li> Very little came out at the gum line which I cleaned away with a dental tool.</li>
            <li> (It was unlikely that there was enough room in post-hole for Dentemp and post.)      </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been using Dentemp products for several years.&lt;br /&gt;(Horrible</li>
            <li> I am sorry the next day it was hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes, despite the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> This CRAP worked forbas long as it took to make a BIGGER HOLE IN MY TOOTH!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did nothing to cause it to get hard.</li>
            <li> Nothing chewy, crunchy or hard.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch or old batch.  </li>
            <li> For those without a root canal this is a plus because blowing air on a tooth to dry it, or patting it with anything when it doesn&#x27;t have a root canal can be painful.</li>
            <li> If applied correctly, it&#x27;s so tough your dentist will have to drill it out.</li>
            <li> Speak of, the directions say to line the crown with a thin layer of Dentemp, about the thickness of three sheets of paper.</li>
            <li> depending on how bad a hole you have in your tooth, this stuff can make months pain</li>

            <li> I put product on the base of crown and inserted post into hole (front lower tooth).  (It was unlikely that there was enough room in post-hole for Dentemp and post.)      I found that Dentemp not adequate \\&quot;cement\\&quot; for even temporary fix.</li>
            <li> Lost a filling and picked this up a local drug store.  Total waste of money.  Never would harden.  After 4 hours, it was like having plumbers puddy in my mouth.  Called dental clinic emergency number and good news is they should be able to get me in tomorrow.  I also asked them about these products and was told none of the over the counter products work and none are FDA licensed for dental repair.  I see a bunch of good reviews about this product and I have to wonder if some of them are paid reviews or employees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good idea, but I think you would be better buying a bottle of snake oil :)</li>
            <li> Got this to fix a temporary crown. I followed the directions exactly but it would not stick. It is thick and gummy and does not spread easily.  I tried three different times and each time the crown fell right back off within an hour.  I even applied it before bed to give it extra time to set and woke up to find the crown under the blanket. Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product, but carry it on long hiking trips in case.  The reviews were good.</li>
            <li> Uber careful and clean...doesn&#x27;t hold when you eat.  After four hours the cap still came out when eating biscuit....da*$!!</li>
            <li> depending on how bad a hole you have in your tooth, this stuff can make months pain free.&lt;br /&gt;BEST money I have spent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been using Dentemp products for several years.&lt;br /&gt;(Horrible dentist who is now out of business - long story short, I&#x27;m the one&lt;br /&gt;who is dealing with the fallout of his bad work.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the stuff in the blue tub is not worth bringing home. It takes WAY&lt;br /&gt;too long to set up, if ever. It says to wait an hour, but often, it is still&lt;br /&gt;pliable and will come out with very little pressure. On the positive side,&lt;br /&gt;this one seems to have more eugenol (or similar) in it, making it a good choice&lt;br /&gt;if your tooth is having pain along with the loose filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temp filling/crown products are good for what they do, but be sure and get the&lt;br /&gt;PURPLE tub, not this blue one. You&#x27;ll find yourself replacing the blue tub filling&lt;br /&gt;very often.</li>
            <li> The product was apparently old.  It did not work right!  It would not stay in the tooth. Besides it tasted sort of funny.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I followed the directions to a tee. It was a chunky mess inside the tiny container, and didn&#x27;t provide me with any kind of temp filling at all - it just fell apart. It was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got a temporary crown on Friday, it came off Friday night, my dentist isn&#x27;t open again until Tuesday and is located far from where I now work. In the circumstances, I figured I should try to reattach the temp myself. I did a fair bit of research, and Dentemp OS seems to be the highest rated of the options (though it seems they are all made by Majestic Drug, except for one) and Dentemp OS was the only one I found at two drug stores I went to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions as carefully as possible, though I may have put too much of the putty/glue inside the temp crown, the directions say to put a width of 2-3 sheets of paper around the upper inside edge... due to the consistency of the putty, this is nearly impossible, but I did the best I could, not wanting to put too much pressure on the edge of the crown with the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temporary crown stayed in my mouth for about 3 hours, then came loose... I spit it out into my hand and it broke in half. So now I am worse off than I was in the first place. That speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> I am sorry the next day it was hard as a rock.  The tiny blue plastic jar looks way bigger online than it really is.  It is very tiny.  I made sure I kept it closed while I applied it.  The next day it had become very hard,  I had to throw it away.  What that tell me is that it was probably old. or damaged in some way but one thing I know for sure I did nothing to cause it to get hard. Maybe I just got a bad batch or old batch.  After reading the directions and applying Dentemp on my cap, it stayed on less than five minutes and dropped out thank goodness on to the palm of my hand, I reacted and caught it.  Because it did not work for me does not mean that it will not work for the next person.</li>
            <li> Cement not even sticky. I have no idea how this could repair a cap.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for a tooth that lost its filling and is sensitive.  It is easy to apply and stays put.  It doesn&#x27;t change the flavors of food and drinks.</li>
            <li> Waste of time &amp; money. I think I ate more of the product than stayed in the lost filling.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the temp filling repair products I have found that this lasts the longest and you can actually eat with it in. It is very sticky and kind of difficult to use at first. Just remember as soon as it gets wet it starts to harden so you need to get it in quick. This company makes a few other types of this product but they just don&#x27;t work well. You need to make sure you get the maximum strength brand.</li>
            <li> The packaging I got looks different (dark blue) but it says Dentemp Maximum Strength for fillings and crowns, 12+ applications. Comes in a little blue tub with a plastic applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a crown fall off on a Saturday morning. Ran to drugstore to pick up this product. My dental assistant had warned a long time ago not to use too much of these products if I ever needed to use them... (implying it can be hard for the dentist to get the crown off again). So I was mindful of that and maybe that&#x27;s partly why the first attempt failed to work. But it was also because the entire top layer of cement in the tub was too dry and no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know exactly what the consistency was supposed to be, but I could not get it to spread *or* stick to the inside of the cleaned-out crown. It kept balling up. And the applicator was useless as it seemed to stick to that better than to the crown. So the more I tried to spread the material in the crown, the more it balled up and stuck to the applicator -- obviously too dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I dug into the bottom of the tub to pull out fresher cement that had not been exposed to the air inside the container... then trailed some of that inside the crown... tried to spread it (directions say spread a layer about the thickness of 3 sheets of paper), but again, the applicator was useless, though the cement was a better consistency. Put the crown back, checked the bite, and gently applied just a little pressure by biting down on a cotton ball for about 30 sec&#x27;s. However I did not expect this to work... I didn&#x27;t feel there was enough cement in it. I was right. 30 minutes later the crown was loose again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took it off, cleaned it out again, and this time I decided to use a good fat dab from the bottom of the tub, using the flattened, wider end of a toothpick to get it out of the tub *and* to smear it around inside the crown. A flat-ended toothpick worked MUCH better than the included applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after dropping in a fresh dab from the bottom of the tub, and using the wooden toothpick to smear it against all the walls and top sort of like sticky frosting, I removed the excess (by again using the toothpick), and put the crown back on. I pushed down pretty hard with my fingertip to seat the crown and push out any excess cement. Very little came out at the gum line which I cleaned away with a dental tool.Gently checked the bite. Then gently bit down on a washcloth and held that for 15 secs or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel this time the tooth felt &#x27;insulated&#x27; with the cement. That&#x27;s one of the main reasons I wanted to use cement and not just &amp;#34;be careful&amp;#34; for two days. Cement should keep saliva, drink and food out, protecting the tooth.  And this stuff has eugenol which helped b/c the tooth does not have a root canal. (Another reason I did not want anything getting under the crown.) I felt this time it was going to hold until Monday when I could get to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line: On the downside, the container does not keep the cement fresh and the top layer in my case was too dried out to be sticky or useable (plus the applicator wasn&#x27;t useful at all). This is probably why it gets so many bad reviews. On the plus side, once I mined cement from the bottom of the tub and it was the consistency it&#x27;s meant to be... and I found the right tool in the form of a flat-ended toothpick to spread it, it seemed to work well. I also like it has oil of clove or eugenol to help ease the tooth pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final small plus, it says the tooth should be wet, not dry, when you put the crown back on. For those without a root canal this is a plus because blowing air on a tooth to dry it, or patting it with anything when it doesn&#x27;t have a root canal can be painful. In this case you can swish with neutral-temp water to clean it, futz with the crown and stick it on. No drying necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just need to package it better. The tub is only filled halfway with cement, so the air sitting on top of that cement dries it out, even when the tub is closed. They need to package it in something that doesn&#x27;t have excess air space. Like a toothpaste tube that can be rolled up as you use it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, despite the bad reviews. You never know whether someone is following directions. Speak of, the directions say to line the crown with a thin layer of Dentemp, about the thickness of three sheets of paper. The problem is, it is the consistency of putty. And if your crown was made well and is a tight fit, there is no room for putty without affecting your bite. Still searching for a solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on a crown for about the last 2 years.  It sets quickly, and holds for 4-6 months.  Way cheaper and more convenient than a trip to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, Recapit (a competing brand with &amp;#34;a unique formula&amp;#34;) didn&#x27;t hold at all for me.  Get the Dentemp!</li>
            <li> My temporary crown fell off while using my WaterPik water flosser ( too much water pressure, I guess, for a temporary crown.) I still had 2 more weeks to go before getting the permanent crown. So, I looked up how to &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; back the crown, and found at least a half dozen products devoted to this happenstance. I wanted to know what to look for/ask for at the drug store, since I had no experience at all with these products. I found Dentemp Max. Strength with good reviews on the web (not necessarily on Amazon). So, I bought it at my closest drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be exceptionally easy to use, and it worked 1st time for re-attaching my crown. It remained secure for the 2 weeks till I got my permanent crown. I can&#x27;t explain how some others have had such poor experience with the product. My experience was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator was very easy to use for grabbing a tiny bit of cement and spreading the cement  onto the crown&#x27;s interior pocket. The post is supposed to be wet (not dry) which makes for a very easy application. No need to dry the crown&#x27;s post (or area around the post). This is a great advantage over other cements that require you to have the post completely dry!  I placed the crown onto the post ( a bit difficult to manipulate) and pressed it down, and bit down to secure it properly. That&#x27;s it. Very easy.</li>
            <li> This actually lasts longer for me than the one that says max.</li>
            <li> When my filling came out, I purchased this.  It went it well the very first time and after an hour, it harden. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it falling out. I was even able to floss my teeth and it didn&#x27;t fall out.  I would recommend it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I do not deny the fact all those dentemp of any brand may be a hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;Though one thing in common they have ifs their application which is roughly about the same and in my experience for best application is:&lt;br /&gt;1- have well cleaned hands and fingers with no natural skin oil. So wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;2- Mouth wash, then rince, and rince again and try keeping your mouth well moist but never overflowing with fluids&lt;br /&gt;3- Make a rough small ball of dentemp, place the dentemp onto the cavity&lt;br /&gt;4- press hard with a finger, then adjust sides  if too much go out of tooth shape, then press again,until your are satisfied with visual application&lt;br /&gt;5- Lightly and shortly bite the application&lt;br /&gt;  Too much pressure and the dentemp is likely to jump out.&lt;br /&gt;  Not enough pressure and the dentemps will NOT form as it should for best biting experience once dried. Also not enough pressure and dentemps cannot fill in well in crevices and such!&lt;br /&gt;6- Do NOT eat anything for next 3~4 hours. In my experience I would also say, try not to drink hot beverages for next hour or so, though cold water seems to be ok 30 minutes after.</li>
            <li> This CRAP worked forbas long as it took to make a BIGGER HOLE IN MY TOOTH!!!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice how big it had gotten until the stuff would no longer stay in.&lt;br /&gt;It already didn&#x27;t last more than a few days but I should sue for this huge cavity in my damn tooth.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Suffer through until you can make it to the dentists.&lt;br /&gt;I think a dentists invented this to create more business.&lt;br /&gt;GAR&#x27;BAGE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. If applied correctly, it&#x27;s so tough your dentist will have to drill it out. But there is a knack for using it. For one thing, on dry fingers it&#x27;s very sticky. Damp fingers make it easier to roll into a ball a little bigger than the cavity. Make sure the tooth is DRY. I use a cotton swab to dry the hole and a tissue to dry the tooth. With firm pressure and damp fingers, push it into the hole. Allowing mouth to be damp, gently clench and grind your teeth. What oozes out around, try to pack back in. Drink only cool liquids and give it hour before eating. When you eat, eat something soft. Nothing chewy, crunchy or hard. In about 12 hours, it&#x27;ll be fully set. My dentist actually thought it was a professional temporary, lol.</li>
