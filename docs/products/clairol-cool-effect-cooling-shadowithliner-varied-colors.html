            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find this shade in drugstores anymore, because it is the best.</li>
            <li>I cant even explain how happy i am with this product!</li>
            <li>The best part...</li>
            <li>Best color ever.  </li>
            <li>Good luck!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Happy with product and color!</li>
            <li>Wife loves it and get great comments on her hair color!</li>
            <li>It was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Change is NOT always good!!  </li>
            <li>The Spiced Tea is the best semi-permanent hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This color is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Smells very nice, and ofcourse no amonia!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look very good at all.</li>
            <li>Bright magenta and orange too!</li>
            <li>Good coverage!</li>
            <li>The in-between color packets are great, too.</li>
            <li>It is a great shade and always comes out evenly.</li>
            <li>The result was great, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Great price as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to ruin your hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am fairly experienced when it comes to coloring my hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It is semipermanent and fades very nicely.</li>
            <li>I tested this product at no cost, yet im very happy :) and all opinions are from the heart.</li>
            <li>Remember how good Iams and Infusium used to be?</li>
            <li>THAT IS GOOD FOR THOSE THAT LIKE THE COLOR BUT</li>
            <li>Great product, nice coverage and good shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was  so excited to find my color again on Amazon at a wonderful price as well.</li>
            <li>I just Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it since I can&#x27;t put permanent color in my hair!</li>
            <li>and I love the brand, but it&#x27;s not as bright as it is on the box.</li>
            <li>so I found a color I liked of this brand.</li>
            <li>; as one reviewer so aptly said).</li>
            <li>This color is nice and leaves your hair shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice color</li>
            <li>Nice medium auburn color.  </li>
            <li>The color is very striking and the conditioner leaves your hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is amazing and it lasts for more than one shampoo.</li>
            <li>&quot; it up, and Natural Instincts was always the perfect product.  </li>
            <li>Great color, great price and just ten minutes to use.</li>
            <li>And of course, a good conditioner (the one that comes with the Natural Instincts is great).</li>
            <li>the first couple of washing, settled into a great color.  </li>
            <li>That, I think, is the true measure of a good color job.  </li>
            <li>I love this auburn color</li>
            <li>and I love Clairol brand.</li>
            <li>It worked fantastic!</li>
            <li>I ordered Spiced Tea but somehow I got another color that I like better than Spiced Tea.  </li>
            <li>( I will need even more.)  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li>I used two boxes, and I needed both to make sure I got all the hair.  </li>
            <li>this is better.</li>
            <li>If you are a red head and just want to perk up your color, this is the best product.</li>
            <li>I usually love this brand.</li>
            <li>However, I was hoping for a much more orange-y color (as I&#x27;m trying to get my hair to be almost a coppery color).</li>
            <li>Was glad that I was able to get it one more time.</li>
            <li>There was another favorite before that one that got discontinued called Sedona Sunrise or Sunset, I think.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally a lovely dishwater brown, bleh,</li>
            <li>and I get many, many compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li>It did an OK job of covering.</li>
            <li>They purchase reputable companies and then re-formulate (cheapen)the product,so their profit margins go up.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times.  </li>
            <li>I agree that the longer you leave it on the better the gray coverage.  </li>
            <li>so I love auto ship.</li>
            <li>so I ordered thinking I was getting Spiced Tea which was my favorite color years ago when I used it.  </li>
            <li>The color itself (I used Medium Brown) is okay.</li>
            <li>Really love the fact that I never have to worry about roots showing.</li>
            <li>But if you want something new and fun, this is a great color!</li>
            <li>Though it says light Auburn, I find it to be more of a medium intensity.</li>
            <li>Easy to use too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, covers my gray for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Also, a first-time dyer should have no problems...very easy to use.</li>
            <li>First time coloring my own hair.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you in finding a new hair color...</li>
            <li>Well, my favorite color of Golden Sienna got discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Have been looking for a replacement for the color that was now no longer available...</li>
            <li>Great Red - Doesn&#x27;t Damage Hair Like Permanant Color.  </li>
            <li>Clairol has changed the color and the box says &amp;#34;former 16 Light Auburn&amp;#34</li>
            <li>If you are expecting the light auburn that Spiced Tea always was, you will not get it with this version.  </li>
            <li>To me it lives up to it&#x27;s name of Spice Tea and adds just the right amount of Spice to my life :)</li>
            <li>I usually use Nice and Easy, but loved this shade option.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, not a great look, but it&#x27;s better to breathe than look awesome while I&#x27;m getting shut eye.  </li>
            <li>Spiced Tea #16 is just right!</li>
            <li>I was worried that Spiced Tea would be too intense or too maroon, but I love the results.</li>
            <li>I really miss it and was glad to find some before I have to change to another product.</li>
            <li>This is a good thing for me because I was aiming for red.  </li>
            <li>It came out a beautiful, rich auburn with coppery highlights, and several people have told me it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I think I could use more, I really only use it on my roots and top area.</li>
            <li>None of it is the products fault, all my own, but I wanted those who are as inexperienced as I to consider the woes of coloring roots before purchasing :)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to assume that this product only works on already processed hair which kind of defeats the purpose of trying to use a product that is more gentle on one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love the new box though.</li>
            <li>Best red and lasts as long as permanent.  </li>
            <li>and my hair still looks pretty well dyed!</li>
            <li>It looks great freshly colored and it fades away gradually enough to look natural.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead and this covers my white hairs and blends perfectly with my natural color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice red color,</li>
            <li>My hair also feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have many compliments  on my hair color and style which I wear short cropped close to my head in back and longer on top to be able to use a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Some of my natural hair shows through, which adds greater tone to the color.</li>
            <li>You look better, but so natural nobody is saying \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li>Kind of a generic orangish brown.</li>
            <li>It washes away pretty quickly, after about two shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have been using this color light auburn, #16 for over 8 years, mixing it sometimes with the 15rg light golden red.  </li>
            <li>The color turned out very much like it said it did.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>Very content!</li>
            <li>I tried it once several months ago, and it was surprisingly okay.  </li>
            <li>the first couple nights after coloring.  </li>
            <li>Maybe people were doing what I did, and buying as many boxes as I could because they wouldn&#x27;t stock it enough!  </li>
            <li>It smells way more chemical, and the color feels different...</li>
            <li>only thing I liked about this product was the conditioner which actually did make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>However, I will no longer purchase this product from Amazon since they are not sending the most recent version of this hair color.</li>
            <li>more Auburn than RED or BROWN</li>
            <li>and that was pretty much a match for my hair, but I definitely prefer the lovely auburn hints.</li>
            <li>They stopped making the the light golden red, and now they have changed the formula, packaging, conditioner etc., on with this color.</li>
            <li>I have contacted the company asking why they discontinued the light golden red</li>
            <li>I love the color, but I had to use it repeatedly to get all the grey covered.</li>
            <li>Maybe its better for someone without grey roots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve happily used semi-permanent hair colors from L&#x27;Oreal and Clairol for years and have seen them go through various iterations, so I didn&#x27;t think twice when the Clairol Natural Instincts boxes started to look a bit different.  </li>
            <li>Before this, I tried dark warm brown #28</li>
            <li>While I was figuring out the right formula I discovered Prell shampoo which has a high detergent content.</li>
            <li>It makes it so the red is more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over ten years, and my hair feels so much more soft and conditioned right after doing it.</li>
            <li>I never had problem any popular bland name hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li>This keeps her hair healthy looking &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry it out like a permanent hair color could.</li>
            <li>Some reviews mention the color refresher pack turned their hair red, but for me that&#x27;s fine because that&#x27;s the color</li>
            <li>It is darker and MUCH redder.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much Spiced Tea to get the reddish-gold effect I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>and I really like the conditioner it comes with.  </li>
            <li>Well, it would really be faded then.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>I bought this color specifically to color my roots and match them to the rest of my hair, which is a light auburn color (similar to the one this product promises).</li>
            <li>Amazon sells this as Spiced Tea, a light auburn color, indicating the package may be different</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer a more naturally looking light copper red.  </li>
            <li>One lady really wanted to know what dye I had used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you are looking for a more natural red-</li>
            <li>I love Natural Instincts, and this is the third time I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with it.</li>
            <li>, I did my roots first as it would take longer for the uncolored hair to take the new color, then went on to do the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>If you look at the other 5-star reviews, many of them are for this color,</li>
            <li>One or two good shampoos using Prell will tone down too much red.</li>
            <li>More like medium auburn to mahogany, but not unhappy - just a little surprised.</li>
            <li>As the product gradually washes out, the color remains consistent throughout, looking completely natural at all times.</li>
            <li>Wish they still sold it more widely for natural redheads like myself.</li>
            <li>I am of the older generation 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>hope this will work out as well as the older color.</li>
            <li>While it is red, it is prone to fading quickly.  </li>
            <li>I believe the boxes I received were an older version.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that the package they show in the listing is the exact same one you will get.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for a friend who has been using this color for quite a while &amp; loves it,  but she was buying one box at a time at stores at a way too high price.  </li>
            <li>my hair dried, the color was a beautiful dark red with ginger undertones - not a completely natural look, but I&#x27;m sure that it will fade into one.</li>
            <li>And the husband has never complained.  </li>
            <li>I loved the color and it left my hair in about the same condition as other hair dyes.</li>
            <li>It only covers gray until the first wash, which I really like because people think it&#x27;s my natural color when they can still see the gray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a prime example of another company trying to save money by cheapening the product, and then they call it \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have light ash brown hair with blond highlights, and I left this product on for ten minutes, which is the minimum recommended time.</li>
            <li>very natural looking</li>
            <li>It is a very natural color,</li>
            <li>It does leave a bit of smell after coloring, and as I am very sensitive to smells, I wrap my hair with a bandana before I go to bed</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a very natural looking color.  </li>
            <li>I was born a natural redhead, but as you get older the pretty red color fades, so I started \\&quot;brightening\\</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the week two booster yet, I&#x27;ve been so busy, and my color is still showing!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the reformulated version, I tried the refresher, which left a brassy orange cast to my hair.  </li>
            <li>And not a fake red either.</li>
            <li>I am not totally gray, but I have quite a bit of gray mixed in, especially at my temples and on top.  </li>
            <li>Both the old version and the new version.  </li>
            <li>The first week or so it&#x27;s a bit freaky, mildly punkish dark red.  </li>
            <li>I do know that this current formula left my hair with a much richer color than I expected for a semi-permanent dye and that my hair is soft and smooth after dyeing it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a truly natural color, unlike those purpleish shades.</li>
            <li>This matches my natural color, I have some gray but don&#x27;t want to go with permanent color.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much damage at all, my hair was actually moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is not a natural looking color, but I actually really like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally a red-head</li>
            <li>and I use this color every 3 months to boost my natural color.</li>
            <li>Maybe my trick will help some of us natural redheads who are fading out as age and gray hair creep up on us</li>
            <li>people talked about the old formula over all, but I don&#x27;t know anything about that.  </li>
            <li>try this even if you have tried Natural instincts</li>
            <li>I have not tried the old box with this color.</li>
            <li>The ends don&#x27;t get a lot of coverage because you only get so much.</li>
            <li>I have been using Natural Instincts for years and was upset when they took this color off the shelves.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 20 years or so..........makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I picked a color close to my natural color</li>
            <li>I have used Natural Instincts for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>ALL THESE YEARS, GOODBYE NATURAL INSTINCTS</li>
            <li>It says natural, but it is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>It fades out naturally as you wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>I always get compliments from men and women and asked if this is natural</li>
            <li>Review for Clairol Natural Instincts Spiced Tea 16.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could still find my old Natural Instincts color....</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using Natural Instincts exclusively for over 15 years</li>
            <li>Then it becomes more natural but still has that sort of fake red (not copper/orange) tint that many red dyes have.  </li>
            <li>Previous versions of Natural Instincts have easily covered the gray and left my hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead but as I&#x27;ve aged, the color has faded to a light brown with grey streaks.</li>
            <li>Now I have no idea if the color refresher works well with other colors because when I used other colors (the brown reds mostly), they were in the old box.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally medium brown with natural red highlights that can only be seen in the sun really.</li>
            <li>I know some people have had a problem with the new formula, but it has worked the same for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it very gradually washes out.</li>
            <li>I skipped the refresher the second time and will be skipping Natural Instincts completely from now on.  </li>
            <li>I complained to Amazon about my most recent purchase and they did refund my money.  </li>
            <li>Also, from past experience, this color in particular (with any hair coloring kit) doesn&#x27;t last long and fades quickly!</li>
            <li>I mix several shades of Natural Instincts to get the shade I want</li>
            <li>I have medium-tone golden-red brown hair (about shoulder length) as it is, but have always wanted to be ginger - this being the lightest red NI offers</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always been the one I could use and fool people that I&#x27;m a natural red and cover all my stray greys as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much different from my normal shade, actually.</li>
            <li>My formula is 5 1/2 teaspoons Medium Golden Blonde and &amp;#60;1 teaspoon Spiced Tea to half of the developer (I mark the developer bottle with a sharpie).</li>
            <li>Application was easy as pie, as usual, and I left it on a little longer than recommended because I have so much</li>
            <li>their old conditioner with aloe has me purchasing aloe vera conditioners--sans parabens and perfumes -- I only wear essential oils</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only dye that actually leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and has a natural curl/wave to it.</li>
            <li>No strange color roots.  </li>
            <li>Since the Sienna / Sedona Sunset (or whatever it was called) was discontinued, leaving no light red/strawberry blonde shade option, I now mix a tiny bit of Spiced Tea (#16) into the Medium Golden Blonde (once #4, now #8G).</li>
            <li>Both times, the color barely touched my moderate gray and left my hair coarse, frizzy, and brittle.  </li>
            <li>My hair also feels soft and silky and my natural waves are less frizzy.</li>
            <li>It is affordable, and gentle enough on hair that I have regularly used it every 4 weeks for the last year and a half.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find this shade in drugstores anymore, because it is the best.</li>
            <li> I cant even explain how happy i am with this product!</li>
            <li> The best part...</li>
            <li> Best color ever.  </li>
            <li> Good luck!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Happy with product and color!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and get great comments on her hair color!</li>
            <li> It was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Change is NOT always good!!  </li>
            <li> The Spiced Tea is the best semi-permanent hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This color is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, and ofcourse no amonia!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look very good at all.</li>
            <li> Bright magenta and orange too!</li>
            <li> Good coverage!</li>
            <li> The in-between color packets are great, too.</li>
            <li> It is a great shade and always comes out evenly.</li>
            <li> The result was great, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Great price as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to ruin your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am fairly experienced when it comes to coloring my hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It is semipermanent and fades very nicely.</li>
            <li> I tested this product at no cost, yet im very happy :) and all opinions are from the heart.</li>
            <li> Remember how good Iams and Infusium used to be?</li>
            <li> THAT IS GOOD FOR THOSE THAT LIKE THE COLOR BUT</li>
            <li> Great product, nice coverage and good shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was  so excited to find my color again on Amazon at a wonderful price as well.</li>
            <li> I just Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it since I can&#x27;t put permanent color in my hair!</li>
            <li> and I love the brand, but it&#x27;s not as bright as it is on the box.</li>
            <li> so I found a color I liked of this brand.</li>
            <li> ; as one reviewer so aptly said).</li>
            <li> This color is nice and leaves your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice color</li>
            <li> Nice medium auburn color.  </li>
            <li> The color is very striking and the conditioner leaves your hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is amazing and it lasts for more than one shampoo.</li>
            <li> &quot; it up, and Natural Instincts was always the perfect product.  </li>
            <li> Great color, great price and just ten minutes to use.</li>
            <li> And of course, a good conditioner (the one that comes with the Natural Instincts is great).</li>
            <li> the first couple of washing, settled into a great color.  </li>
            <li> That, I think, is the true measure of a good color job.  </li>
            <li> I love this auburn color</li>
            <li> and I love Clairol brand.</li>
            <li> It worked fantastic!</li>
            <li> I ordered Spiced Tea but somehow I got another color that I like better than Spiced Tea.  </li>
            <li> ( I will need even more.)  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li> I used two boxes, and I needed both to make sure I got all the hair.  </li>
            <li> this is better.</li>
            <li> If you are a red head and just want to perk up your color, this is the best product.</li>
            <li> I usually love this brand.</li>
            <li> However, I was hoping for a much more orange-y color (as I&#x27;m trying to get my hair to be almost a coppery color).</li>
            <li> Was glad that I was able to get it one more time.</li>
            <li> There was another favorite before that one that got discontinued called Sedona Sunrise or Sunset, I think.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a lovely dishwater brown, bleh,</li>
            <li> and I get many, many compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li> It did an OK job of covering.</li>
            <li> They purchase reputable companies and then re-formulate (cheapen)the product,so their profit margins go up.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times.  </li>
            <li> I agree that the longer you leave it on the better the gray coverage.  </li>
            <li> so I love auto ship.</li>
            <li> so I ordered thinking I was getting Spiced Tea which was my favorite color years ago when I used it.  </li>
            <li> The color itself (I used Medium Brown) is okay.</li>
            <li> Really love the fact that I never have to worry about roots showing.</li>
            <li> But if you want something new and fun, this is a great color!</li>
            <li> Though it says light Auburn, I find it to be more of a medium intensity.</li>
            <li> Easy to use too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, covers my gray for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Also, a first-time dyer should have no problems...very easy to use.</li>
            <li> First time coloring my own hair.</li>
            <li> Good luck to you in finding a new hair color...</li>
            <li> Well, my favorite color of Golden Sienna got discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Have been looking for a replacement for the color that was now no longer available...</li>
            <li> Great Red - Doesn&#x27;t Damage Hair Like Permanant Color.  </li>
            <li> Clairol has changed the color and the box says &amp;#34;former 16 Light Auburn&amp;#34</li>
            <li> If you are expecting the light auburn that Spiced Tea always was, you will not get it with this version.  </li>
            <li> To me it lives up to it&#x27;s name of Spice Tea and adds just the right amount of Spice to my life :)</li>
            <li> I usually use Nice and Easy, but loved this shade option.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, not a great look, but it&#x27;s better to breathe than look awesome while I&#x27;m getting shut eye.  </li>
            <li> Spiced Tea #16 is just right!</li>
            <li> I was worried that Spiced Tea would be too intense or too maroon, but I love the results.</li>
            <li> I really miss it and was glad to find some before I have to change to another product.</li>
            <li> This is a good thing for me because I was aiming for red.  </li>
            <li> It came out a beautiful, rich auburn with coppery highlights, and several people have told me it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I think I could use more, I really only use it on my roots and top area.</li>
            <li> None of it is the products fault, all my own, but I wanted those who are as inexperienced as I to consider the woes of coloring roots before purchasing :)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to assume that this product only works on already processed hair which kind of defeats the purpose of trying to use a product that is more gentle on one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love the new box though.</li>
            <li> Best red and lasts as long as permanent.  </li>
            <li> and my hair still looks pretty well dyed!</li>
            <li> It looks great freshly colored and it fades away gradually enough to look natural.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and this covers my white hairs and blends perfectly with my natural color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice red color,</li>
            <li> My hair also feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have many compliments  on my hair color and style which I wear short cropped close to my head in back and longer on top to be able to use a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Some of my natural hair shows through, which adds greater tone to the color.</li>
            <li> You look better, but so natural nobody is saying \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li> Kind of a generic orangish brown.</li>
            <li> It washes away pretty quickly, after about two shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have been using this color light auburn, #16 for over 8 years, mixing it sometimes with the 15rg light golden red.  </li>
            <li> The color turned out very much like it said it did.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Very content!</li>
            <li> I tried it once several months ago, and it was surprisingly okay.  </li>
            <li> the first couple nights after coloring.  </li>
            <li> Maybe people were doing what I did, and buying as many boxes as I could because they wouldn&#x27;t stock it enough!  </li>
            <li> It smells way more chemical, and the color feels different...</li>
            <li> only thing I liked about this product was the conditioner which actually did make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> However, I will no longer purchase this product from Amazon since they are not sending the most recent version of this hair color.</li>
            <li> more Auburn than RED or BROWN</li>
            <li> and that was pretty much a match for my hair, but I definitely prefer the lovely auburn hints.</li>
            <li> They stopped making the the light golden red, and now they have changed the formula, packaging, conditioner etc., on with this color.</li>
            <li> I have contacted the company asking why they discontinued the light golden red</li>
            <li> I love the color, but I had to use it repeatedly to get all the grey covered.</li>
            <li> Maybe its better for someone without grey roots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve happily used semi-permanent hair colors from L&#x27;Oreal and Clairol for years and have seen them go through various iterations, so I didn&#x27;t think twice when the Clairol Natural Instincts boxes started to look a bit different.  </li>
            <li> Before this, I tried dark warm brown #28</li>
            <li> While I was figuring out the right formula I discovered Prell shampoo which has a high detergent content.</li>
            <li> It makes it so the red is more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over ten years, and my hair feels so much more soft and conditioned right after doing it.</li>
            <li> I never had problem any popular bland name hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This keeps her hair healthy looking &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry it out like a permanent hair color could.</li>
            <li> Some reviews mention the color refresher pack turned their hair red, but for me that&#x27;s fine because that&#x27;s the color</li>
            <li> It is darker and MUCH redder.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much Spiced Tea to get the reddish-gold effect I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> and I really like the conditioner it comes with.  </li>
            <li> Well, it would really be faded then.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> I bought this color specifically to color my roots and match them to the rest of my hair, which is a light auburn color (similar to the one this product promises).</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this as Spiced Tea, a light auburn color, indicating the package may be different</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer a more naturally looking light copper red.  </li>
            <li> One lady really wanted to know what dye I had used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you are looking for a more natural red-</li>
            <li> I love Natural Instincts, and this is the third time I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with it.</li>
            <li> , I did my roots first as it would take longer for the uncolored hair to take the new color, then went on to do the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> If you look at the other 5-star reviews, many of them are for this color,</li>
            <li> One or two good shampoos using Prell will tone down too much red.</li>
            <li> More like medium auburn to mahogany, but not unhappy - just a little surprised.</li>
            <li> As the product gradually washes out, the color remains consistent throughout, looking completely natural at all times.</li>
            <li> Wish they still sold it more widely for natural redheads like myself.</li>
            <li> I am of the older generation 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> hope this will work out as well as the older color.</li>
            <li> While it is red, it is prone to fading quickly.  </li>
            <li> I believe the boxes I received were an older version.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that the package they show in the listing is the exact same one you will get.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend who has been using this color for quite a while &amp; loves it,  but she was buying one box at a time at stores at a way too high price.  </li>
            <li> my hair dried, the color was a beautiful dark red with ginger undertones - not a completely natural look, but I&#x27;m sure that it will fade into one.</li>
            <li> And the husband has never complained.  </li>
            <li> I loved the color and it left my hair in about the same condition as other hair dyes.</li>
            <li> It only covers gray until the first wash, which I really like because people think it&#x27;s my natural color when they can still see the gray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a prime example of another company trying to save money by cheapening the product, and then they call it \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have light ash brown hair with blond highlights, and I left this product on for ten minutes, which is the minimum recommended time.</li>
            <li> very natural looking</li>
            <li> It is a very natural color,</li>
            <li> It does leave a bit of smell after coloring, and as I am very sensitive to smells, I wrap my hair with a bandana before I go to bed</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a very natural looking color.  </li>
            <li> I was born a natural redhead, but as you get older the pretty red color fades, so I started \\&quot;brightening\\</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the week two booster yet, I&#x27;ve been so busy, and my color is still showing!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the reformulated version, I tried the refresher, which left a brassy orange cast to my hair.  </li>
            <li> And not a fake red either.</li>
            <li> I am not totally gray, but I have quite a bit of gray mixed in, especially at my temples and on top.  </li>
            <li> Both the old version and the new version.  </li>
            <li> The first week or so it&#x27;s a bit freaky, mildly punkish dark red.  </li>
            <li> I do know that this current formula left my hair with a much richer color than I expected for a semi-permanent dye and that my hair is soft and smooth after dyeing it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a truly natural color, unlike those purpleish shades.</li>
            <li> This matches my natural color, I have some gray but don&#x27;t want to go with permanent color.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much damage at all, my hair was actually moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is not a natural looking color, but I actually really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a red-head</li>
            <li> and I use this color every 3 months to boost my natural color.</li>
            <li> Maybe my trick will help some of us natural redheads who are fading out as age and gray hair creep up on us</li>
            <li> people talked about the old formula over all, but I don&#x27;t know anything about that.  </li>
            <li> try this even if you have tried Natural instincts</li>
            <li> I have not tried the old box with this color.</li>
            <li> The ends don&#x27;t get a lot of coverage because you only get so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using Natural Instincts for years and was upset when they took this color off the shelves.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 20 years or so..........makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I picked a color close to my natural color</li>
            <li> I have used Natural Instincts for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> ALL THESE YEARS, GOODBYE NATURAL INSTINCTS</li>
            <li> It says natural, but it is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> It fades out naturally as you wash your hair.  </li>
            <li> I always get compliments from men and women and asked if this is natural</li>
            <li> Review for Clairol Natural Instincts Spiced Tea 16.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could still find my old Natural Instincts color....</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using Natural Instincts exclusively for over 15 years</li>
            <li> Then it becomes more natural but still has that sort of fake red (not copper/orange) tint that many red dyes have.  </li>
            <li> Previous versions of Natural Instincts have easily covered the gray and left my hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead but as I&#x27;ve aged, the color has faded to a light brown with grey streaks.</li>
            <li> Now I have no idea if the color refresher works well with other colors because when I used other colors (the brown reds mostly), they were in the old box.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally medium brown with natural red highlights that can only be seen in the sun really.</li>
            <li> I know some people have had a problem with the new formula, but it has worked the same for me.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it very gradually washes out.</li>
            <li> I skipped the refresher the second time and will be skipping Natural Instincts completely from now on.  </li>
            <li> I complained to Amazon about my most recent purchase and they did refund my money.  </li>
            <li> Also, from past experience, this color in particular (with any hair coloring kit) doesn&#x27;t last long and fades quickly!</li>
            <li> I mix several shades of Natural Instincts to get the shade I want</li>
            <li> I have medium-tone golden-red brown hair (about shoulder length) as it is, but have always wanted to be ginger - this being the lightest red NI offers</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always been the one I could use and fool people that I&#x27;m a natural red and cover all my stray greys as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much different from my normal shade, actually.</li>
            <li> My formula is 5 1/2 teaspoons Medium Golden Blonde and &amp;#60;1 teaspoon Spiced Tea to half of the developer (I mark the developer bottle with a sharpie).</li>
            <li> Application was easy as pie, as usual, and I left it on a little longer than recommended because I have so much</li>
            <li> their old conditioner with aloe has me purchasing aloe vera conditioners--sans parabens and perfumes -- I only wear essential oils</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only dye that actually leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and has a natural curl/wave to it.</li>
            <li> No strange color roots.  </li>
            <li> Since the Sienna / Sedona Sunset (or whatever it was called) was discontinued, leaving no light red/strawberry blonde shade option, I now mix a tiny bit of Spiced Tea (#16) into the Medium Golden Blonde (once #4, now #8G).</li>
            <li> Both times, the color barely touched my moderate gray and left my hair coarse, frizzy, and brittle.  </li>
            <li> My hair also feels soft and silky and my natural waves are less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is affordable, and gentle enough on hair that I have regularly used it every 4 weeks for the last year and a half.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find just the right shade of red that is not too orange and not too purple!</li>
            <li> ; but this is a deep brown with only a slight red highlight to it and is for medium and dark brown hair instead of dark blonde and light brown.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a mess after using Natural Insticts!!  </li>
            <li> did* notice the new color refresher and some slight changes in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle and did not give me an orange tint, but it gave my hair just the right amount of color to brighten me up.</li>
            <li> It did wash out really soon after using it and I have this problem with all the hair coloring products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I decided one day to hide my grey with a red tone hair color.</li>
            <li> And since it is semi permanent it did not make my hair one flat color.</li>
            <li> The color is bright and does not look fake or dull.</li>
            <li> started with medium-brown long hair that had not been dyed.  </li>
            <li> Not clear yet as to whether or not it&#x27;s discontinued.  </li>
            <li> other 2 shades of red-</li>
            <li> When you use permanent, you only want to use it every other month so as not to damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Lets just say that while my hair is a very dark brown, I should have considered that greys are white and therefore would require a different color than the rest of it.</li>
            <li> I use it on damp or dry hair, depending on my mood.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s now in her late 50&#x27;s), beginning with a close match to her natural color (med brown) &amp; then changing to a brown with red in it, then to this colir, Spiced Tea.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money if you actually want it to cover any gray!  </li>
            <li> Apparently my shoulder-length hair was too thick and needed extra dye.</li>
            <li> This used to make my hair soft and shiny, now it makes it dull and dry.  </li>
            <li> Since she has very dry hair, she washes it every 3 days, so her grays grow out before the color should begin to fade.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to find a nice shade of red that does not look loud and fake.</li>
            <li> Why are you changing something that was already great to this horrible product!  </li>
            <li> I actually washed my hair before testing this product out, i dried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find this in stores</li>
            <li> I have to convince people that I&#x27;m not really a redhead.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I used the booster packet they give you.</li>
            <li> My current color is also non permanent and I have a few highlights, which, of course, are permanent.</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair shows minimal to no difference in color either.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, but as a child it was a little lighter with some hints of red.</li>
            <li> With other products, they would start to show after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find it consistently in stores</li>
            <li> I had flourescent orange roots, then an awful hued pink, and finally a nicely faded strawberry blonde halo around my temples and forehead.</li>
            <li> My hair was a dark blonde/light brown before using it.  </li>
            <li> I have washed my hair three times in an hour trying to tone it down.  </li>
            <li> My husband was down in the shop.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but he couldn&#x27;t quite pin it down.  </li>
            <li> Very slight pink hue</li>
            <li> I went from a medium brown to a slightly darker \\&quot;caramel\\&quot; brown.</li>
            <li> It came out a bit dark but washed up to the package color after a  few shampoos.</li>
            <li> I mix it all in a little dish and apply with a brush.</li>
            <li> A little darker than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I had to use some just to get area which is probably greyer around the bangs, which was a waste of product.</li>
            <li> It is darker than the picture on the box, but I expect it will lighten up after a few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product before I dont know why but was a waste of money not the seller fault,but didnt get the job done</li>
            <li> I colored, rinsed and dried before he came in the house.  </li>
            <li> well, if you leave it on long enough to cover your grays, it will look very fake and dark(think gothic).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not LIGHT auburn!</li>
            <li> Sucks... Did not cover one of my grey hairs!!!grrr frustrating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this color 3 times in the past.  </li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really disappointed and annoyed that I wasted money on this product.</li>
            <li> Totally shocked to have the same gray roots I started with!  </li>
            <li> So very disappointed in Clairol with Natural Instincts.  </li>
            <li> THEY DISCONTINUED THIS COLOR WITH NO REPLACEMENT EXCEPT A TOO TOO DARK AUBURN :(</li>
            <li> SUCKS!!</li>
            <li> Horrible, wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> NO MORE :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST!</li>
            <li> the conditioner is weak and even the gloves they include have gone to crap.</li>
            <li> TOO BAD....</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> it came in, it was a mess!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed Clairol!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THAT bad!!!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find this shade in drugstores anymore, because it is the best. It&#x27;s a truly natural color, unlike those purpleish shades. It only covers gray until the first wash, which I really like because people think it&#x27;s my natural color when they can still see the gray. If this color gets discontinued, I might go on a homicidal spree at the Clairol factory. I&#x27;ve been using this for over ten years, and my hair feels so much more soft and conditioned right after doing it. The conditioner is amazing and it lasts for more than one shampoo. The in-between color packets are great, too.</li>
            <li> I cant even explain how happy i am with this product! I actually washed my hair before testing this product out, i dried it. Smells very nice, and ofcourse no amonia! Very content! I tested this product at no cost, yet im very happy :) and all opinions are from the heart. Xoxo :*</li>
            <li> This matches my natural color, I have some gray but don&#x27;t want to go with permanent color.  It&#x27;s a nice red color, very natural looking I think.  Easy to use too.  Wish they still sold it more widely for natural redheads like myself.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on my hair color! I just Love it! It is hard to find just the right shade of red that is not too orange and not too purple! Spiced Tea #16 is just right!</li>
            <li> About three months ago, I had my \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair dyed (only semi-permanent) at Ulta. I got a hair cut too, but the cost was 70 dollars!! I was flabbergasted. Apparently my shoulder-length hair was too thick and needed extra dye. Well, I am not made of money so I found a color I liked of this brand. I went from a medium brown to a slightly darker \\&quot;caramel\\&quot; brown. The color turned out very much like it said it did. It&#x27;s been four weeks and my hair still looks pretty well dyed! I haven&#x27;t used the week two booster yet, I&#x27;ve been so busy, and my color is still showing! I didn&#x27;t notice much damage at all, my hair was actually moisturized. I will be using it again (:</li>
            <li> I love this auburn color and I love Clairol brand. The color is bright and does not look fake or dull. My hair also feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this color for several years but could not get it any longer in the stores? I was  so excited to find my color again on Amazon at a wonderful price as well. I was born with carrot red  hair but over time it turned blond and then finally ash blond. My mom had reddish hair and freckles so  I decided one day to hide my grey with a red tone hair color. I am of the older generation 60&#x27;s. It worked fantastic! I have many compliments  on my hair color and style which I wear short cropped close to my head in back and longer on top to be able to use a curling iron.  To me it lives up to it&#x27;s name of Spice Tea and adds just the right amount of Spice to my life :)</li>
            <li> I ordered Spiced Tea but somehow I got another color that I like better than Spiced Tea.  Thank you very much</li>
            <li> The color did NOT turn out in my hair like it did on the box. Of course, no dye from the box ever does. It is darker and MUCH redder. Bright magenta and orange too! It is not a natural looking color, but I actually really like it! It&#x27;s different. And since it is semi permanent it did not make my hair one flat color. Some of my natural hair shows through, which adds greater tone to the color. If you want the color on the box, then do not get this product. But if you want something new and fun, this is a great color!</li>
            <li> I love the color, but I had to use it repeatedly to get all the grey covered.( I will need even more.)  I had to use some just to get area which is probably greyer around the bangs, which was a waste of product. Also, from past experience, this color in particular (with any hair coloring kit) doesn&#x27;t last long and fades quickly!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is affordable, and gentle enough on hair that I have regularly used it every 4 weeks for the last year and a half.  The best part...it fades over time (but the \\&quot;boost packet\\&quot; after 2 weeks helps restore some color) so never have roots showing in-between colorings!  With other products, they would start to show after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a red-head and I use this color every 3 months to boost my natural color. It is a great shade and always comes out evenly.</li>
            <li> Great color, great price and just ten minutes to use.</li>
            <li> Best color ever.  My hair loves it.</li>
            <li> love it -- my hair comes out in shades like an expensive foil--their old conditioner with aloe has me purchasing aloe vera conditioners--sans parabens and perfumes -- I only wear essential oils --no crappy colones/fragrances  gag/gag/puke</li>
            <li> Maybe my trick will help some of us natural redheads who are fading out as age and gray hair creep up on us (I&#x27;m 58). I mix several shades of Natural Instincts to get the shade I want (so I do not come out looking like &amp;#34;Bozo the Clown&amp;#34; as one reviewer so aptly said). Since the Sienna / Sedona Sunset (or whatever it was called) was discontinued, leaving no light red/strawberry blonde shade option, I now mix a tiny bit of Spiced Tea (#16) into the Medium Golden Blonde (once #4, now #8G). It doesn&#x27;t take much Spiced Tea to get the reddish-gold effect I&#x27;m looking for. My hair is on the short side (above the shoulder), so I can actually get 2 colorings out of one bottle of developer. My formula is 5 1/2 teaspoons Medium Golden Blonde and &amp;#60;1 teaspoon Spiced Tea to half of the developer (I mark the developer bottle with a sharpie). I mix it all in a little dish and apply with a brush. While I was figuring out the right formula I discovered Prell shampoo which has a high detergent content. One or two good shampoos using Prell will tone down too much red. I always keep it on hand &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;. And of course, a good conditioner (the one that comes with the Natural Instincts is great). Good luck!!</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, but as a child it was a little lighter with some hints of red. This \\&quot;spiced tea\\&quot; #16 brought my hair back closer to that shade and I love it! It is subtle and did not give me an orange tint, but it gave my hair just the right amount of color to brighten me up. Before this, I tried dark warm brown #28 and that was pretty much a match for my hair, but I definitely prefer the lovely auburn hints. My hair also feels soft and silky and my natural waves are less frizzy. I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I pored over customer reviews before I bought a hair coloring kit online.  If you look at the other 5-star reviews, many of them are for this color, Spiced Tea. Just something to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people talked about the old formula over all, but I don&#x27;t know anything about that.  I do know that this current formula left my hair with a much richer color than I expected for a semi-permanent dye and that my hair is soft and smooth after dyeing it.  I am really pleased.  (See the photo I posted above.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with medium-brown long hair that had not been dyed.  (I used to dye my hair, but I haven&#x27;t in years.)  I used two boxes, and I needed both to make sure I got all the hair.  I left it on for longer than required, about 15 minutes after I had put it all on.  The result was great, in my opinion.  It is darker than the picture on the box, but I expect it will lighten up after a few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my personal experience, 5 stars are in order.  Great price as well.  (I paid $9/box.)</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find a nice shade of red that does not look loud and fake. This color is nice and leaves your hair shiny. I recommend this if you are looking for a more natural red- try this even if you have tried Natural instincts other 2 shades of red- this is better.</li>
            <li> If you are a red head and just want to perk up your color, this is the best product. Though it says light Auburn, I find it to be more of a medium intensity. The color is very striking and the conditioner leaves your hair very smooth. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> It came out a bit dark but washed up to the package color after a  few shampoos. It is a very natural color,</li>
            <li> More like medium auburn to mahogany, but not unhappy - just a little surprised. It&#x27;s certainly not LIGHT auburn!</li>
            <li> Did not cover my greys I use this product before I dont know why but was a waste of money not the seller fault,but didnt get the job done I usually love this brand. Maybe its better for someone without grey roots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find this in stores so now I have to buy it online.  Not clear yet as to whether or not it&#x27;s discontinued.  This is the nicest shade for my hair and I really like the conditioner it comes with.  It&#x27;s really a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it very gradually washes out.</li>
            <li> order was recieved as advertised in a timely fashion!</li>
            <li> Should say orange...bright orange! Nothing like the pictures....</li>
            <li> I love Natural Instincts, and this is the third time I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with it. I have medium-tone golden-red brown hair (about shoulder length) as it is, but have always wanted to be ginger - this being the lightest red NI offers, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Application was easy as pie, as usual, and I left it on a little longer than recommended because I have so much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair dried, the color was a beautiful dark red with ginger undertones - not a completely natural look, but I&#x27;m sure that it will fade into one. It&#x27;s not too much different from my normal shade, actually. However, I was hoping for a much more orange-y color (as I&#x27;m trying to get my hair to be almost a coppery color). Hopefully it will fade into one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice color and I love the brand, but it&#x27;s not as bright as it is on the box.</li>
            <li> Good coverage! Happy with product and color!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and get great comments on her hair color!</li>
            <li> SUCKS!! I&#x27;ll never buy it again. I literally have about 10 grays on my head and it didn&#x27;t even cover those. Horrible, wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve happily used semi-permanent hair colors from L&#x27;Oreal and Clairol for years and have seen them go through various iterations, so I didn&#x27;t think twice when the Clairol Natural Instincts boxes started to look a bit different.  I *did* notice the new color refresher and some slight changes in the instructions.  The biggest difference?  My hair is a mess after using Natural Insticts!!  I actually used the reformulation twice and tried two different colors.  Both times, the color barely touched my moderate gray and left my hair coarse, frizzy, and brittle.  Previous versions of Natural Instincts have easily covered the gray and left my hair soft, silky and shiny.  The first time I used the reformulated version, I tried the refresher, which left a brassy orange cast to my hair.  I skipped the refresher the second time and will be skipping Natural Instincts completely from now on.  It&#x27;s THAT bad!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color every month for over 6 months now. I use it on damp or dry hair, depending on my mood. I get the same results either way. My hair is naturally medium brown with natural red highlights that can only be seen in the sun really. I have not tried the old box with this color. I love the new box though. My hair is red. Not orange or coppery. And if I ever tried blonde in my hair, it would get that orange coppery look. This color is just red. And not a fake red either. I have to admit...I never get compliments on my hair. It&#x27;s long and has a natural curl/wave to it. After using this color, I get compliments all of the time. I haven&#x27;t used any permanent red hair dyes because I have heard red fades. When you use permanent, you only want to use it every other month so as not to damage your hair. Well, it would really be faded then. So I like that I can color it every month to refresh it. I do use the refresher that comes with it. I have not had problems with it. It makes it so the red is more vibrant. I think I could use more, I really only use it on my roots and top area. The ends don&#x27;t get a lot of coverage because you only get so much. Now I have no idea if the color refresher works well with other colors because when I used other colors (the brown reds mostly), they were in the old box.</li>
            <li> I have been using Natural Instincts for years and was upset when they took this color off the shelves. Was glad that I was able to get it one more time. Haven&#x27;t decided what to do in the future but have seen some of the reds come back so will likely experiment.</li>
            <li> I loved the color and it left my hair in about the same condition as other hair dyes. It did wash out really soon after using it and I have this problem with all the hair coloring products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of my type of hair or the products are made that way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 20 years or so..........makes my hair soft &amp; shiny. I picked a color close to my natural color and it has worked for me, only have to use it every two or three months!</li>
            <li> I have used Natural Instincts for over 20 years.  I was born a natural redhead, but as you get older the pretty red color fades, so I started \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; it up, and Natural Instincts was always the perfect product.  Until now!  I never wanted to put anything permanent on it, and like the fact that it \\&quot;fades\\&quot; out.  Well, my favorite color of Golden Sienna got discontinued.  It was perfect for me.  There was another favorite before that one that got discontinued called Sedona Sunrise or Sunset, I think.  Anyway, now the only auburn I could find was medium auburn.  I tried it once several months ago, and it was surprisingly okay.  A little darker than I wanted.  So I tried the creme formula today, and I look like fricking Bozo the Clown!!  I&#x27;m so disappointed Clairol!  Why are you changing something that was already great to this horrible product!  I have washed my hair three times in an hour trying to tone it down.  I am going on at trip tomorrow, and I&#x27;m horrified!  I just keep walking around saying, OMG!!  Change is NOT always good!!  OMG!!!</li>
            <li> Sucks... Did not cover one of my grey hairs!!!grrr frustrating</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a replacement for the color that was now no longer available...hope this will work out as well as the older color.</li>
            <li> Great Red - Doesn&#x27;t Damage Hair Like Permanant Color.  I&#x27;m have nightmare&#x27;s about them discontinuing this product.  Best red and lasts as long as permanent.  I can color every three to four weeks without damage.</li>
            <li> This is the brand and color I&#x27;ve used for many years.  While it is red, it is prone to fading quickly.  But paired with John Freida&#x27;s shampoo for red&#x27;s, it lasts longer.  It&#x27;s easy to use, covers my gray for about 3 weeks.  I recolor after 4-5 weeks.  It does leave a bit of smell after coloring, and as I am very sensitive to smells, I wrap my hair with a bandana before I go to bed the first couple nights after coloring.  Yeah, not a great look, but it&#x27;s better to breathe than look awesome while I&#x27;m getting shut eye.  And the husband has never complained.  I&#x27;m naturally a lovely dishwater brown, bleh, this hair color is essential to my sanity and I get many, many compliments on the color.  I have to convince people that I&#x27;m not really a redhead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead but as I&#x27;ve aged, the color has faded to a light brown with grey streaks. The Spiced Tea is the best semi-permanent hair color I&#x27;ve ever used. It looks great freshly colored and it fades away gradually enough to look natural. I have dry hair and it&#x27;s the only dye that actually leaves my hair feeling soft. I&#x27;ve never written an online review before and it isn&#x27;t in the spirit of altruism. I don&#x27;t want this one to go off the market or be \\&quot;improved\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> First time coloring my own hair. Lets just say that while my hair is a very dark brown, I should have considered that greys are white and therefore would require a different color than the rest of it. I had flourescent orange roots, then an awful hued pink, and finally a nicely faded strawberry blonde halo around my temples and forehead. My husband got a lot of laughter out of this. None of it is the products fault, all my own, but I wanted those who are as inexperienced as I to consider the woes of coloring roots before purchasing :)</li>
            <li> I was worried that Spiced Tea would be too intense or too maroon, but I love the results. I have light ash brown hair with blond highlights, and I left this product on for ten minutes, which is the minimum recommended time. It came out a beautiful, rich auburn with coppery highlights, and several people have told me it looks very natural. I will definitely be using it again!</li>
            <li> I used Medium Brown. It did an OK job of covering. A few weeks later I used the booster packet they give you. It turned my roots AND MY SCALP red. Didn&#x27;t look very good at all. I might use this again in a pinch, but I definitely won&#x27;t use the booster packet ever again.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product.  I have been using this color light auburn, #16 for over 8 years, mixing it sometimes with the 15rg light golden red.  They stopped making the the light golden red, and now they have changed the formula, packaging, conditioner etc., on with this color. It sucks. It dries out my hair and makes it orange-y after several washes.  If you have gray hair at all, you have to leave it on longer...well, if you leave it on long enough to cover your grays, it will look very fake and dark(think gothic). I have contacted the company asking why they discontinued the light golden red and they say it&#x27;s lack of demand. Really?  Every time I would go to Target or a beauty supply, they would be out of it, it seemed to be on order all the time. Maybe people were doing what I did, and buying as many boxes as I could because they wouldn&#x27;t stock it enough!  Anyway, this IS NOT the same product as before. It smells way more chemical, and the color feels different...the conditioner is weak and even the gloves they include have gone to crap. It&#x27;s a prime example of another company trying to save money by cheapening the product, and then they call it \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot;. This used to make my hair soft and shiny, now it makes it dull and dry.  I cancelled my subscription and will not be purchasing this product again. This is what big corporations like P&amp;L do.  They purchase reputable companies and then re-formulate (cheapen)the product,so their profit margins go up. Remember how good Iams and Infusium used to be? Check the back of the packaging and see who owns it now...buyer beware, it&#x27;s bait and switch! Good luck to you in finding a new hair color...</li>
            <li> Great product, nice coverage and good shine.&lt;br /&gt;BAD NEWS: THEY DISCONTINUED THIS COLOR WITH NO REPLACEMENT EXCEPT A TOO TOO DARK AUBURN :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOO TOO BAD....NO MORE :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, GOODBYE NATURAL INSTINCTS</li>
            <li> It says natural, but it is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;After I use this product, I had terrible itch scalp a week. I never had problem any popular bland name hair color.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> THIS DOES NOT WASH OUT IN 28 SHAMPOOS! IT HAS BEEN 6 WEEKS AND THE COLOR IS STILL CLINGING! THIS FEELS LIKE A SEMI PERMANENT BUT STAYS LIKE A PERMANENT! THAT IS GOOD FOR THOSE THAT LIKE THE COLOR BUT SOMEONE WHO DOESN&#x27;T IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST!</li>
            <li> I wish the retail stores still carried this.  I really miss it and was glad to find some before I have to change to another product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times.  Both the old version and the new version.  Both work equally well.  I have never had burnt crunchy orange hair, not even once.  I agree that the longer you leave it on the better the gray coverage.  I have not tried the refresher packet.  Just didn&#x27;t see a need to, but I might try it this time.  It fades out naturally as you wash your hair.  No strange color roots.  My hair is very soft and shiny.  I think it is a very natural looking color.  I hadn&#x27;t colored in 7 months (or longer).  Thought I would just let it go.  But I did have one box of color in the cupboard and last Saturday I decided to use it up.  I am not totally gray, but I have quite a bit of gray mixed in, especially at my temples and on top.  My husband was down in the shop.  I colored, rinsed and dried before he came in the house.  Later on that day he said \\&quot;you look different\\&quot; but he couldn&#x27;t quite pin it down.  That, I think, is the true measure of a good color job.  You look better, but so natural nobody is saying \\&quot;oh, you died your hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This color is awesome. I always get compliments from men and women and asked if this is natural&lt;br /&gt; It is semipermanent and fades very nicely. I color about every 5 weeks. It is difficult to find it consistently in stores so I love auto ship.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to ruin your hair.  Forget it!</li>
            <li> Nice medium auburn color.  Very slight pink hue the first couple of washing, settled into a great color.  Product lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I bought this color specifically to color my roots and match them to the rest of my hair, which is a light auburn color (similar to the one this product promises). My current color is also non permanent and I have a few highlights, which, of course, are permanent. Also, I am fairly experienced when it comes to coloring my hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I did my roots first as it would take longer for the uncolored hair to take the new color, then went on to do the rest of my hair. The color started to get darker and was even while processing which left me hopeful that this would work. After washing my hair, however, it turned out that my roots did NOT take the color AT ALL. The rest of my hair shows minimal to no difference in color either. I think my highlights are the only parts of my hair which actually took any color so I&#x27;m going to assume that this product only works on already processed hair which kind of defeats the purpose of trying to use a product that is more gentle on one&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked about this product was the conditioner which actually did make my hair smooth. Overall, I&#x27;m really disappointed and annoyed that I wasted money on this product.</li>
            <li> Review for Clairol Natural Instincts Spiced Tea 16.  Have used this brand and color for about six years with no problems.  I know some people have had a problem with the new formula, but it has worked the same for me.  Also, I like the color refresher pack.  Some reviews mention the color refresher pack turned their hair red, but for me that&#x27;s fine because that&#x27;s the color I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is with Amazon&#x27;s fulfillment.  The last two boxes I received did not include the refresher pack which is shown in the pictures and mentioned in the description.  I believe the boxes I received were an older version.  I complained to Amazon about my most recent purchase and they did refund my money.  However, I will no longer purchase this product from Amazon since they are not sending the most recent version of this hair color.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this as Spiced Tea, a light auburn color, indicating the package may be different so I ordered thinking I was getting Spiced Tea which was my favorite color years ago when I used it.  Be aware that the package they show in the listing is the exact same one you will get.  Clairol has changed the color and the box says &amp;#34;former 16 Light Auburn&amp;#34; but this is a deep brown with only a slight red highlight to it and is for medium and dark brown hair instead of dark blonde and light brown.  If you are expecting the light auburn that Spiced Tea always was, you will not get it with this version.  Shame on Clairol for not naming this totally different color a different name!</li>
            <li> Wish I could still find my old Natural Instincts color....more Auburn than RED or BROWN</li>
            <li> This color is just what I had been looking for.  I am a natural redhead and this covers my white hairs and blends perfectly with my natural color.</li>
            <li> The color itself (I used Medium Brown) is okay. Kind of a generic orangish brown. It washes away pretty quickly, after about two shampoos. The problem is the \\&quot;refresher\\&quot; color. Which is the consistency of fudge and will stain light-colored towels, pillow cases, etc. I must have shampooed my hair TWICE after using it, and it was still leaving an orange residue! Yikes!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend who has been using this color for quite a while &amp; loves it,  but she was buying one box at a time at stores at a way too high price.  She&#x27;s been using Natural Instincts exclusively for over 15 years (she&#x27;s now in her late 50&#x27;s), beginning with a close match to her natural color (med brown) &amp; then changing to a brown with red in it, then to this colir, Spiced Tea.  Since she has very dry hair, she washes it every 3 days, so her grays grow out before the color should begin to fade.  This keeps her hair healthy looking &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry it out like a permanent hair color could.</li>
            <li> I can only find this color through Amazon and I love it since I can&#x27;t put permanent color in my hair! The color leaked all over in the box it came in, it was a mess!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand with various red colors for years and it&#x27;s always been the one I could use and fool people that I&#x27;m a natural red and cover all my stray greys as well.  Also, a first-time dyer should have no problems...very easy to use.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed in Clairol with Natural Instincts.  I usually use Nice and Easy, but loved this shade option.  Total waste of money if you actually want it to cover any gray!  Instructions call to leave on 15 minutes for gray coverage, which I did.  Totally shocked to have the same gray roots I started with!  Box indicates it covers gray, but it is a waste of money to buy this one if you really want it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this color 3 times in the past.  My hair was a dark blonde/light brown before using it.  Comes out way redder than the swatch on the box.  This is a good thing for me because I was aiming for red.  The first week or so it&#x27;s a bit freaky, mildly punkish dark red.  Then it becomes more natural but still has that sort of fake red (not copper/orange) tint that many red dyes have.  Personally, I prefer a more naturally looking light copper red.  I did get a couple compliments on the color from strangers walking around town.  One lady really wanted to know what dye I had used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts about 6-8 weeks.  Actually the permanent red dyes last the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> Great product! Really love the fact that I never have to worry about roots showing. As the product gradually washes out, the color remains consistent throughout, looking completely natural at all times.</li>
