            <li>Love, love, love!  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair every 3 days so a bottle lasts 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>I love this product and after switching around for years</li>
            <li>I finally found the one I like best.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is magic.  </li>
            <li>We find it has plenty of froth and has a lovely scent as well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and will continue purchase and use.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I have used both of these products for about 4 years and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Again, I love these hair products.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many top brands like Pureology, Kerastase, Living Proof, etc.  </li>
            <li>Probably ok for oily hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it......</li>
            <li>For my friends, my friends say ok.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite shampoo....</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it for years along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Then after about two weeks the effect wore off to just an okay shampoo.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to get around not washing every day if you use this, but it&#x27;s moisturizing and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy-</li>
            <li>This was a nice shampoo, clean smelling and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are not that great and have since gone to using all natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today, and can only say that it is absolutely great!  </li>
            <li>Fine shampoo</li>
            <li>delivery was super efficient and packaging was cute.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>And, although it costs more, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>your hair feel silky and smooth</li>
            <li>Skip this, get a cheap sulfate free shampoo, and splurge on conditioner.</li>
            <li>I still love the smell and how it makes my hair feel right after washing.</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after a couple of washings.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does not feel like it gets your clean to me.</li>
            <li>It still comes out thick and wonderful!</li>
            <li>I really wish the price can be adorable too.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner yet-</li>
            <li>Brings back great shine and soft texture.  </li>
            <li>far i love this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and silky and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>For me, it is was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner because it does not strip the color out of my hair and leaves my hair soft and shiney even with continuous use of color products.</li>
            <li>After shampooing in the evening, my hair is a kind of oily by the next morning - and my scalp/hair is not even oily to begin with.</li>
            <li>think the product is excellent - 5 stars; however it is quite expensive, thus 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I tried this product in a salon first then i purchased it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos, all of which caused my scalp to break out sooner or later.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve tried many different ones.</li>
            <li>At first my hair was silky soft smooth.</li>
            <li>But the product made my hair feel more coarse then before.</li>
            <li>I originally found this shampoo at the salon that I go to but was able to locate it on Amazon for less money.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out so soft, manageable and clean.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s dry on the ends but gets greasy on top.</li>
            <li>It has made our hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nourishing and leaves hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li>what has changed: When I first tried this shampoo, I found it gentle to my hair and amazing smelling and definitely moisturizing for my dry ends.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps my fine, dry, colored, curly/wavy hair like nothing else.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased and reviewed the Alterna Anti-Aging Sea Silk Oil Gel, which I love.  </li>
            <li>If I blow it dry, I can make it have smooth curl as well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo dried it out even more.</li>
            <li>Straight from the bottle the fragrance is a little strong, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair smell perfumey after drying.</li>
            <li>This is an anti aging shampoo and it&#x27;s supposed to make your hair feel young and silky-it does!  </li>
            <li>There was always a feeling after using other shampoos that my hair wasn&#x27;t totally clean.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive and have negative reactions to most products.</li>
            <li>A little expensive, but great shampoo!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp to dry out like so many other products on the market.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Replenishing Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner, too, make my hair feel soft and sleek, but still with plenty of body, thickness, and curl.  </li>
            <li>The product last for ever, you do not need much of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel alive again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying a new brand next.</li>
            <li>I have highlighted hair and this along with the conditioner is the only thing I have found that makes it soft and manageable on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>In fact, I keep and old bottle and refill it half way with new then add water.</li>

            <li> In fact, I keep and old bottle and refill it half way with new then add water.</li>
            <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner is the only product that has reversed hair damage caused by flat iron use.</li>
            <li> I tried using it several times a few weeks apart, but each time it left my hair stripped of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> It did not last long</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of use, it actually started to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> ( My hair is usually dry )&lt;</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair, so my hair is already dry.</li>
            <li> I also have eczema &amp; found that this product didn&#x27;t irritate my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> Have checked back and there seems to be some fluctuation in price, but with a little persistence and patience, you can pick this up for a steal.</li>
            <li> The product was not what I expected and a bit pricy...</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey, but I only shampoo every other day</li>
            <li> For the past 4 years I used the same hair products, until something changed in their formula.</li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product; however, I have tried other products which do work...</li>
            <li> Prior to discovering this we were experiencing dry, dull, limp and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> However, I am sad to say my hair no longer loves this shampoo as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> I have thick, slightly coarse hair with lots of body and curl.  </li>
            <li> I used the product continuously for the bast year and a half.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but a little goes a long way &amp; I only use this 2x a week.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick &amp; somewhat coarse.</li>
            <li> The absence of a bunch of unnecessary chemicals seals the deal.  </li>
            <li> The price is not so bad when you realize you don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now and will NEVER change!</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes thin hair very dry, dull and difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> If your hair is thin, I would recommend mixing this with a cheaper volumizing shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff really helps my fine, dry, colored, curly/wavy hair like nothing else. The price is not so bad when you realize you don&#x27;t use that much. In fact, I keep and old bottle and refill it half way with new then add water. It still comes out thick and wonderful! I wash my hair every 3 days so a bottle lasts 6 months or more. I have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> This is an anti aging shampoo and it&#x27;s supposed to make your hair feel young and silky-it does!  I have used Wella Balsam since I started using Alterna Caviar Anti Aging, and it does not work as well as Alterna.  Bear in mind that not every shampoo works for everyone.  I mix conditioners to get that silky feeling using Alterna, Root awakening, and Wella Balsam.  But if I don&#x27;t used Alterna then the conditioners don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Good product but pricey for the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I&#x27;ve every used</li>
            <li> I have  curly hair which I highlight so it&#x27;s dry on the ends but gets greasy on top. I love this product and after switching around for years I finally found the one I like best.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; hair wonderfully well.  Brings back great shine and soft texture.  I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now and will NEVER change!</li>
            <li> I did not like how oily it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo.  He gave me several samples.  I liked it so much I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is magic.  The females in our home have been using it now for over a year and I can&#x27;t see us switching.  It has made our hair super shiny and soft. Prior to discovering this we were experiencing dry, dull, limp and damaged hair. The absence of a bunch of unnecessary chemicals seals the deal.  We find it has plenty of froth and has a lovely scent as well.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased and reviewed the Alterna Anti-Aging Sea Silk Oil Gel, which I love.  Wanted to try their shampoo as well.  Used it for the first time today, and can only say that it is absolutely great!  My hair came out so soft, manageable and clean.  Followed with the oil gel and my hair looks great!  There was always a feeling after using other shampoos that my hair wasn&#x27;t totally clean.  This product solved that problem.  Absolutely love it and will continue purchase and use.</li>
            <li> Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Shampoo &amp; Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is excellent - 5 stars; however it is quite expensive, thus 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic shampoo!  It leaves my hair silky and shiny.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp to dry out like so many other products on the market.  I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!! It&#x27;s so nourishing and leaves hair super soft and shiny. Sodium chloride and sulfate free!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and found it on Amazon for a killer price! Have checked back and there seems to be some fluctuation in price, but with a little persistence and patience, you can pick this up for a steal. Lovely smell and makes hair look great.</li>
            <li> I have used both of these products for about 4 years and absolutely love them.  Definitely would recommend this product.line.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shampoo on the advice of hair stylist.It smells great and my hair seems to approve.Reason for 4,the price.</li>
            <li> For the past 4 years I used the same hair products, until something changed in their formula. I have only used this for a short time but I love it. I am very sensitive and have negative reactions to most products. Again, I love these hair products.</li>
            <li> I tried this product in a salon first then i purchased it. It makes my hair looking healthy. ( My hair is usually dry )&lt;br /&gt;So far i love this product. I really wish the price can be adorable too.</li>
            <li> Fine shampoo but I didn&#x27;t feel like it performed above any mass shampoo. After a couple weeks of use, it actually started to dry out my hair. I&#x27;m trying a new brand next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many top brands like Pureology, Kerastase, Living Proof, etc.  Always come back to my Alterna Caviar, and I can always tell a difference!  Plus a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair, so my hair is already dry. This shampoo dried it out even more. I tried using it several times a few weeks apart, but each time it left my hair stripped of its natural oils. Probably ok for oily hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.  Leaves my hair soft and silky and healthy looking.  I get so many compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it......and I&#x27;m 56,  it is a little pricey, but I only shampoo every other day and  you don&#x27;t use as much as regular shampoo.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is excellent shampoo for my type of hair.  I have thick, slightly coarse hair with lots of body and curl.  The Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Replenishing Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner, too, make my hair feel soft and sleek, but still with plenty of body, thickness, and curl.  If I blow it dry, I can make it have smooth curl as well.  This is a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoos, all of which caused my scalp to break out sooner or later.  This shampoo is different.  And, although it costs more, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and it leaves your hair feeling great.  I do use the Caviar conditioner along with it !!!!!</li>
            <li> For my friends, my friends say ok.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, smells good and works great on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair feel silky and smooth</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite shampoo....It leaves my hair shiny and silky  and I hope they make it forever!</li>
            <li> This was a nice shampoo, clean smelling and moisturizing. It did not last long so I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product made my tangled and felt like it had a residue on it.  My hair never gets tangled.  I would not use this product again... I will stick with Wen.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick &amp; somewhat coarse. This shampoo &amp; conditioner is the only product that has reversed hair damage caused by flat iron use. It is expensive, but a little goes a long way &amp; I only use this 2x a week. My absolute favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner yet- &amp; I&#x27;ve tried many different ones. If your hair is thin, I would recommend mixing this with a cheaper volumizing shampoo/conditioner. Straight from the bottle the fragrance is a little strong, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair smell perfumey after drying. I also have eczema &amp; found that this product didn&#x27;t irritate my already dry skin. For me, it is was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes thin hair very dry, dull and difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for years along with the conditioner. The product last for ever, you do not need much of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a shampoo. I don&#x27;t care what they put in it. Skip this, get a cheap sulfate free shampoo, and splurge on conditioner. Your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair act!</li>
            <li> At first my hair was silky soft smooth. Then after about two weeks the effect wore off to just an okay shampoo. The ingredients are not that great and have since gone to using all natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> I originally found this shampoo at the salon that I go to but was able to locate it on Amazon for less money.  I love the conditioner because it does not strip the color out of my hair and leaves my hair soft and shiney even with continuous use of color products. I used the product continuously for the bast year and a half.</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after a couple of washings. The shampoo does not feel like it gets your clean to me.</li>
            <li> Alterna Caviar Shampoo used to be my holy grail shampoo. Let me tell you why that was and what has changed: When I first tried this shampoo, I found it gentle to my hair and amazing smelling and definitely moisturizing for my dry ends. So once I was done with my 3rd bottle, I did not hesitate to immediately order my 4th bottle. However, I am sad to say my hair no longer loves this shampoo as much as it used to. Alterna changed the packaging (it used to be a curvier bottle with a silver cap), and I feel like the effect it has on my hair has changed as well. After shampooing in the evening, my hair is a kind of oily by the next morning - and my scalp/hair is not even oily to begin with. I still love the smell and how it makes my hair feel right after washing. Shame about the next day oiliness - it is the only reason why I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but great shampoo!</li>
            <li> The product was not what I expected and a bit pricy... I would not recommend this product; however, I have tried other products which do work... (with this brand)</li>
            <li> delivery was super efficient and packaging was cute. But the product made my hair feel more coarse then before. Don&#x27;t know what to do with the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> best shampoo and conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Very, very nice. There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to get around not washing every day if you use this, but it&#x27;s moisturizing and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy- which has been chemically straightened and is regularly colored, so that&#x27;s quite an accomplishment.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!  This is my favorite shampoo!  I have highlighted hair and this along with the conditioner is the only thing I have found that makes it soft and manageable on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. It makes my hair feel alive again.</li>
