            <li>I was VERY pleasantly</li>
            <li>I was happy to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>formula is great, healthy for your lashes and makes them grow.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job of separating my lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li>No need to spend more than $8 on a mascara anymore!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as amazing as people make it to be in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice product..</li>
            <li>Nice brush though.</li>
            <li>I will sterilize the container and make my own.</li>
            <li>It came off nicely with remover.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This is a nice mascara that I discovered 5 years ago in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>However, my joy quickly faded when I used the mascara.  </li>
            <li>makes your lashes look amazing :)</li>
            <li>Honestly this mascara is just okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about what products I buy &amp; this is a perfect example of something that just doesn&#x27;t live up to the great reviews.</li>
            <li>, this one sounded to good to be true, and you know what they say, but I took the plunge and ordered.</li>
            <li>This mascar goes on easily and looks nice on.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I pictured and more!!</li>
            <li>suprised!!!It is all it says and more.</li>
            <li>Love it, also helped my eyelashes grow when some fell out.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m SO glad I stumbled upon it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Seven oils\\&quot; is more a fanciful name than a product description.</li>
            <li>Overall best mascara ever, i recommend  it for all eyelash types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wish it would give it more volume.</li>
            <li>It works better when you curl your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>makes my lash more longer.</li>
            <li>I love the brush but</li>
            <li>I really love using this mascara, been using it since I started wearing makeup..</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with results despite off-putting odor.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE everything about it, lashes look long and adds perfect volume!!!</li>
            <li>Th&#x27; good thing was that the delivery was VERY fast.</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes look long plus the olive oil is awesome for conditioning.</li>
            <li>Shipping and packaging was fine aswell:)</li>
            <li>My lash are more long and I&#x27;m more happy</li>
            <li>For every day wear, one coat is fine, for going out at night, I will use three to four coats and at the risk of repeating myself, NO clumps in sight, no brittleness, and no spider looking lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara gives length, heaps of volume and a really bold and wispie effect, whenever i have it on people ask if i got falsies on!</li>
            <li>I was excited to see the very full mascara brush.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really volumize on its own</li>
            <li>It does add length but nothing to get excited about</li>
            <li>It works great however, the mascara itself was dry.</li>
            <li>You will most likely need to follow this 2 mascara routine to get the best possible look, but this regimen has given me better results than ANY high end mascara out there, including Diorshow, and it&#x27;s one of the cheapest mascaras on the market</li>
            <li>This product was not as great as I expected it to, for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I can even get two days&#x27; wear out of it if I&#x27;m careful, which is great for when I&#x27;m camping.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain about having to add another layer to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>- again, a lot like the old fashioned kind of mascara.</li>
            <li>very nature look, love it</li>
            <li>because it &amp;#34;builds up&amp;#34; the lashes quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the product its highly recommmended.</li>
            <li>It is as good as other mascaras</li>
            <li>Finally, after trying several brands that were supposedly the best (but they weren&#x27;t), the light bulb went off, and I remembered Christian.  </li>
            <li>If there would be one drawback the brush is a little short and fat for my taste, but it&#x27;s worth it, and makes my lashes look wonderful!</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s ok waterproof mascara but definitely not 5 stars</li>
            <li>Try not to blink until this dries or it will smear, but once on, it lasts pretty well</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind another version with a smaller wand for more precision (like DHC&#x27;s mascara).  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s OK for what it cost.</li>
            <li>and did I mention it&#x27;s waterproof WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>bought this mascara based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>inky black color is nicely saturated.</li>
            <li>you just need color, this is a nice black bargain option.</li>
            <li>This is a very buildable product.</li>
            <li>You will not get much from one layer.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really either.</li>
            <li>The container was not sealed and the mascara itself was very oily.</li>
            <li>This mascara really makes my eyelashes look longer.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the brush.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well for that.  </li>
            <li>like I said I really like this mascara and do recommend this..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, not even when I add the second layer of mascara, and it&#x27;s super long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Make eyelashes look super long but can get clumpy if you put too much on.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the various oil formulations this line offers and don&#x27;t notice a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>Makes the eye lashes look full and long, and it stays on all day</li>
            <li>Would definatly buy again if the mascara was new and normal consistancy.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say fast long lashes cause the mascara brush is wide and huge!</li>
            <li>Brush was fat and short and it&#x27;s pretty easy to make a mess all around your eye.</li>
            <li>I have tried expensive department store mascaras, but this one works best for my active lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>Makes lashes that have been curled with a eyelash curler, stayed curled, all day, keeps lashes soft feeling and looking natural, no clumps in sight, and no dull chalky color.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old bottle or if its always like that.</li>
            <li>I bought this because itcame up when i searched for natural and waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>I have straight Asian lashes and this holds a curl like no other.  </li>
            <li>It also holds a curl which I took for granted until I tried some of the higher end brands that definitely did not do the same.</li>
            <li>is leave it under hot water for a few seconds and its ready..</li>
            <li>the ONLY mascara that I will use because it&#x27;s the only one that keeps my straight lashes staying curled</li>
            <li>It curls and lengthens like no other.</li>
            <li>Afterward I went back to my old clumpy (and more expensive) brand.  </li>
            <li>However, overall this mascara doesn&#x27;t budge, smudge and keeps my lashes soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>But that may be the nature of the beast when it comes to waterproof formulas because that has happened to me with other brands (from high to low end too).  </li>

            <li> It last long.</li>
            <li> Lash length and curl stays all day long into the night.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look very long</li>
            <li> It seems a bit dry and oily</li>
            <li> It appears that the tube is dry.</li>
            <li> I have gotta a dry mascara</li>
            <li> The smell is not noticeable once dry, but it does make me wonder...</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s because it was old or if it always smells that way</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lengthen at all but may volumize a little if you put on several coats.</li>
            <li> but if I still don&#x27;t like it after 3 tries, it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the fat brush, but it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and all the other mascaras I have used always tend to smear,  this one however does not!</li>
            <li> I ordered the seven oils black, and am wondering what the other oils will be like.  </li>
            <li> so I use it as a base mascara and then use a drug store brand volumizing mascara on top to finish it off.  </li>
            <li> Con: little flakes would form allover my lashes and bits would get into my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The tube may have dried out a bit when I rec&#x27;d it.  </li>
            <li> it?)has been increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> and then comes along the one person with a complaint, and that does it</li>
            <li> Not sure if mine is a dud or outdated.</li>
            <li> down side is that the product has a weird, sort of toxic smell like motor oil or grease.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> but ill</li>
            <li> But product itself was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> , I have been quite disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tend to agonize over purchases, reading and re-reading every review written. All will be well and I will almost be convinced....and then comes along the one person with a complaint, and that does it, this one sounded to good to be true, and you know what they say, but I took the plunge and ordered. I was VERY pleasantly suprised!!!It is all it says and more. I am passed middle aged and finding make up that looks natural and helps any flaws (why else do we wear it?)has been increasingly hard to find. Not so with this mascara, here is what it does. Makes lashes that have been curled with a eyelash curler, stayed curled, all day, keeps lashes soft feeling and looking natural, no clumps in sight, and no dull chalky color. it is wonderful. For every day wear, one coat is fine, for going out at night, I will use three to four coats and at the risk of repeating myself, NO clumps in sight, no brittleness, and no spider looking lashes.If there would be one drawback the brush is a little short and fat for my taste, but it&#x27;s worth it, and makes my lashes look wonderful! Don&#x27;t hesitate a moment longer order this product!!! OH and did I mention it&#x27;s waterproof WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to see the very full mascara brush. It works great however, the mascara itself was dry. So I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old bottle or if its always like that. Would definatly buy again if the mascara was new and normal consistancy.</li>
            <li> Stays on and doesn&#x27;t clump up. Makes your lashes look long plus the olive oil is awesome for conditioning. I will always buy it</li>
            <li> This is a very buildable product. You will not get much from one layer. It seems a bit dry and oily but I think it helps so that you don&#x27;t get gigantic globs and can actually layer it to you liking. It does add length but nothing to get excited about and it&#x27;s definitely an all day Mascara. Doesn&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t run which is a plus for me!</li>
            <li> Make eyelashes look super long but can get clumpy if you put too much on.</li>
            <li> Nice product.. It last long.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Brush is way too big&lt;br /&gt;2. Smelled different...not sure if it&#x27;s because it was old or if it always smells that way&lt;br /&gt;3. Clumped&lt;br /&gt;4. Seemed a bit too dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mascara based on all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ll give it another shot or two but if I still don&#x27;t like it after 3 tries, it&#x27;s going in the trash. I&#x27;m really picky about what products I buy &amp; this is a perfect example of something that just doesn&#x27;t live up to the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this because itcame up when i searched for natural and waterproof mascara. It isn&#x27;t really either. It actually contained petrolates and ran all under my eyes. Nice brush though. I will sterilize the container and make my own.</li>
            <li> Love it, also helped my eyelashes grow when some fell out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! It curls and lengthens like no other. It doesn&#x27;t really volumize on its own so I use it as a base mascara and then use a drug store brand volumizing mascara on top to finish it off.  You will most likely need to follow this 2 mascara routine to get the best possible look, but this regimen has given me better results than ANY high end mascara out there, including Diorshow, and it&#x27;s one of the cheapest mascaras on the market so I can&#x27;t complain about having to add another layer to get the full effect. It doesn&#x27;t clump, not even when I add the second layer of mascara, and it&#x27;s super long-lasting. Lash length and curl stays all day long into the night. This is definitely one of my go-to makeup items so I&#x27;m SO glad I stumbled upon it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Th&#x27; good thing was that the delivery was VERY fast. But product itself was quite disappointing. Brush was fat and short and it&#x27;s pretty easy to make a mess all around your eye. Yes, it does make lashes longer but you have to put 2-3 layers for it. Also, it  doesn&#x27;t make lashes curly. So, it&#x27;s ok waterproof mascara but definitely not 5 stars</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Seven oils\\&quot; is more a fanciful name than a product description. This is your grandmother&#x27;s mascara - petrolatum, beeswax, and parabens. At the bottom, it does say the mascara MAY contain several kinds of oil plus iron oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inky black color is nicely saturated. Try not to blink until this dries or it will smear, but once on, it lasts pretty well - again, a lot like the old fashioned kind of mascara. It doesn&#x27;t lengthen at all but may volumize a little if you put on several coats. Despite the waxy formula, it didn&#x27;t make my lashes stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just need color, this is a nice black bargain option. If you need something that will enhance or treat your lashes, I&#x27;d say spend the extra money and try elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever! Shipping and packaging was fine aswell:) This mascara gives length, heaps of volume and a really bold and wispie effect, whenever i have it on people ask if i got falsies on! Also, you could layer and layer without it looking clumpy. Overall best mascara ever, i recommend  it for all eyelash types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing:P it&#x27;s formula is great, healthy for your lashes and makes them grow.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO! BEST BRUSH EVER!! WORDS CAN&#x27;T EVEN EXPLAIN.. makes your lashes look amazing :)</li>
            <li> The container was not sealed and the mascara itself was very oily. It does not compare the the actual product I buy at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply</li>
            <li> My beautician used this product to do my makeup for my wedding.  That should tell you something.  Afterward I went back to my old clumpy (and more expensive) brand.  Finally, after trying several brands that were supposedly the best (but they weren&#x27;t), the light bulb went off, and I remembered Christian.  This mascara really makes my eyelashes look longer.  It stays on all day, and doesn&#x27;t flake later, plus there is no smearing or smudging.  I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the fat brush, but it works extremely well.  I ordered the seven oils black, and am wondering what the other oils will be like.  However, I think I&#x27;ll stick with what works well.</li>
            <li> Honestly this mascara is just okay. It makes eyelashes look longer yes but I wish it would give it more volume. It works better when you curl your eyelashes. It isn&#x27;t as amazing as people make it to be in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. No need to spend more than $8 on a mascara anymore!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I pictured and more!! It&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be and they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say fast long lashes cause the mascara brush is wide and huge! I&#x27;m very happy with this and I&#x27;ll be buying from this seller again forsure!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Lancome (Defincils and Hypnose), Dior (DiorShow, Etase), Givenchy and always wonder why I strayed and come back to this.  I have straight Asian lashes and this holds a curl like no other.  I have tried all the various oil formulations this line offers and don&#x27;t notice a significant difference.  The wand is very big which can be unweldy for some.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind another version with a smaller wand for more precision (like DHC&#x27;s mascara).  However, overall this mascara doesn&#x27;t budge, smudge and keeps my lashes soft all day long.  It also holds a curl which I took for granted until I tried some of the higher end brands that definitely did not do the same.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the brush.  It doesn&#x27;t do a good job of separating my lashes. Overall it&#x27;s OK for what it cost.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and all the other mascaras I have used always tend to smear,  this one however does not! This mascara makes my lashes look very long and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This product was not as great as I expected it to, for the price I paid. However I did receive my product on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This is the best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve ever had. Makes the eye lashes look full and long, and it stays on all day</li>
            <li> This mascar goes on easily and looks nice on.  It last for a while - but I do not re&#x3D;apply makeup.  I put it on in the evening - and removed it later.  It came off nicely with remover.  I like it  I did not find it to be clumpy to put on - which is a plus.</li>
            <li> the ONLY mascara that I will use because it&#x27;s the only one that keeps my straight lashes staying curled</li>
            <li> I use it to layer my mascara and it works really well for that.  I have not tried it on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive department store mascaras, but this one works best for my active lifestyle.  I can even get two days&#x27; wear out of it if I&#x27;m careful, which is great for when I&#x27;m camping.</li>
            <li> My lash are more long and I&#x27;m more happy I never so a eye lash like this excellent product I recommend my friends.</li>
            <li> I love the product its highly recommmended. makes my lash more longer. I&#x27;ve been using this product for last 12 months.</li>
            <li> It appears that the tube is dry. Each time I dip the brush and attempt to apply, no mascara goes on the lashes, I have been quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara that I discovered 5 years ago in Hawaii.  I was happy to have found it on Amazon.  However, my joy quickly faded when I used the mascara.  Pros: It is long-wearing, waterproof and will lengthen your lashes and your lashes will get conditioned.  Con: little flakes would form allover my lashes and bits would get into my eyes.  The tube may have dried out a bit when I rec&#x27;d it.  But that may be the nature of the beast when it comes to waterproof formulas because that has happened to me with other brands (from high to low end too).  If you have short to medium lashes, you will like this mascara because it &amp;#34;builds up&amp;#34; the lashes quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the brush but the liquid in there doesn&#x27;t work too well for me, I feel like it&#x27;s just water...what I did was use the brush for another one of my mascaras! 😉</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this mascara.  Use to buy it from a different source.  I think I found this as an add-on, so it was inexpensive, which is why I bought it here.  It is as good as other mascaras, I have just happened to always be found of this one.</li>
            <li> very nature look, love it</li>
            <li> I really love using this mascara, been using it since I started wearing makeup..its the only mascara that holds my eyelash curl and gives them length..I have gotta a dry mascara but ill I do is leave it under hot water for a few seconds and its ready..it works perfect..like I said I really like this mascara and do recommend this..</li>
            <li> Beautiful length and volume and holds my curl all day! Love this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is that the product has a weird, sort of toxic smell like motor oil or grease. Not sure if mine is a dud or outdated. The smell is not noticeable once dry, but it does make me wonder...but It works so well that I&#x27;ll probably continue using it even if it gives me a giant eye tumor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably repurchase and see if they all have this smell. Overall, very happy with results despite off-putting odor.</li>
            <li> BEST mascara ever! Great product! Absolutely LOVE everything about it, lashes look long and adds perfect volume!!!</li>
