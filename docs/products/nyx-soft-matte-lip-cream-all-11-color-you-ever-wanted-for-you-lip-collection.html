            <li>I absolutely love these lip creams.</li>
            <li>I absolutely Love It.....</li>
            <li>Some colors better than others.</li>
            <li>The application is flawlessly smooth and I find that pairing them with a lip liner maximizes their amazing formulation.</li>
            <li>They pair well with a lip gloss layered on top as well which some long-lasting lip products do not, so I find this to be another plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Wish there were more shades.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I ordered it.</li>

            <li>The color looked stunning as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got home, I couldn&#x27;t help but try on more of the colors, and they all went well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I hope they never run out, but I&#x27;ll just have to buy more when they do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these added more colors to my selection</li>
            <li>I found out that most of these colors are nudes and pinks.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>They look better with some shiny gloss over it.</li>
            <li>Lovely shades ..</li>
            <li>There are a couple I don&#x27;t love, but I mix these and I can create colors that I do like.</li>
            <li>My order included many more neutrals and browns rather than the pinks and reds shown in image.</li>
            <li>love how they go on as a liquid yet</li>
            <li>You can add more layers for more color depth.</li>

            <li>I will surely be reordering soon.</li>
            <li>Most dryer, and the quantity</li>
            <li>this soft matte lip cream are amazing, I love all the NYX products !!</li>
            <li>Quality-wise, this is the best lipstick I have tried -- 100% coat of my natural lip color, very smooth, matte, true color-stay.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and easy to apply</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s really how much I was impressed with them.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these lipsticks; however, most of the colors were too light for me.</li>
            <li>Not only I got all 11 colors, they were nicely packed, but also a great deal.</li>
            <li>Shipped right on time, and I am so pleased!</li>
            <li>wife says it is very cool</li>
            <li>were cakey, others you can barely see and others where beautiful.</li>
            <li>It looked great all up until I wiped it completely off with my napkin (a habit I have</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I purchased these from Amazon, but I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>True to color!</li>
            <li>It smelled great, and it felt so smooth and soft going on my lips,</li>
            <li>but it goes on easy and looks well</li>
            <li>get for the price this is better than any lip stick they stay off super</li>
            <li>I love lip cream all color, this is my first time using nyx lip cream.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get these lip creams.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make your lips feel dry and they are greatly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these mainly for the velvety smooth texture and the comfort long-lasting quality.</li>
            <li>The complete collection contains 11 shades of which I own and have reviewed a variety of 4 of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice soft applications.</li>
            <li>Keep lips soft and moist, nice colors.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really understand what they were, but the makeup gurus on youtube loves them including many of the buyers on here</li>
            <li>I really love how nice smelling these lip cream are,, they dry up matt with a bit of velvety finish</li>
            <li>They last all day or almost all day -:), these are the best lip creams I have ever bought, they are not shinny and glossy like other lip liners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a full five stars is because some of the colors are very similar.</li>
            <li>Seriously, these are a great deal!</li>
            <li>Finally found the perfect red lip color for my skin tone (Mac:nc42) which is Amsterdam.</li>
            <li>These came quickly in the mail during holiday season.</li>
            <li>I wish they had more shades of Red in this pack though, too many pinks</li>
            <li>I mainly got nudes!!!</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with that unexpected miracle!</li>
            <li>but these are worth the risk.</li>
            <li>Years worth of color.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I think whether you are a lipstick gal or a gloss lady, you will love NYX soft matte lip</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start by saying that I was surprised that there were so many people with positive feedback about these lipsticks to me</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Product is fine but some seem already used... When you open some of them are completely clean and never opened</li>
            <li>I purchased these expecting more of a matted gloss, but instead they are super creamy, soft, and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I loved these lip creams but some of them looked like they&#x27;ve been used or swatched before with little hairs on the sponge applicator..</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>When I first received these lip cream I was a bit upset because i thought I had ordered the lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>The first day I got them I tested a color before bed.</li>
            <li>, I had never tried them on in person or anything, but they definitely sounded like something I would be pleased</li>
            <li>it simply because of the matte sexy finish it has.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve seen various lip colors advertised as all day wear, wont come off after eating or drinking...</li>
            <li>Love the different shades that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>I most especially like the San Pablo shade.</li>
            <li>I love them but some of them was open</li>
            <li>They came pretty fast and had all the colors i wanted !</li>
            <li>ther is ni red color and many color is the seam ..</li>
            <li>So I just put them to the side and really didn&#x27;t use them because I didn&#x27;t like how it looked when i first put it on.  </li>
            <li>soooooo long love the color even though some look alike</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft color that can be intense depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved this specific set in my wishlist, and for a long time, I would visit it and contemplate buying them because the price was so good.</li>
            <li>Since then I really haven&#x27;t kept track of how long they last through the day, but it stays for a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>many that are pink</li>
            <li>would really give it a 3.5/ out of 5</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the lighter side, but I think these colors are really versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect from them.</li>
            <li>not one red what I was really wanting!!! 👿</li>
            <li>Each color is different &amp; unique.</li>
            <li>The colors were rich, covered smoothly and for once, they were actually long lasting as promised.</li>
            <li>I wish the had more variety of colors from dark to brights.</li>
            <li>The cream feels strange going on because it is unique</li>
            <li>u do suggest a high volume gloss unless the matte look is what your going for.</li>
            <li>(light pink (</li>
            <li>I normally go with a stain and gloss and maintian with Burt&#x27;s bees or Vaseline to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a good experience with NYX before in the past, especially with their matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I think NYX just came out with few more new shades for their soft matte lip cream, so you will actually get more variety of colors such as corals and peaches.</li>
            <li>if 6 star i will put its very soft look dosnt dehydrat the lip .</li>
            <li>This is the first cream that I have had that actually lasted ALL DAY........  </li>
            <li>Use chapstick on top for excessive dryness.</li>
            <li>While applying it to my lips, I was pleasantly surprised, it was unlike anything else I had ever put on before.</li>
            <li>It feels natural and doesn&#x27;t come off on anything like lipstick</li>
            <li>The collection offers nudes, neutrals, pinks, berry, to reds.</li>
            <li>I admit i was a bit hesitant at first when ordering, because these are matte and I usually like my lip colors with a shine, but I took a chance and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I used daily for my work its natural &amp; fixed not change, matte &amp; soft</li>
            <li>this lip creams are very different from glosses and normal lipsticks, It&#x27;s like a ink you use on lips, they have this matte and no shining finishing.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors I am not sooooo crazy for, but with a little lipgloss mixing they all look wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is not for me at all because it really makes my lips dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>As much as I love color, I hate how drying most lipsticks are &amp; how they look if they don&#x27;t wear we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li>Their very opaque and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Package clearly had been opened, and only 4 colors were in it and one of them was opened and used.</li>
            <li>You would think I would be a little upset about them not being what I expected, but they are so fantastic</li>
            <li>You can simply top of the nudes with another color to blend your custom shades, or with a sheer colored lip gloss to tone down the pale nudes.</li>
            <li>Although, they dry up a bit, it&#x27;s nothing a lil clear gloss can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>I got dull pale tans and Browns and not these rich vibrant colors.  </li>

            <li> Lovely shades ..</li>
            <li> There are a couple I don&#x27;t love, but I mix these and I can create colors that I do like.</li>
            <li> My order included many more neutrals and browns rather than the pinks and reds shown in image.</li>
            <li> love how they go on as a liquid yet</li>
            <li> You can add more layers for more color depth.</li>
            <li> Love this lip cream set.</li>
            <li> I love the texture on these lip cream.</li>

            <li> I will surely be reordering soon.</li>

            <li> this soft matte lip cream are amazing, I love all the NYX products !!</li>
            <li> Quality-wise, this is the best lipstick I have tried -- 100% coat of my natural lip color, very smooth, matte, true color-stay.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and easy to apply</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s really how much I was impressed with them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these lipsticks; however, most of the colors were too light for me.</li>
            <li> Not only I got all 11 colors, they were nicely packed, but also a great deal.</li>
            <li> Shipped right on time, and I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> wife says it is very cool</li>
            <li> were cakey, others you can barely see and others where beautiful.</li>
            <li> It looked great all up until I wiped it completely off with my napkin (a habit I have</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I purchased these from Amazon, but I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> True to color!</li>
            <li> It smelled great, and it felt so smooth and soft going on my lips,</li>
            <li> but it goes on easy and looks well</li>
            <li> get for the price this is better than any lip stick they stay off super</li>
            <li> I love lip cream all color, this is my first time using nyx lip cream.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these lip creams.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make your lips feel dry and they are greatly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these mainly for the velvety smooth texture and the comfort long-lasting quality.</li>
            <li> The complete collection contains 11 shades of which I own and have reviewed a variety of 4 of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice soft applications.</li>
            <li> Keep lips soft and moist, nice colors.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand what they were, but the makeup gurus on youtube loves them including many of the buyers on here</li>
            <li> I really love how nice smelling these lip cream are,, they dry up matt with a bit of velvety finish</li>
            <li> They last all day or almost all day -:), these are the best lip creams I have ever bought, they are not shinny and glossy like other lip liners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a full five stars is because some of the colors are very similar.</li>
            <li> Seriously, these are a great deal!</li>
            <li> Finally found the perfect red lip color for my skin tone (Mac:nc42) which is Amsterdam.</li>
            <li> These came quickly in the mail during holiday season.</li>
            <li> I wish they had more shades of Red in this pack though, too many pinks</li>
            <li> I mainly got nudes!!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with that unexpected miracle!</li>
            <li> but these are worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Years worth of color.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think whether you are a lipstick gal or a gloss lady, you will love NYX soft matte lip</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying that I was surprised that there were so many people with positive feedback about these lipsticks to me</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Product is fine but some seem already used... When you open some of them are completely clean and never opened</li>
            <li> I purchased these expecting more of a matted gloss, but instead they are super creamy, soft, and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I loved these lip creams but some of them looked like they&#x27;ve been used or swatched before with little hairs on the sponge applicator..</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> When I first received these lip cream I was a bit upset because i thought I had ordered the lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> The first day I got them I tested a color before bed.</li>
            <li> , I had never tried them on in person or anything, but they definitely sounded like something I would be pleased</li>
            <li> it simply because of the matte sexy finish it has.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve seen various lip colors advertised as all day wear, wont come off after eating or drinking...</li>
            <li> Love the different shades that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I most especially like the San Pablo shade.</li>
            <li> I love them but some of them was open</li>
            <li> They came pretty fast and had all the colors i wanted !</li>
            <li> ther is ni red color and many color is the seam ..</li>
            <li> So I just put them to the side and really didn&#x27;t use them because I didn&#x27;t like how it looked when i first put it on.  </li>
            <li> soooooo long love the color even though some look alike</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft color that can be intense depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved this specific set in my wishlist, and for a long time, I would visit it and contemplate buying them because the price was so good.</li>
            <li> Since then I really haven&#x27;t kept track of how long they last through the day, but it stays for a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> many that are pink</li>
            <li> would really give it a 3.5/ out of 5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the lighter side, but I think these colors are really versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect from them.</li>
            <li> not one red what I was really wanting!!! 👿</li>
            <li> Each color is different &amp; unique.</li>
            <li> The colors were rich, covered smoothly and for once, they were actually long lasting as promised.</li>
            <li> I wish the had more variety of colors from dark to brights.</li>
            <li> The cream feels strange going on because it is unique</li>
            <li> u do suggest a high volume gloss unless the matte look is what your going for.</li>
            <li> (light pink (</li>
            <li> I normally go with a stain and gloss and maintian with Burt&#x27;s bees or Vaseline to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a good experience with NYX before in the past, especially with their matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I think NYX just came out with few more new shades for their soft matte lip cream, so you will actually get more variety of colors such as corals and peaches.</li>
            <li> if 6 star i will put its very soft look dosnt dehydrat the lip .</li>
            <li> This is the first cream that I have had that actually lasted ALL DAY........  </li>
            <li> Use chapstick on top for excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> While applying it to my lips, I was pleasantly surprised, it was unlike anything else I had ever put on before.</li>
            <li> It feels natural and doesn&#x27;t come off on anything like lipstick</li>
            <li> The collection offers nudes, neutrals, pinks, berry, to reds.</li>
            <li> I admit i was a bit hesitant at first when ordering, because these are matte and I usually like my lip colors with a shine, but I took a chance and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I used daily for my work its natural &amp; fixed not change, matte &amp; soft</li>
            <li> this lip creams are very different from glosses and normal lipsticks, It&#x27;s like a ink you use on lips, they have this matte and no shining finishing.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors I am not sooooo crazy for, but with a little lipgloss mixing they all look wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is not for me at all because it really makes my lips dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> As much as I love color, I hate how drying most lipsticks are &amp; how they look if they don&#x27;t wear we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Their very opaque and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Package clearly had been opened, and only 4 colors were in it and one of them was opened and used.</li>
            <li> You would think I would be a little upset about them not being what I expected, but they are so fantastic</li>
            <li> You can simply top of the nudes with another color to blend your custom shades, or with a sheer colored lip gloss to tone down the pale nudes.</li>
            <li> Although, they dry up a bit, it&#x27;s nothing a lil clear gloss can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I got dull pale tans and Browns and not these rich vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li> These colors are vibrant enough that they don&#x27;t need a shiny finish, but if I want one, i can always dab a little gloss on my lips after applying one of these.</li>
            <li> long lasting (no lip liner</li>
            <li> They are long lasting even during eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> These will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Toyko &amp; Istanbul are similar as well (nude pink).</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date and was shipped internationally with no problems.</li>
            <li> The color is not natural and doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Some will dry up your lips and look really dry.</li>
            <li> After I let it dry a bit</li>
            <li> These make your lips look dry</li>
            <li> But even then I suggest an untinted moisturizer because they can feel dry at times</li>
            <li> The only down fall is</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although they are long-lasting, as I mentioned above, they are not drying in the typical form of a long-lasting lip product.</li>
            <li> i had to but expensive clear lipgloss over it to make the lip color look professional.</li>
            <li> Yucky soft, not nice.</li>
            <li> After 8 hours of sleep, I woke up to perfectly pink lips.</li>
            <li> For both inexperienced make up wearers and pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> and I am really not a fan of them at all.</li>
            <li> a few colors were similar.</li>
            <li> i should of just bought 1 before i spent $70 on it.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months back..</li>
            <li> The picture does not accurately portray actual colors received.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel heavy on the lips, even when layered with other products, and are instead give a richly-pigmented almost staining effect that is also creamy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is creamy but not runny a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But however I decided to play with the cream again and use some other gloss with them, and guess what.....  </li>
            <li> first one I ended up using was Istanbul, which I picked and unwrapped at random.</li>
            <li> i would not go with any other brand.</li>
            <li> I was looking for that specifically so the matte is a plus but just for other buyers remember that!</li>
            <li> hmmm.. let me use them  for a little bit</li>
            <li> only only thing is they then to dry up after a few HOURS which isn&#x27;t bad since it stayed on for</li>
            <li> lots of color (almost a stain) while staying moist, not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> but I still always wind up having to reapply after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have quite dry lips, and you would think matte lip products will make them worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to buy cosmetics sight unseen</li>
            <li> (the reason I bought this) way to much money for a screw up Amazon get your crap together!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but i think a 3 would be unfair and a 4 would be too generous...</li>
            <li> wtf is that???????</li>
            <li> i hate it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Colors are gorgeous! Finally found the perfect red lip color for my skin tone (Mac:nc42) which is Amsterdam. This is a great price for 11 colors considering they are 6 bucks a tube. Although, they dry up a bit, it&#x27;s nothing a lil clear gloss can&#x27;t fix. 3 of the 11 colors are very similar: Stockholm, London &amp; Abu Dhabi (nude brown) and Toyko &amp; Istanbul are similar as well (nude pink). They have a mousse like feel and you don&#x27;t need a lip liner, the applicator glides on so well. I only gave it 4 stars because of the drying effect but it is called &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; for a reason...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lip creams. They last all day or almost all day -:), these are the best lip creams I have ever bought, they are not shinny and glossy like other lip liners. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5star is because I didn&#x27;t get the colors shown in the picture. Some I liked and some not at all.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Arrived before expected date and was shipped internationally with no problems. And these are for sure the best 11 colors! Perfect amounts of nudes, pinks, and reds. I love it!</li>
            <li> Just got my 11 shades I&#x27;ve been anticipating.  NOT the same colors as pictured.  I got dull pale tans and Browns and not these rich vibrant colors.  Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> When I first received these lip cream I was a bit upset because i thought I had ordered the lip gloss.  So I just put them to the side and really didn&#x27;t use them because I didn&#x27;t like how it looked when i first put it on.  But however I decided to play with the cream again and use some other gloss with them, and guess what.....  The Lip Cream is all I wear now.  This is the first cream that I have had that actually lasted ALL DAY........  I absolutely Love It.....</li>
            <li> ⚠ YOU WILL GET USED, EXPIRED</li>
            <li> love these things!  they have a whipped feeling to them when you put them on your lips.  Their very opaque and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Some colors better than others. Some will dry up your lips and look really dry.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2KM18M9AB0MNG]]These richly-pigmented lip products combine the qualities of a long-lasting lipstick with the ease of application of a gloss. The complete collection contains 11 shades of which I own and have reviewed a variety of 4 of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Stockholm&lt;br /&gt;-Milan&lt;br /&gt;-Antwerp&lt;br /&gt;-San Paulo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they are long-lasting, as I mentioned above, they are not drying in the typical form of a long-lasting lip product. The application is flawlessly smooth and I find that pairing them with a lip liner maximizes their amazing formulation. They pair well with a lip gloss layered on top as well which some long-lasting lip products do not, so I find this to be another plus in my book. They don&#x27;t feel heavy on the lips, even when layered with other products, and are instead give a richly-pigmented almost staining effect that is also creamy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail price: $6&lt;br /&gt;However, prices can range anywhere from $5-$9 depending on where purchased.</li>
            <li> I purchased these expecting more of a matted gloss, but instead they are super creamy, soft, and not heavy at all. You would think I would be a little upset about them not being what I expected, but they are so fantastic I don&#x27;t mind at all.  I put on my lip primer/ plumper and then apply. After I let it dry a bit I put a light layer of cream matted lipgloss over the top, and these colors look gorgeous. The first day I got them I tested a color before bed. After 8 hours of sleep, I woke up to perfectly pink lips. Since then I really haven&#x27;t kept track of how long they last through the day, but it stays for a good amount of time.  Some of the colors I am not sooooo crazy for, but with a little lipgloss mixing they all look wonderful. Shipped right on time, and I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> wow i might say the best soo creamy n soft on the lips beautiful colors  ,i will order again soon .i lovee love love love it !!!!!! so buy it now !</li>
            <li> These came quickly in the mail during holiday season. I was really pleased with that unexpected miracle! Plus the colors are great but just remember that they are MATTE and not glossy. I was looking for that specifically so the matte is a plus but just for other buyers remember that! Great product!</li>
            <li> Very nice and comes in a variety of matte shades. Ones that don&#x27;t work well alone can be mixed with something else. I love them. Wish there were more shades.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying that I was surprised that there were so many people with positive feedback about these lipsticks to me not all the lipsticks are impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some were cakey, others you can barely see and others where beautiful. I&#x27;ve uploaded a pic with the lipsticks on the lips with each name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;they are not sticky&lt;br /&gt;go on smooth&lt;br /&gt;various colors&lt;br /&gt;nice reds&lt;br /&gt;nice pinks&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than retail&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some lip colors are cakey and in my photo you will see which one&#x27;s I&#x27;m talking about&lt;br /&gt;too many that are pink (light pink (eekkk)&lt;br /&gt;not enough variety of what you would expect in 11 different shades&lt;br /&gt;not long lasting (no lip liner but i did use a lip primer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really give it a 3.5/ out of 5 but i think a 3 would be unfair and a 4 would be too generous...hmmm.. let me use them  for a little bit and I may change my mind..</li>
            <li> Lots of colors, great quality and smells like frosted carrot cake! So great and I am so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> As much as I love color, I hate how drying most lipsticks are &amp; how they look if they don&#x27;t wear we&#x27;ll. I normally go with a stain and gloss and maintian with Burt&#x27;s bees or Vaseline to avoid dryness. These are wonderful. The cream feels strange going on because it is unique but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.....lots of color (almost a stain) while staying moist, not sticky or heavy. It&#x27;s tough to buy cosmetics sight unseen but these are worth the risk.</li>
            <li> if 6 star i will put its very soft look dosnt dehydrat the lip . very good smelling</li>
            <li> this lip creams are very different from glosses and normal lipsticks, It&#x27;s like a ink you use on lips, they have this matte and no shining finishing. Really nice.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like reapplying all the time this is perfect, it also comes in a great range of colors. I&#x27;d buy more if they had more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a good experience with NYX before in the past, especially with their matte lipsticks. I saw this and was intrigued, I had never tried them on in person or anything, but they definitely sounded like something I would be pleased with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved this specific set in my wishlist, and for a long time, I would visit it and contemplate buying them because the price was so good. Thankfully, my friend offered to buy me them as a Christmas present. As soon as she gave me the package, I couldn&#x27;t help but use one immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I ended up using was Istanbul, which I picked and unwrapped at random. While applying it to my lips, I was pleasantly surprised, it was unlike anything else I had ever put on before. It smelled great, and it felt so smooth and soft going on my lips, applying it was a breeze. The color looked stunning as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I went to eat and man, does this stuff have staying power! It looked great all up until I wiped it completely off with my napkin (a habit I have while eating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, I couldn&#x27;t help but try on more of the colors, and they all went well with my skin tone. Some of the colors do look similar, especially the ones in the beige containers, but you can see the difference. They all have that nice sweet smell, and all of them applied great. They look great matte, or even with added shine. They don&#x27;t make your lips feel dry and they are greatly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think the color selections would go great with any skin tone as well. I&#x27;m on the lighter side, but I think these colors are really versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wish I could give them 10 stars, that&#x27;s really how much I was impressed with them. I hope they never run out, but I&#x27;ll just have to buy more when they do. I&#x27;m glad these added more colors to my selection, now I can&#x27;t wait to wear them out, it&#x27;s almost like I won&#x27;t ever run out of options. Seriously, these are a great deal! For both inexperienced make up wearers and pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I also forgot to mention that they are cruelty-free and hypoallergenic, how much better can they get?!</li>
            <li> These lip cream are easy to apply and smells good. They are long lasting even during eating and drinking. Even though I haven&#x27;t tried them with lip liners or lip gloss I get compliments on every color that I wear, and it simply because of the matte sexy finish it has. The only down fall is I wish the had more variety of colors from dark to brights. I found out that most of these colors are nudes and pinks. But great product worth the money. Nice soft applications.</li>
            <li> wow&lt;br /&gt;My wife says it is very cool</li>
            <li> Great deal for its price. I recommend it. It came very fast and perfect conditions. I will buy it again for sure. I am so happy i bought them they are great !!</li>
            <li> These make your lips look dry and I am really not a fan of them at all. I will never buy lip gloss online again.</li>
            <li> Very nice love all the color</li>
            <li> the creams feel absolutely perfectly matte! i would not go with any other brand. EVER! It is absolutely amazing and I am so glad that I bought this set</li>
            <li> This lip cream is a beautiful color. I love lip cream all color, this is my first time using nyx lip cream. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. I love it.</li>
            <li> All the colors are amazing. Since it is a matte cream u do suggest a high volume gloss unless the matte look is what your going for. But even then I suggest an untinted moisturizer because they can feel dry at times</li>
            <li> get for the price this is better than any lip stick they stay off super only only thing is they then to dry up after a few HOURS which isn&#x27;t bad since it stayed on for soooooo long love the color even though some look alike but still a super good buy</li>
            <li> as always... nyx smells good &amp; is easy to apply. its matte so it looks good on the lips! lovely!</li>
            <li> I love ALL the colors! It feels natural and doesn&#x27;t come off on anything like lipstick does. You only need to put it on once, and maybe touch it up after eating or something but that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> This is creamy but not runny a little goes a long way. Keep lips soft and moist, nice colors.&lt;br /&gt;Will give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Package clearly had been opened, and only 4 colors were in it and one of them was opened and used.</li>
            <li> this soft matte lip cream are amazing, I love all the NYX products !!</li>
            <li> I loved these lip cremes. The colors were rich, covered smoothly and for once, they were actually long lasting as promised. I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve seen various lip colors advertised as all day wear, wont come off after eating or drinking...but I still always wind up having to reapply after a few hours. These however stayed on all day. I admit i was a bit hesitant at first when ordering, because these are matte and I usually like my lip colors with a shine, but I took a chance and it was worth it. These colors are vibrant enough that they don&#x27;t need a shiny finish, but if I want one, i can always dab a little gloss on my lips after applying one of these. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS!!!!!! There may be 4 colors right I bought this for my girlfriend and I got the package today but none of those bright colors are in it (the reason I bought this) way to much money for a screw up Amazon get your crap together!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these lip creams. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect from them. I&#x27;ve never used a lip cream before. I didn&#x27;t really understand what they were, but the makeup gurus on youtube loves them including many of the buyers on here so I said the hell with it and bought them. a few colors were similar. the matte finish isn&#x27;t something that looks flattering on me, except for monte carlo. They look better with some shiny gloss over it. im just getting into makeup so this is something nice to have in my collection.</li>
            <li> I loved these lip creams but some of them looked like they&#x27;ve been used or swatched before with little hairs on the sponge applicator..</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these lipsticks; however, most of the colors were too light for me. Quality-wise, this is the best lipstick I have tried -- 100% coat of my natural lip color, very smooth, matte, true color-stay. Use chapstick on top for excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> All the colors shown were sent. But its NOT longlasting and after 5 minutes it dries up. i had to but expensive clear lipgloss over it to make the lip color look professional. i should of just bought 1 before i spent $70 on it. smh</li>
            <li> Like the actual product&lt;br /&gt;Just upset that they weren&#x27;t the colors shown.. I mainly got nudes!!! And Browns&lt;br /&gt;And not one red what I was really wanting!!! 👿</li>
            <li> Excellent product by NYX cosmetics !! Lovely shades .. Packed well delivered on time .. Must have for women</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft color that can be intense depending on how much you use. You do need a moisturizer. I just use Chapstick. Some of the colors are very very similar. There are a couple I don&#x27;t love, but I mix these and I can create colors that I do like. These will last for a very long time. Years worth of color.</li>
            <li> I used daily for my work its natural &amp; fixed not change, matte &amp; soft&lt;br /&gt;More quality &amp; incredible price</li>
            <li> Love the different shades that comes with it.  I most especially like the San Pablo shade. Would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! Totally worth the money. Couldn&#x27;t be any happier with these.</li>
            <li> This is not for me at all because it really makes my lips dry and flaky. For the quality, I guess you get what you paid. The color is not natural and doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Yucky soft, not nice.</li>
            <li> i hate it! i just got the item! 11 lipstick but 5 lipstick is open!! wtf is that???????</li>
            <li> I love them but some of them was open</li>
            <li> The picture does not accurately portray actual colors received. My order included many more neutrals and browns rather than the pinks and reds shown in image.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months back..love how they go on as a liquid yet dries with a matte finished look! You can add more layers for more color depth. I wish they had more shades of Red in this pack though, too many pinks</li>
            <li> I really love how nice smelling these lip cream are,, they dry up matt with a bit of velvety finish</li>
            <li> My wife got these from me in her stocking for Christmas.  She loves them.  Although they are a bit pricey, the quality is great.</li>
            <li> They came pretty fast and had all the colors i wanted !</li>
            <li> Product is fine but some seem already used... When you open some of them are completely clean and never opened while some others have smudges all along the inside... very obvious</li>
            <li> recevied on time..&lt;br /&gt;like the product</li>
            <li> Love this lip cream set. Colors are beautiful and long lasting! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a full five stars is because some of the colors are very similar.</li>
            <li> this does not shine enough for me. but it goes on easy and looks well</li>
            <li> Love the colors and easy to apply</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I purchased these from Amazon, but I absolutely love these! I compared price on a lot of the websites for these, and believed this is the best value. Not only I got all 11 colors, they were nicely packed, but also a great deal. I love the texture on these lip cream. I am a lipstick person, and don&#x27;t wear lipgloss. These come in lipgloss like tubes with the sponge applicators. I have quite dry lips, and you would think matte lip products will make them worse. Not these ones! The texture is velvety, and they go on very smoothly. They are not hydrating, but non-drying, either. The color payoff on these are the same as what you see of the tube colors. True to color! They blend out nice, super light-weight, long-lasting, comfortable wear, and have great portable size. The range of colors are nice as well. The collection offers nudes, neutrals, pinks, berry, to reds. I like how all the colors in this collection are wearable except for the ultra nudes, but these are great for layering. You can simply top of the nudes with another color to blend your custom shades, or with a sheer colored lip gloss to tone down the pale nudes. I love these mainly for the velvety smooth texture and the comfort long-lasting quality. I think NYX just came out with few more new shades for their soft matte lip cream, so you will actually get more variety of colors such as corals and peaches. I think whether you are a lipstick gal or a gloss lady, you will love NYX soft matte lip cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For products reviews and makeup tutorials, please visit my Youtube channel: Theartofsign</li>
            <li> Each individual lip cream came wrapped in plastic, which shows me they were never opened and are sanitary. I love all the colors. Very pretty and I&#x27;m sure my clients will love them as well. I will surely be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> this is not the seam color in the pic. ther is ni red color and many color is the seam .. the nude color is 56 peases</li>
            <li> I love these! Each color is different &amp; unique. The pigmentation is amazing it lasts for hours &amp; I find its best when coated with a lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Most dryer, and the quantity, I bought them a gift</li>
