            <li>This lip balm is great - totally worth</li>
            <li>Nice smell , cute package.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip balm I have run into so far.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is pretty great.</li>
            <li>This makes my lips smooth and the container for the product is adorable!</li>
            <li>I tried this product, and it is very mild and perfect for my sensitive lip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing and really glossy - a perfect look.</li>
            <li>Cute AND functional packaging lengthens the product lifespan too.</li>
            <li>And the pot it comes in is just so adorable</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The shine is not outrageous.</li>
            <li>Cute container I like the smell of the lip balm I ordered the orange one too.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the cutest lip glosses I have ever purchased :) and not only that, it smells and tastes so good!</li>
            <li>Perfect adorable little &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in a tube for easy application.  </li>
            <li>Also got here relatively quick, which rocked!</li>
            <li>Smooth application.</li>
            <li>Also, the lip balm looked a lot like real honey which was amazing.</li>
            <li>I use this nearly everyday (whenever I throw a bit of Tony Moly color on my lips), and I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li>was very useful.</li>
            <li>First, the packaging is so cute.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use the honey stick because i dont want to clean it off</li>
            <li>Super cute, a tiny bit sticky, but smells nice and I like the packaging.</li>
            <li>Smells great and has a very sheer and pretty shine to lips.</li>
            <li>But the product is really smooth and, well, almost fun.</li>
            <li>color and consistency really mimics honey, which is super cute.</li>
            <li>If you purchased it at a 8$ price or a 7$ price then obviously you new how much it costed before you purchased it as well as how many ounces it is.!!!</li>
            <li>and it applies very well and easy.</li>
            <li>so of course i passed along ur seller info because its absolutely so cute and it does stay on for hours and its not a heavy goopy feeling that some glosses have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>The packaging is certainly a bonus!</li>
            <li>I constantly seek new and amazing lip balms but the only thing that was amazing about this was the packaging.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the samples!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too sticky like lip gloss but not to dry like most lip balms.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>This is just a basic lip gloss without any color, but I love how it shines, stays on for a while, and most importantly is NOT STICKY.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again once I run out!&lt;br /&gt;The seller I bought from also included tons of free samples which is always a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this lip balm.</li>
            <li>It is not a lip gloss, and the texture is much like jelly</li>
            <li>very cute, way smaller than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and put it on at night before bed and my lips feel great in the morning, hate flakey lips under lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I am still undecided about the cute little wand that you use, but since it is made of wood I am not too concerned about germ buildup.</li>
            <li>I love the little honey pot spoon everyone at work kept asking where i got this little adorable lip gloss from</li>
            <li>I love the little honey</li>
            <li>The little wooden thing is cute, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the idea of infection from having to put it somewhere.</li>
            <li>price for this was a little more expensive than I would have liked, however I think its well worth it.</li>
            <li>i paid 2.80$ condition new</li>
            <li>so to complain after you already new</li>
            <li>The taste of it isn&#x27;t too bad, but it&#x27;s not over the top amazing.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive lips and have problem using lip products.  </li>
            <li>It was clear but it make my lips so glossly!</li>
            <li>I usually dab on a shade of the Tony Moly bunny sticks, and then wipe this honey pot over on top</li>
            <li>My lips felt smooth, soft and had a slight shine.</li>
            <li>The little wooden &amp;#34;dipper&amp;#34; is a cute feature.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and can be worn over lip stick.</li>
            <li>*came in early ❤️</li>
            <li>Really soft lips with this ..</li>
            <li>an goes on soft</li>
            <li>I love the way it glides over my lips and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or sticky.</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend this product to other until further notice :)</li>
            <li>Pharmacy brands, major brands,  Burt&#x27;s bees, anything all natural, doesn&#x27;t matter....</li>
            <li>lip balm itself is super hydrating, and it last a long long time!</li>
            <li>Probably half my fault, I should have really looked to see the dimensions of it.</li>
            <li>The taste and scent are amazingly sweet and subtle.</li>

            <li> The taste and scent are amazingly sweet and subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost all brands of lip products and so far Nars is only lipstick I can wear on my lip other than Vaseline and Aquaphore.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this in my mailbox on Friday, it seems my husband surprised me with a small gift.</li>
            <li> A lot more expensive than I thought it would be as it is a lot smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> It also lasted of my lips for quite a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the typical lip balm as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying other flavors in the future.</li>
            <li> With just a little goop you can cover all your lips; it&#x27;s a very jello-y and thick consistency.</li>
            <li> REALLY SMALL o_O</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I yell at my daughter for using this one when she can use ALL my other test items, yet she keeps using this one as well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it because my lips were extremely chapped from the winter, and I always would lose my chapsticks after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> they all made blisters on my lip and I end up w/ black crusted lip.  </li>
            <li> This is not super greasy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with a bit of subtle color and luscious, plump lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little honey stick it comes with</li>
            <li> My lips usually react to whatever I am allergic to in less than half day.</li>
            <li> I really like how this feels on my lips, but the applicator gets a bit awkward after a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for few weeks now without any problem.  </li>
            <li> so i feel alot if it goes to waste</li>
            <li> Ordered a few of these and going to give my granddaughters one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> well for the one person who says this product is expensive for a lip balm it actually isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It helps to moisturizes my lips for some time, but it doenst have any long term effect tho. :(</li>
            <li> Dermatologist, allergist hasn&#x27;t found what&#x27;s wrong w/</li>
            <li> :(  </li>

            <li> Super cute and tasty not sticky!!! The stick is adorable too!!! I don&#x27;t wanna even use it just keep it as a nicknack. Haha</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive lips and have problem using lip products.  I&#x27;ve tried almost all brands of lip products and so far Nars is only lipstick I can wear on my lip other than Vaseline and Aquaphore.  You name it, I tried ALL glosses, balms, etc.  Pharmacy brands, major brands,  Burt&#x27;s bees, anything all natural, doesn&#x27;t matter....they all made blisters on my lip and I end up w/ black crusted lip.  :(  I tried this product, and it is very mild and perfect for my sensitive lip.

            <li> Bought these for my nieces. Perfect adorable little &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of lip gloss. The little wooden &amp;#34;dipper&amp;#34; is a cute feature. These arrived in a timely fashion and were well packaged.</li>
            <li> A lot more expensive than I thought it would be as it is a lot smaller than expected. Was going to be a prize for a baby shower gift but it&#x27;s not substantial enough. Probably half my fault, I should have really looked to see the dimensions of it.</li>
            <li> This makes my lips smooth and the container for the product is adorable!</li>
            <li> This is just a basic lip gloss without any color, but I love how it shines, stays on for a while, and most importantly is NOT STICKY.  I am still undecided about the cute little wand that you use, but since it is made of wood I am not too concerned about germ buildup.</li>
            <li> Oh ma gosh this is amazing! It felt so good to were something so perfect for my dance. It was clear but it make my lips so glossly! Also I bought the standard shipping and I got it the next day! So amazing! 5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a tube for easy application.  You can&#x27;t throw this in your purse because you need the tool to apply.  You&#x27;d have to find a case for the tool.</li>
            <li> Super cute, a tiny bit sticky, but smells nice and I like the packaging.</li>
            <li> I love the little honey pot spoon everyone at work kept asking where i got this little adorable lip gloss from so of course i passed along ur seller info because its absolutely so cute and it does stay on for hours and its not a heavy goopy feeling that some glosses have</li>

            <li> It is amazing! I bought it for a gift for my mom and now I HAVE to get one for myself. Thanks for the samples!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! I purchased it because my lips were extremely chapped from the winter, and I always would lose my chapsticks after a couple uses. First, the packaging is so cute. The little honey stick it comes with is very cute and helpful. Theres a lot of the lip balm in here, so you are definitely getting your moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm itself is super hydrating, and it last a long long time! You don&#x27;t need to re-apply that often. It also isnt sticky at all and it applies very well and easy. It has a nice shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;The price for this was a little more expensive than I would have liked, however I think its well worth it. I will definitely buy this again once I run out!&lt;br /&gt;The seller I bought from also included tons of free samples which is always a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Would Recommend</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the cutest lip glosses I have ever purchased :) and not only that, it smells and tastes so good! Also got here relatively quick, which rocked! Will definitely purchase again &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this in my mailbox on Friday, it seems my husband surprised me with a small gift. :) I absolutely love it! It doesn&#x27;t smell like honey at all but it smells delicious anyways! I love the way it glides over my lips and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or sticky. Smooth application. And the pot it comes in is just so adorable and I think I&#x27;m going to love showing it off whenever I can!</li>
            <li> REALLY SMALL o_O *came in early ❤️</li>
            <li> This lip balm is pretty great. The taste of it isn&#x27;t too bad, but it&#x27;s not over the top amazing. It smells pretty good as well. I would recommend to try this product.</li>
            <li> I really like how this feels on my lips, but the applicator gets a bit awkward after a while. I would like trying it with the tint next time.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has a very sheer and pretty shine to lips.</li>
            <li> Its a nice lip balm. Really soft lips with this .. it stays on even if im eating they only downside is when you get the product out of the pot thres alot thee and you dont need alot so i feel alot if it goes to waste .. i don&#x27;t use the honey stick because i dont want to clean it off everytime i put this on my lips.</li>
            <li> Smells good an goes on soft I have all 3 colors</li>
            <li> well for the one person who says this product is expensive for a lip balm it actually isn&#x27;t i paid 2.80$ condition new the price must have went up. If you purchased it at a 8$ price or a 7$ price then obviously you new how much it costed before you purchased it as well as how many ounces it is.!!! so to complain after you already new then its your fault i would definitely recommend this product to other until further notice :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The little wooden thing is cute, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the idea of infection from having to put it somewhere. But the product is really smooth and, well, almost fun. If one can say that about lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> very cute, way smaller than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great - totally worth the wait (it ships from Korea). It is not sticky and just feels soft and nice (tastes very pleasant). They also sent six product samples with my order which was a very nice surprise.</li>
            <li> This is not super greasy. The shine is not outrageous. The taste and scent are amazingly sweet and subtle. With just a little goop you can cover all your lips; it&#x27;s a very jello-y and thick consistency. This is the cutest lip gloss I have purchased -- recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this lip balm. It smells like gummy bears! It is not a lip gloss, and the texture is much like jelly yet it is  not sticky so your hair will not get caught in it. My lips felt smooth, soft and had a slight shine. It goes on clear and can be worn over lip stick. It&#x27;s worth the price. You have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell , cute package. It helps to moisturizes my lips for some time, but it doenst have any long term effect tho. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, but it also does not feel too great. I constantly seek new and amazing lip balms but the only thing that was amazing about this was the packaging. Plus it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the typical lip balm as well. I will probably  still use this, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have run into so far. It wasn&#x27;t too sticky like lip gloss but not to dry like most lip balms. The wooden stick it came with was very useful. Also, the lip balm looked a lot like real honey which was amazing. The lip balm also moisturized my lips perfectly. It also lasted of my lips for quite a long period of time.The lip balm came also in a very cute container. I would recommend this product to everyone. This stuff is awesome!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and put it on at night before bed and my lips feel great in the morning, hate flakey lips under lipstick.  Ordered a few of these and going to give my granddaughters one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Cute container I like the smell of the lip balm I ordered the orange one too. Its not sticky or slimy that&#x27;s why I like it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s super moisturizing and really glossy - a perfect look. I usually dab on a shade of the Tony Moly bunny sticks, and then wipe this honey pot over on top and I&#x27;m left with a bit of subtle color and luscious, plump lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color and consistency really mimics honey, which is super cute. The packaging is certainly a bonus! I love the little honey stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this! I use this nearly everyday (whenever I throw a bit of Tony Moly color on my lips), and I&#x27;m really impressed. Will be purchasing again. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It works well for me. It&#x27;s kinda gives a glossy-ish look when I put it on but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> adorable and smells really good</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the taste but it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
