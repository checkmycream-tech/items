            <li>My kids love it.</li>
            <li>Thought they were more like just polish.  </li>
            <li>so i knew a girl that does such a awesome design</li>
            <li>ALL THE GIRLS LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li>Love the texture the color and how it looks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get better at the art portion of doing my nails.</li>
            <li>creative in art for nails</li>
            <li>This set is Okay</li>
            <li>more like puffy paint.</li>
            <li>This was an okay product.</li>
            <li>It is advertised as a &#x27;nail art tip pen&amp;#34;, but it looks more like glitter glue.  </li>
            <li>so I do not know the ingredients of if they are safe for children&#x27;s fingernails.  </li>
            <li>, I imagine they will spend many of hours of their holiday vacation doing their nails.</li>
            <li>I think these are probably OK.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave these as a gift which my wife enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>So smooth and easy to use!</li>
            <li>These pens are ok, they have a glue-ish texture and peels off easily.</li>
            <li>i thought this would be very cool which it is.</li>
            <li>They look great on nails but it peels off easily if used on natural nails.</li>
            <li>It tends to come off their nails fairly easy</li>
            <li>When I ordered this item it specified fine point pens but when arrived there was no tips</li>
            <li>Even he cheap plastic bag</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying having some fun with nail color and art.  </li>
            <li>Like the cheapest of the cheap kids craft paint.</li>
            <li>Actually they&#x27;d probably be great as like glitter glue on construction paper.</li>
            <li>When this came in the mail i was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>Nothing special, not quite what I percieved them to be.</li>
            <li>and I was super excited to receive them.</li>
            <li>also with-out my full knowledge the shipping charge was 27.00.</li>
            <li>I did buy two one for me and my mother, but I really wish that it was something better.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how in the world a person would be able to use these on fingernails?</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Got them quickly but also noticed that these are not nail pens.</li>
            <li>just wish there was more colours including a clear one too!!</li>
            <li>I chose the five star rating because the colors are vibrant and easy to create designs.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be great for a kid playing around, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a professional.</li>
            <li>These look like so much fun.</li>
            <li>These are worth what I paid for them.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I like these, the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li>These supplies don&#x27;t sit flat and fall off very easy.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>would recommend this too anyone who wants to have fun with their nails.&lt;br /&gt;bright</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, EVERMARKET!</li>
            <li>Not difficult though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife just squeezed a bead on where she wanted and waited about 3 minutes for it to dry then used a top coat.  </li>
            <li>come out of the container as much as the container want to not the user.</li>
            <li>I am very please with my set.</li>
            <li>its comes out way to fast and not even.</li>
            <li>but I cant get them to be detailed enough where I try to use them.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used yet.</li>
            <li>I feel really ripped off.</li>
            <li>Thanks for ruining my home manicure plans with my step daughter.</li>
            <li>but I can tell that we paid way too much for this item.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do much with those.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had things coming from China with much longer delivery times so no complaints about that</li>
            <li>for this&lt;br /&gt;it is very usefull and neccessary to make all the nail art, are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;thanks in advace.</li>
            <li>the black one is working OK...  </li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Most of the tubes were dried out at the tips while the ones that weren&#x27;t leaked through the sides in clumps.  </li>
            <li>i had fun with different patterns.</li>
            <li>They come right off your nails, and the directions.. Are in Chinese.</li>
            <li>Now had to go back and order another item that also said and shown product with a fine point for actually drawing on nail.</li>
            <li>The others work ok, but I am disappointed because the 4 that are unusable are the colors I use most!</li>
            <li>If you cover with a top coat and can resist fondling your nails throughout the day it should last as long as standard finger nail polish.  </li>
            <li>(clear liquid came out - no color or paint).</li>
            <li>(That I have tried so far)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a weird consistency, and when you try to use it the product sticks way up from the nail, and not in a good way in my opinion.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t dry very fast, but it&#x27;s no biggy.</li>
            <li>They are going to be Christmas gifts, so I can&#x27;t really tell you much about them other than I got them practically the day after I ordered them.</li>
            <li>the tubes aren&#x27;t even half full...</li>
            <li>This is more like half empty tubes of tulip paint and two of them look like glitter glue...</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The tips aren&#x27;t fine enough so the paint flows too heavy.</li>
            <li>Ordered this in December 2014 and received late January 2015 which was fine.  </li>
            <li>Not consistent enough for the artwork that I do, but they were worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I tried putting this on a false mail and it was lumpy and to top it off, it wouldn&#x27;t come off with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>However, more than half of the pens are dried up.  </li>
            <li>but when it dried it was like goo and it pilled right off.......</li>
            <li>It never dry up</li>
            <li>Some were separated and could not be mixed back together so only clear goo would come out and others were completely dry.</li>

            <li> It is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to receive them in the mail</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I guess thats why they labeled it as 3D, but I think thats just because the product is too thick for real nail art.</li>
            <li> They come out in big globs no matter how hard or soft you squeeze and because of that it takes the nail polish very long to dry.  </li>
            <li> it was still dry.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> they dont dry at all when used on acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> And the pain just pops off once its dry.</li>
            <li> When these paints dry they become kinda rubbery,</li>
            <li> I tried to use three different colors and all three were not right</li>
            <li> are completely unusable, they are all dried up &amp; all that comes out is a foamy residue!  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in my own talents.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and looks so unprofessional!  </li>
            <li> I did expect it to last a little longer though.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed, pretty much just like puffy paints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected ,maybe it&#x27;s jus not for me  </li>
            <li> It is harder to draw on fingernails than we expected but that is not the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> A few days later I received a phone call from the border patrol saying that this item was made with toxic ink they had to get my approval to ship it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The tip of the &amp;#34;pens&amp;#34; are too big and the paint is messy.</li>
            <li> they are just like glitter pens and when you apply them to you nails, they last a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It actually came in a few days before it was expected.</li>
            <li> Got it for nails, but have found other uses instead of nails.  </li>
            <li> Nope waste of money not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They took too long to arrive - got them on December 27 -- too late for Christmas.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, I think that this will be easier to use than a liner brush</li>
            <li> It dries a little tacky/rubbery.  </li>
            <li> I got the first order and it was no good, the second ones came and they are bad too.</li>
            <li> Turns out that the finger nail polish was dried out.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> So me are dried out or they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time</li>
            <li> All dried up when I got them</li>
            <li> ALL of the nail polish was dried up and it had to be thrown away</li>
            <li> but it took a long time to arrive and was late for Christmas!  </li>
            <li> Its like colorful elmers glue :(</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it was frozen on transit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> it is pointless.</li>
            <li> Product was a total disappointment and a waste of money..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at drawing nail art, but I believe a pro could use this product with ease.</li>
            <li> Received product and it was hard not usable</li>
            <li> This product came hard in the tubes.</li>
            <li> At least 4</li>
            <li> They go on in a fairly thick bead of about 1-2 mm, depending on how you apply it, giving it the 3D effect.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed and will be asking for my money back!</li>
            <li> At least one of the colors should have worked!</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s very hard to control to use .The silicon</li>
            <li> Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> All the paint was actually settled at the base and couldnt be squeezed out.</li>
            <li> The package and pens (not just the polish, but everything) had such a bad smell that I was afraid to use these.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> i failed at this.</li>
            <li> needless to say my daughter did not like at all</li>
            <li> paint is for painting on shirts or paper, and even that is questionable.</li>
            <li> Sad, I have to pay for the return shipment of this useless product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; is crappy colored glue that smears and stinks.</li>
            <li> I was really mad</li>
            <li> It is very sad, i was waiting a lot.</li>
            <li> I was scared to use them because they smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it was not  as described.  </li>
            <li> They are bad, they smell horrible.  </li>
            <li> It is a very bad experience.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that Amazon would sell a product like this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the worst pen ever</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> They smell terrible and are too puffy to go on nails!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> These pens are horrible.  </li>
            <li> tried using them and they are horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t even pens! They are containers that squirt out paint without any precision at all! If I could give it zero stars, I would.</li>
            <li> Im not an artist and I can still use these pens with ease. Excellent work. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, better than I thought it would be and quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.  Just like using a fabric or liquid paint.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone to buy this pen for nail art.  It never dry up and it&#x27;s the worst pen ever</li>
            <li> They are for more like childrens&#x60; art and craft stuff. It&#x60;s very hard to control to use .The silicon come out of the container as much as the container want to not the user. i failed at this.</li>
            <li> Not a horrible product, you get what you pay for. It came on time. Just disappointed, pretty much just like puffy paints. They come right off your nails, and the directions.. Are in Chinese.</li>
            <li> None of these worked! Some were separated and could not be mixed back together so only clear goo would come out and others were completely dry. Not one pen worked! Extremely disappointed and will be asking for my money back!</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Most of the tubes were dried out at the tips while the ones that weren&#x27;t leaked through the sides in clumps.  The instructions were in Chinese. Nothing about this product worked. Even he cheap plastic bag the tubes came in split on opening.  It is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> These supplies don&#x27;t sit flat and fall off very easy. Won&#x27;t recommend...</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. I chose the five star rating because the colors are vibrant and easy to create designs. I would recommend and use this company again. I am very please with my set.</li>
            <li> Love it..... i had fun with different patterns.Defitley would recommend it for any one who likes home made manicure!!!!! Try it!!!</li>
            <li> They work really good just have to get used to it just a lil practice.Love the 3d effects. Very happy.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I tried to squeeze the tubes to get the finger nail polish out and it was just water. Turns out that the finger nail polish was dried out. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected ,maybe it&#x27;s jus not for me  ,I thought it was something better. Wanted smaller paint flow</li>
            <li> Nope waste of money not at all what I expected.  Its like colorful elmers glue :( needless to say my daughter did not like at all</li>
            <li> its comes out way to fast and not even. so it just sits on my shelf collecting dust. Waste of money</li>
            <li> My daughter received these paints for her birthday. It took a long time to receive them in the mail but she loves all the colors. They look great on nails but it peels off easily if used on natural nails.</li>
            <li> Got it for nails, but have found other uses instead of nails.  Didn&#x27;t like it on my nails. Thats all I have to say about that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this item twice fron two different ppl and the result is always the same. So me are dried out or they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I expected. My kids love it. I did expect it to last a little longer though. It tends to come off their nails fairly easy</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful set. loved it, loved it, loved it. this is a must buy for any nail tech</li>
            <li> I did not think these were 3D nail art pens.  Thought they were more like just polish.  Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> I got these pens for my bithday, my friends and i were going to paint our nails but the nail polish was dry!!!i put them in boiling water so the nail polish would melt. When i got them out it was still dry. I was really mad then i found out it wasnt nail polish it was some kind of paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS CRAP!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got these nail art pens they are called &amp;#34;hot designs&amp;#34;, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> i thought this would be very cool which it is. but im not that good on the art designs so i knew a girl that does such a awesome design so i gave the set to her.</li>
            <li> This is more like half empty tubes of tulip paint and two of them look like glitter glue... the tubes aren&#x27;t even half full... and I ordered it Oct. 22 and just got it today Dec. 6... and not that I dont know what I&#x27;m doing but the instructions on how to use them,,, are not even in English....Not what I thought I was ordering AT ALL and wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday in the mail, I waited well over 3 weeks for it. This IS NOT for your nails. It&#x27;s not a pen point applicator either. Why mislead people. To make a buck? I&#x27;m so upset about this and no longer am I going to order from this company. I tried putting this on a false mail and it was lumpy and to top it off, it wouldn&#x27;t come off with nail polish remover. Another sign that it&#x27;s not meant to be put on nails.&lt;br /&gt;This paint is for painting on shirts or paper, and even that is questionable.</li>
            <li> Product was a total disappointment and a waste of money.. Received product and it was hard not usable therefore I cannot recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this she can use it  for anything! just wish there was more colours including a clear one too!!</li>
            <li> The product I received never got anything at all. All that could be squeezed out was a coloured oozing. All the paint was actually settled at the base and couldnt be squeezed out. It is a very bad experience. At least one of the colors should have worked! But none worked. Sad, I have to pay for the return shipment of this useless product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time</li>
            <li> ALL THE GIRLS LOVE THIS...AN DO WONDERFUL  ART WORK ON OUR TOE&#x27;S...FINGERNAILS..AN WE LIKE THE PRICE..AN WE ARE GONNA BUG ANOTHER..THANK YOU LADYBUG....</li>
            <li> I got the first order and it was no good, the second ones came and they are bad too. Im not sure if it was frozen on transit but I dont like them.</li>
            <li> This is what I wanted. It is harder to draw on fingernails than we expected but that is not the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> They smell terrible and are too puffy to go on nails! I was scared to use them because they smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> Love the texture the color and how it looks. Drys very easy and looks stunning. I received it in a timely fashioned. Very highly recommended! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This is not what they said it was.  They don&#x27;t dry. They are bad, they smell horrible.  DON&#x27;T BOTHER GETTING THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But I will say this they were good when I wanted to return them. That is the only reason I gave them 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Lots of colors; work well and I am enjoying having some fun with nail color and art.  I can&#x27;t wait to get better at the art portion of doing my nails.</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant.  With a little practice, I think that this will be easier to use than a liner brush</li>
            <li> they dont dry at all when used on acrylic nails. they dont even show up in color...</li>
            <li> Terrible! It takes forever to dry and looks so unprofessional!  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> This product came hard in the tubes. Will not come out. The glue has hardened it. It is not nail polish. Shame for taking a child&#x27;s money and sending damaged goods.</li>
            <li> would recommend this too anyone who wants to have fun with their nails.&lt;br /&gt;bright colors&lt;br /&gt;get creative in art for nails</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright. I like the color choices, and the bag they came in but they&#x27;re not all that great for nail art. They&#x27;re a weird consistency, and when you try to use it the product sticks way up from the nail, and not in a good way in my opinion. I guess thats why they labeled it as 3D, but I think thats just because the product is too thick for real nail art. They&#x27;d be great for a kid playing around, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a professional. You know what it reminds me of? Kids craft paint. Like the cheapest of the cheap kids craft paint. Actually they&#x27;d probably be great as like glitter glue on construction paper. Anyway, they&#x27;re alright. But not for nail art. I guess thats the bottom line.</li>
            <li> hello, congratulations very good excellent product, good quality and material. I recommend it to all of the community. Equally greetings</li>
            <li> Nothing special, not quite what I percieved them to be.</li>
            <li> the package was torn when we received the item and all the markers were out of the package.</li>
            <li> I am not an artist so this wasn&#x27;t a good buy for me. These paints are great color wise and flow freely but I cant get them to be detailed enough where I try to use them. The tips aren&#x27;t fine enough so the paint flows too heavy. If you use them for polka dots they work great but I was disappointed in my own talents. A good artist will really enjoy these pens !!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like these, the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li> The package and pens (not just the polish, but everything) had such a bad smell that I was afraid to use these.</li>
            <li> These pens are ok, they have a glue-ish texture and peels off easily.</li>
            <li> This set is Okay but it took a long time to arrive and was late for Christmas!  I didn&#x27;t know it was coming from China or I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used yet. Didn&#x27;t order in time for Christmas, but I knew that . It actually came in a few days before it was expected.</li>
            <li> The pens I received is so hard,not good to use.they should replace the customers with good stuff.</li>
            <li> These look like so much fun. They are going to be Christmas gifts, so I can&#x27;t really tell you much about them other than I got them practically the day after I ordered them. Thank you so much, EVERMARKET!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item also as a gift. A few days later I received a phone call from the border patrol saying that this item was made with toxic ink they had to get my approval to ship it. also with-out my full knowledge the shipping charge was 27.00. no need to say but I cancelled this order. and here yesterday the order was delivered to my home; I called customer service and they handled things.I disposed of this product.Just wanted to let you all know that this product may contain Toxic Ink...........</li>
            <li> I got these b/c thought they were the pens and they were not. And the pain just pops off once its dry.</li>
            <li> They work nice for beginners</li>
            <li> When these paints dry they become kinda rubbery, which I guess is what makes them 3D. There is no brush, you just squeeze the paint out of the tip of the tube. I&#x27;m not very good at drawing nail art, but I believe a pro could use this product with ease.</li>
            <li> more like puffy paint.</li>
            <li> This was an okay product. It wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting but the customer service was GREAT! Nothing again them just the product.  I did like the price to I did buy two one for me and my mother, but I really wish that it was something better.</li>
            <li> These are worth what I paid for them. Not consistent enough for the artwork that I do, but they were worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Thought they were markers for nail art😠😫</li>
            <li> Horrible product. All dried up when I got them</li>
            <li> bravo, thinking about ordering another one.</li>
            <li> I would never ever buy this again. Complete waste of money. Nothing like the description. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> When this came in the mail i was so excited to use it but when it dried it was like goo and it pilled right off.......The bag it came in broke when i was zipping it back up........I do not recoamend</li>
            <li> I finally received this product today after ordering it over two weeks ago.  It is advertised as a &#x27;nail art tip pen&amp;#34;, but it looks more like glitter glue.  I tried to use three different colors and all three were not right (clear liquid came out - no color or paint). I really don&#x27;t know how in the world a person would be able to use these on fingernails? The product arrived with the packaging all ripped and cracked.  Lastly, there is no literature so I do not know the ingredients of if they are safe for children&#x27;s fingernails.  I I I am very disappointed that Amazon would sell a product like this.</li>
            <li> Got them quickly but also noticed that these are not nail pens. I feel really ripped off. The &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; is crappy colored glue that smears and stinks. Thanks for ruining my home manicure plans with my step daughter. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> These pens are horrible.  They come out in big globs no matter how hard or soft you squeeze and because of that it takes the nail polish very long to dry.  I would not recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase. The tip of the &amp;#34;pens&amp;#34; are too big and the paint is messy. I&#x27;m not using this product at all. Will not bother sending it back it is pointless.</li>
            <li> I am happy with color nail pen. Now I can make different designs. My nails now it&#x27;s always nice looking.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item it specified fine point pens but when arrived there was no tips just nail polished that squeeze out. Can&#x27;t draw nothing but dots. Disappointed that it was not  as described.  Now had to go back and order another item that also said and shown product with a fine point for actually drawing on nail.</li>
            <li> well dis is wat relly i spect n it is exactly d same ting as seeing on d picture, well i relly recomend u guys dis</li>
            <li> Giving this to girls as stocking stuffers.  They will like them, I imagine they will spend many of hours of their holiday vacation doing their nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking maybe I&#x27;d give it a try and I was super excited to receive them. this came a month and 4 days later..&lt;br /&gt;I tried using them and they are horrible. they are just like glitter pens and when you apply them to you nails, they last a few minutes. total waist of money. I BEG YOU DO NOT BUY THESE</li>
            <li> Almost the 12 PCS are dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the black one is working OK...  It is very sad, i was waiting a lot.</li>
            <li> I think these are probably OK. I haven&#x27;t tried them and won&#x27;t be using them myself.  I ordered them a couple of weeks before Christmas to add to my gifts for my grandaughter.  No one told me they would be delivered FROM CHINA !!  They took too long to arrive - got them on December 27 -- too late for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These came in a container that didn&#x27;t close and was actually sliced open on the side.  We will keep them because I think they will work but I can tell that we paid way too much for this item.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these, until I tried to use them!  At least 4 (That I have tried so far) are completely unusable, they are all dried up &amp; all that comes out is a foamy residue!  The others work ok, but I am disappointed because the 4 that are unusable are the colors I use most!:((((</li>
            <li> These nail pens are wonderful!! I can do just about any design on my nails that I want! So smooth and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Was not what I thought it would be. It&#x27;s nail polish in tubes. Can&#x27;t do much with those. The directions were in CHINESE!</li>
            <li> Bought for 2 teenager girls but they didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift from a cousin. I absolutely LOVE them!&lt;br /&gt;It takes some practice, but once you get the hang of these, they&#x27;re great!&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t dry very fast, but it&#x27;s no biggy. The colors are bright and come out wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely re-purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> ALL of the nail polish was dried up and it had to be thrown away</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift which my wife enjoyed.  They go on in a fairly thick bead of about 1-2 mm, depending on how you apply it, giving it the 3D effect.  It dries a little tacky/rubbery.  If you cover with a top coat and can resist fondling your nails throughout the day it should last as long as standard finger nail polish.  Nail polish remover didn&#x27;t dissolve the product, it had to be scraped off with another fingernail or orange stick. Not difficult though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a couple weeks but was well within the estimated delivery date.  I&#x27;ve had things coming from China with much longer delivery times so no complaints about that, just plan ahead if you want to give this as a gift.  The instructions on the back of the package were in Chinese so your guess is as good as mine what they say.  My wife just squeezed a bead on where she wanted and waited about 3 minutes for it to dry then used a top coat.  It should work well for lines or dots....maybe let the layers build up and create architectural marvels.  Whatever your imagination leads you to.</li>
            <li> hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for this&lt;br /&gt;it is very usefull and neccessary to make all the nail art, are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;thanks in advace. love it.</li>
            <li> I love love love these, even though a thinner tip would be nice, these are just perfect, I can do even more nail designs than I could before</li>
            <li> Ordered this in December 2014 and received late January 2015 which was fine.  However, more than half of the pens are dried up.  Would not recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Never want it again...</li>
            <li> These work great. Arrived within the time period stated.</li>
    </ol>
