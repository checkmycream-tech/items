    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This works great!</li>
            <li>This has to be the best.</li>
            <li>it would be perfect ringlets after her hair was washed and combed but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect product for about 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product</li>
            <li>Best of all, there&#x27;s no sticky or greasy residue.</li>
            <li>This curl smoother smells delicious, however, it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li>If that is you - then this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful smell to it too.</li>

            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve also tried and loved but that was beyond my budget.</li>
            <li>My hair is obstinate and it did a good job with it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is the miracle product that I&#x27;ve been searching for (that makes my hair look good no matter how humid it is), but it worked well</li>
            <li>Dang, I thought this product might be good on my hair.</li>
            <li>i felt like i was just adding water that smelled good to my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells good not chemically.</li>
            <li>but it came good product for the price and nothing was leak.</li>
            <li>and I like hair products that smell good.  </li>
            <li>The result is perfect ringlets that actually stay perfect ringlets with no frizz and</li>
            <li>product is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>We both love the smell of the shea butter and honey, too!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair tanlge free.</li>
            <li>AMAZING stuff...</li>
            <li>I think this is a nice alternative to mousse.</li>
            <li>My frizz was tamed into nice ringlets.</li>
            <li>Her hair gets very frizzy without any product in it.the curl smoother makes her curls look perfect</li>
            <li>For the price and versatility I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is that the smell stays with you all day when you use it.  </li>
            <li>When your own mother asks, \\&quot;What the H*ll did you do to your hair?</li>
            <li>Anyway - despite loving how this product smells, I feel like it leaves my and my toddlers hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Her hair is very smooth and shiny afterwards, it smells WONDERFUL and her waves are very defined.</li>
            <li>My husband is all over the new hairdo, which (1) makes me wonder which woman in his life had curly hair, and (2) makes me very happy that he loves the hair I have</li>
            <li>so my hair has its own bipolar personality for sure.</li>
            <li>My kids have some very easily tangled hair and I am happy to report that this product works very well for detangling and keeping hair untangled.</li>
            <li>nice, easy to use product.</li>
            <li>that I love and is a consistency that I find better for my longer hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to purchase more of this product for both myself and my family.</li>
            <li>Both of my daughters have 3C/4C hair and it&#x27;s a challenge every day to get their hair looking healthy and well kept.  </li>
            <li>They love the way this smells, like they just washed their hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>turns back into perfect curls.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love just for me hair products.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and was overall very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve found it takes slightly more than a quarter-sized blob to cover my daughter&#x27;s mass of curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;re not going to throw this bottle away, but we won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li>Then again, maybe I should read a bit more about products.</li>
            <li>so this became for her more of a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>More Tangles cream</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and most of the time blow it out and flatiron.</li>
            <li>So most of the time, I just don&#x27;t put the effort in to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead, I&#x27;ve tried many products for curls.</li>
            <li>My hair behaves better in the humidity with this product and also works for combing out my hair when I get out of the pool before I have a chance to rewash it.</li>
            <li>I have instead been using it at night to add more moisture to my hair while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also curly in most spots.</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff, it Leaves my daughters curls looking healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>The fragrance will stay on my hair most of the day if I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love this curl smoother.  </li>
            <li>Love this for my son&#x27;s biracial hair and my hair as well.  </li>
            <li>I love their spray too.  </li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>But yeah love them and of course amazon for having everything i nee and more</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;One Bottle 6</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put much on top of my head.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>I think this is a pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>works great on my 1 year old&#x27;s curly hair!  </li>
            <li>works great in my 2 year old daughter hair</li>
            <li>It does smooth my 9 month-old daughter&#x27;s hair out so that it is more managable.</li>
            <li>It does wash fairly easily off my hands, unlike the curl perfecter</li>
            <li>product not only makes curls look BEAUTIFUL, it also helps detangle, leaving smooth and easy-to-manage hair.  </li>
            <li>Liked the way it was before, you have apply more product with this new one</li>
            <li>It smells very good and helps him feel a little better about his hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look greasy, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just healthy and shiny, not crunchy or hard, it is perfect!</li>
            <li>Both those products offered great control, but I wasn&#x27;t especially keen on how they felt and how dense they were when trying to work them into my hair.</li>
            <li>my Asian daughter, this is great.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how  tangle free my hair was.</li>
            <li>but I think this would be a great option for people with really curly hair - it would keep it so smooth and really bring out those curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather light, and somewhat sweet, but dissipates almost immediately so as to make it a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive tried a lot of products on my daughters unique hair.</li>
            <li>She has super fine hair like me</li>
            <li>I have unusual hair that is very fine but have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I am loving this new hair milk.</li>
            <li>product works great for people with curly hair who blow dry their hair.</li>
            <li>how but for me it holds my hair as if i put mousse or some super light holding products like that.</li>
            <li>Overall, it does its job and smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried because it&#x27;s light and actually works to organize the hair in a nice fluffy but non-frizzy way.</li>
            <li>Probably better results with other hair types, and smells good as always.  </li>
            <li>For most of my life, my hair was bone straight.</li>
            <li>love it, it really helps me a lot.</li>
            <li>hair milk styling cr√®me, and cheap is the right word.</li>
            <li>This is our go to for quick hair fixes.  </li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super curly (just wavy)</li>
            <li>Used this &#x60;curl smoother&#x27; on myself and my 6 year old, whos hair is far more curly then my own.  </li>
            <li>It has made such a difference she has asked me to order more!</li>
            <li>I have stick straight fine hair and my daughter somehow managed to get the curly haired gene that skipped two generations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light coconut smell that is pleasant and sweet, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>and shes tangle and knot free, smells great and her hair actually feels and looks different.</li>
            <li>On straight hair days, I just smooth it around sections of my hair in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then add another quarters worth to add on the ends.</li>
            <li>As the white mother of two biracial (black-white) girls, I will freely admit that the hair issue has been one of the most daunting aspects of parenthood for me.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this I thought it would be worth trying out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its naturally curly and beautiful but after a long nap or play day</li>
            <li>Worth trying out regardless of your ethnicity or the manufacturer&#x27;s marketing strategy.</li>
            <li>Love the scent &amp; makes my daughter&#x27;s hair so soft with bouncy curls</li>
            <li>I prefer a product called Soft &amp; Precious from a Tampa based company.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light, so light in fact, that I&#x27;ve been using the product for two weeks now, and at the end of a long day, I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly what it smelled like without going to the bottle and taking a whiff.</li>
            <li>the more it dried the more frizzies she would get.</li>
            <li>There were a few mornings that she must have tossed more during sleeping and her hair was more knotted and required either the Johnson &amp; Johnson spray conditioner or cream to get a tangle undone.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a fantastic deal, because you really don&#x27;t need much at all to have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks OK for the first 30 minutes and afterwards it looks more dried out.</li>
            <li>It goes on very much like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It left my daughters hair shiny (but not a greasy look), healthy and the curls are prettier than ever.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be using this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this that way first -</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It works wonders and I love this product its definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li>She gets lots of compliments on how pretty her hair looks.  </li>
            <li>First of all, let me start off by saying, I have 2C/3A hair.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to try different products because I prefer to have more than one or two products to turn to, in case either is discontinued, which can happen at any time.</li>
            <li>; and it just wouldn&#x27;t work for me; it goes on freshly washed hair better than it does on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>and I came to realize the only real way of using this was VERY lightly at the ends of our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is has a nice clean scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Like the other products in the line, this has an amazing smell.  </li>
            <li>others have noted, it&#x27;s pretty thin, which means it pours easily out of the bottle (a bit too easily perhaps) and spreads easily throughout the hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and mild not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>My own hair did seem less frizzy when I put this on in the morning after a shower.  </li>
            <li>The product comes in a large bottle and has a lotion like texture.</li>
            <li>First, let me be clear: the Just For Me product line is NOT for most white folks.</li>
            <li>My wife has the same problem and it makes her long wavy hair look great and feel so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve applied it to both wet and dry hair and have received great results with both.</li>
            <li>After going through several different products , I fell in love with just for me after one use!</li>
            <li>It works great for hair immediately after washing/conditioning, but once you blow dry it will leave a very wet appearance.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful for this product.</li>
            <li>Getting tangles out is much easier now.</li>
            <li>My hair was no longer straight, but very wavy after I washed it.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, like that skin milk brand.  </li>
            <li>Adjusting the amount used did not seem to help much</li>
            <li>It really bothered me every time I touched it.  </li>
            <li>It really defines my two year olds curls.  </li>
            <li>I do not like it, but I would recommend each individual try it for themselves and not base their decision to try it, off of what someone else says.  </li>
            <li>In One&amp;#34; except, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it</li>
            <li>I can use this on both straight hair days and curly hair days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really concentrate on the ends, and on the shorter hair pieces around my face.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I really like that product.</li>
            <li>The product absorbs nicely without leaving a heavy, glossy residue that can sometimes weigh hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has almost the exact same consistency, but you definitely get a better price.</li>
            <li>and the next morning could usually just spritz with water and comb through smoothly again and her hair retained a nice curl without frizz.  </li>
            <li>I can let my hair air dry and get lovely natural curls, or I can pull it back in a ponytail and get a smooth look that doesn&#x27;t make me freak out when I see myself in a mirror at the end of the day wondering why nobody said anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So tou only need a quarter worth first to start.</li>
            <li>I live near the ocean, and even on the most humid days, my hair stays loose and pretty, not frizzy and out of control.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves this line and I like her using these products as opposed to mine as they&#x27;re made for kids, which makes her feel extra special.  </li>
            <li>She has very fine hair with a little bit of wave to it.</li>
            <li>It is very nice-smelling (but not too strong, just mild-scented) and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or hair/crunchy like other products do.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s less dense than the pomade, making it more spreadable).</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to any mother who is trying to keep their child&#x27;s hair as healthy as possible, this is a must buy !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly notice a fragrance one way or another, but my daughter says she likes the smell.  </li>
            <li>Mainly from trying to brush out the tangles she gets from her hair type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair</li>
            <li>her hair was much smoother but still soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This curl smoother is a FANTASTIC investment for the low, low price!  </li>
            <li>As a result, I know how to care for straight hair and only straight hair.</li>
            <li>When you think if conditioner you think of thick, rick product that leaves your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This product smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really light, unlike other products that feel very heavy and weigh down my curls.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My daughter has extremely curly hair that looks beautiful when its wet, but looks life a big afro puff when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I am going back to the hair milk styling cr√®me, it has a thicker consistency, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it and it works.</li>
            <li>carseat(she is 1 year old)</li>
            <li>and that is really important if you&#x27;re not shampooing everyday.</li>
            <li>My daughter has naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Not only has it tamed the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;, it has made her hair much easier to brush.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s easier to just straighten my hair than try to let it go naturally curly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and soft but so manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and silky, and it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t just for children - I like it just as well on my adult hair.</li>
            <li>This product provides a light hold for curls without the stickiness like so many other products leave behind.  </li>
            <li>The smoother goes in quickly and smooths hair down without leaving it sticky or greasy-looking.  </li>
            <li>It went on great, long as my hair was wet, however, when my hair dried, it was soft, but it was extremely dry and frizzy looking.  </li>
            <li>mix a little with water in a spray bottle for quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews said that this product was greasy, and it is a greasy product on your hands, but because my hair is so dry and thirst for oil and moisture, the greasiness didn&#x27;t really bother me any.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But the long and short of it is that it doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I am a mixed raced adult...</li>
            <li>and it was barely doing the trick.</li>
            <li>I know not one thing about caring for curly hair, and after I try to style it, it looks like I barely escaped electrocution.</li>
            <li>But, I don&#x27;t really care for the wet hair it creates.</li>
            <li>I got this to make her little waves at the end be more defined and less scragly</li>
            <li>I rarely blow dry my hair instead scruching it while wet and adding some product.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick, curly hair that tends to frizz when left to dry on its own.  </li>
            <li>This product does make her hair feel a little crunchy, but it does hold up well throughout the day and makes her curls look really pretty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on kiddo&#x27;s hair and isn&#x27;t harsh smelling or stiffens the hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Then again, I do with almost all other products, so it was perhaps too much to expect that this would work any differently.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and tends to get a little frizzy when it is hot and humid outside, so I like the way</li>
            <li>This particular Smoother is a but greasier than others of this brand, and we&#x27;ve had to use the smallest amount to work through it, but it still feels heavier on my 7 year old straight, thin locks.  </li>
            <li>He likes to use it himself and it took some training to get him not to use too much because if he puts too much in it is a mess.</li>
            <li>One of my daughters has tight, ringlet, very curly hair...</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this might not offer much moisture to those who need it for dry, brittle curls I found that putting this on my daughter&#x27;s wet hair after a bath made it significantly smoother when it dried and a lot less troublesome to brush/comb.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This works great!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best.</li>
            <li> it would be perfect ringlets after her hair was washed and combed but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect product for about 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product</li>
            <li> Best of all, there&#x27;s no sticky or greasy residue.</li>
            <li> This curl smoother smells delicious, however, it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li> If that is you - then this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful smell to it too.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients!</li>
            <li> However, it does smell good, to anyone thinking about getting it!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s good to go!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great, great stuff.</li>
            <li> but i did and its amazing!</li>
            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve also tried and loved but that was beyond my budget.</li>
            <li> My hair is obstinate and it did a good job with it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is the miracle product that I&#x27;ve been searching for (that makes my hair look good no matter how humid it is), but it worked well</li>
            <li> Dang, I thought this product might be good on my hair.</li>
            <li> i felt like i was just adding water that smelled good to my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells good not chemically.</li>
            <li> but it came good product for the price and nothing was leak.</li>
            <li> and I like hair products that smell good.  </li>
            <li> The result is perfect ringlets that actually stay perfect ringlets with no frizz and</li>
            <li> product is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> We both love the smell of the shea butter and honey, too!</li>
            <li> fell in love with this after the 1st time I used it!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I was looking for so completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair tanlge free.</li>
            <li> AMAZING stuff...</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice alternative to mousse.</li>
            <li> My frizz was tamed into nice ringlets.</li>
            <li> Her hair gets very frizzy without any product in it.the curl smoother makes her curls look perfect</li>
            <li> For the price and versatility I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is that the smell stays with you all day when you use it.  </li>
            <li> When your own mother asks, \\&quot;What the H*ll did you do to your hair?</li>
            <li> Anyway - despite loving how this product smells, I feel like it leaves my and my toddlers hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Her hair is very smooth and shiny afterwards, it smells WONDERFUL and her waves are very defined.</li>
            <li> My husband is all over the new hairdo, which (1) makes me wonder which woman in his life had curly hair, and (2) makes me very happy that he loves the hair I have</li>
            <li> so my hair has its own bipolar personality for sure.</li>
            <li> My kids have some very easily tangled hair and I am happy to report that this product works very well for detangling and keeping hair untangled.</li>
            <li> nice, easy to use product.</li>
            <li> that I love and is a consistency that I find better for my longer hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to purchase more of this product for both myself and my family.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters have 3C/4C hair and it&#x27;s a challenge every day to get their hair looking healthy and well kept.  </li>
            <li> They love the way this smells, like they just washed their hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> turns back into perfect curls.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love just for me hair products.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and was overall very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve found it takes slightly more than a quarter-sized blob to cover my daughter&#x27;s mass of curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We&#x27;re not going to throw this bottle away, but we won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> Then again, maybe I should read a bit more about products.</li>
            <li> so this became for her more of a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> More Tangles cream</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and most of the time blow it out and flatiron.</li>
            <li> So most of the time, I just don&#x27;t put the effort in to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead, I&#x27;ve tried many products for curls.</li>
            <li> My hair behaves better in the humidity with this product and also works for combing out my hair when I get out of the pool before I have a chance to rewash it.</li>
            <li> I have instead been using it at night to add more moisture to my hair while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also curly in most spots.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff, it Leaves my daughters curls looking healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> The fragrance will stay on my hair most of the day if I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this curl smoother.  </li>
            <li> Love this for my son&#x27;s biracial hair and my hair as well.  </li>
            <li> I love their spray too.  </li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> But yeah love them and of course amazon for having everything i nee and more</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair feel.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;One Bottle 6</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put much on top of my head.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> works great on my 1 year old&#x27;s curly hair!  </li>
            <li> works great in my 2 year old daughter hair</li>
            <li> It does smooth my 9 month-old daughter&#x27;s hair out so that it is more managable.</li>
            <li> It does wash fairly easily off my hands, unlike the curl perfecter</li>
            <li> product not only makes curls look BEAUTIFUL, it also helps detangle, leaving smooth and easy-to-manage hair.  </li>
            <li> Liked the way it was before, you have apply more product with this new one</li>
            <li> It smells very good and helps him feel a little better about his hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look greasy, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just healthy and shiny, not crunchy or hard, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Both those products offered great control, but I wasn&#x27;t especially keen on how they felt and how dense they were when trying to work them into my hair.</li>
            <li> my Asian daughter, this is great.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how  tangle free my hair was.</li>
            <li> but I think this would be a great option for people with really curly hair - it would keep it so smooth and really bring out those curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather light, and somewhat sweet, but dissipates almost immediately so as to make it a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive tried a lot of products on my daughters unique hair.</li>
            <li> She has super fine hair like me</li>
            <li> I have unusual hair that is very fine but have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I am loving this new hair milk.</li>
            <li> product works great for people with curly hair who blow dry their hair.</li>
            <li> how but for me it holds my hair as if i put mousse or some super light holding products like that.</li>
            <li> Overall, it does its job and smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried because it&#x27;s light and actually works to organize the hair in a nice fluffy but non-frizzy way.</li>
            <li> Probably better results with other hair types, and smells good as always.  </li>
            <li> For most of my life, my hair was bone straight.</li>
            <li> love it, it really helps me a lot.</li>
            <li> hair milk styling cr√®me, and cheap is the right word.</li>
            <li> This is our go to for quick hair fixes.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super curly (just wavy)</li>
            <li> Used this &#x60;curl smoother&#x27; on myself and my 6 year old, whos hair is far more curly then my own.  </li>
            <li> It has made such a difference she has asked me to order more!</li>
            <li> I have stick straight fine hair and my daughter somehow managed to get the curly haired gene that skipped two generations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light coconut smell that is pleasant and sweet, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> and shes tangle and knot free, smells great and her hair actually feels and looks different.</li>
            <li> On straight hair days, I just smooth it around sections of my hair in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then add another quarters worth to add on the ends.</li>
            <li> As the white mother of two biracial (black-white) girls, I will freely admit that the hair issue has been one of the most daunting aspects of parenthood for me.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this I thought it would be worth trying out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its naturally curly and beautiful but after a long nap or play day</li>
            <li> Worth trying out regardless of your ethnicity or the manufacturer&#x27;s marketing strategy.</li>
            <li> Love the scent &amp; makes my daughter&#x27;s hair so soft with bouncy curls</li>
            <li> I prefer a product called Soft &amp; Precious from a Tampa based company.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light, so light in fact, that I&#x27;ve been using the product for two weeks now, and at the end of a long day, I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly what it smelled like without going to the bottle and taking a whiff.</li>
            <li> the more it dried the more frizzies she would get.</li>
            <li> There were a few mornings that she must have tossed more during sleeping and her hair was more knotted and required either the Johnson &amp; Johnson spray conditioner or cream to get a tangle undone.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a fantastic deal, because you really don&#x27;t need much at all to have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks OK for the first 30 minutes and afterwards it looks more dried out.</li>
            <li> It goes on very much like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It left my daughters hair shiny (but not a greasy look), healthy and the curls are prettier than ever.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be using this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this that way first -</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders and I love this product its definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> She gets lots of compliments on how pretty her hair looks.  </li>
            <li> First of all, let me start off by saying, I have 2C/3A hair.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to try different products because I prefer to have more than one or two products to turn to, in case either is discontinued, which can happen at any time.</li>
            <li> ; and it just wouldn&#x27;t work for me; it goes on freshly washed hair better than it does on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> and I came to realize the only real way of using this was VERY lightly at the ends of our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is has a nice clean scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Like the other products in the line, this has an amazing smell.  </li>
            <li> others have noted, it&#x27;s pretty thin, which means it pours easily out of the bottle (a bit too easily perhaps) and spreads easily throughout the hair.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and mild not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> My own hair did seem less frizzy when I put this on in the morning after a shower.  </li>
            <li> The product comes in a large bottle and has a lotion like texture.</li>
            <li> First, let me be clear: the Just For Me product line is NOT for most white folks.</li>
            <li> My wife has the same problem and it makes her long wavy hair look great and feel so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied it to both wet and dry hair and have received great results with both.</li>
            <li> After going through several different products , I fell in love with just for me after one use!</li>
            <li> It works great for hair immediately after washing/conditioning, but once you blow dry it will leave a very wet appearance.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful for this product.</li>
            <li> Getting tangles out is much easier now.</li>
            <li> My hair was no longer straight, but very wavy after I washed it.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, like that skin milk brand.  </li>
            <li> Adjusting the amount used did not seem to help much</li>
            <li> It really bothered me every time I touched it.  </li>
            <li> It really defines my two year olds curls.  </li>
            <li> I do not like it, but I would recommend each individual try it for themselves and not base their decision to try it, off of what someone else says.  </li>
            <li> In One&amp;#34; except, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it</li>
            <li> I can use this on both straight hair days and curly hair days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really concentrate on the ends, and on the shorter hair pieces around my face.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I really like that product.</li>
            <li> The product absorbs nicely without leaving a heavy, glossy residue that can sometimes weigh hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has almost the exact same consistency, but you definitely get a better price.</li>
            <li> and the next morning could usually just spritz with water and comb through smoothly again and her hair retained a nice curl without frizz.  </li>
            <li> I can let my hair air dry and get lovely natural curls, or I can pull it back in a ponytail and get a smooth look that doesn&#x27;t make me freak out when I see myself in a mirror at the end of the day wondering why nobody said anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So tou only need a quarter worth first to start.</li>
            <li> I live near the ocean, and even on the most humid days, my hair stays loose and pretty, not frizzy and out of control.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves this line and I like her using these products as opposed to mine as they&#x27;re made for kids, which makes her feel extra special.  </li>
            <li> She has very fine hair with a little bit of wave to it.</li>
            <li> It is very nice-smelling (but not too strong, just mild-scented) and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or hair/crunchy like other products do.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s less dense than the pomade, making it more spreadable).</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to any mother who is trying to keep their child&#x27;s hair as healthy as possible, this is a must buy !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly notice a fragrance one way or another, but my daughter says she likes the smell.  </li>
            <li> Mainly from trying to brush out the tangles she gets from her hair type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair</li>
            <li> her hair was much smoother but still soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This curl smoother is a FANTASTIC investment for the low, low price!  </li>
            <li> As a result, I know how to care for straight hair and only straight hair.</li>
            <li> When you think if conditioner you think of thick, rick product that leaves your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really light, unlike other products that feel very heavy and weigh down my curls.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly hair that looks beautiful when its wet, but looks life a big afro puff when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I am going back to the hair milk styling cr√®me, it has a thicker consistency, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it and it works.</li>
            <li> carseat(she is 1 year old)</li>
            <li> and that is really important if you&#x27;re not shampooing everyday.</li>
            <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not only has it tamed the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;, it has made her hair much easier to brush.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s easier to just straighten my hair than try to let it go naturally curly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and soft but so manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and silky, and it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t just for children - I like it just as well on my adult hair.</li>
            <li> This product provides a light hold for curls without the stickiness like so many other products leave behind.  </li>
            <li> The smoother goes in quickly and smooths hair down without leaving it sticky or greasy-looking.  </li>
            <li> It went on great, long as my hair was wet, however, when my hair dried, it was soft, but it was extremely dry and frizzy looking.  </li>
            <li> mix a little with water in a spray bottle for quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews said that this product was greasy, and it is a greasy product on your hands, but because my hair is so dry and thirst for oil and moisture, the greasiness didn&#x27;t really bother me any.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But the long and short of it is that it doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> I am a mixed raced adult...</li>
            <li> and it was barely doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I know not one thing about caring for curly hair, and after I try to style it, it looks like I barely escaped electrocution.</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t really care for the wet hair it creates.</li>
            <li> I got this to make her little waves at the end be more defined and less scragly</li>
            <li> I rarely blow dry my hair instead scruching it while wet and adding some product.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that tends to frizz when left to dry on its own.  </li>
            <li> This product does make her hair feel a little crunchy, but it does hold up well throughout the day and makes her curls look really pretty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on kiddo&#x27;s hair and isn&#x27;t harsh smelling or stiffens the hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Then again, I do with almost all other products, so it was perhaps too much to expect that this would work any differently.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and tends to get a little frizzy when it is hot and humid outside, so I like the way</li>
            <li> This particular Smoother is a but greasier than others of this brand, and we&#x27;ve had to use the smallest amount to work through it, but it still feels heavier on my 7 year old straight, thin locks.  </li>
            <li> He likes to use it himself and it took some training to get him not to use too much because if he puts too much in it is a mess.</li>
            <li> One of my daughters has tight, ringlet, very curly hair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this might not offer much moisture to those who need it for dry, brittle curls I found that putting this on my daughter&#x27;s wet hair after a bath made it significantly smoother when it dried and a lot less troublesome to brush/comb.</li>
            <li> for normal hair, I give it a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> As a woman in my mid-thirties, I feel like the bottle itself is a little \\&quot;kiddish\\&quot;, and that may be the main target demographic for this product, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> So far, when using the bottle almost every day, it still has a half bottle left after a month!  </li>
            <li> No More Tangles Shampoo/Conditioner, Straight Hair, 13-fluid Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]], and have the spray around as well.  </li>
            <li> I have biracial girls with long curly hair and this stuff didn&#x27;t even work on my baby&#x27;s short hair.</li>
            <li> Still, I am looking for a good product for both my and my daughter&#x27;s hair that can tame frizzies without feeling dirty or breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> might* work if your hair is very dry or coarse, but</li>
            <li> The only complaint is it is not on amazon for a decent price</li>
            <li> I have long frizzy,dry,and curly hair.</li>
            <li> In the short run, it leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair looking slightly wet and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> I only wet my hair when I wash it, every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> If I want to have looser waves, this works well with wet hair as my only styling product, but I prefer using it on dry</li>
            <li> It feels a bit greasy on my hands, but no moreso than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I saturate my hair with my staple products when I wash it, but when I maintain it, I only need a dime size every other day.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I&#x27;ve had a hard time controlling for my entire life.  </li>
            <li> but it works immediately on dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> After her bath I towel dry her hair and put about a nickle size amount in my hands and rub it all over her damp hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s dry curls.</li>
            <li> So tried using it an blow drying my hair - it did work, but there is no way I&#x27;m going to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Just for me hair milk detangler and leave in conditioner is all I use in my daughters hair then air dry.</li>
            <li> My staple products can be applied even on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not thrilled with using this on wet hair - it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything when used that way, unless I scrunch it in and then strictly leave my hair alone when dry</li>
            <li> I now have the loose, long curls that I wanted all those years ago when I had the permanent wave disasters!</li>
            <li> For reference, I have dark Caucasian hair of middle texture and thickness, with a tendency for waviness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her hair has medium size loose curls.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I like to let dry by itself so, this helps to tone it down a little so its not so frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i do use other hair cleaning products especially head&amp;shoulders because little fluffly white flakes are a struggle i&#x27;ve had for some reason this year way before i bought these.</li>
            <li> Just For Me texturizer treatment, and omg i am so annoyed i didn&#x27;t do it earlier in life (like throughout high school and beginning of college)</li>
            <li> I have very dry, curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> But in summertime with the pool, humidity, and overall frizz factor, it becomes impossible to keep my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> i dont need to add 3 and 4 different products to my daughters hair anymore, just a little of this stuff</li>
            <li> This has been a huge help for my sons crazy curls.</li>
            <li> The Just for Me worked just as well, put it in her wet her the night before</li>
            <li> I have tried it on wet hair also</li>
            <li> suppose it is supposed to be heavy, but it is not something I will be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> Even though I used a TINY amount, my hair looked limp and felt greasy.  </li>
            <li> Overall if you have frizzy hair this will help tame it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is half Dominican &amp; half Italian.</li>
            <li> When I add it to my dry hair, it tames down the frizzies without making it sticky or greasy-looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other</li>
            <li> My son has thick curly hair and it can be very dry especially during the warmer seasons this helps with moisturizing, and curl definition.</li>
            <li> it gets tangled and a little rough.</li>
            <li> and you have to be very careful that you don&#x27;t pour half the bottle out onto your palm.</li>
            <li> For example, I am not someone that wet my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> The product is like a watered down body lotion in texture</li>
            <li> Its not greasy and does not weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> Not knowing what would work well for her curls that wouldn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy, I decided to give this product a try</li>
            <li> plus, after a nap or sleep her hair becomes a ratty mess.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been pretty desperate.</li>
            <li> my mother used to use this on me when i was little</li>
            <li> It brought out the waviness of my hair when used on damp hair and then air dried.</li>
            <li> But a few years ago, I noticed a change in my hair (besides the unwanted approach of gray).</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells heavily of coconut.  </li>
            <li> After my hair dried, I tried to apply the &amp;#34;Just</li>
            <li> This is a thinner liquid, not creamy or as thick as other &amp;#34;milks&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, but I can&#x27;t use a lot of hair products that are too heavy, because it weighs my hair down and makes it look greasy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a curly mess!</li>
            <li> I have been using these products on my thin curly ethnic hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re having trouble with your curls, PLEASE check this product out!</li>
            <li> I used this product on damp hair as directed and styled as usual.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or hard drying like some hair gels.</li>
            <li> would say that this product is at least on par with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d honestly never know there was product in her hair</li>
            <li> It goes on thick .</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> My daughter is black/white and has thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> My elder daughter has thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Recommended in small doses!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as bad when I use this in her hair and when I get her out of the car all I have to do is take a damp rag over the back of her hair and the brillo pad</li>
            <li> I am always in the market for something that controls my daughters&#x27; curls (the worst possible combination of my husband&#x27;s tight curls and my wavy, crazy, frizzy hair).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and runny</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to hair products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I guess this is supposed to be a cheaper version of the just for me hair milk styling cr√®me, and cheap is the right word. I have biracial girls with long curly hair and this stuff didn&#x27;t even work on my baby&#x27;s short hair. It&#x27;s very thin and runny and you have to be very careful that you don&#x27;t pour half the bottle out onto your palm. I am going back to the hair milk styling cr√®me, it has a thicker consistency, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it and it works. The only complaint is it is not on amazon for a decent price but it is on soap.com for $4.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful for this product. My daughter has extremely curly hair that looks beautiful when its wet, but looks life a big afro puff when it&#x27;s dry. This didn&#x27;t do anything to &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; her curls at all., even in conjunction with their detangler. Her strands became frizzy at the ends.</li>
            <li> This works well for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very fine hair with a little bit of wave to it. I got this to make her little waves at the end be more defined and less scragly plus, after a nap or sleep her hair becomes a ratty mess. This works great! Her hair is very smooth and shiny afterwards, it smells WONDERFUL and her waves are very defined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other Just For Me hair products ([[ASIN:B003U4LI7W Just For Me Hair Milk Smoothing Edges Cr√®me, 4-Ounce Container]] and [[ASIN:B002MOBZSS Just For Me Hair Milk Styling Creme, 8-Ounce Bottle]]). Both those products offered great control, but I wasn&#x27;t especially keen on how they felt and how dense they were when trying to work them into my hair. In fact, they felt somewhat greasy. Still, I am looking for a good product for both my and my daughter&#x27;s hair that can tame frizzies without feeling dirty or breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty awesome. It goes on very much like the [[ASIN:B00AE07H0M Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Elixir, 0.94 Ounce]] that I&#x27;ve also tried and loved but that was beyond my budget. This product has almost the exact same consistency, but you definitely get a better price. The scent is very light, so light in fact, that I&#x27;ve been using the product for two weeks now, and at the end of a long day, I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly what it smelled like without going to the bottle and taking a whiff. It&#x27;s rather light, and somewhat sweet, but dissipates almost immediately so as to make it a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied it to both wet and dry hair and have received great results with both. I can let my hair air dry and get lovely natural curls, or I can pull it back in a ponytail and get a smooth look that doesn&#x27;t make me freak out when I see myself in a mirror at the end of the day wondering why nobody said anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this product is at least on par with the [[ASIN:B004G91LAO Got2b Playful Texturizing Cr√®me Pomade, 2-Ounce (Pack of 2)]] that I love and is a consistency that I find better for my longer hair (it&#x27;s less dense than the pomade, making it more spreadable). I&#x27;m planning to purchase more of this product for both myself and my family.</li>
            <li> This is our go to for quick hair fixes.  The product is like a watered down body lotion in texture but it works immediately on dry, frizzy hair.  Both of my daughters have 3C/4C hair and it&#x27;s a challenge every day to get their hair looking healthy and well kept.  They love the way this smells, like they just washed their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix a little with water in a spray bottle for quick touch ups.  We haven&#x27;t noticed any product build up in their hair.</li>
            <li> This product provides a light hold for curls without the stickiness like so many other products leave behind.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave that shellac look and feel that you get from gels.  My hair is obstinate and it did a good job with it.  I gave it four stars because I would like it to control poofing.  It is has a nice clean scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product. It brought out the waviness of my hair when used on damp hair and then air dried. It is very nice-smelling (but not too strong, just mild-scented) and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or hair/crunchy like other products do. I think this is a nice alternative to mousse. My hair isn&#x27;t super curly (just wavy) but I think this would be a great option for people with really curly hair - it would keep it so smooth and really bring out those curls. Nice product!</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and tends to get a little frizzy when it is hot and humid outside, so I like the way Just For Me Hair Milk makes it keeps the dreaded frizz at bay.  My wife has the same problem and it makes her long wavy hair look great and feel so soft. We both love the smell of the shea butter and honey, too!</li>
            <li> I am a mixed raced adult...I think this product is aimed at children. I have long frizzy,dry,and curly hair. The product comes in a large bottle and has a lotion like texture. The scent is nice and mild not overwhelming at all. Its not greasy and does not weigh the hair down. I didn&#x27;t find that it made my hair \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; It tamed and moisturized my hair. My frizz was tamed into nice ringlets. I found that the effect lasted all day. Overall if you have frizzy hair this will help tame it.</li>
            <li> I am loving this new hair milk. I have been using these products on my thin curly ethnic hair for a long time. This has to be the best. It goes on thick . So tou only need a quarter worth first to start. Then add another quarters worth to add on the ends. Use you fingers so that this will go on evenly. . Keeps my curls intact without leaving a greasy residue when it dries. Smells great and leaves my hair tanlge free. Not just only for kids.</li>
            <li> One of my daughters has tight, ringlet, very curly hair...it would be perfect ringlets after her hair was washed and combed but the more it dried the more frizzies she would get. Also anytime she got out of her carseat(she is 1 year old) her hair would be frizzy and the back that rubbed the carseat would be a tangled mess-fuzz ball(like a brillo pad)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with this after the 1st time I used it! After her bath I towel dry her hair and put about a nickle size amount in my hands and rub it all over her damp hair. Then I comb her hair again and brush my fingers through her hair to loosen it up. The result is perfect ringlets that actually stay perfect ringlets with no frizz and it is shiny too. It doesn&#x27;t look greasy, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just healthy and shiny, not crunchy or hard, it is perfect! Now my daughter still gets the brillo pad knot from her car seat but it isn&#x27;t as bad when I use this in her hair and when I get her out of the car all I have to do is take a damp rag over the back of her hair and the brillo pad turns back into perfect curls.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My daughter is half Dominican &amp; half Italian. Her hair gets very frizzy without any product in it.the curl smoother makes her curls look perfect &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy or thick. When it dries you can&#x27;t even tell there is product on the hair. I will never use anything else on her hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love just for me hair products. I&#x27;d been looking for a shampoo and moisturizer to help keep the curl pattern of my daughters hair. After going through several different products , I fell in love with just for me after one use! It left my daughters hair shiny (but not a greasy look), healthy and the curls are prettier than ever. I would definitely recommend this to any mother who is trying to keep their child&#x27;s hair as healthy as possible, this is a must buy !</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I&#x27;ve had a hard time controlling for my entire life.  I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect product for about 30 years.  I tried this product and was overall very happy with it.  I don&#x27;t think it is the miracle product that I&#x27;ve been searching for (that makes my hair look good no matter how humid it is), but it worked well and I will continue to use it regularly as I continue my search.  This product smells great, and leaves my hair feeling really light, unlike other products that feel very heavy and weigh down my curls.  As a woman in my mid-thirties, I feel like the bottle itself is a little \\&quot;kiddish\\&quot;, and that may be the main target demographic for this product, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ll just keep doing what works.</li>
            <li> As the white mother of two biracial (black-white) girls, I will freely admit that the hair issue has been one of the most daunting aspects of parenthood for me.  I am always in the market for something that controls my daughters&#x27; curls (the worst possible combination of my husband&#x27;s tight curls and my wavy, crazy, frizzy hair).  When I saw this I thought it would be worth trying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product instructions say to use an \\&quot;adequate\\&quot; amount of the product on damp hair, but they neglect to say what constitutes \\&quot;adequate\\&quot;.  Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve found it takes slightly more than a quarter-sized blob to cover my daughter&#x27;s mass of curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, it&#x27;s pretty thin, which means it pours easily out of the bottle (a bit too easily perhaps) and spreads easily throughout the hair.  I don&#x27;t particularly notice a fragrance one way or another, but my daughter says she likes the smell.  It feels a bit greasy on my hands, but no moreso than other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  It does wash fairly easily off my hands, unlike the curl perfecter which we also tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the long and short of it is that it doesn&#x27;t do much.  In the short run, it leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair looking slightly wet and conditioned.  As the wetness dries, it controls frizz for a short time, but by the time my daughter comes home from school, or even a short play date at the park, her hair is every bit as frizzy and out of control as it ever is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re not going to throw this bottle away, but we won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> Dang, I thought this product might be good on my hair. But it wasn&#x27;t. Then again, maybe I should read a bit more about products. I am Caucasian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said I think. Whoops! However, it does smell good, to anyone thinking about getting it!</li>
            <li> Ive tried a lot of products on my daughters unique hair. its naturally curly and beautiful but after a long nap or play day it gets tangled and a little rough. I had been using the just for me &#x27;hair milk&#x27; products and it was barely doing the trick. i felt like i was just adding water that smelled good to my daughters hair.  this is Miracles in a tiny bottle. i dont need to add 3 and 4 different products to my daughters hair anymore, just a little of this stuff and shes tangle and knot free, smells great and her hair actually feels and looks different. AMAZING stuff...this is a MUST BUY!!!</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOVE this! If you have kids with curls, this is a terrific product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product but somehow i noticed they changed the formula. Liked the way it was before, you have apply more product with this new one</li>
            <li> Used this &#x60;curl smoother&#x27; on myself and my 6 year old, whos hair is far more curly then my own.  My own hair did seem less frizzy when I put this on in the morning after a shower.  My daughter is still taking her baths at night so this became for her more of a leave in conditioner.  We had used the Johnson &amp; Johnsons 5oz No More Tangles cream [[ASIN:B003D7LDP8 Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo No More Tangles Shampoo/Conditioner, Straight Hair, 13-fluid Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]], and have the spray around as well.  The Just for Me worked just as well, put it in her wet her the night before and the next morning could usually just spritz with water and comb through smoothly again and her hair retained a nice curl without frizz.  There were a few mornings that she must have tossed more during sleeping and her hair was more knotted and required either the Johnson &amp; Johnson spray conditioner or cream to get a tangle undone. For the price and versatility I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> This product is probably intended for African-American hair types but I&#x27;ve been pretty desperate. I have stick straight fine hair and my daughter somehow managed to get the curly haired gene that skipped two generations. She has super fine hair like me but it&#x27;s a curly mess! Not knowing what would work well for her curls that wouldn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy, I decided to give this product a try and it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this might not offer much moisture to those who need it for dry, brittle curls I found that putting this on my daughter&#x27;s wet hair after a bath made it significantly smoother when it dried and a lot less troublesome to brush/comb. Best of all, there&#x27;s no sticky or greasy residue. You&#x27;d honestly never know there was product in her hair and that is really important if you&#x27;re not shampooing everyday. I will most definitely be using this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for all curly hair types!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this line and I like her using these products as opposed to mine as they&#x27;re made for kids, which makes her feel extra special.  This particular Smoother is a but greasier than others of this brand, and we&#x27;ve had to use the smallest amount to work through it, but it still feels heavier on my 7 year old straight, thin locks.  Probably better results with other hair types, and smells good as always.  Recommended in small doses!</li>
            <li> My sister is biracial and her hair is quite frizzy. After using the Just For Me Hair Milk Curl Smoother her hair was much smoother but still soft to the touch. I would order this item again.</li>
            <li> My kids have some very easily tangled hair and I am happy to report that this product works very well for detangling and keeping hair untangled. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair. Her hair has medium size loose curls. One of her biggest complaints is that her hair is frizzy all the time. Mainly from trying to brush out the tangles she gets from her hair type. She has been using the Curl Smoother for a couple of weeks and loves the difference it is making in her hair. Not only has it tamed the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;, it has made her hair much easier to brush. Getting tangles out is much easier now. It has made such a difference she has asked me to order more!</li>
            <li> First, let me be clear: the Just For Me product line is NOT for most white folks. I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my Asian daughter, this is great. I also use it sometimes for my African son and daughters, but it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for it to be my regular go to for them.</li>
            <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s dry curls. It looks OK for the first 30 minutes and afterwards it looks more dried out. I have tried it on wet hair also and I just believe it&#x27;s not for my son hair type.</li>
            <li> This curl smoother smells delicious, however, it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair. I still have a bit of frizz after using it. Then again, I do with almost all other products, so it was perhaps too much to expect that this would work any differently.</li>
            <li> This immediately softened my daughters 4C texture.  That&#x27;s all I was looking for so completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> This conditioner does the job but at the same time it&#x27;s too watery.  When you think if conditioner you think of thick, rick product that leaves your hair nice and soft. This is way too watery but it works for de tangling my daughters curly hair.</li>
            <li> works great on my 1 year old&#x27;s curly hair!  keeps it frizz-free.  after a snooze just use a bit of water and she&#x27;s good to go!  Smells good not chemically.</li>
            <li> This curl smoother is a FANTASTIC investment for the low, low price!  Especially if you&#x27;re doing subscribe &amp; save (which is only hitting at $4/bottle)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product not only makes curls look BEAUTIFUL, it also helps detangle, leaving smooth and easy-to-manage hair.  So far, when using the bottle almost every day, it still has a half bottle left after a month!  That&#x27;s a fantastic deal, because you really don&#x27;t need much at all to have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having trouble with your curls, PLEASE check this product out!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and most of the time blow it out and flatiron. But in summertime with the pool, humidity, and overall frizz factor, it becomes impossible to keep my hair smooth. So most of the time, I just don&#x27;t put the effort in to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I&#x27;ve tried many products for curls. This is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried because it&#x27;s light and actually works to organize the hair in a nice fluffy but non-frizzy way. My hair behaves better in the humidity with this product and also works for combing out my hair when I get out of the pool before I have a chance to rewash it. I don&#x27;t end up looking like a chrysanthemum post pool. The product absorbs nicely without leaving a heavy, glossy residue that can sometimes weigh hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice, easy to use product. Will definitely purchase this.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, curly/wavy hair.  I rarely blow dry my hair instead scruching it while wet and adding some product.  I tried this that way first - it did not work to keep my curls and left my hair feeling greasy.  So tried using it an blow drying my hair - it did work, but there is no way I&#x27;m going to blow dry my hair every because after day three I could feel my hair drying out. The nice thing is that the smell stays with you all day when you use it.  I have instead been using it at night to add more moisture to my hair while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great for people with curly hair who blow dry their hair. If that is not you I would try something else.  If that is you - then this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to hair products. I have unusual hair that is very fine but have a lot of it. It&#x27;s also curly in most spots. So it&#x27;s easier to just straighten my hair than try to let it go naturally curly. But this Just For Me Hair Milk Curl Smoother actually helps enhance my curls so I don&#x27;t have to straighten all the time. Love it! It&#x27;s lightweight and soft but so manageable. Great product!</li>
            <li> Just for me hair milk detangler and leave in conditioner is all I use in my daughters hair then air dry. I Love this stuff, it Leaves my daughters curls looking healthy and shiny. My daughter is black/white and has thick curly hair. This is all I have ever used on my 3 yr olds hair</li>
            <li> For most of my life, my hair was bone straight. As a result, I know how to care for straight hair and only straight hair. But a few years ago, I noticed a change in my hair (besides the unwanted approach of gray). My hair was no longer straight, but very wavy after I washed it. If the day was humid, the hair around my face curled. This was especially strange because my hair was nearly waist length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, after a \\&quot;trim\\&quot; that hacked eight inches of hair off my head, I discovered that I now have curly hair. I know not one thing about caring for curly hair, and after I try to style it, it looks like I barely escaped electrocution. When your own mother asks, \\&quot;What the H*ll did you do to your hair? It&#x27;s like you have shoulder length frizz,\\&quot; you know that you need to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally, this conditioner came in the mail. I don&#x27;t remember ordering it, but decided to give it a try anyway. WOW! Hooray! I now have the loose, long curls that I wanted all those years ago when I had the permanent wave disasters! My husband is all over the new hairdo, which (1) makes me wonder which woman in his life had curly hair, and (2) makes me very happy that he loves the hair I have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair with any hint of curl, give this conditioner a try. It encourages the curl in your hair to come out, but doesn&#x27;t let it become frizzy. I live near the ocean, and even on the most humid days, my hair stays loose and pretty, not frizzy and out of control.  Great, great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, but I can&#x27;t use a lot of hair products that are too heavy, because it weighs my hair down and makes it look greasy. This doesn&#x27;t do that. It makes my hair feel soft and silky, and it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy at all. This has a wonderful smell to it too. The fragrance will stay on my hair most of the day if I use it in the morning. I can still smell it in my hair at 7:00pm. I think this is a pretty good product for the price. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this curl smoother.  I have been using it to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; my hair during the day, since it tends to frizz out in the mid-afternoon, especially when there&#x27;s a thunderstorm on its way.  The smoother goes in quickly and smooths hair down without leaving it sticky or greasy-looking.  If I want to have looser waves, this works well with wet hair as my only styling product, but I prefer using it on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light coconut smell that is pleasant and sweet, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Like the other products in the line, this has an amazing smell.  Very creamy, like that skin milk brand.  Anyway - despite loving how this product smells, I feel like it leaves my and my toddlers hair greasy.  Adjusting the amount used did not seem to help much and I came to realize the only real way of using this was VERY lightly at the ends of our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it is supposed to be heavy, but it is not something I will be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> My elder daughter has thick, wavy hair.  She often complains that she&#x27;d like it to be straighter.  When we got an opportunity to try this product, we jumped at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well.  It relaxes the wave in her hair and helps to reduce tangling without looking greasy.  Overall, it does its job and smells pleasant.  Worth trying out regardless of your ethnicity or the manufacturer&#x27;s marketing strategy.</li>
            <li> works great in my 2 year old daughter hair</li>
            <li> My son has thick curly hair and it can be very dry especially during the warmer seasons this helps with moisturizing, and curl definition. It&#x27;s not sticky or hard drying like some hair gels. I also bought the moisturizer, and the detangling spray. I will be using this brand regularly for my son.</li>
            <li> I always like to have this as part of my hair products.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, it really helps me a lot.</li>
            <li> This has been a huge help for my sons crazy curls. It keeps his hair neat without being tacky and picking up dirt. It does not snarl and it can still be combed through. He likes to use it himself and it took some training to get him not to use too much because if he puts too much in it is a mess. It smells very good and helps him feel a little better about his hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that tends to frizz when left to dry on its own.  I used this product on damp hair as directed and styled as usual.  Blah.  Even though I used a TINY amount, my hair looked limp and felt greasy.  It really bothered me every time I touched it.  Plus, it smells heavily of coconut.  I think this *might* work if your hair is very dry or coarse, but for normal hair, I give it a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product from walmart yesterday and I tried it last night after I got done washing and conditioning my hair. I put this on my hair and waited a couple minutes before I blow dryed my hair I was amazed at how  tangle free my hair was. I also use this on my hair before I flat-iron it. It works wonders and I love this product its definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Love this for my son&#x27;s biracial hair and my hair as well.  I love their spray too.  It&#x27;s very gentle on kiddo&#x27;s hair and isn&#x27;t harsh smelling or stiffens the hair at all.  I have this on subscription and will continue to do so!  Just an FYI. This is a thinner liquid, not creamy or as thick as other &amp;#34;milks&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried.  But it works as well and can&#x27;t beat the price.  Great ingredients!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only stuff that makes my daughter&#x27;s hair manageable.works wonders!</li>
            <li> It works great for hair immediately after washing/conditioning, but once you blow dry it will leave a very wet appearance. Not recommended if you want to straighten your hair out after-the-fact.</li>
            <li> my mother used to use this on me when i was little and i bought it again recently idk why but i did and its amazing! idk how but for me it holds my hair as if i put mousse or some super light holding products like that. i also just recently did the Just For Me texturizer treatment, and omg i am so annoyed i didn&#x27;t do it earlier in life (like throughout high school and beginning of college) im Dominican, and Puerto Rican so my hair has its own bipolar personality for sure. and yep i also bought the shampoo and i love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do use other hair cleaning products especially head&amp;shoulders because little fluffly white flakes are a struggle i&#x27;ve had for some reason this year way before i bought these. But yeah love them and of course amazon for having everything i nee and more</li>
            <li> It took a while to get here but it came good product for the price and nothing was leak.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  It really defines my two year olds curls.  This product does make her hair feel a little crunchy, but it does hold up well throughout the day and makes her curls look really pretty.  She gets lots of compliments on how pretty her hair looks.  I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair feel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Walmart after reading some of the reviews on Amazon.  I decided to write a review based on my personal experience with this product.  I do not like it, but I would recommend each individual try it for themselves and not base their decision to try it, off of what someone else says.  First of all, let me start off by saying, I have 2C/3A hair.  I have two staple products that give me the results that I am looking for (&amp;#34;One Bottle 6 In One&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Curly Perm Activator Lotion,&amp;#34; which has been discontinued). I purchased the last case of the &amp;#34;Curly Perm Activator Lotion&amp;#34; a year ago and am beginning to run out of it.  I love the &amp;#34;One Bottle 6 In One&amp;#34; except, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it and I like hair products that smell good.  The &amp;#34;Just For Me Curl Smoother&amp;#34;  was applied after shampooing and conditioning my hair.  It went on great, long as my hair was wet, however, when my hair dried, it was soft, but it was extremely dry and frizzy looking.  Some reviews said that this product was greasy, and it is a greasy product on your hands, but because my hair is so dry and thirst for oil and moisture, the greasiness didn&#x27;t really bother me any.  In fact, my hair did not feel greasy at all.  In addition, for me, this product is not a maintenance product either.  For example, I am not someone that wet my hair everyday.  I only wet my hair when I wash it, every two weeks.  My staple products can be applied even on dry hair.  I saturate my hair with my staple products when I wash it, but when I maintain it, I only need a dime size every other day.  After my hair dried, I tried to apply the &amp;#34;Just For Me Curl Smoother&amp;#34; and it just wouldn&#x27;t work for me; it goes on freshly washed hair better than it does on dry hair.  I will continue to try different products because I prefer to have more than one or two products to turn to, in case either is discontinued, which can happen at any time.</li>
            <li> Love the scent &amp; makes my daughter&#x27;s hair so soft with bouncy curls</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I like to let dry by itself so, this helps to tone it down a little so its not so frizzy.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and texture of this creamy white hair &#x27;milk&#x27;. When I add it to my dry hair, it tames down the frizzies without making it sticky or greasy-looking. I can use this on both straight hair days and curly hair days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t just for children - I like it just as well on my adult hair. For reference, I have dark Caucasian hair of middle texture and thickness, with a tendency for waviness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it on dry hair:&lt;br /&gt;1. I pour a dollop into my hands, and rub my hands together.&lt;br /&gt;2. Starting at the ends, I work it into my hair and then work it up the hair shaft. I don&#x27;t put much on top of my head. I really concentrate on the ends, and on the shorter hair pieces around my face.&lt;br /&gt;3. On curly hair days, I scrunch the milk into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. On straight hair days, I just smooth it around sections of my hair in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not thrilled with using this on wet hair - it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything when used that way, unless I scrunch it in and then strictly leave my hair alone when dry: any further styling removes any benefit.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. It does smooth my 9 month-old daughter&#x27;s hair out so that it is more managable. But, I don&#x27;t really care for the wet hair it creates. It smells really nice. I prefer a product called Soft &amp; Precious from a Tampa based company. They have a creme that is not greasy. I really like that product. The only place I know that it can be ordered is from their website.</li>
