            <li>Otherwise GREAT 4.7</li>
            <li>But if you just want a great nail polish this is it.</li>
            <li>works great and love the colors!!</li>
            <li>While this set provides a very nice assortment of non-duplicated colors, I found the quality of the polishes to be a bit lacking.</li>
            <li>I love these polishes and the colors are great!</li>
            <li>so kool way better deal than a bottle for $7 GREAT DEAL!</li>
            <li>Seems to be a successful purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and they glow beautifully!</li>
            <li>the nail polish is ok but its not the best.</li>
            <li>Wonderful they all glow I&#x27;m enjoying</li>
            <li>Great value and my kids loved them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that bright either</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t let the bright colors deceive you.</li>
            <li>The bright colors don&#x27;t reflect the color of the polish when applied, or the color of the glow.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that they all glowed bright.</li>
            <li>the colors aren&#x27;t bright like they r in the pics</li>
            <li>Got for my daughter for Christmas, she loved it.</li>
            <li>A good buy for a dozen polishes.</li>
            <li>The girls at my daughter&#x27;s birthday party really loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>work good ass hell</li>
            <li>She has always loved her nails being painted</li>
            <li>This is a good product but, when you put it on it is to transparent and doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>It is good</li>
            <li>I got it on time so good .</li>
            <li>excellent and indoor room light also provides a sufficient glow.</li>
            <li>The Item was good  and is of quality.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them they are great good purchase.</li>
            <li>Really fun for Christmas and best used over another color.</li>
            <li>A very interesting mix of colors and blends for all occasion.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied will order again</li>
            <li>These are a great buy and totally worth your money!!</li>
            <li>This is the reason for bottom and top coat!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>i got it for them and they love the glow just like it is!</li>
            <li>real cool look good on lady friend</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s an amazing purchase</li>
            <li>After about 5 coats then it looks really nice.</li>
            <li>After adding a bit of my own polish they did work though.</li>
            <li>so I bought these for her (with mom&#x27;s supervision of course) so that she could have her own polish.  </li>
            <li>You will need 3 coats to get a nice glow.</li>
            <li>this would be a five star item if it wasn&#x27;t so transparent really nice though they glow</li>
            <li>I really liked these.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, great price, fast shipping, exactly as described!</li>
            <li>More variety would have been nice.</li>
            <li>So awesome the glow is very bright over light colored polish the design possibilities are endless</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and very fun.</li>
            <li>i love love love this!</li>
            <li>The most upsetting factor is that the polish peels off very easily.</li>
            <li>The colors are very very light...</li>
            <li>The nail Polish was very light</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, but not a product I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li>BTW, make sure to wear a bottom coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>My girls love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>It is according to her expectations and she is satisfied.  </li>

            <li>The persons I gave it to enjoyed</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed it</li>
            <li>Takes many coats to even show on your nails.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for anyone who loves doing they&#x27;re nails and adding spunk to them :)</li>
            <li>Had to put on more than 3 coats and was able to see some glow but not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the product</li>
            <li>I may buy more depends on how others goes,</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprisingly pleased with these polishes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Submitted some pictures, I should have added, the pictures show 2 coats with a top coat.2 coats with a top coat.</li>
            <li>Sure-</li>
            <li>Love the colors .its</li>
            <li>My grand daughter love them.</li>
            <li>the kids love how they do glow...</li>
            <li>but kids age :10-13 and 14 all love the glow..</li>
            <li>MORE</li>
            <li>I had to put so many layers on</li>
            <li>My roommate likes to wear them to raves and to the club when we go out, and kids love them.</li>
            <li>they can be worn alone some better than others but not as well as i had hoped.</li>
            <li>I love the colors.  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>You have to alpy to many coats to get the color</li>
            <li>I will for sure be buying more products from y&#x27;all</li>
            <li>very interesting and fun to work with</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure the girls will love it!</li>
            <li>cheap, you have to use 5 or 6 coats to make it look ok</li>
            <li>Just hold it under the light for 45 seconds after it dries, it glows better</li>
            <li>I still like it though it is cute if u want a light color on.</li>
            <li>My niece loved them, thank you so much for this product</li>
            <li>So they are a good product reasonable price and they do work</li>
            <li>She loved it but the polish is very thin/watery.  </li>
            <li>gf loved the whole package</li>
            <li>These polishes are cool and funky!</li>
            <li>Peels off easily.</li>
            <li>The company sent this product VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li>Peels off easily.</li>
            <li>AND MAKE THEM BREAK EASY</li>
            <li>recieved this material with a quickness, they are right on top of satisfying customers, have not used it, its a gift</li>
            <li>and they glow nice with all type of things pretty</li>
            <li>11 bottles were fine.</li>
            <li>my girls love this polish and fun to sniff.</li>
            <li>This was such a great price and it seemed to work well with a couple of coats.  </li>
            <li>I did not see this glow in the dark.its too light.</li>
            <li>Made really cheap.  </li>
            <li>and they say to hold you finger up to a light to get it to glow.</li>
            <li>you just have to hold your fingers up to a light.</li>
            <li>Glows bright and all the colors are perfectly clear that you can build the desired shade with.</li>
            <li>The longer you keep in light, the brighter they glow.  </li>
            <li>Sunlight, lamp light, anything to would do so if it doesn&#x27;t glow just read this hope it helps</li>
            <li>They cheerfully canceled the order for me, even though I didn&#x27;t realize my mistake for hours, so I could re-order the correct amount.</li>
            <li>These will make Halloween more fun &amp;</li>
            <li>My daughters enjoy these.</li>
            <li>NO YOU NEEDED TO PUT UNDER LIGHT MACHINE</li>
            <li>I enjoy the colors.</li>
            <li>We held all of them to the light to see the glow.</li>
            <li>Loved this kit as I was able to break it up and give several sets as gifts.</li>
            <li>the polish doesn&#x27;t dry good 3 nice cool color.....</li>
            <li>Great color selection too to match most of my other polish colors</li>
            <li>Very good if you live in an area with frequent power outages as you can use your hands to guide your way.  </li>
            <li>You can have fun with it at night!</li>
            <li>Really excited to wear each and every one.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive these</li>
            <li>, I was so excited for these colors</li>
            <li>This is fun nail polish!</li>
            <li>Gave as a birthday gift and she was really excited.</li>
            <li>Does glow in the dark but takes so many layers if you want it to look good during the day/in the light.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright only when in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Received my order in a short period of time &amp; in good condition.</li>
            <li>This would only be good if maybe your buying for kids.</li>
            <li>maybe with 10 coats you can receive the full color</li>
            <li>Cool nail polish.</li>
            <li>It comes true to the description.</li>
            <li>The colors are great, just a little light</li>
            <li>the nail polish was great for price but the polish really dident glow in dark and you have to put more then 2 coats on for color to show</li>
            <li>BUT put your nails under a black light and WOW- these glow so bright!!</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>These polishes are great the only thing I don&#x27;t like is they are really transparent if you buy these polishes</li>
            <li>The polishes arrived on time, and I was very pleased with that , and couldn&#x27;t wait to open them up.</li>
            <li>these given the mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>you also hav to shine it in light first</li>
            <li>so I figured that out and very pretty colors</li>
            <li>Will not stay more than 2 days, good for special sleep overs, really glowing in the dark.</li>
            <li>Lots of variety, but the colors are really transparent and chip easily.</li>
            <li>I applied one coat of the polish (which took FOREVER to dry) and let it charge out in the sun for a good 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>BUT, when it is dry, it is really good quality.</li>
            <li>It seemed as though the white tip glowed more brightly than the part of the nail with no other polish underneath.</li>
            <li>And they actually glow in the dark but you will need to use 2 prety good coats of paints to have the good glow.</li>
            <li>its a very goo product, just you have to put in a bulb light or something to glow</li>
            <li>the nail polish takes a few coats but it drys fast great nail polish, you might need to put your nails in light.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 5 year old Grand daughter and after one application we tried to see if they glowed; they did, but</li>
            <li>In the picture they look kind of different</li>
            <li>It is overall a nice product</li>
            <li>only nice about is the color .but</li>
            <li>They are wonderful, but one of the nail polish came broken.  </li>
            <li>I saw how cool they were and put a super light coat of clear on my nails.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She is still playing with them, but I was hoping the colors would be more vivid, hence more fun for my Grand daughter to play with in the dark.</li>
            <li>Exactly right it</li>
            <li>however, I contacted the seller &amp; they sent out a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>n polish don,t peal off right away</li>
            <li>The glowing doesn&#x27;t last over night, even after shining a bright light on them for several minutes.</li>
            <li>The girls loved the glow in the dark polish, I dont know about the scent it all smells like nail polish.</li>
            <li>Best if used alone and be prepared to receive 5 different shades of green.</li>
            <li>recieved 2 sets of 6 from lime light and peach light series and every color is different!</li>
            <li>Looks more like clear really.  </li>
            <li>not bad works decent.</li>
            <li>And the bottles are huge, as far as a bundle goes.</li>
            <li>The colors were pretty...</li>
            <li>It does however glow, and the colors are pretty during the day, so I cant complain.</li>
            <li>is was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scented removers they sent especially since I didn&#x27;t know that it was part of the package.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li>I love to use different colors on  my nails when I have meeting at night.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t show any signs until the final application of the top coat.</li>
            <li>Overall pleased though</li>
            <li>I bought these and what a waste of money the colors aren&#x27;t bright like they look in the bottle even after 3-4 coats and it never did glow so</li>
            <li>A top coat does not effect its glow &amp; white polish underneath seemed to intensify the effect a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially since a top coat &amp; even stamping doesn&#x27;t seem to cause problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in fact the colors are too light that they are equivalent to clear nail polish..</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty however, I did get way too many of the same colors.</li>
            <li>It was subscribed as exactly what it was.</li>
            <li>Let dry and place nails under light and turn light out to see nails glow.</li>
            <li>even better under a black light..</li>
            <li>The polish takes a couple coats to make it dark, but with two coats it looks awesome under a blacklight and glows in the dark.</li>
            <li>i will really appreciate it ;)</li>
            <li>love the polish it glows for a long time</li>
            <li>Everyone really liked looking at their nails glowing in the dark.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry very well and just looks very cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It glowed in the dark and the girls had fun with it, but I would have liked it to dry smooth and</li>
            <li>They are pretty colors, I expected them to glow a bit better.</li>
            <li>but Im embarrassed to give such cheap nail polish.</li>
            <li>Very thick/sticky like glue.</li>
            <li>REALLY well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>However it was delivered efficiently and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>so I just gave her mine as I haven&#x27;t used it that much</li>
            <li>that really impress my friends.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find myself using these as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>It got mailed to me really fast.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>in regular light</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very translucent-</li>
            <li>They glow really well.</li>
            <li>THEY MUST HAVE PUT TO MUCH OF SOMETHING IN IT</li>
            <li>AND RESEARCH HAVE MUCH THEY PUT IN THE POLISH</li>
            <li>But if I put topcoat on, it&#x27;s not glow that much.</li>
            <li>it really glows I didn&#x27;t think it would</li>
            <li>Colors dont really show</li>
            <li>They are very similar to sheer tints, which means you aren&#x27;t going to get an opaque manicure out of them on their own.</li>
            <li>I had the thought that I might end up only using these for the kids for Halloween, but it looks nice enough that I might wear them myself from time to time.</li>
            <li>These are lighter than the 24 count in the other brand but not as sticky just takes too many coats</li>
            <li>but it does really glow in the dark so its an okay item</li>
            <li>cool and looks cool in the dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something exciting to wear instead of just the same old same old nail polish.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a color and doesn&#x27;t glow very long, even after its under the light for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I gave three stars because I wasn&#x27;t super happy getting four nearly identical greens and is very thin.</li>
            <li>Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Be ready for the delay in shipment as the Nail polish is considered as a different cargo and needs to be combined along with other hazardous consignment.</li>
            <li>the main time, if anyone knows a trick or something to make them work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy them if you wanted them to be vibrant or to glow the color they represent.</li>
            <li>but in real life all of them pretty much look the same, as well as the two greens that came.</li>
            <li>even though the light colors glow better than the dark ones, they all glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>Its fun for kids but the glow only lasts for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Fun for a pre teen girl</li>
            <li>The colors are mainly for use under a black light.</li>
            <li>And they are quick dry</li>
            <li>It goes on very clear</li>
            <li>Plain packaging, but ordered several packs and received nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li>(Wow!</li>
            <li>Glows for a short while in the dark if you expose it to light first.</li>
            <li>The fact that I  have to use a light to activate the the glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>I wish the company tells you that you have to hold it up to a light because I was just about to complain about it not glowing in the dark.</li>
            <li>Product came on time but the nail polish was cheap and it didn&#x27;t glow in the dark..</li>
            <li>Drying time is pretty standard.</li>
            <li>Completely!</li>
            <li>All but one of the bottles were in perfect condition but one bottle was half empty and dried up!</li>
            <li>Does not glow unless under a black light.</li>
            <li>i had hoped they would work with black light</li>
            <li>(everything neon glows in black light</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s a black light thing I haven&#x27;t been near a black light yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going out this weekend near a black light</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try to post some pictures later, I used one of these last night with a white tip classic French mani &amp; stamped over top.</li>
            <li>but if you put white nail polish underneath them they show up a little better.</li>
            <li>All the colors go on practically clear.</li>
            <li>Came with a 11 colors and clear.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ...</li>
            <li>I had no trouble using it.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my earrings, my metal belt buckles in order to have that WOW effect on the dancefloor.</li>
            <li>Two coats and just a few minutes under the light</li>
            <li>Three layers definitely do the trick if you opt for straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>We used 1-2-3 coats to make sure and none glowed in the least.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the nail polish, I received it early.  </li>
            <li>The bottom was completely off.  </li>
            <li>so was my 9 year old granddaughter ;(</li>
            <li>On the upside, I must say that the amount of glow produced once the polish is exposed to natural sunlight is</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money on these...</li>
            <li>THEY THIN YOUR OWN NAILS</li>
            <li>Once again I&#x27;m only going by looks, for right now once I have received and used the product I will give my overall rating</li>
            <li>It takes SEVERAL coats of polish for the colors to appear as vibrant on the nails as they do in the bottles.</li>
            <li>I know there are a few negative reviews on this product with people saying they got two of the same colors and things of that nature, but really, with the cheapness of it and the GOOD quality (yes, I think the nail polishes surpassed my expectations by quite a bit), what did you guys expect?</li>
            <li>The colors are VERY light unless you apply about 4 thick coats!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty certain that the people who rated this poorly didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s supposed to be used under black light.</li>
            <li>it said that you need to put a light over the nail/toe nails you painted which for me was hard to do.</li>
            <li>Apply two coats, (no different than any other polish), dry and place your hands under a light source, (IE: A LAMP), for approx 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I did remove the polish later though since having clear polish on my nails still means I&#x27;m a guy with polish on my nails.  </li>
            <li>When it was night time, the polish barely glowed.</li>
            <li>Barely glows.</li>
            <li>These are barely colored when applied.  </li>
            <li>they are kind of the same because it glows in the dark only in green</li>
            <li>Being a &amp;#34;clubber&amp;#34; I am always looking for something different and fun to wear under the black lights in the dance clubs.</li>
            <li>so just one quick coat and a few minutes later you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li>This polish lights up so much brighter than the other polishes Ive tried.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten to find out yet if other colors of polish effect how much</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t chip as fast as other polishes.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time but all the bottles were only about half full if that much, kind of disappointing</li>
            <li>and they r even lighter on ur nails u need to put on at least three coats on to even see the color and to get a good glow u need at least two coats of polish.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, colors are not bright as shown and don&#x27;t glow very easily also chipped off by next day!!</li>
            <li>It should&#x27;ve been named black light polish instead of glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>The polishes do glow in the dark without the need for black light.</li>
            <li>The glow in the dark polish really works.</li>
            <li>and they really glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>Really does glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li>Hard to dry &amp; gooey smudges off easy.</li>
            <li>It does seem to have a slightly different consistency than regular nail polish, but not extreme.</li>
            <li>The nail polish glows in the dark if you hold it under a light source for a few moments.</li>
            <li>The polishes really do glow in the dark.!</li>
            <li>Really does glow in the dark!</li>
            <li>I was shocked how bright they are.</li>

            <li> While this set provides a very nice assortment of non-duplicated colors, I found the quality of the polishes to be a bit lacking.</li>

            <li> so kool way better deal than a bottle for $7 GREAT DEAL!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a successful purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they glow beautifully!</li>
            <li> the nail polish is ok but its not the best.</li>
            <li> Wonderful they all glow I&#x27;m enjoying</li>
            <li> Great value and my kids loved them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bright either</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t let the bright colors deceive you.</li>
            <li> The bright colors don&#x27;t reflect the color of the polish when applied, or the color of the glow.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that they all glowed bright.</li>
            <li> the colors aren&#x27;t bright like they r in the pics</li>
            <li> Got for my daughter for Christmas, she loved it.</li>
            <li> A good buy for a dozen polishes.</li>
            <li> The girls at my daughter&#x27;s birthday party really loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> work good ass hell</li>
            <li> She has always loved her nails being painted</li>
            <li> This is a good product but, when you put it on it is to transparent and doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li> It is good</li>
            <li> I got it on time so good .</li>
            <li> excellent and indoor room light also provides a sufficient glow.</li>
            <li> The Item was good  and is of quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them they are great good purchase.</li>
            <li> Really fun for Christmas and best used over another color.</li>
            <li> A very interesting mix of colors and blends for all occasion.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied will order again</li>
            <li> These are a great buy and totally worth your money!!</li>
            <li> This is the reason for bottom and top coat!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> i got it for them and they love the glow just like it is!</li>
            <li> real cool look good on lady friend</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s an amazing purchase</li>
            <li> After about 5 coats then it looks really nice.</li>
            <li> After adding a bit of my own polish they did work though.</li>
            <li> so I bought these for her (with mom&#x27;s supervision of course) so that she could have her own polish.  </li>
            <li> You will need 3 coats to get a nice glow.</li>
            <li> this would be a five star item if it wasn&#x27;t so transparent really nice though they glow</li>
            <li> I really liked these.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price, fast shipping, exactly as described!</li>
            <li> More variety would have been nice.</li>
            <li> So awesome the glow is very bright over light colored polish the design possibilities are endless</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and very fun.</li>
            <li> i love love love this!</li>
            <li> The most upsetting factor is that the polish peels off very easily.</li>
            <li> The colors are very very light...</li>
            <li> The nail Polish was very light</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, but not a product I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li> BTW, make sure to wear a bottom coat and top coat.</li>

            <li> and I have enjoyed it</li>
            <li> Takes many coats to even show on your nails.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for anyone who loves doing they&#x27;re nails and adding spunk to them :)</li>
            <li> Had to put on more than 3 coats and was able to see some glow but not what I was hoping for.</li>

            <li> the kids love how they do glow...</li>
            <li> but kids age :10-13 and 14 all love the glow..</li>
            <li> MORE</li>
            <li> I had to put so many layers on</li>
            <li> My roommate likes to wear them to raves and to the club when we go out, and kids love them.</li>
            <li> they can be worn alone some better than others but not as well as i had hoped.</li>
            <li> I love the colors.  </li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> You have to alpy to many coats to get the color</li>
            <li> I will for sure be buying more products from y&#x27;all</li>
            <li> very interesting and fun to work with</li>
            <li> but I am pretty sure the girls will love it!</li>
            <li> cheap, you have to use 5 or 6 coats to make it look ok</li>
            <li> Just hold it under the light for 45 seconds after it dries, it glows better</li>
            <li> I still like it though it is cute if u want a light color on.</li>
            <li> My niece loved them, thank you so much for this product</li>
            <li> So they are a good product reasonable price and they do work</li>
            <li> She loved it but the polish is very thin/watery.  </li>
            <li> gf loved the whole package</li>
            <li> These polishes are cool and funky!</li>
            <li> Peels off easily.</li>
            <li> The company sent this product VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li> Peels off easily.</li>
            <li> AND MAKE THEM BREAK EASY</li>
            <li> recieved this material with a quickness, they are right on top of satisfying customers, have not used it, its a gift</li>
            <li> and they glow nice with all type of things pretty</li>
            <li> 11 bottles were fine.</li>
            <li> my girls love this polish and fun to sniff.</li>
            <li> This was such a great price and it seemed to work well with a couple of coats.  </li>
            <li> I did not see this glow in the dark.its too light.</li>
            <li> Made really cheap.  </li>
            <li> and they say to hold you finger up to a light to get it to glow.</li>
            <li> you just have to hold your fingers up to a light.</li>
            <li> Glows bright and all the colors are perfectly clear that you can build the desired shade with.</li>
            <li> The longer you keep in light, the brighter they glow.  </li>
            <li> Sunlight, lamp light, anything to would do so if it doesn&#x27;t glow just read this hope it helps</li>
            <li> They cheerfully canceled the order for me, even though I didn&#x27;t realize my mistake for hours, so I could re-order the correct amount.</li>
            <li> These will make Halloween more fun &amp;</li>
            <li> My daughters enjoy these.</li>
            <li> NO YOU NEEDED TO PUT UNDER LIGHT MACHINE</li>
            <li> I enjoy the colors.</li>
            <li> We held all of them to the light to see the glow.</li>
            <li> Loved this kit as I was able to break it up and give several sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> the polish doesn&#x27;t dry good 3 nice cool color.....</li>
            <li> Great color selection too to match most of my other polish colors</li>
            <li> Very good if you live in an area with frequent power outages as you can use your hands to guide your way.  </li>
            <li> You can have fun with it at night!</li>
            <li> Really excited to wear each and every one.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive these</li>
            <li> , I was so excited for these colors</li>
            <li> This is fun nail polish!</li>
            <li> Gave as a birthday gift and she was really excited.</li>
            <li> Does glow in the dark but takes so many layers if you want it to look good during the day/in the light.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright only when in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Received my order in a short period of time &amp; in good condition.</li>
            <li> This would only be good if maybe your buying for kids.</li>
            <li> maybe with 10 coats you can receive the full color</li>
            <li> Cool nail polish.</li>
            <li> It comes true to the description.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, just a little light</li>
            <li> the nail polish was great for price but the polish really dident glow in dark and you have to put more then 2 coats on for color to show</li>
            <li> BUT put your nails under a black light and WOW- these glow so bright!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> These polishes are great the only thing I don&#x27;t like is they are really transparent if you buy these polishes</li>
            <li> The polishes arrived on time, and I was very pleased with that , and couldn&#x27;t wait to open them up.</li>
            <li> these given the mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li> you also hav to shine it in light first</li>
            <li> so I figured that out and very pretty colors</li>
            <li> Will not stay more than 2 days, good for special sleep overs, really glowing in the dark.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety, but the colors are really transparent and chip easily.</li>
            <li> I applied one coat of the polish (which took FOREVER to dry) and let it charge out in the sun for a good 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> BUT, when it is dry, it is really good quality.</li>
            <li> It seemed as though the white tip glowed more brightly than the part of the nail with no other polish underneath.</li>
            <li> And they actually glow in the dark but you will need to use 2 prety good coats of paints to have the good glow.</li>
            <li> its a very goo product, just you have to put in a bulb light or something to glow</li>
            <li> the nail polish takes a few coats but it drys fast great nail polish, you might need to put your nails in light.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 5 year old Grand daughter and after one application we tried to see if they glowed; they did, but</li>
            <li> In the picture they look kind of different</li>
            <li> It is overall a nice product</li>
            <li> only nice about is the color .but</li>
            <li> They are wonderful, but one of the nail polish came broken.  </li>
            <li> I saw how cool they were and put a super light coat of clear on my nails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She is still playing with them, but I was hoping the colors would be more vivid, hence more fun for my Grand daughter to play with in the dark.</li>
            <li> Exactly right it</li>
            <li> however, I contacted the seller &amp; they sent out a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> n polish don,t peal off right away</li>
            <li> The glowing doesn&#x27;t last over night, even after shining a bright light on them for several minutes.</li>
            <li> The girls loved the glow in the dark polish, I dont know about the scent it all smells like nail polish.</li>
            <li> Best if used alone and be prepared to receive 5 different shades of green.</li>
            <li> recieved 2 sets of 6 from lime light and peach light series and every color is different!</li>
            <li> Looks more like clear really.  </li>
            <li> not bad works decent.</li>
            <li> And the bottles are huge, as far as a bundle goes.</li>
            <li> The colors were pretty...</li>
            <li> It does however glow, and the colors are pretty during the day, so I cant complain.</li>
            <li> is was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scented removers they sent especially since I didn&#x27;t know that it was part of the package.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> I love to use different colors on  my nails when I have meeting at night.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t show any signs until the final application of the top coat.</li>
            <li> Overall pleased though</li>
            <li> I bought these and what a waste of money the colors aren&#x27;t bright like they look in the bottle even after 3-4 coats and it never did glow so</li>
            <li> A top coat does not effect its glow &amp; white polish underneath seemed to intensify the effect a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially since a top coat &amp; even stamping doesn&#x27;t seem to cause problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in fact the colors are too light that they are equivalent to clear nail polish..</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty however, I did get way too many of the same colors.</li>
            <li> It was subscribed as exactly what it was.</li>
            <li> Let dry and place nails under light and turn light out to see nails glow.</li>
            <li> even better under a black light..</li>
            <li> The polish takes a couple coats to make it dark, but with two coats it looks awesome under a blacklight and glows in the dark.</li>
            <li> i will really appreciate it ;)</li>
            <li> love the polish it glows for a long time</li>
            <li> Everyone really liked looking at their nails glowing in the dark.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry very well and just looks very cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It glowed in the dark and the girls had fun with it, but I would have liked it to dry smooth and</li>
            <li> They are pretty colors, I expected them to glow a bit better.</li>
            <li> but Im embarrassed to give such cheap nail polish.</li>
            <li> Very thick/sticky like glue.</li>
            <li> REALLY well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> However it was delivered efficiently and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> so I just gave her mine as I haven&#x27;t used it that much</li>
            <li> that really impress my friends.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find myself using these as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> It got mailed to me really fast.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> in regular light</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very translucent-</li>
            <li> They glow really well.</li>
            <li> THEY MUST HAVE PUT TO MUCH OF SOMETHING IN IT</li>
            <li> AND RESEARCH HAVE MUCH THEY PUT IN THE POLISH</li>
            <li> But if I put topcoat on, it&#x27;s not glow that much.</li>
            <li> it really glows I didn&#x27;t think it would</li>
            <li> Colors dont really show</li>
            <li> They are very similar to sheer tints, which means you aren&#x27;t going to get an opaque manicure out of them on their own.</li>
            <li> I had the thought that I might end up only using these for the kids for Halloween, but it looks nice enough that I might wear them myself from time to time.</li>
            <li> These are lighter than the 24 count in the other brand but not as sticky just takes too many coats</li>
            <li> but it does really glow in the dark so its an okay item</li>
            <li> cool and looks cool in the dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have something exciting to wear instead of just the same old same old nail polish.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a color and doesn&#x27;t glow very long, even after its under the light for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I gave three stars because I wasn&#x27;t super happy getting four nearly identical greens and is very thin.</li>
            <li> Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Be ready for the delay in shipment as the Nail polish is considered as a different cargo and needs to be combined along with other hazardous consignment.</li>
            <li> the main time, if anyone knows a trick or something to make them work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy them if you wanted them to be vibrant or to glow the color they represent.</li>
            <li> but in real life all of them pretty much look the same, as well as the two greens that came.</li>
            <li> even though the light colors glow better than the dark ones, they all glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> Its fun for kids but the glow only lasts for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Fun for a pre teen girl</li>
            <li> The colors are mainly for use under a black light.</li>
            <li> And they are quick dry</li>
            <li> It goes on very clear</li>
            <li> Plain packaging, but ordered several packs and received nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> (Wow!</li>
            <li> Glows for a short while in the dark if you expose it to light first.</li>
            <li> The fact that I  have to use a light to activate the the glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> I wish the company tells you that you have to hold it up to a light because I was just about to complain about it not glowing in the dark.</li>
            <li> Product came on time but the nail polish was cheap and it didn&#x27;t glow in the dark..</li>
            <li> Drying time is pretty standard.</li>
            <li> Completely!</li>
            <li> All but one of the bottles were in perfect condition but one bottle was half empty and dried up!</li>
            <li> Does not glow unless under a black light.</li>
            <li> i had hoped they would work with black light</li>
            <li> (everything neon glows in black light</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a black light thing I haven&#x27;t been near a black light yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going out this weekend near a black light</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to post some pictures later, I used one of these last night with a white tip classic French mani &amp; stamped over top.</li>
            <li> but if you put white nail polish underneath them they show up a little better.</li>
            <li> All the colors go on practically clear.</li>
            <li> Came with a 11 colors and clear.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ...</li>
            <li> I had no trouble using it.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my earrings, my metal belt buckles in order to have that WOW effect on the dancefloor.</li>
            <li> Two coats and just a few minutes under the light</li>
            <li> Three layers definitely do the trick if you opt for straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> We used 1-2-3 coats to make sure and none glowed in the least.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the nail polish, I received it early.  </li>
            <li> The bottom was completely off.  </li>
            <li> so was my 9 year old granddaughter ;(</li>
            <li> On the upside, I must say that the amount of glow produced once the polish is exposed to natural sunlight is</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money on these...</li>
            <li> THEY THIN YOUR OWN NAILS</li>
            <li> Once again I&#x27;m only going by looks, for right now once I have received and used the product I will give my overall rating</li>
            <li> It takes SEVERAL coats of polish for the colors to appear as vibrant on the nails as they do in the bottles.</li>
            <li> I know there are a few negative reviews on this product with people saying they got two of the same colors and things of that nature, but really, with the cheapness of it and the GOOD quality (yes, I think the nail polishes surpassed my expectations by quite a bit), what did you guys expect?</li>
            <li> The colors are VERY light unless you apply about 4 thick coats!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty certain that the people who rated this poorly didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s supposed to be used under black light.</li>
            <li> it said that you need to put a light over the nail/toe nails you painted which for me was hard to do.</li>
            <li> Apply two coats, (no different than any other polish), dry and place your hands under a light source, (IE: A LAMP), for approx 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I did remove the polish later though since having clear polish on my nails still means I&#x27;m a guy with polish on my nails.  </li>
            <li> When it was night time, the polish barely glowed.</li>
            <li> Barely glows.</li>
            <li> These are barely colored when applied.  </li>
            <li> they are kind of the same because it glows in the dark only in green</li>
            <li> Being a &amp;#34;clubber&amp;#34; I am always looking for something different and fun to wear under the black lights in the dance clubs.</li>
            <li> so just one quick coat and a few minutes later you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> This polish lights up so much brighter than the other polishes Ive tried.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to find out yet if other colors of polish effect how much</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t chip as fast as other polishes.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time but all the bottles were only about half full if that much, kind of disappointing</li>
            <li> and they r even lighter on ur nails u need to put on at least three coats on to even see the color and to get a good glow u need at least two coats of polish.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, colors are not bright as shown and don&#x27;t glow very easily also chipped off by next day!!</li>
            <li> It should&#x27;ve been named black light polish instead of glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> The polishes do glow in the dark without the need for black light.</li>
            <li> The glow in the dark polish really works.</li>
            <li> and they really glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> Really does glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li> Hard to dry &amp; gooey smudges off easy.</li>
            <li> It does seem to have a slightly different consistency than regular nail polish, but not extreme.</li>
            <li> The nail polish glows in the dark if you hold it under a light source for a few moments.</li>
            <li> The polishes really do glow in the dark.!</li>
            <li> Really does glow in the dark!</li>
            <li> I was shocked how bright they are.</li>
            <li> i am using the glow in the dark nail polish for one of my specisl models to be on display at the new york state nationals model contest on july 19-21 2013...</li>
            <li> It may be a pro rather than a con to some (children perhaps) to be able to literally peel the polish off rather than use polish remover, however I find this to be a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> However, they can looks surprisingly classy layered over other polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clear is still glow in the dark though.  </li>
            <li> This is my first negative review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given these to my 5 year old because they are just not worth it for me to use.</li>
            <li> Also, the color is really sheer, so suggest a base color (white is good for this)</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, just different than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I  WILL GO BACK TO PLAIN CLEAR BECAUSE I DON&#x27;T WEAR FOST NAILS</li>
            <li> and it really does glow in the dark!!!</li>
            <li> The polishes have a strange consistency.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ve been trying a few of the colors</li>
            <li> They seem to be very thick and gooey,and they don&#x27;t go on right..</li>
            <li> However, for the color to show up I had to apply 4 coats, and it takes a long time for it to dry.</li>
            <li> never buy unless you were looking for very poor quality cheap stuffs</li>
            <li> I guess next time I&#x27;ll follow the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I do like using these with other polishes and paints, especially outerspace themed nails or animal eyes.</li>
            <li> looks for all the world just like any other sheer tint during the day.</li>
            <li> only got 6 bottles other 6 broke when i recieved it</li>
            <li> Takes a very long time to dry.</li>
            <li> The scented polish remover pads that shipped with it, were compleatly bone dry.</li>
            <li> Some were dry</li>
            <li> bought these for my granddaughter,waste of money, and so called sented remover pads were all dry.</li>
            <li> I know I never will purchase this again and the nail polish remover were dry pads...</li>
            <li> They all glow the same color, not the color that the bottle is, they either glow white or green.</li>
            <li> i am a single mom</li>
            <li> I only made it 4 stars because it takes eons to dry, and you have to hide in the closet to see the glow in the dark effects.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the difference in color even in the dark.</li>
            <li> Color donst show it only glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> these did not even glow in the dark if you did not put it on before you left the house.</li>
            <li> nail polish was sticky and rough long after it was dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry!  </li>
            <li> the nail polsih only lasts about a day and a half</li>
            <li> The colors are very light, wear a white base under it.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money</li>
            <li> my granddaughters expected it to glow ,didnt get that.</li>
            <li> With a proper base coat and top coat</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and packaged nicely but the product itself is crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of it actually glowed because it just wouldn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> I will see if there are any other sellers as I like the product and would definately&lt;br /&gt;order</li>
            <li> Like any other polish, your nails will chip and peel without it.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The nailpolish glows in the dark as expected</li>
            <li> I JUST SCRAPPED IT OFF WITH ONE OTHER NAIL</li>
            <li> they were 2 bottles broke and the other 4 were all stuck togethere</li>
            <li> didnt use the other 6 yet</li>
            <li> When it glows, it&#x27;s not a very bright glow, and I was hoping it would glow the color of the polish, not just the generic glow color.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t they only time they glow in the dark is when im in bed which is like black as night because i hate sleeping with light</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t even glow in the dark and it hand chipped and pealed within 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my students to use in their performance at the GLOW art event in Santa Monica, CA on September 28, 2013, and it does not glow in the dark.  </li>
            <li> The polish didn&#x27;t flow in the dark like it said it would.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>

            <li> none of these glow in the dark...</li>
            <li> none of the polish glo in the dark.</li>
            <li> my daughter doesn&#x27;t like it cause it don&#x27;t glo in the dark</li>
            <li> This product does not glow and half of the colors work for</li>
            <li> About 20seconds next to a light-bulb &amp; they glow for at least a few hours.</li>
            <li> it was hard to spread it around and took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> But everything was neatly packaged in little boxes.</li>
            <li> and i didnt care how little it glows..</li>
            <li> At first I was frustrated with the nails because they weren&#x27;t glowing in the dark until I read the reviews</li>
            <li> This polish is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and they all glow green.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but after a few coats it becomes darker.</li>
            <li> And all colors glow in like a green color.</li>
            <li> totally waste of money</li>
            <li> i feel like i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> so i dont have money to waste.</li>
            <li> When dried it began to bubble up on her toes.</li>
            <li> When applied to nails the polish is transparent, and all colors glow in the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; glow-in-the-dark whitish green color.</li>
            <li> waste of my money</li>
            <li> I got three shades of green and two shades of orange.</li>
            <li> few bottles leaked around the lids during shipping.</li>
            <li> If you put a white base coat the colors show up very well.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in these nail polish, first you can barely see the color didn&#x27;t glow in dark</li>
            <li> just a plain color 😩 👎👎 😡😡  </li>
            <li> You can hardly see that they glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> it very thick and takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> you can hardly see any color at all, and no, they don&#x27;t glow in the dark, duh.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!</li>
            <li> and I wanted to have some glowing nails for the night parade</li>
            <li> Not sure how the glow</li>
            <li> One bottle was slightly opened and so that one bottle is thick and not great for use.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I painted my nails at 2pm and by 6 at least one was peeling and by 8</li>
            <li> this product sucks...</li>
            <li> You need to apply at least 3-4 coats for them to look like the color.</li>
            <li> and then its so thick that it smudges.</li>
            <li> I did not find this polish to be runny or thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> it was really thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a touch thick, but not at all too thick to work with.</li>
            <li> I will say that one did arrive broken in half (which made for some stinky mail!)</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed with this because when it came in a few of the colors were very thick and sticky,like they were old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good quality nail polish to stay on.</li>
            <li> Not bright at all.</li>
            <li> They do glow, but very faintly, even after they&#x27;ve been under a lamp as long as the directions say.</li>
            <li> These colors are very weak, hardly show at all.</li>
            <li> also 2 of my jars were broken vicar quality is poor not gonna worry about replacing them.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two of the bottles were broken when they arived  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;THREE broken bottles.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as hoped, and 2 bottles were broken, and leaked all over the place.</li>
            <li> Polish too thin.</li>
            <li> Received pkg today and one of the bottles of nail polish was broken.  </li>
            <li> This is the worse nail polish I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> The bottles were broken and the nail polish is sticky and gooey that you can&#x27;t paint your nails with it</li>
            <li> Tip, must use white polish as base.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this order.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery yet you need a white base coat</li>
            <li> Colors are very weak.</li>
            <li> The color is very weak and doesn&#x27;t show when alone.</li>
            <li> without the base coat you have to apply a few layers of the color.</li>
            <li> And nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> The scented nail polish remover pads are useless though.</li>
            <li> so i give it  two stars sorry</li>
            <li> in essence I received two of six different colors very unhappy :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got for my daughter for Christmas, she loved it.</li>
            <li> This polish is a waste of money. All the colors go on practically clear. Not bright at all.</li>
            <li> These are lighter than the 24 count in the other brand but not as sticky just takes too many coats also 2 of my jars were broken vicar quality is poor not gonna worry about replacing them.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to evryone that likes to get there nails done. The glow in the dark polish really works. You can have fun with it at night!</li>
            <li> i am using the glow in the dark nail polish for one of my specisl models to be on display at the new york state nationals model contest on july 19-21 2013...</li>
            <li> the nail polish was great for price but the polish really dident glow in dark and you have to put more then 2 coats on for color to show</li>
            <li> cheap, you have to use 5 or 6 coats to make it look ok and then its so thick that it smudges. Not happy with these at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give as gifts but Im embarrassed to give such cheap nail polish.</li>
            <li> I didnt recive them 😡😡😡</li>
            <li> not bad works decent.</li>
            <li> After about 5 coats then it looks really nice. Great for the kids.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety, but the colors are really transparent and chip easily. Fast shipping, but not a product I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money</li>
            <li> Two of the bottles were broken when they arived  and they were not glowing as I thought</li>
            <li> I guess next time I&#x27;ll follow the other reviews. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ... Poor quality. Does not glow unless under a black light. Peels off easily. Very thick/sticky like glue. Can not see the color of the polish unless you do a lot of coatings and still it&#x27;s just a tint of color. I would not buy this product again or recommend anyone buy this. It should&#x27;ve been named black light polish instead of glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> Exactly right it night glow .it&#x27;s work for me</li>
            <li> These nail polishes work REALLY well. You can definitely tell the difference in color even in the dark.</li>
            <li> polishes work great. Apply two coats, (no different than any other polish), dry and place your hands under a light source, (IE: A LAMP), for approx 30 seconds. The polish WILL glow! The colors are very light, wear a white base under it. The colors are mainly for use under a black light. I used the colors&lt;br /&gt;OVER a color of the same. I did not find this polish to be runny or thick and sticky. The consistency was&lt;br /&gt;fine abd I had no trouble using it. I just wish there were some sort of QUALITY CONTROL as I got&lt;br /&gt;THREE broken bottles. I will see if there are any other sellers as I like the product and would definately&lt;br /&gt;order them again but not from this seller. BTW, make sure to wear a bottom coat and top coat. Like any other polish, your nails will chip and peel without it. This is the reason for bottom and top coat!</li>
            <li> Love them. Works great.</li>
            <li> im very happy i recomended 100%&lt;br /&gt;thanks its a very goo product, just you have to put in a bulb light or something to glow</li>
            <li> These polishes are cool and funky! I love these polishes and the colors are great! Great color selection too to match most of my other polish colors</li>
            <li> my girls love this polish and fun to sniff. never thought I&#x27;d buy paint for a kid and tell them to sniff it! LOL</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as hoped, and 2 bottles were broken, and leaked all over the place.</li>
            <li> Being a &amp;#34;clubber&amp;#34; I am always looking for something different and fun to wear under the black lights in the dance clubs. This polish lights up so much brighter than the other polishes Ive tried. Tip: buy some WHITE nail polish and use TWO COATS. Polish nails TWICE with UV reactive polish. Let dry and place nails under light and turn light out to see nails glow. I have to hide these from my twin daughters! I also use it on my earrings, my metal belt buckles in order to have that WOW effect on the dancefloor. A good buy for a dozen polishes.</li>
            <li> My girls love this nail polish. It goes on very clear so they put it on over a darker color.</li>
            <li> They seem to be very thick and gooey,and they don&#x27;t go on right..it&#x27;s kinds clumpy</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. Tried product to see if it glowed. Two coats and just a few minutes under the light and it did! Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> This was such a great price and it seemed to work well with a couple of coats.  The girls at my daughter&#x27;s birthday party really loved it.  A great party favor!!!</li>
            <li> Takes several coats to apply polish</li>
            <li> Received my order in a short period of time &amp; in good condition. I don&#x27;t know if the others got the same polish as me but I DO NOT recommend wasting your money!! The colors are VERY light unless you apply about 4 thick coats! It does NOT glow!! This would only be good if maybe your buying for kids. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! (Wow! This is my first negative review. Hmm)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them they are great good purchase.</li>
            <li> The item is actually for my wife and she likes it.  It is according to her expectations and she is satisfied.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love nail polish &amp; service  : )</li>
            <li> Really fun for Christmas and best used over another color. Three layers definitely do the trick if you opt for straight out of the bottle. Good product, good price. Plain packaging, but ordered several packs and received nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> very interesting and fun to work with</li>
            <li> Colors are very weak. I bought these for my 5 year old Grand daughter and after one application we tried to see if they glowed; they did, but just barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is still playing with them, but I was hoping the colors would be more vivid, hence more fun for my Grand daughter to play with in the dark.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t even glow in the dark and it hand chipped and pealed within 6 hours.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this nail polish.  My niece look forward to put this on all the time especially when we are camping.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my students to use in their performance at the GLOW art event in Santa Monica, CA on September 28, 2013, and it does not glow in the dark.  We used 1-2-3 coats to make sure and none glowed in the least.  Terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter, and she was disappointed because  they did not Glow..</li>
            <li> The colors were pretty... but the glow was not so great.</li>
            <li> The polishes arrived on time, and I was very pleased with that , and couldn&#x27;t wait to open them up. All 12 bottles were different colors.  And they do come out very bright on your fingers. However, for the color to show up I had to apply 4 coats, and it takes a long time for it to dry. When it glows, it&#x27;s not a very bright glow, and I was hoping it would glow the color of the polish, not just the generic glow color. It does however glow, and the colors are pretty during the day, so I cant complain. The scented polish remover pads that shipped with it, were compleatly bone dry. After adding a bit of my own polish they did work though.</li>
            <li> The company sent this product VERY quickly.  E-mails letting me know when it shipped and all!  The kids LOVE it!!!! One bottle was slightly opened and so that one bottle is thick and not great for use.  But all and all, great experience. I was expecting the different bottles to glow in their respective colors and they all glow green.  Not a big deal, just different than I expected.  For the price, this is a GREAT deal.</li>
            <li> Came with a 11 colors and clear.  The clear is still glow in the dark though.  I bought it for my wife and she used them immediately.  I saw how cool they were and put a super light coat of clear on my nails.  My fingertips glowed for about 15 minutes after the lights went out.  Very good if you live in an area with frequent power outages as you can use your hands to guide your way.  I did remove the polish later though since having clear polish on my nails still means I&#x27;m a guy with polish on my nails.  Imagine working on a car and &amp;#34;Hand my that torque wrench&amp;#34; BOOM, glowing fingernails under the hood.  I&#x27;d never hear the end of it...  Other than that though it&#x27;s an amazing purchase and I will buy more when we run out.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them. Instructions are included so follow steps and they really glow in the dark. The colors are the same as pictured.</li>
            <li> it dosent like up a lot they all came they are kind of the same because it glows in the dark only in green</li>
            <li> work good ass hell and i work with them alot and they glow nice with all type of things pretty</li>
            <li> The polish didn&#x27;t flow in the dark like it said it would. Daughter was disappointed. Polish too thin. Wasn&#x27;t happy</li>
            <li> I ordered the nail polish, I received it early.  The persons I gave it to enjoyed and I have enjoyed it</li>
            <li> The polishes have a strange consistency. They are like jelly to me. If you put a white base coat the colors show up very well. without the base coat you have to apply a few layers of the color. The polishes really do glow in the dark.! I painted a star on my wall and it glows and it glows on my nails as well. All the the polishes are there. It comes with three types of orange. In the picture they look kind of different but in real life all of them pretty much look the same, as well as the two greens that came. But everything was neatly packaged in little boxes. And nothing was broken! I also ordered the matte polishes from this seller and they are great as well!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and she likes it.. But sometimes the colors don&#x27;t glow..</li>
            <li> Really does glow in the dark!</li>
            <li> My niece loved them, thank you so much for this product is was exactly what I was looking for.I will definitely be recommend these.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, colors are not bright as shown and don&#x27;t glow very easily also chipped off by next day!! Not worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this. I did not see this glow in the dark.its too light. I would never order again. However it was delivered efficiently and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>
            <li> I know there are a few negative reviews on this product with people saying they got two of the same colors and things of that nature, but really, with the cheapness of it and the GOOD quality (yes, I think the nail polishes surpassed my expectations by quite a bit), what did you guys expect? I got two of the same colors also (two \\&quot;clears\\&quot;), but I don&#x27;t mind at all. I LOVE the scented removers they sent especially since I didn&#x27;t know that it was part of the package. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product to someone. In fact, I was going to order it for my younger cousin as a gift, but I forgot to until the last possible day (she lives in a different continent and I was sending it through a relative who was going to visit), so I just gave her mine as I haven&#x27;t used it that much (I tried all of them of course). Great product.</li>
            <li> This product does not glow and half of the colors work for just a plain color 😩 👎👎 😡😡  do not buy this product your wasting your money</li>
            <li> Peels off easily. Takes many coats to even show on your nails. But, the kids seemed to like it. Glows for a short while in the dark if you expose it to light first.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes were great! Love them! I would recommend for anyone who loves doing they&#x27;re nails and adding spunk to them :)</li>
            <li> I will never order again.  Made really cheap.  I work at my local flea market selling cosmetics and I cannot even give them away.&lt;br /&gt;T &amp; T.  Totally Terrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ever polish and they&#x27;re all too sheer to wear alone. The glowing doesn&#x27;t last over night, even after shining a bright light on them for several minutes. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Had to put on more than 3 coats and was able to see some glow but not what I was hoping for. Some of the colors didn&#x27;t glow at all.</li>
            <li> Received pkg today and one of the bottles of nail polish was broken.  The bottom was completely off.  11 bottles were fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this glow in the dark nail polish for my 5 yoa niece..  She has always loved her nails being painted so I bought these for her (with mom&#x27;s supervision of course) so that she could have her own polish.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time but all the bottles were only about half full if that much, kind of disappointing</li>
            <li> The fact that I  have to use a light to activate the the glow in the dark. It&#x27;s not that bright either</li>
            <li> The colors are great, just a little light but after a few coats it becomes darker. At first I was frustrated with the nails because they weren&#x27;t glowing in the dark until I read the reviews and they say to hold you finger up to a light to get it to glow. I wish the company tells you that you have to hold it up to a light because I was just about to complain about it not glowing in the dark. And all colors glow in like a green color. So they are a good product reasonable price and they do work you just have to hold your fingers up to a light.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I applied one coat of the polish (which took FOREVER to dry) and let it charge out in the sun for a good 20 minutes. When it was night time, the polish barely glowed. I was very disappointed and so we&#x27;re my party guests.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed with this because when it came in a few of the colors were very thick and sticky,like they were old. It doesn&#x27;t dry very well and just looks very cheap. I&#x27;ve given these to my 5 year old because they are just not worth it for me to use. They arrived on time and packaged nicely but the product itself is crap.</li>
            <li> One bottle broke in my hand as a shook it up.</li>
            <li> All but one of the bottles were in perfect condition but one bottle was half empty and dried up!</li>
            <li> THEY DO NOT GLOW IN THE DARK!!!!!!!!!!!! WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!</li>
            <li> the product doesnt glow in the dark, there is very bad this product not glow in the dark what happen?</li>
            <li> This is a good product but, when you put it on it is to transparent and doesn&#x27;t look good. It is overall a nice product and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The colors are very very light...maybe with 10 coats you can receive the full color and they do not glow in the dark...totally waste of money</li>
            <li> This is the worse nail polish I have ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t even stay on till the end of day. I would never recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> Everytime i have used it it just peels off within hours. I painted my nails at 2pm and by 6 at least one was peeling and by 8 almost all were peeling. I have 2 girls and this paint would be perfect for them if it stayed on. i feel like i wasted my money. i am a single mom so i dont have money to waste.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, great variety of colors. Really excited to wear each and every one. Thanks a bunch! Enjoyed the product</li>
            <li> even though the light colors glow better than the dark ones, they all glow in the dark. I love to use different colors on  my nails when I have meeting at night. that really impress my friends.</li>
            <li> I just got this set today. I have yet to try them on, but I thought I would post some pictures because I do have a big blacklight and I thought it might help to show you what they look like.</li>
            <li> Glows bright and all the colors are perfectly clear that you can build the desired shade with.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive these but when they came it was disappointing. There was a color that repeated and it was really thick it was hard to spread it around and took forever to dry. In the box it came with instructions it said that you need to put a light over the nail/toe nails you painted which for me was hard to do. I&#x27;m not sure of it actually glowed because it just wouldn&#x27;t dry so I removed it. The colors where great though. Hope I helped</li>
            <li> I received my two boxes of 12 different colored nail polish because it&#x27;s carnival time here and I wanted to have some glowing nails for the night parade but so far I&#x27;ve been trying a few of the colors and I can&#x27;t get a glow, I was so excited for these colors but I will keep trying and hope they work!&lt;br /&gt;In the main time, if anyone knows a trick or something to make them work i will really appreciate it ;)</li>
            <li> Great It is good I got it on time so good . I may buy more depends on how others goes,</li>
            <li> You will need 3 coats to get a nice glow. It does seem to have a slightly different consistency than regular nail polish, but not extreme. Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Great color assortment, but I don&#x27;t find myself using these as much as I thought I would. They do glow, but very faintly, even after they&#x27;ve been under a lamp as long as the directions say. I do like using these with other polishes and paints, especially outerspace themed nails or animal eyes.</li>
            <li> Color donst show it only glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> The nailpolish glows in the dark as expected</li>
            <li> I applied this polish to a clients toes. When dried it began to bubble up on her toes. I took polish off and began again and it did the same thing. It didn&#x27;t show any signs until the final application of the top coat.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone ..works great!</li>
            <li> It did not meet my needs it Didn&#x27;t even glow in the dark</li>
            <li> They are pretty colors, I expected them to glow a bit better. Overall pleased though</li>
            <li> great polish for a great price</li>
            <li> Awesome!  You have to apply several coats to achieve the color.  The longer you keep in light, the brighter they glow.  Great for the price.  The scented nail polish remover pads are useless though.</li>
            <li> I bought these and what a waste of money the colors aren&#x27;t bright like they look in the bottle even after 3-4 coats and it never did glow so not only was I disappoint so was my 9 year old granddaughter ;(</li>
            <li> i love love love this! the nail polish takes a few coats but it drys fast great nail polish, you might need to put your nails in light. Sunlight, lamp light, anything to would do so if it doesn&#x27;t glow just read this hope it helps</li>
            <li> The nail Polish was very light and u could see the nail underneath I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Not sure how the glow but I still like them I guess it&#x27;s a black light thing I haven&#x27;t been near a black light yet but the colors are awesome I&#x27;m going out this weekend near a black light wish me luck</li>
            <li> The girls loved the glow in the dark polish, I dont know about the scent it all smells like nail polish. Everyone really liked looking at their nails glowing in the dark. This was purchased along with the mood changing nail polish which was great as well.</li>
            <li> never buy unless you were looking for very poor quality cheap stuffs</li>
            <li> Im very happy with the colors they are all good and it really does glow in the dark!!! It got mailed to me really fast. I really love it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> these did not even glow in the dark if you did not put it on before you left the house.</li>
            <li> So awesome the glow is very bright over light colored polish the design possibilities are endless</li>
            <li> Loved this kit as I was able to break it up and give several sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> Its fun for kids but the glow only lasts for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> These polishes are great the only thing I don&#x27;t like is they are really transparent if you buy these polishes I would say put a one or two coats of a matte polish underneath then paint the glow in the dark over it this would be a five star item if it wasn&#x27;t so transparent really nice though they glow really well also I think they have glitter in them</li>
            <li> The bottles were broken and the nail polish is sticky and gooey that you can&#x27;t paint your nails with it</li>
            <li> Fun for a pre teen girl</li>
            <li> Product came on time but the nail polish was cheap and it didn&#x27;t glow in the dark..</li>
            <li> The nail polish glows in the dark if you hold it under a light source for a few moments. However, don&#x27;t let the bright colors deceive you. When applied to nails the polish is transparent, and all colors glow in the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; glow-in-the-dark whitish green color. The bright colors don&#x27;t reflect the color of the polish when applied, or the color of the glow.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a color and doesn&#x27;t glow very long, even after its under the light for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The color is very weak and doesn&#x27;t show when alone. I painted over already painted nails. Barely glows.</li>
            <li> These polishes are best used over-top another polish. They are very similar to sheer tints, which means you aren&#x27;t going to get an opaque manicure out of them on their own. However, they can looks surprisingly classy layered over other polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a touch thick, but not at all too thick to work with. Drying time is pretty standard. I layered the yellow over another yellow polish yesterday for my niece and they came out well. About 20seconds next to a light-bulb &amp; they glow for at least a few hours. If the effect starts to fade, pop them back under a light-bulb. A top coat does not effect its glow &amp; white polish underneath seemed to intensify the effect a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to post some pictures later, I used one of these last night with a white tip classic French mani &amp; stamped over top. It seemed as though the white tip glowed more brightly than the part of the nail with no other polish underneath. I haven&#x27;t gotten to find out yet if other colors of polish effect how much it glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks for all the world just like any other sheer tint during the day. I had the thought that I might end up only using these for the kids for Halloween, but it looks nice enough that I might wear them myself from time to time. Especially since a top coat &amp; even stamping doesn&#x27;t seem to cause problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprisingly pleased with these polishes. I will say that one did arrive broken in half (which made for some stinky mail!) however, I contacted the seller &amp; they sent out a replacement right away. I&#x27;ll leave feedback for the seller too, but I&#x27;d also made a mistake in ordering &amp; accidentally ordered two. They cheerfully canceled the order for me, even though I didn&#x27;t realize my mistake for hours, so I could re-order the correct amount. I was nervous buying these given the mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m very glad I did. These will make Halloween more fun &amp; then some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Submitted some pictures, I should have added, the pictures show 2 coats with a top coat.2 coats with a top coat.</li>
            <li> These were on my daughters 18th birthday list, I was ecstatic that I found them as a set, my daughter LOVES them, they glow wonderfully!!</li>
            <li> Cool nail polish. Glow works well in dark. Glows well.</li>
            <li> Some were dry and I&#x27;m wanting to exchange for newer product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty certain that the people who rated this poorly didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s supposed to be used under black light. Sure- in regular light it&#x27;s very translucent- you can hardly see any color at all, and no, they don&#x27;t glow in the dark, duh. BUT put your nails under a black light and WOW- these glow so bright!! And they are quick dry so just one quick coat and a few minutes later you&#x27;re all set. These are a great buy and totally worth your money!!</li>
            <li> Does glow in the dark but takes so many layers if you want it to look good during the day/in the light.</li>
            <li> terrible prouduct. it very thick and takes forever to dry and it doesnt glow in the dark</li>
            <li> Love the colors .its great</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry!  Best if used alone and be prepared to receive 5 different shades of green.</li>
            <li> They do not glow in the dark... in fact the colors are too light that they are equivalent to clear nail polish.. this product sucks... waste of my money</li>
            <li> I received them and immediately tried them out.. .very cool and looks cool in the dark. even better under a black light..</li>
            <li> works great and love the colors!! recieved 2 sets of 6 from lime light and peach light series and every color is different!</li>
            <li> My daughters enjoy these.</li>

            <li> Recieved on time. Great choice of colors. They do glow in the dark .  My grand daughter love them.</li>
            <li> Really does glow in the dark.  Tip, must use white polish as base.</li>
            <li> the kids love how they do glow... but they dont glow a lot..but kids age :10-13 and 14 all love the glow..im 31 and i didnt care how little it glows..i did 5 star it cause i didnt get this for me... i got it for them and they love the glow just like it is!</li>
            <li> They glow really well. I was shocked how bright they are. The colors are pretty however, I did get way too many of the same colors. I got three shades of green and two shades of orange. More variety would have been nice. The polish lasts for a while so I was happy with that. It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> This polish does not glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> recieved this material with a quickness, they are right on top of satisfying customers, have not used it, its a gift but I am pretty sure the girls will love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price, fast shipping, exactly as described!</li>

            <li> love the polish it glows for a long time n polish don,t peal off right away n I enjoy the colors.</li>
            <li> Great polish!! Was supposed to be a gift but I kept it for myself!!!</li>
            <li> Says glow in dark however it doesn&#x27;t glow in the dark</li>
            <li> I got this set for my daughter and she loves it! She paints her nails every couple days and she says this is some of the best polish she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good quality nail polish to stay on. But if I put topcoat on, it&#x27;s not glow that much. Not happy with this order.</li>
            <li> Once again I&#x27;m only going by looks, for right now once I have received and used the product I will give my overall rating</li>
            <li> While this set provides a very nice assortment of non-duplicated colors, I found the quality of the polishes to be a bit lacking. It takes SEVERAL coats of polish for the colors to appear as vibrant on the nails as they do in the bottles. The most upsetting factor is that the polish peels off very easily. It may be a pro rather than a con to some (children perhaps) to be able to literally peel the polish off rather than use polish remover, however I find this to be a major disappointment. On the upside, I must say that the amount of glow produced once the polish is exposed to natural sunlight is excellent and indoor room light also provides a sufficient glow. With a proper base coat and top coat these polishes aren&#x27;t bad, but to be worn alone isn&#x27;t optimal.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a girls summer camp.&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish was sticky and rough long after it was dry.&lt;br /&gt;It glowed in the dark and the girls had fun with it, but I would have liked it to dry smooth and not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;A few bottles leaked around the lids during shipping.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in these nail polish, first you can barely see the color didn&#x27;t glow in dark tt well, would not order again</li>
            <li> I was hoping that they all glowed bright. I had to put so many layers on and it still only glowed a bit not all of them glowed either</li>
            <li> the nail polsih only lasts about a day and a half but it does really glow in the dark so its an okay item</li>
            <li> These are barely colored when applied.  Looks more like clear really.  Haven&#x27;t had any luck with seeing glowing.  Hard to dry &amp; gooey smudges off easy.</li>
            <li> didnt work at all only nice about is the color .but my granddaughters expected it to glow ,didnt get that.</li>
            <li> i had hoped they would work with black light but they don&#x27;t they only time they glow in the dark is when im in bed which is like black as night because i hate sleeping with light so i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and very fun. My roommate likes to wear them to raves and to the club when we go out, and kids love them. It&#x27;s nice to have something exciting to wear instead of just the same old same old nail polish.</li>
            <li> The Item was good  and is of quality. Be ready for the delay in shipment as the Nail polish is considered as a different cargo and needs to be combined along with other hazardous consignment.</li>
            <li> I would give this polish 2 1/2 stars because I received 12 polishes but they were duplicates so in essence I received two of six different colors very unhappy :(</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and the person loves it! It was subscribed as exactly what it was.I would order this again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> it really glows I didn&#x27;t think it would and it came with 12! so kool way better deal than a bottle for $7 GREAT DEAL! you also hav to shine it in light first so I figured that out and very pretty colors but u could put a different color instead of 2 greens and 3 oranges. Otherwise GREAT 4.7</li>
            <li> I bought these for a birthday party. The polish takes a couple coats to make it dark, but with two coats it looks awesome under a blacklight and glows in the dark.</li>
            <li> It comes true to the description. It glows quite well. It does come with all 12 colors. And the bottles are huge, as far as a bundle goes. The only reason its not 5 stars is because the colors are transparent. they can be worn alone some better than others but not as well as i had hoped. But if you just want a great nail polish this is it. Just hold it under the light for 45 seconds after it dries, it glows better</li>
            <li> Colors dont really show</li>
            <li> The problem is It doesn&#x27;t glow like what it says ...  should I return it or not... or what ..</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the paint to glow.</li>
            <li> I love the colors.  A very interesting mix of colors and blends for all occasion.</li>
            <li> bought these for my granddaughter,waste of money, and so called sented remover pads were all dry.</li>
            <li> How awesome is this?? Completely!</li>
            <li> They are wonderful, but one of the nail polish came broken.  I will like to get a discount for that item.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is fun nail polish! I only made it 4 stars because it takes eons to dry, and you have to hide in the closet to see the glow in the dark effects. BUT, when it is dry, it is really good quality. Just takes 2 days to get there.... Also, the color is really sheer, so suggest a base color (white is good for this)</li>
            <li> none of these glow in the dark... I have tried for months... I would not waste my money on these... I know I never will purchase this again and the nail polish remover were dry pads...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, and my granddaughter seems to be very happy with the product. Seems to be a successful purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they glow beautifully!</li>
            <li> You can hardly see that they glow in the dark. Very disappointed and my daughter doesn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I really liked these. I gave three stars because I wasn&#x27;t super happy getting four nearly identical greens and is very thin. The polishes do glow in the dark without the need for black light. (everything neon glows in black light I did three coats over white</li>
            <li> Got this for my teen God daughter.  She loved it but the polish is very thin/watery.  You need several coats to match how the color appears in the bottles.</li>
            <li> the nail polish is ok but its not the best. the colors aren&#x27;t bright like they r in the pics and they r even lighter on ur nails u need to put on at least three coats on to even see the color and to get a good glow u need at least two coats of polish. I still like it though it is cute if u want a light color on.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied will order again</li>
            <li> Wonderful they all glow I&#x27;m enjoying</li>
            <li> VERY Disappointed!!! These colors are very weak, hardly show at all. You need to apply at least 3-4 coats for them to look like the color. They all glow the same color, not the color that the bottle is, they either glow white or green. Don&#x27;t buy them if you wanted them to be vibrant or to glow the color they represent.</li>
            <li> Glow Okay. Great value and my kids loved them. They don&#x27;t chip as fast as other polishes.</li>
            <li> only got 6 bottles other 6 broke when i recieved it they were 2 bottles broke and the other 4 were all stuck togethere so i had to trow one box out ,didnt use the other 6 yet</li>
            <li> Very thin color but if you put white nail polish underneath them they show up a little better.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright only when in the bottle. On nails you need to have 3-4 coats to get some color showing. Will not stay more than 2 days, good for special sleep overs, really glowing in the dark. Put for a minute a&lt;br /&gt;Under table lamp to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend.</li>
            <li> Gave as a birthday gift and she was really excited. We held all of them to the light to see the glow.</li>
            <li> The paints is really great ! And they actually glow in the dark but you will need to use 2 prety good coats of paints to have the good glow. And the polish remover that comes with is great.&lt;br /&gt;My gf loved the whole package</li>
            <li> You have to alpy to many coats to get the color</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery yet you need a white base coat so you can see the colors. Also it doesn&#x27;t feel like nail polish, it seems oily. Takes a very long time to dry.</li>
            <li> none of the polish glo in the dark. my daughter doesn&#x27;t like it cause it don&#x27;t glo in the dark</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> real cool look good on lady friend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my nail polish I will for sure be buying more products from y&#x27;all</li>
