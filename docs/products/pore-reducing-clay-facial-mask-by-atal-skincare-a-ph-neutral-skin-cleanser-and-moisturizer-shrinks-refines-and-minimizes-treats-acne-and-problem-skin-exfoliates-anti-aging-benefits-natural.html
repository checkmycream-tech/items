            <li>Love the way my face feels after I use it!</li>
            <li>It gives you a warm sensation when applied.</li>
            <li>but I actually liked it.  </li>
            <li>I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice spoon</li>
            <li>I then rinsed it off and felt nice and refreshed and</li>
            <li>It takes a minute but it is nice and not unbearable, unlike some masks I have used.</li>
            <li>When I received the box it was in a bubble wrapped mailer, box was nice and the product was wrapped well.</li>
            <li>Nice scent to boot.</li>

            <li>I used a warm washcloth to wash it off my face after thirty minutes.</li>
            <li>received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I rinse it off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Some I liked and some</li>
            <li>I got this on aone time promotional offer to provide my honest review.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see this product come up for review!!</li>
            <li>No matter how well you clean your face, it is always a great idea to use a clay mask once or twice a week to rid your skin of impurities.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone whom would like a great cleanser, purifier, pore reducer, and skin smoother all at once!</li>
            <li>am so very glad that I was able review this product during a promotional period.</li>
            <li>Very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>I loved how silky smooth it glides on</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and luxurious when applied, and smells good to boot.</li>
            <li>My experiences are authentic and honest.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any difference with my adult acne, but my skin feels smoother &amp; looks great!</li>
            <li>I love this mask and its nice to put on your skin</li>
            <li>It rinses fairly well with cool water.</li>
            <li>It tingles in a most pleasant way and dries quickly (within 10-15 minutes).  </li>
            <li>It came off easily with warm water &amp; a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>But I was very interested in trying out this product because I read that this clay contains so many beneficial ingredients that&#x27;s good for the skin.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this product during a promotional period, which might explain why I was so gleeful to smear it about my chest.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>After only 4 uses those results are impressive in my book.</li>
            <li>With this clay facial mask, I was most impressed by the gel like texture, that left my face feeling great after the fact!</li>
            <li>I found the smell refreshing with a hit of mint.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many mud masks in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure the application would be easier if one used a makeup brush to apply to the face.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the cute packaging it comes in too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was able to get a lower price for trying it.</li>
            <li>They mostly claim to tighten skin and close your pores.</li>
            <li>I had a cut on my forehead and wasn&#x27;t sure if I should use it or not  on the area.  </li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way this mask makes my skin feel and use it now a couple of times a week.  </li>
            <li>so I made sure to test an area on my face before using this product, just in case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of facial treatments over the years, and this one is excellent.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it absorbs the excess oil that seems to be always present-even after washing.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and not too over powering.</li>
            <li>and I am glad to give it a raving review.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this as part of a promotion</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I was able to add this to my repertoire of beauty products.</li>
            <li>I have used many clay masks before.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product its like a minty peppermint smell to me</li>
            <li>this improves the over all quality of my face and so glad.</li>
            <li>I’m in LOVE with this.</li>
            <li>It was easy to wash off and my pores looked smaller and my skin felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>My skin felt and looked very clean.</li>
            <li>It has a cool like mint feeling that kind of tingles but not...</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the mud has a creamy consistency and is really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, and this product is perfect for that, as for all of the ATAL products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>My skin felt and looked smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>First of all, it comes in an elegant looking jar packed inside a nice box.</li>
            <li>The mask texture is a bit gel and clay mixture, which makes it easy to spread across instead of clumping in one spot as some clay mask might do.</li>
            <li>It smooths on evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>I just use my finger, and though I easily get some of the clay on my finger to apply on my face, there is a sort of taught, or viscous, surface.  </li>
            <li>This easily has become a part of my weekly routine.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily.</li>
            <li>The mask is easy to scoop out of the container using the provided scoop and spreads easily across you</li>
            <li>It goes on easily-</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older,  I am always looking for good products to use on my skin for anti aging benefits.</li>
            <li>The jar is high quality and has a good weight to it when being handled.</li>
            <li>In fact I found it to be very gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this product at a special discount when I joined the ATAL VIP Membership Club.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>but it dries pretty fast and is not coming off lol .</li>
            <li>I had used the serum made by ATAL previously and was impressed,  </li>
            <li>I also have huge pores and overtime.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the product has a light &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>It went on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>It  is certified Gluten Free and Vegan.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel nice when done, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin one way or another.  </li>
            <li>I took some fun ribbing from my kids who found it hilarious</li>
            <li>Atal Skin Solutions has a great clay facial mask.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth, looked clearer and invigorated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used various ATAL products before and they have all worked great.  </li>
            <li>Once I wash off the mask, I notice that my skin is smooth and tighter.  </li>
            <li>face looked smooth and felt super clean!</li>
            <li>When the mask was first on the face there was a strong stinging sensation for about a minute, but after that it gradually turns into a tinkling and refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li>I like to open my pores before I use this by placing a very warm cloth over my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good idea to use a steamer or warm water to open your pores up before you use the products, I like to use it immediately after the hot shower.</li>
            <li>When I washed it off I was amazed at how clean, smooth and silky my face felt.  </li>
            <li>I did have the slight burning feeling, but it was not painful, and quickly subsided, leaving me feeling great after!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t quite figure out what it is, but it&#x27;s familiar.</li>
            <li>I promise this is worth it!</li>
            <li>Despite years of research on the unique minerals in the sea&#x27;s water and mud, scientists still do not have the answer as to why sea mud, from the lowest place on earth, is so beneficial for the skin and body.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean each time that I use it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way - somewhere between a piece of chewing gum and flower  - and rinses totally clean.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a pull tab to open the secure packaging would be a good idea..</li>
            <li>I loved that fact that my face felt tighter and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>This mask is a compliment to their other products and they all work together beautifully.</li>
            <li>As with their other products, it comes beautifully packaged and sealed.</li>
            <li>and this makes my skin feel so nice and so smooth and look so nice after using gives me a tight look that.</li>
            <li>ATAL has a wide variety of products and I have been happy with each one.</li>
            <li>this is most definitely a real clay mask.</li>
            <li>Was able to keep it on the whole 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>There was a light and pleasant tingle as it dried and when it was time to wash off, it was quite easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I started off with a clean freshly washed face.</li>
            <li>it felt so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to purchase this during a recent promotion.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and immediately shrinks your pores.</li>
            <li>if I am going somewhere special because I like the fresh face look.</li>
            <li>I tried this out with some skepticism about this kind of product in general</li>
            <li>What I am most excited about is just how soft my face was after using the mask.  </li>
            <li>First off, there is NO comparison to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Our faces were left nice &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>I love trying different skin care products, so when the ATAL Clay Facial mask was available through a recent promotion, I was more than happy to give it a try.</li>
            <li>What an amazing product and such a sleek jar and design!</li>
            <li>It works so well to reduce any inflammation/redness on my skin, helps to clear up the acne, and just leaves it looking better.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pleased and surprised that I did see results with this ATAL clay gel mask.  </li>
            <li>I was offered this facial mask at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>It washes on easy and your skin feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I left it on for bout 15 mins and washed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I waited until the mask completely hardened on my face before rinsing it off with warm water and my face felt really refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li>If smells quite fresh</li>
            <li>What a powerful mask.</li>
            <li>After about the first ten minutes the tightening became more and more intense.</li>
            <li>(make sure your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it first, obvs)</li>
            <li>After I washed my face, my skin has the &#x27;cool&#x27; sensation and I felt that it has cleaned my pores very well.</li>
            <li>It seemed to smooth out my skin a little and shrink pore size, and I liked the feel of my skin after I used it.</li>
            <li>and it really helped reduce inflammation quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it does not dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li>but, its not thick or cakey, its soft and goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li>I love to use facial products on my face.</li>
            <li>This facial mask was a surprise to me, I decided to give it a try and review it when I saw it on promotion, and I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>First, there is a gel quality to it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used what I would consider a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; face mask.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed a pretty good reduction in a few acne scars.</li>
            <li>First, I must say I am a religious ATAL customer, and love all of their products I have.</li>
            <li>The jar comes with a durable scooping spoon, which I really appreciate!</li>
            <li>I used it the first day it arrived</li>
            <li>I love the way this product left my face feeling!</li>
            <li>Not a fake perfumey smell at all.  </li>
            <li>It felt so smooth, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the way my skin felt after just one use of the Clay Facial Mask by ATAL.  </li>
            <li>Not at all disturbing but knew smoothing wonderful was happening.  </li>
            <li>it is the first mask that I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My skin complexion is more even also since starting to use this product.</li>
            <li>I used promotional code to get my first container.</li>
            <li>was really smooth feeling skiing that felt hydrated and completely soothed.  </li>
            <li>Upon using this clay, I was able to feel instant smoothness on my face.  </li>
            <li>I love how this comes with a scraper to grab the product so you do not contaminating the product that is left inside the jar.</li>
            <li>the mask is a think green and was glad for the spoon as I did not get it all stuck under my nails witch would be easy to do when getting it out.</li>
            <li>Love this mask, plus it&#x27;s a great excuse to take a small break from the day to pamper myself!</li>
            <li>My review is the result of a promotional distribution and my opinions in this review are a direct result of my own personal use.  </li>
            <li>And to make it even better, if you are not satisfied, they will let you return your cleanser for a full refund!  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have caught a promotion for this clay gel mask, but I would pay full price for this in a heart beat.  </li>
            <li>I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>I have used Atal’s products in the past and loved the end results every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a amazing product in a small jar but so worth it and made me face feel divine after using it.</li>
            <li>The clay was easy to apply, I left it on for about 10-15 minutes, it hardened and washed off with ease.</li>
            <li>My skin was super soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Sometimes they are so strong that your face feels like it&#x27;s actually burning.</li>
            <li>Through all the clinical trials conducted in hospitals on a range of medical problems including skin diseases, arthritis, and even cancer in patients undergoing chemotherapy have shown that the high concentration of sea minerals is almost instantly effective in improving the skin&#x27;s natural process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pure luxury combination.  </li>
            <li>While it certainly feels as though your skin is tightening while wearing the masks, once washed off the effects fade away.</li>
            <li>The jar is attractive looking and comes with a small spatula to keep from contaminating the product with bare fingers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have another mud mask, which I really like, but this clay gel mask is not at all like the mud mask.  </li>
            <li>My face really does feel cleaner after</li>
            <li>I truly found this clay mask a very divine experience and would recommend adding it to your weekly cleansing regimens.</li>
            <li>And of course I don&#x27;t need much make up because my face is glowing and problem</li>
            <li>This mask helped close up the cut, helping to heal much faster than it was.  </li>
            <li>Nothing that would make me run to rinse off, just lets you know it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>Just some warm water and my hands will wash the dried clay off my face.  </li>
            <li>The blackheads are almost completely gone!!!</li>
            <li>It exfoliates my skin which makes my other products work better.  </li>
            <li>This summer so far has been hot and very humid with lots of rain.</li>
            <li>and I felt a lovely tingling sensation for the first few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have really enjoyed this product since it offers high quality natural ingredients without breaking one&#x27;s bank.</li>
            <li>You definitely don’t need much and it goes on smooth and easily with the little scoop/spoon that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter said it slightly burned, but what I felt was more of a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>I thought it was very thoughtful to include a little scooper to scoop up the clay mask to avoid contamination.</li>
            <li>was I surprised how small my pores were and how smooth and blemish free</li>
            <li>The container is pretty enough to just leave out on your bathroom counter and the clay mask has a nice scent that is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive-ish skin.</li>
            <li>This product assists in cell regeneration and repair and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin to certain products and I never know until I try it.</li>
            <li>Even though I am 60 years old, I have large pores that are unsightly and can lead to acne.  </li>
            <li>I l love that it comes with a little scoop type scraper so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting your fingers in the jar and contaminating the clay.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft and smooth… I want a jar for my body…PLEASE!!  </li>
            <li>It felt a little tingly and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always very cautious when trying out products on my face.</li>
            <li>I will give it a few more applications.</li>
            <li>But, what sticky gunk normally is?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Previously I tried out Atal&#x27;s anti-aging serum at discounted rate, with the same opportunity, I try out their cleansing mask at a discounted rate as well in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I just want you to know that right away, before we go any further, in case that bothers you or you</li>
            <li>It is obvious when you are going to apply the mask (which ATAL provides a wonderful little scoop to get a small amount of the mask out).  </li>
            <li>My face has an entirely new feeling that as a guy, I&#x27;ve never felt before.</li>
            <li>Not only was my face softer, but after using it three times in one week, I really did see a reduction in the size of my pores and my skin really seemed brighter to me.  </li>
            <li>I have only ever used the cheap ones from local department stores.</li>
            <li>By this, I mean to make sure that your face is free of moisture and that are your hands are dry as well.</li>
            <li>After I washed it off, my skin was very soft and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation at all...</li>
            <li>I have ordered ATAL products in the past and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>In fact, I chose to use this on my decollate area and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I think it actually removed some of the redness I have on the first use.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on it seemed to burn just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>Can I just say wow!  </li>
            <li>Recently, as my skin is changing I have been looking into the idea of a home clay mask to help in smoothing out my skin and reduces my large pores.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it at all so it will last a while.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, was concerned I might have a reaction.  </li>
            <li>it works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom of 5 and at the age where I&#x27;m suffering with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>even some of the &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My pores looked smaller and absolutely clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take much to cover our faces which means it should last a while.</li>
            <li>My complexion seemed to look better and the one red pimple that I had looked less red and swollen after the mask.</li>
            <li>I decided to use it after a hot shower to open my pores and using my facial scrub to help removed any excess peeling skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my teen daughter joined me for the facial.</li>
            <li>It is dark green in color and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>It rinses off very easily and leaves no residue behind.</li>
            <li>I usually have HUGE pores on my nose and chin along with blackheads.</li>
            <li>I have used it about four times now and have seen a marked improvement on my pores and the general glow of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 year old male who doesn&#x27;t have much experience with facial cleansers but after being offered this at a promotional discount I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>I also used the back of the little spoon/scooper to smooth out areas of the mask on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type to usually use pre-packaged one-time only facial masks whenever I needed to refresh my face/skin because it&#x27;s more convenient.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the container I was a little surprised to see that it was a greenish color.  </li>
            <li>The fact that I&#x27;ve used it so few times and have not only seen some improvement in my skin, but also the container looks like I haven&#x27;t even touched it and will therefore clearly last quite a while, tells me this product is high quality and worth the cost.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a professional facial before, and the results of this mask are comparable.</li>
            <li>I have never really been a mask person but now, thanks to ATAL , it will be a staple.</li>
            <li>I am a 51 year old woman who has become disenchanted with the idea of facial masks, throughout the years.</li>
            <li>I have used it four times so far and my pores seem smaller already.  </li>
            <li>The texture was silky smooth and thick to touch.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly leaving the clay on to dry (which was between 10-15 minutes) , and after only 3 days my face feels firmer, skin softer, and my pores are noticeably smaller!</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, seriously!</li>
            <li>This also washes off very easily; much easier than my other mud mask.  </li>
            <li>My face is the softest it has been in a long time, and it was soft even before applying moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>The clay facial is green and kind of like a gel/mud, not sure how to describe it</li>
            <li>I have been suffering with hormonal breakouts lately, and haven&#x27;t really found much that helps with it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I started to apply the product because it&#x27;s actually got a gel texture even though it looks like a traditional clay mask.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s not essential for me, it is definitely a bonus that the mask has all natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will be looking at the other products this company has to offer.  </li>
            <li>My face is less oily and so much softer and my blemishes have gone away.</li>
            <li>I only use a thin layer on my face and it spreads easily.  </li>

            <li> It gives you a warm sensation when applied.</li>
            <li> but I actually liked it.  </li>
            <li> I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice spoon</li>
            <li> I then rinsed it off and felt nice and refreshed and</li>
            <li> It takes a minute but it is nice and not unbearable, unlike some masks I have used.</li>
            <li> When I received the box it was in a bubble wrapped mailer, box was nice and the product was wrapped well.</li>
            <li> Nice scent to boot.</li>

            <li> Some I liked and some</li>
            <li> I got this on aone time promotional offer to provide my honest review.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this product come up for review!!</li>
            <li> No matter how well you clean your face, it is always a great idea to use a clay mask once or twice a week to rid your skin of impurities.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone whom would like a great cleanser, purifier, pore reducer, and skin smoother all at once!</li>
            <li> am so very glad that I was able review this product during a promotional period.</li>
            <li> Very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> I loved how silky smooth it glides on</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and luxurious when applied, and smells good to boot.</li>
            <li> My experiences are authentic and honest.  </li>

            <li> I love this mask and its nice to put on your skin</li>
            <li> It rinses fairly well with cool water.</li>
            <li> It tingles in a most pleasant way and dries quickly (within 10-15 minutes).  </li>
            <li> It came off easily with warm water &amp; a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> But I was very interested in trying out this product because I read that this clay contains so many beneficial ingredients that&#x27;s good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this product during a promotional period, which might explain why I was so gleeful to smear it about my chest.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> After only 4 uses those results are impressive in my book.</li>
            <li> With this clay facial mask, I was most impressed by the gel like texture, that left my face feeling great after the fact!</li>
            <li> I found the smell refreshing with a hit of mint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many mud masks in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure the application would be easier if one used a makeup brush to apply to the face.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the cute packaging it comes in too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was able to get a lower price for trying it.</li>
            <li> They mostly claim to tighten skin and close your pores.</li>
            <li> I had a cut on my forehead and wasn&#x27;t sure if I should use it or not  on the area.  </li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this mask makes my skin feel and use it now a couple of times a week.  </li>
            <li> so I made sure to test an area on my face before using this product, just in case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of facial treatments over the years, and this one is excellent.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it absorbs the excess oil that seems to be always present-even after washing.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing and not too over powering.</li>
            <li> and I am glad to give it a raving review.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this as part of a promotion</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I was able to add this to my repertoire of beauty products.</li>
            <li> I have used many clay masks before.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product its like a minty peppermint smell to me</li>
            <li> this improves the over all quality of my face and so glad.</li>
            <li> I’m in LOVE with this.</li>
            <li> It was easy to wash off and my pores looked smaller and my skin felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> My skin felt and looked very clean.</li>
            <li> It has a cool like mint feeling that kind of tingles but not...</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the mud has a creamy consistency and is really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, and this product is perfect for that, as for all of the ATAL products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> My skin felt and looked smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> First of all, it comes in an elegant looking jar packed inside a nice box.</li>
            <li> The mask texture is a bit gel and clay mixture, which makes it easy to spread across instead of clumping in one spot as some clay mask might do.</li>
            <li> It smooths on evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> I just use my finger, and though I easily get some of the clay on my finger to apply on my face, there is a sort of taught, or viscous, surface.  </li>
            <li> This easily has become a part of my weekly routine.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily.</li>
            <li> The mask is easy to scoop out of the container using the provided scoop and spreads easily across you</li>
            <li> It goes on easily-</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older,  I am always looking for good products to use on my skin for anti aging benefits.</li>
            <li> The jar is high quality and has a good weight to it when being handled.</li>
            <li> In fact I found it to be very gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this product at a special discount when I joined the ATAL VIP Membership Club.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> but it dries pretty fast and is not coming off lol .</li>
            <li> I had used the serum made by ATAL previously and was impressed,  </li>
            <li> I also have huge pores and overtime.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the product has a light &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> It went on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> It  is certified Gluten Free and Vegan.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel nice when done, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin one way or another.  </li>
            <li> I took some fun ribbing from my kids who found it hilarious</li>
            <li> Atal Skin Solutions has a great clay facial mask.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth, looked clearer and invigorated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used various ATAL products before and they have all worked great.  </li>
            <li> Once I wash off the mask, I notice that my skin is smooth and tighter.  </li>
            <li> face looked smooth and felt super clean!</li>
            <li> When the mask was first on the face there was a strong stinging sensation for about a minute, but after that it gradually turns into a tinkling and refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li> I like to open my pores before I use this by placing a very warm cloth over my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good idea to use a steamer or warm water to open your pores up before you use the products, I like to use it immediately after the hot shower.</li>
            <li> When I washed it off I was amazed at how clean, smooth and silky my face felt.  </li>
            <li> I did have the slight burning feeling, but it was not painful, and quickly subsided, leaving me feeling great after!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t quite figure out what it is, but it&#x27;s familiar.</li>
            <li> I promise this is worth it!</li>
            <li> Despite years of research on the unique minerals in the sea&#x27;s water and mud, scientists still do not have the answer as to why sea mud, from the lowest place on earth, is so beneficial for the skin and body.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean each time that I use it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way - somewhere between a piece of chewing gum and flower  - and rinses totally clean.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a pull tab to open the secure packaging would be a good idea..</li>
            <li> I loved that fact that my face felt tighter and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> This mask is a compliment to their other products and they all work together beautifully.</li>
            <li> As with their other products, it comes beautifully packaged and sealed.</li>
            <li> and this makes my skin feel so nice and so smooth and look so nice after using gives me a tight look that.</li>
            <li> ATAL has a wide variety of products and I have been happy with each one.</li>
            <li> this is most definitely a real clay mask.</li>
            <li> Was able to keep it on the whole 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> There was a light and pleasant tingle as it dried and when it was time to wash off, it was quite easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I started off with a clean freshly washed face.</li>
            <li> it felt so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was able to purchase this during a recent promotion.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and immediately shrinks your pores.</li>
            <li> if I am going somewhere special because I like the fresh face look.</li>
            <li> I tried this out with some skepticism about this kind of product in general</li>
            <li> What I am most excited about is just how soft my face was after using the mask.  </li>
            <li> First off, there is NO comparison to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> Our faces were left nice &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> I love trying different skin care products, so when the ATAL Clay Facial mask was available through a recent promotion, I was more than happy to give it a try.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product and such a sleek jar and design!</li>
            <li> It works so well to reduce any inflammation/redness on my skin, helps to clear up the acne, and just leaves it looking better.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pleased and surprised that I did see results with this ATAL clay gel mask.  </li>
            <li> I was offered this facial mask at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> It washes on easy and your skin feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I left it on for bout 15 mins and washed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I waited until the mask completely hardened on my face before rinsing it off with warm water and my face felt really refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> If smells quite fresh</li>
            <li> What a powerful mask.</li>
            <li> After about the first ten minutes the tightening became more and more intense.</li>
            <li> (make sure your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it first, obvs)</li>
            <li> After I washed my face, my skin has the &#x27;cool&#x27; sensation and I felt that it has cleaned my pores very well.</li>
            <li> It seemed to smooth out my skin a little and shrink pore size, and I liked the feel of my skin after I used it.</li>
            <li> and it really helped reduce inflammation quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it does not dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li> but, its not thick or cakey, its soft and goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li> I love to use facial products on my face.</li>
            <li> This facial mask was a surprise to me, I decided to give it a try and review it when I saw it on promotion, and I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> First, there is a gel quality to it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used what I would consider a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; face mask.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a pretty good reduction in a few acne scars.</li>
            <li> First, I must say I am a religious ATAL customer, and love all of their products I have.</li>
            <li> The jar comes with a durable scooping spoon, which I really appreciate!</li>
            <li> I used it the first day it arrived</li>
            <li> I love the way this product left my face feeling!</li>
            <li> Not a fake perfumey smell at all.  </li>
            <li> It felt so smooth, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the way my skin felt after just one use of the Clay Facial Mask by ATAL.  </li>
            <li> Not at all disturbing but knew smoothing wonderful was happening.  </li>
            <li> it is the first mask that I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My skin complexion is more even also since starting to use this product.</li>
            <li> I used promotional code to get my first container.</li>
            <li> was really smooth feeling skiing that felt hydrated and completely soothed.  </li>
            <li> Upon using this clay, I was able to feel instant smoothness on my face.  </li>
            <li> I love how this comes with a scraper to grab the product so you do not contaminating the product that is left inside the jar.</li>
            <li> the mask is a think green and was glad for the spoon as I did not get it all stuck under my nails witch would be easy to do when getting it out.</li>
            <li> Love this mask, plus it&#x27;s a great excuse to take a small break from the day to pamper myself!</li>
            <li> My review is the result of a promotional distribution and my opinions in this review are a direct result of my own personal use.  </li>
            <li> And to make it even better, if you are not satisfied, they will let you return your cleanser for a full refund!  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have caught a promotion for this clay gel mask, but I would pay full price for this in a heart beat.  </li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> I have used Atal’s products in the past and loved the end results every time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a amazing product in a small jar but so worth it and made me face feel divine after using it.</li>
            <li> The clay was easy to apply, I left it on for about 10-15 minutes, it hardened and washed off with ease.</li>
            <li> My skin was super soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Sometimes they are so strong that your face feels like it&#x27;s actually burning.</li>
            <li> Through all the clinical trials conducted in hospitals on a range of medical problems including skin diseases, arthritis, and even cancer in patients undergoing chemotherapy have shown that the high concentration of sea minerals is almost instantly effective in improving the skin&#x27;s natural process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pure luxury combination.  </li>
            <li> While it certainly feels as though your skin is tightening while wearing the masks, once washed off the effects fade away.</li>
            <li> The jar is attractive looking and comes with a small spatula to keep from contaminating the product with bare fingers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have another mud mask, which I really like, but this clay gel mask is not at all like the mud mask.  </li>
            <li> My face really does feel cleaner after</li>
            <li> I truly found this clay mask a very divine experience and would recommend adding it to your weekly cleansing regimens.</li>
            <li> And of course I don&#x27;t need much make up because my face is glowing and problem</li>
            <li> This mask helped close up the cut, helping to heal much faster than it was.  </li>
            <li> Nothing that would make me run to rinse off, just lets you know it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> Just some warm water and my hands will wash the dried clay off my face.  </li>
            <li> The blackheads are almost completely gone!!!</li>
            <li> It exfoliates my skin which makes my other products work better.  </li>
            <li> This summer so far has been hot and very humid with lots of rain.</li>
            <li> and I felt a lovely tingling sensation for the first few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Overall I have really enjoyed this product since it offers high quality natural ingredients without breaking one&#x27;s bank.</li>
            <li> You definitely don’t need much and it goes on smooth and easily with the little scoop/spoon that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> My daughter said it slightly burned, but what I felt was more of a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I thought it was very thoughtful to include a little scooper to scoop up the clay mask to avoid contamination.</li>
            <li> was I surprised how small my pores were and how smooth and blemish free</li>
            <li> The container is pretty enough to just leave out on your bathroom counter and the clay mask has a nice scent that is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive-ish skin.</li>
            <li> This product assists in cell regeneration and repair and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin to certain products and I never know until I try it.</li>
            <li> Even though I am 60 years old, I have large pores that are unsightly and can lead to acne.  </li>
            <li> I l love that it comes with a little scoop type scraper so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting your fingers in the jar and contaminating the clay.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft and smooth… I want a jar for my body…PLEASE!!  </li>
            <li> It felt a little tingly and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always very cautious when trying out products on my face.</li>
            <li> I will give it a few more applications.</li>
            <li> But, what sticky gunk normally is?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Previously I tried out Atal&#x27;s anti-aging serum at discounted rate, with the same opportunity, I try out their cleansing mask at a discounted rate as well in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I just want you to know that right away, before we go any further, in case that bothers you or you</li>
            <li> It is obvious when you are going to apply the mask (which ATAL provides a wonderful little scoop to get a small amount of the mask out).  </li>
            <li> My face has an entirely new feeling that as a guy, I&#x27;ve never felt before.</li>
            <li> Not only was my face softer, but after using it three times in one week, I really did see a reduction in the size of my pores and my skin really seemed brighter to me.  </li>
            <li> I have only ever used the cheap ones from local department stores.</li>
            <li> By this, I mean to make sure that your face is free of moisture and that are your hands are dry as well.</li>
            <li> After I washed it off, my skin was very soft and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation at all...</li>
            <li> I have ordered ATAL products in the past and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> In fact, I chose to use this on my decollate area and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I think it actually removed some of the redness I have on the first use.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on it seemed to burn just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Can I just say wow!  </li>
            <li> Recently, as my skin is changing I have been looking into the idea of a home clay mask to help in smoothing out my skin and reduces my large pores.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it at all so it will last a while.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, was concerned I might have a reaction.  </li>
            <li> it works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of 5 and at the age where I&#x27;m suffering with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> even some of the &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My pores looked smaller and absolutely clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take much to cover our faces which means it should last a while.</li>
            <li> My complexion seemed to look better and the one red pimple that I had looked less red and swollen after the mask.</li>
            <li> I decided to use it after a hot shower to open my pores and using my facial scrub to help removed any excess peeling skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my teen daughter joined me for the facial.</li>
            <li> It is dark green in color and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> It rinses off very easily and leaves no residue behind.</li>
            <li> I usually have HUGE pores on my nose and chin along with blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have used it about four times now and have seen a marked improvement on my pores and the general glow of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old male who doesn&#x27;t have much experience with facial cleansers but after being offered this at a promotional discount I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I also used the back of the little spoon/scooper to smooth out areas of the mask on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type to usually use pre-packaged one-time only facial masks whenever I needed to refresh my face/skin because it&#x27;s more convenient.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the container I was a little surprised to see that it was a greenish color.  </li>
            <li> The fact that I&#x27;ve used it so few times and have not only seen some improvement in my skin, but also the container looks like I haven&#x27;t even touched it and will therefore clearly last quite a while, tells me this product is high quality and worth the cost.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a professional facial before, and the results of this mask are comparable.</li>
            <li> I have never really been a mask person but now, thanks to ATAL , it will be a staple.</li>
            <li> I am a 51 year old woman who has become disenchanted with the idea of facial masks, throughout the years.</li>
            <li> I have used it four times so far and my pores seem smaller already.  </li>
            <li> The texture was silky smooth and thick to touch.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly leaving the clay on to dry (which was between 10-15 minutes) , and after only 3 days my face feels firmer, skin softer, and my pores are noticeably smaller!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, seriously!</li>
            <li> This also washes off very easily; much easier than my other mud mask.  </li>
            <li> My face is the softest it has been in a long time, and it was soft even before applying moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> The clay facial is green and kind of like a gel/mud, not sure how to describe it</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with hormonal breakouts lately, and haven&#x27;t really found much that helps with it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I started to apply the product because it&#x27;s actually got a gel texture even though it looks like a traditional clay mask.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s not essential for me, it is definitely a bonus that the mask has all natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will be looking at the other products this company has to offer.  </li>
            <li> My face is less oily and so much softer and my blemishes have gone away.</li>
            <li> I only use a thin layer on my face and it spreads easily.  </li>
            <li> It comes sealed which while nice is just a little difficult to get off.  </li>
            <li> I have had other clay masks that were much more difficult and lingered even after several rinses with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I recommend use this product once a week only since it will dry up the skin to reduce excess oil.</li>
            <li> That is absolutely the only negative thing I have to say about it.  </li>
            <li> It was dry within 10 minutes, but we left it on for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see the little spoon that comes with it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and you cannot go wrong with it…</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly clear on what it is suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> Above my eyebrows is less coarse from sun damage and the crepeness has also improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other clay masks I have used in the past have been much thinner and had perfumey scent-</li>
            <li> My skin was not at all red after removal, unable with many others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Then it starts to dry and is all done to remove in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> but it does dry.</li>
            <li> I let it completely dry for</li>
            <li> I felt I needed some moisturizing afterwards though my skin did not feel overly dry.</li>
            <li> I washed my face, patted it dry and then applied the mask.  </li>
            <li> The instructions indicate that you should let the clay mask dry for 10 to 15 minutes</li>
            <li> but I like to leave it on for thirty minutes and read or relax as I let the clay mask dry.</li>
            <li> When I opened it up, I’m not sure what I was expecting, but I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> Any mask I have used in the past has left my face somewhat blotchy red.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my pores appeared smaller and my face appeared a little brighter.</li>
            <li> No such issues at all, there was a little burning feeling, almost like peppermint on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products that work well for sensitive skin--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deep, muddy, blackish green the color of avocado peels.</li>
            <li> The consistency is similar to children&#x27;s finger paint and the color looks like Army Green.</li>
            <li> The product was mailed in a bubble wrapped mailer, box was nice and the product was wrapped well, but unfortunately the plastic scoop that came with the product was broken</li>
            <li> about 15 -20 minutes while I did other things, and then rinsed my face thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> With other masks I would sometimes need to remove sooner due to irritation &amp; itching but not with this one.</li>
            <li> But ATAL made it different with their ingredients to combat the usual.</li>
            <li> free.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other masks</li>
            <li> I use other Atal products.</li>
            <li> I put a a small amount on my skin left it on for about fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> Thou this company makes other beauty products</li>
            <li> I walked about and did a little tidying around the house as I allowed the mask to dry.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry like rock hard like you would think</li>
            <li> I use this product also and they look like they have gone down.</li>
            <li> It is not a pretty thing to put on your face, sort of a yucky green.  </li>
            <li> This product is made of glacial marine clay combined with other anti aging ingredients like aloe vera, green tea,  licorice root,  and vitamins B</li>
            <li> The mask comes in a small container, but a little goes a long way with this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly minty, medicinal scent to it, but also an earthy tone.</li>
            <li> It gave a slight tingle that lets you know it was working.</li>
            <li> Comes with a little scoop to help get it out which was helpful.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little application spoon thing that comes with it, but I opted to use by fingers.</li>
            <li> I comes with a little spatula to scoop it out and put it on your fingers.</li>
            <li> When I put it on it felt a little slimy  </li>
            <li> I used the little scoop to remove the amount that I wanted to use from the jar.</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little tighter after the use.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes along way.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little scoop so you don&#x27;t have to waste any of the product by getting it on your hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now realizing what a waste of time and money I put in to that junk.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to write a review for this mask by ATAL.  </li>
            <li> It dries in just a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel stiff</li>
            <li> I use this after using my skin looks brighter and the pores looks small or less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It is a dark olive-y green and it has the consistency of a thick pudding.</li>
            <li> Another little bonus is the small spoon/ spatula thingy that is included so you don&#x27;t have to stick your fingers in the jar.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount using the spatula.</li>
            <li> You know when you see the selling point &amp;#34;9 of 10 women saw results?&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m usually that 1 woman that doesn&#x27;t see results.  </li>
            <li> No trace of the deeply-pgmented elixirs were left behind!</li>
            <li> It came with a small plastic scoop as well.</li>
            <li> My moisturizer soaked in faster than usual.</li>
            <li> Additionally my face felt softer than usual.</li>
            <li> It came with a small spatula to use and mix up.</li>
            <li> It also came with a small spoon style applicator.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to put on the face with your finger</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer evenly all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I then applied it all over my face went on about my household things was slightly afraid of it dripping or coming off</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like to get your hands dirty, get over it!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Previously I tried out Atal&#x27;s anti-aging serum at discounted rate, with the same opportunity, I try out their cleansing mask at a discounted rate as well in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The product was mailed in a bubble wrapped mailer, box was nice and the product was wrapped well, but unfortunately the plastic scoop that came with the product was broken so it was a bit of bummer; since the product is not affected, it&#x27;s not a big deal. It&#x27;s good idea to use a steamer or warm water to open your pores up before you use the products, I like to use it immediately after the hot shower. With a cosmetic spoon, I scoop out about a nickle size of the product and brushed it evenly over my face. The mask texture is a bit gel and clay mixture, which makes it easy to spread across instead of clumping in one spot as some clay mask might do. I can feel the &#x27;cleansing&#x27; feel as I let the mask on my face for about 15 minutes. After I washed my face, my skin has the &#x27;cool&#x27; sensation and I felt that it has cleaned my pores very well. I recommend use this product once a week only since it will dry up the skin to reduce excess oil. Follow by the mask, I used the anti-aging face serum so that I hydrate and moist my skin, making it softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I love to use facial products on my face. I ordered this Facial Clay mask by ATAL during a promotion. I have ordered ATAL products in the past and have always been satisfied. The jar is attractive looking and comes with a small spatula to keep from contaminating the product with bare fingers. I like that the product is organic and not tested on animals. I noticed that the product has a light &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; scent. I knew after I applied this to my face, my face would feel invigorated. I applied a small amount using the spatula. It smooths on evenly and easily. It rinses fairly well with cool water. After using the product for 2 weeks, (the directions say to use weekly, but I used it 3 times a week) I noticed that my pores appeared smaller and my face appeared a little brighter. My skin feels clean each time that I use it. ATAL has a wide variety of products and I have been happy with each one. I have oily skin in the T-zone and this has improved.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product and such a sleek jar and design! This product is wonderful. It gives you a warm sensation when applied. Spa treatment feeling at home! I l love that it comes with a little scoop type scraper so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting your fingers in the jar and contaminating the clay.  Smells wonderfully minty. I am so glad I was able to purchase this during a recent promotion. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I tried this out with some skepticism about this kind of product in general but I actually liked it.  It seemed to smooth out my skin a little and shrink pore size, and I liked the feel of my skin after I used it. I also thought there would only be enough of it for a couple of uses but I didn&#x27;t have to use much of it at all so it will last a while.  Comes with a little scoop to help get it out which was helpful.</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used this face mask, I&#x27;ve had great results. My face is less oily and so much softer and my blemishes have gone away. My face looks clearer and cleaner after every wash. I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin. I love the fact that the mud has a creamy consistency and is really easy to apply. My regimen has been once a week and before I apply the mask I use a facial steamer to open my pores. It works so well to reduce any inflammation/redness on my skin, helps to clear up the acne, and just leaves it looking better. I saw this was offered for a promotion and I jumped at the opportunity!</li>
            <li> This facial mask was a surprise to me, I decided to give it a try and review it when I saw it on promotion, and I am glad that I did.  I&#x27;ve had a professional facial before, and the results of this mask are comparable. The jar is high quality and has a good weight to it when being handled. There&#x27;s a little application spoon thing that comes with it, but I opted to use by fingers. I was surprised when I started to apply the product because it&#x27;s actually got a gel texture even though it looks like a traditional clay mask. It went on so smoothly. There was a light and pleasant tingle as it dried and when it was time to wash off, it was quite easy to remove. I knew I would be reviewing it, so I took photos, but you can see the difference! I use this mask along with the eye creme. the ATAL company has my attention!</li>
            <li> This is a unique clay mask, and in a very good way.  I have another mud mask, which I really like, but this clay gel mask is not at all like the mud mask.  First, there is a gel quality to it.  It is obvious when you are going to apply the mask (which ATAL provides a wonderful little scoop to get a small amount of the mask out).  I just use my finger, and though I easily get some of the clay on my finger to apply on my face, there is a sort of taught, or viscous, surface.  I only use a thin layer on my face and it spreads easily.  I can feel this mask working.  It tingles in a most pleasant way and dries quickly (within 10-15 minutes).  This also washes off very easily; much easier than my other mud mask.  Just some warm water and my hands will wash the dried clay off my face.  What I am most excited about is just how soft my face was after using the mask.  My face is the softest it has been in a long time, and it was soft even before applying moisturizer!  You know when you see the selling point &amp;#34;9 of 10 women saw results?&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m usually that 1 woman that doesn&#x27;t see results.  But I&#x27;m pleased and surprised that I did see results with this ATAL clay gel mask.  Not only was my face softer, but after using it three times in one week, I really did see a reduction in the size of my pores and my skin really seemed brighter to me.  I was lucky enough to have caught a promotion for this clay gel mask, but I would pay full price for this in a heart beat.  There are quality ingredients, the jar looks fancy, it feels great when you use it, and it gave me results.  I&#x27;ve been pleased with ATAL skin care products, as their anti-aging serum is wonderful as well.  Using this and the serum combined gave me excellent results.  Great products from a great company.  I truly do not have any cons to tell you about this clay gel mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s green. I just want you to know that right away, before we go any further, in case that bothers you or you are scared like I was. It&#x27;s deep, muddy, blackish green the color of avocado peels. It smells delightful, but might take a moment to summon the courage to put it on your pores. This is not a facial mask you&#x27;re going to want to grind into your nose. In fact, I chose to use this on my decollate area and was pleasantly surprised! It leaves a very nice scent in it&#x27;s way - somewhere between a piece of chewing gum and flower  - and rinses totally clean. No trace of the deeply-pgmented elixirs were left behind! I was able to get this product during a promotional period, which might explain why I was so gleeful to smear it about my chest. Have at it, you.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used what I would consider a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; face mask. I have only ever used the cheap ones from local department stores. I was offered this facial mask at a discount in exchange for my honest review. First off, there is NO comparison to the cheap stuff. I&#x27;m now realizing what a waste of time and money I put in to that junk. I have had this for 3 weeks and I have used it 4 times. It is suggested to use it once per week. I like that it comes with an applicator though it&#x27;s not necessary. It goes on smooth and spreads easily. It dries in just a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel stiff and like I can&#x27;t talk. It rinses off very easily and leaves no residue behind. My face really does feel cleaner after and I love the smell. Can&#x27;t quite figure out what it is, but it&#x27;s familiar. The best part about using this clay mask is I have noticed my pores are shrinking. I usually have HUGE pores on my nose and chin along with blackheads. The blackheads are almost completely gone!!! I have also noticed a pretty good reduction in a few acne scars.Yes, I am one of those people that has a habit of picking at pimples. After only 4 uses those results are impressive in my book. Though it&#x27;s not essential for me, it is definitely a bonus that the mask has all natural and organic ingredients. The fact that I&#x27;ve used it so few times and have not only seen some improvement in my skin, but also the container looks like I haven&#x27;t even touched it and will therefore clearly last quite a while, tells me this product is high quality and worth the cost.   I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions. I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced. If I encounter any issues in the future, I will update my review and adjust my rating accordingly.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with hormonal breakouts lately, and haven&#x27;t really found much that helps with it. So when I got the chance to receive the promotional offer, I jumped! First, I must say I am a religious ATAL customer, and love all of their products I have. With this clay facial mask, I was most impressed by the gel like texture, that left my face feeling great after the fact! I did have the slight burning feeling, but it was not painful, and quickly subsided, leaving me feeling great after! I followed the instructions exactly leaving the clay on to dry (which was between 10-15 minutes) , and after only 3 days my face feels firmer, skin softer, and my pores are noticeably smaller! The jar comes with a durable scooping spoon, which I really appreciate! I have pretty sensitive skin, and this product is perfect for that, as for all of the ATAL products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after hearing a friend rave about it and guess what?  My wife LOVED it as well.  She said it made her skin feel better than anything she has used in 10 years and is a fan for life!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this product come up for review!! I could not wait to get it and try it out. I used it the first day it arrived and I continue to use it twice a week. I really love this stuff, seriously! I have oily, acne prone skin and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, fair complexion. I also have sensitive skin to certain products and I never know until I try it. The clay facial is green and kind of like a gel/mud, not sure how to describe it but, its not thick or cakey, its soft and goes on smooth and light. It has a cool like mint feeling that kind of tingles but not...I think it feels so good. Then it starts to dry and is all done to remove in 15 minutes. It does not dry like rock hard like you would think but it does dry. It washes on easy and your skin feels soft and clean. I was very impressed with the way it goes on and the way it makes my skin feel. I think it actually removed some of the redness I have on the first use. I comes with a little spatula to scoop it out and put it on your fingers. that way you don&#x27;t have to dig in the jar every time. Smells very nice. definitely buying again and again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product left my face feeling! I washed my face in shower before getting out to do the mask. It comes with a nice spoon so help scoop out the product. the mask is a think green and was glad for the spoon as I did not get it all stuck under my nails witch would be easy to do when getting it out. I then applied it all over my face went on about my household things was slightly afraid of it dripping or coming off but it dries pretty fast and is not coming off lol . I then rinsed it off and felt nice and refreshed and face looked smooth and felt super clean!</li>
            <li> I have used ATAL products before and have been very pleased with them. When they offer me a discount to try this clay mask and review it, I was happy to do so! It came in a very nice box, perfect if you thinking about gifting this product.  When I opened it up, I’m not sure what I was expecting, but I was surprised.  The other clay masks I have used in the past have been much thinner and had perfumey scent- this is most definitely a real clay mask. It is a dark olive-y green and it has the consistency of a thick pudding. It has a slightly minty, medicinal scent to it, but also an earthy tone. Not a fake perfumey smell at all.  If you don&#x27;t like to get your hands dirty, get over it!  I promise this is worth it! Once I started putting this all over my face I was surprised at the lack of the normal tingle I usually get from a mask… not to worry the tingle comes, it just isn’t instant.  It takes a minute but it is nice and not unbearable, unlike some masks I have used. I left it on for about 20 minutes (I got distracted) and when I washed it off, I definitely felt refreshed.  I have used it about four times now and have seen a marked improvement on my pores and the general glow of my skin. Love this mask, plus it&#x27;s a great excuse to take a small break from the day to pamper myself!</li>
            <li> I have used Atal’s products in the past and loved the end results every time. I decided I wanted to add to my daily cleansing by trying ATAL Clay Face Mask.  It was wonderful to find this product during a promotional period. When I received the box it was in a bubble wrapped mailer, box was nice and the product was wrapped well. It came with a small plastic scoop as well. I found the smell refreshing with a hit of mint. I had just had been sun burned a week prior to receiving the mask. So my face had already begun to peel. YUCK! I decided to use it after a hot shower to open my pores and using my facial scrub to help removed any excess peeling skin. The texture was silky smooth and thick to touch. It gave a slight tingle that lets you know it was working. I let it completely dry for about 15 -20 minutes while I did other things, and then rinsed my face thoroughly.  I loved that fact that my face felt tighter and not dry at all. It felt so smooth, silky, and soft. To my surprise I had “NO” peeling skin left. Any mask I have used in the past has left my face somewhat blotchy red. This made me happy that this product did not do that to my skin at all. In fact I found it to be very gentle and effective. I followed with a moisturizer lotion and recommend if you have an acne problem to use a toner before using a moisturizer. I truly found this clay mask a very divine experience and would recommend adding it to your weekly cleansing regimens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old male who doesn&#x27;t have much experience with facial cleansers but after being offered this at a promotional discount I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The clay was easy to apply, I left it on for about 10-15 minutes, it hardened and washed off with ease. My face has an entirely new feeling that as a guy, I&#x27;ve never felt before. This easily has become a part of my weekly routine. Would recommend to all any gender!</li>
            <li> When I first put it on it seemed to burn just a tiny bit. Thought I would need to remove it sooner than later but that was not the case. Was able to keep it on the whole 10 minutes. The burning sensation went away. With other masks I would sometimes need to remove sooner due to irritation &amp; itching but not with this one. My skin was not at all red after removal, unable with many others I have used in the past. I felt I needed some moisturizing afterwards though my skin did not feel overly dry. My moisturizer soaked in faster than usual. Nice scent to boot. Additionally my face felt softer than usual.</li>
            <li> They say that the cure for cancer will be found in the sea. Despite years of research on the unique minerals in the sea&#x27;s water and mud, scientists still do not have the answer as to why sea mud, from the lowest place on earth, is so beneficial for the skin and body. Through all the clinical trials conducted in hospitals on a range of medical problems including skin diseases, arthritis, and even cancer in patients undergoing chemotherapy have shown that the high concentration of sea minerals is almost instantly effective in improving the skin&#x27;s natural process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many mud masks in my lifetime. Sometimes they are so strong that your face feels like it&#x27;s actually burning. But ATAL made it different with their ingredients to combat the usual. This mask is a compliment to their other products and they all work together beautifully. As with their other products, it comes beautifully packaged and sealed. I was pleasantly surprised to see the little spoon that comes with it. That was a great touch and as soon as I put it on I saw why. If several people are using the mask, it keeps it sanitary. I loved how silky smooth it glides on and it&#x27;s not too thick. It doesn&#x27;t burn, it&#x27;s just a pleasant tingle. It dries quickly and immediately shrinks your pores. When I washed it off, I felt like my face couldn&#x27;t be any cleaner. I followed it up with ATAL&#x27;s Ultimate Age Defying Serum and their Velvet Eye Serum. It&#x27;s a pure luxury combination.  I wonder what they&#x27;ll make next. I was able to purchase this product at a special discount when I joined the ATAL VIP Membership Club. You should too. I&#x27;m a forever fan!</li>
            <li> It made me feel like i was having a spa treatment. It came with a small spatula to use and mix up. When I put it on it felt a little slimy  but then there was a wonderful warming feeling and tingly feeling.I left it on for bout 15 mins and washed it off with warm water. It was easy to wash off and my pores looked smaller and my skin felt wonderful. It  is certified Gluten Free and Vegan.I would recommend ATAL clay mask. Just run a bath, put some music on and,few candles.Add the ATAL clay mask let the relaxing feeling of the mask take you away. I DID RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT  PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type to usually use pre-packaged one-time only facial masks whenever I needed to refresh my face/skin because it&#x27;s more convenient. But I was very interested in trying out this product because I read that this clay contains so many beneficial ingredients that&#x27;s good for the skin. It wasn&#x27;t hard to put on the face with your finger but I&#x27;m sure the application would be easier if one used a makeup brush to apply to the face. I thought it was very thoughtful to include a little scooper to scoop up the clay mask to avoid contamination. When the mask was first on the face there was a strong stinging sensation for about a minute, but after that it gradually turns into a tinkling and refreshing sensation. I waited until the mask completely hardened on my face before rinsing it off with warm water and my face felt really refreshed afterwards. My complexion seemed to look better and the one red pimple that I had looked less red and swollen after the mask. Overall I have really enjoyed this product since it offers high quality natural ingredients without breaking one&#x27;s bank. Not to mention the cute packaging it comes in too!&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a discounted price in exchanged for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to write a review for this mask by ATAL.  I was able to get a lower price for trying it. I have never really been a mask person but now, thanks to ATAL , it will be a staple. Even though I am 60 years old, I have large pores that are unsightly and can lead to acne.  This summer so far has been hot and very humid with lots of rain. Sometines it&#x27;s so humid I can only wear a tinted sunblock. When the rain finally stops for a couple of days, I used the mask and boy! was I surprised how small my pores were and how smooth and blemish free my skin was after the mask. It is not a pretty thing to put on your face, sort of a yucky green.  But remember it is marine clay and that is the marine color.  There are vitamins in there too like niacinamide (vitamin B3), aloe vera and licorice root.extract. Now I use it every week, rain or shine, sometimes twice if I am going somewhere special because I like the fresh face look. And of course I don&#x27;t need much make up because my face is glowing and problem free.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other masks, ATAL has a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so I will update review if needed. I&#x27;m not exactly clear on what it is suppose to do.  It goes on like a clay mask and feels like a clay mask. It rinses easily. My skin does feel nice when done, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin one way or another.  I will give it a few more applications. I use other Atal products.</li>
            <li> I am a 51 year old woman who has become disenchanted with the idea of facial masks, throughout the years. They mostly claim to tighten skin and close your pores. While it certainly feels as though your skin is tightening while wearing the masks, once washed off the effects fade away. Recently, as my skin is changing I have been looking into the idea of a home clay mask to help in smoothing out my skin and reduces my large pores. So, when I was offered ATAL Clay Facial Mask at a promotional discount, I decided to give it a try. I have used the mask three times and can already feel and see an improvement in not only the size of my pores, but the texture of my skin. Above my eyebrows is less coarse from sun damage and the crepeness has also improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that the best results cam when I APPLIED THE PRODUCT AS INSTRUCTED. By this, I mean to make sure that your face is free of moisture and that are your hands are dry as well. This allows the clay to begin the drying/cleansing/moisturizing process. The mfg. provides a nice scooper so that your fingers never contaminate the product that is in the jar. The clay is not visually appealling. But, what sticky gunk normally is? Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the way my skin felt after just one use of the Clay Facial Mask by ATAL.  The packaging is very nice.  It comes sealed which while nice is just a little difficult to get off.  That is absolutely the only negative thing I have to say about it.  Perhaps a pull tab to open the secure packaging would be a good idea.. just my suggestion.  You definitely don’t need much and it goes on smooth and easily with the little scoop/spoon that comes with it.  Great for keeping the product from being contaminated.  If smells quite fresh and I felt a lovely tingling sensation for the first few minutes.  Not at all disturbing but knew smoothing wonderful was happening.  My granddaughters thought I was a monster.  Very easy to remove.  I have had other clay masks that were much more difficult and lingered even after several rinses with a washcloth.  My skin felt so soft and smooth… I want a jar for my body…PLEASE!!  Not drying at all as some clay mask cleanser can be.  I think it’s the shea butter and aloe vera combination.  This is a fabulous product and you cannot go wrong with it… Highly recommend and will be looking at the other products this company has to offer.  So happy to have taken advantage of a promotional offer... Delighted Grammy!</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing!!  I had a cut on my forehead and wasn&#x27;t sure if I should use it or not  on the area.  This mask helped close up the cut, helping to heal much faster than it was.  My skin was super soft after using it.  I do have sensitive skin, was concerned I might have a reaction.  No such issues at all, there was a little burning feeling, almost like peppermint on the skin.  Nothing that would make me run to rinse off, just lets you know it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> i love this product. it works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always very cautious when trying out products on my face. This one caught my eye, as I was part of a promotional group, and I&#x27;m so happy that I did. As soon as I put it on, I could immediately feel the cooling effects...it is the first mask that I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;. After I washed it off, my skin was very soft and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation at all...which is a definite plus!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive-ish skin.</li>
            <li> I got this as a promotional item. I tend to have oily acne prone skin. This product has made my skin softer. My skin complexion is more even also since starting to use this product. All in all, my skin looks and feels healthier and the redness and acne has improved.</li>
            <li> I had never actually tried a “mud” mask before testing this one.  I’ve used facial masks before, but never a clay one or one of this consistency.  When I first opened the container I was a little surprised to see that it was a greenish color.  I know, I shouldn’t have been, but I was.  I washed my face, patted it dry and then applied the mask.  It felt a little tingly and refreshing.  I walked about and did a little tidying around the house as I allowed the mask to dry.  I took some fun ribbing from my kids who found it hilarious seeing mom’s face covered in “mud”.  When I washed it off I was amazed at how clean, smooth and silky my face felt.  I love the way this mask makes my skin feel and use it now a couple of times a week.  I used promotional code to get my first container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of 5 and at the age where I&#x27;m suffering with adult acne.  Yuck!  I&#x27;ve been using various cleaning washes and creams to control the acne but they are drying out my skin.  When this clay mask was offered for a promotional price-I jumped at the chance to try it!  The container is pretty enough to just leave out on your bathroom counter and the clay mask has a nice scent that is not too heavy.  I have super sensitive skin so I made sure to test an area on my face before using this product, just in case.  The mask is easy to scoop out of the container using the provided scoop and spreads easily across you face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was left with was really smooth feeling skiing that felt hydrated and completely soothed.  I will be using this product again!  It&#x27;s hard to find products that work well for sensitive skin--even some of the &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34; products have left my face red, itching and irritated.</li>
            <li> Atal Skin Solutions has a great clay facial mask. I was very impressed with the detailing in the packaging. This clay mask comes with a spoon/scooper to scoop out the clay mask. This is a great addition to the mask as I always end up getting the mask under my fingernails. I started off with a clean freshly washed face. I used the little scoop to remove the amount that I wanted to use from the jar. I applied it liberally to my face and neck. I did avoid the eye area. I also used the back of the little spoon/scooper to smooth out areas of the mask on my face. I used a warm washcloth to wash it off my face after thirty minutes. The instructions indicate that you should let the clay mask dry for 10 to 15 minutes but I like to leave it on for thirty minutes and read or relax as I let the clay mask dry. I loved the invigorating feel of the mask as it was drying. My skin felt and looked very clean. My skin felt and looked smooth and healthy. No matter how well you clean your face, it is always a great idea to use a clay mask once or twice a week to rid your skin of impurities. I found that the Atal Skin Solutions Glacial Clay Mask worked wonders on my skin. My skin felt so smooth, looked clearer and invigorated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The opinions of the product are based on my experience with and use of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of facial treatments over the years, and this one is excellent. The texture is smooth and luxurious when applied, and smells good to boot. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all like some clay masks. Love the way my face feels after I use it! Pores are visibly smaller and it seems to be helping the &amp;#34;blackhead population&amp;#34; shrink from my chin. I&#x27;ve also used it as a spot treatment for larger blemishes and left it on overnight (make sure your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it first, obvs) and it really helped reduce inflammation quickly. Another little bonus is the small spoon/ spatula thingy that is included so you don&#x27;t have to stick your fingers in the jar. Will definitely be keeping this product stocked in my bathroom cabinet! I received a discount to purchase and review this item.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older,  I am always looking for good products to use on my skin for anti aging benefits. I had used the serum made by ATAL previously and was impressed,  so I decided to give this a try.  This product is made of glacial marine clay combined with other anti aging ingredients like aloe vera, green tea,  licorice root,  and vitamins B and E.&lt;br /&gt;A spatula is included with the clay. I like to open my pores before I use this by placing a very warm cloth over my face. Then I scoop some product out and spread it over my face. It goes on easily- no clumping.  I leave it on for the recommended 15 minutes -- but at times I forget and leave it longer-- and that hasn&#x27;t been a problem. I rinse it off with warm water.  I have oily skin and enlarged pores and I love the way it absorbs the excess oil that seems to be always present-even after washing. It also cleans out my pores well.  I have used it four times so far and my pores seem smaller already.  It exfoliates my skin which makes my other products work better.  It removes the oil,  but it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized. My skin tone is more even and I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this clay at a promotional price for evaluation and review purposes.  My experiences are authentic and honest.  I rely on the reviews of others when buying online and I like to leave my opinions on the products I use to assist others with their decision of whether or not to buy. This product assists in cell regeneration and repair and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Can I just say wow!  What a powerful mask. Seriously. I put a a small amount on my skin left it on for about fifteen minutes. There was a sensation of tightening which was pleasant. The scent is refreshing and not too over powering. After about the first ten minutes the tightening became more and more intense. I swear this stuff was pulling the goober out of skin.&lt;br /&gt;After I rinsed my face it felt so fresh and clean. My pores looked smaller and absolutely clean.&lt;br /&gt;I am so very glad that I was able review this product during a promotional period. This was a great mask by Atal and I am glad to give it a raving review.</li>
            <li> I love trying different skin care products, so when the ATAL Clay Facial mask was available through a recent promotion, I was more than happy to give it a try. First of all, it comes in an elegant looking jar packed inside a nice box. It comes with a little scoop so you don&#x27;t have to waste any of the product by getting it on your hands. The consistency is similar to children&#x27;s finger paint and the color looks like Army Green. It has an earthy scent with a tinge of mint. The first time I used it, my teen daughter joined me for the facial. It didn&#x27;t take much to cover our faces which means it should last a while. It was dry within 10 minutes, but we left it on for 15 minutes. My daughter said it slightly burned, but what I felt was more of a tingling sensation. It came off easily with warm water &amp; a wash cloth. Our faces were left nice &amp; clean. We had no redness which happens from some facial masks. My skin felt a little tighter after the use. I have used it a couple of times since then. I have not noticed any difference with my adult acne, but my skin feels smoother &amp; looks great! I will continue to indulge my skin with this facial mask!</li>
            <li> Atal is a very great company with wonderful products that really do have results!  I was able to get this as part of a promotion and I am so glad I was able to add this to my repertoire of beauty products. Upon using this clay, I was able to feel instant smoothness on my face.  This product has some effective ingredients that are sure to make you happy upon use.  And to make it even better, if you are not satisfied, they will let you return your cleanser for a full refund!  I was really impressed at how well it cleaned the pores on my nose!  This is a wonderful product to have and use once a week.  I highly recommend this product to anyone whom would like a great cleanser, purifier, pore reducer, and skin smoother all at once!</li>
            <li> I have used various ATAL products before and they have all worked great.  When I saw the Clay Facial Mask, I knew that I wanted to give it a try.  I have used many clay masks before.  Some I liked and some I didn&#x27;t.  My review is the result of a promotional distribution and my opinions in this review are a direct result of my own personal use.  The mask comes in a small container, but a little goes a long way with this product.  It is dark green in color and has a nice smell.  It also came with a small spoon style applicator.  I prefer to use the applicator when applying the mask because it keeps my hands out of the container and keeps the mask from getting all over during application.  I apply a thin layer evenly all over my face.  While I wait the recommended 10-15 minutes to wash it off, I can feel a tingling sensation and my face tightening.  Once I wash off the mask, I notice that my skin is smooth and tighter.  I also like to apply my daily moisturizer after each use.  Continual use has proved to reduce my pores a bit too.  In my opinion, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a amazing product in a small jar but so worth it and made me face feel divine after using it. I love the smell of this product its like a minty peppermint smell to me and that was wonderful to put on my face. I love how this comes with a scraper to grab the product so you do not contaminating the product that is left inside the jar. A little bit of this product goes along way. I have oily skin and this makes my skin feel so nice and so smooth and look so nice after using gives me a tight look that. I love it does not dry my skin at all. I also have huge pores and overtime. I use this after using my skin looks brighter and the pores looks small or less noticeable. My acne seems not noticeable when. I use this product also and they look like they have gone down. I love this mask and its nice to put on your skin this improves the over all quality of my face and so glad. I got this on aone time promotional offer to provide my honest review. Thou this company makes other beauty products this is my number one now. I’m in LOVE with this.</li>
