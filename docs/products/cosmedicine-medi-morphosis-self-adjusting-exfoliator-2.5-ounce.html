            <li>The Cosmedicine Medi-morphosis Self Adjusting Exfoliator was getting the most rave reviews!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li>A bit pricey for a scrub, but love it!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 10 years and liked that the microbeads melt away</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates and leaves my skin flawless.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best exfoliate that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Feels wonderful and leaves my skin smooth, glowing and prepped for my moisturizer and make up goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>it truly is in a league all its own:)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like happiness or anything, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a top quality product</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I read an article saying that this was a \\&quot;Top Product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have tried St. Ives, L&#x27;Oreal, Biore, Clinique, Aveeno... and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>There are some cosmedicine products I love.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as I hoped, but OK.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I find this product has more beads than most exfoliators</li>
            <li>When using, the crystals become more smooth and do not feel at all abrasive.  </li>
            <li>You notice the difference from the very first use too!  </li>
            <li>Gentle but effective.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the reviews say it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean, but that&#x27;s not been a problem for me.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something to clean, tingle, scrub, and exfoliate my skin</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive, red blotchy skin with most exfoliators, but then break out if I don&#x27;t use any exfoliator at all: this gentle exfoliator is the perfect balance for my skin.</li>
            <li>Could it be true....</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is most similar to Clinique&#x27;s product, but is more affordable and has the benefit of being \\&quot;self adjusting\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>After washing, my face felt so soft, so smooth, and so clean!</li>
            <li>This facial scrub works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!!  </li>
            <li>This helped me with my oily \\&quot;T-Zone\\&quot;, the discoloration in my skin blends more, the dark spots have faded, and how smooth my skin feels is too real :).</li>
            <li>Three strikes, right on the box.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did it help clear my skin (which might be a magic trick, since apparently that&#x27;s not at all what it&#x27;s supposed to do), but it just feels really, really good.  </li>
            <li>The microdermabrasion beads are the perfect size where they really clean out my pores without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>This buffs the skin so that my moisturizer can actually get to the skin it needs to and is able to absorb.</li>
            <li>Gently, but effectively exfoliates and removes dry skin.</li>
            <li>I kept buying and trying new things on the hope that the promise on the bottle would hold true.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>I am so tempted to use it every day but that would be too much.</li>
            <li>I paid too much for this product, but I think it may be discontinued</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice so far and both times it has left my face feeling so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>The only thing I can think of for comparison is Proactive (which was a bust) - it&#x27;s not a soapy smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>After using it 2-3 times my skin was clear, smooth, and my pores seemed smaller.</li>
            <li>it was worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it is not harsh on my sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li>It has the scrubbing power I like, but it never feels like its completely rinsed off.</li>
            <li>Not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then maybe you could handle the product.</li>
            <li>I wasted $25 on this, when a CVS facial scrub works way better.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It uses witch hazel which I&#x27;m apparently allergic to.</li>
            <li>It claims to diminish wrinkles, something I have not seen, but it works very well at removing any dry, rough skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon&#x27;s price is not bad, but you can often find at Norstrom Rack for even less.</li>
            <li>My face usually breaks out when I try new products, but this one was so gentle.</li>
            <li>I notice no strange smell or oily feel at all.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> *not* a face soap, you&#x27;re also not supposed to use it on active breakouts,</li>

            <li> /&gt;Pretty solid experience, considering I&#x27;d decided to be annoyed with it before even taking it out of the box.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The granules are very small, and thus less irritating than the larger scrubs like St. IVes.  </li>

            <li> Another complaint</li>

            <li> and I think the price isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I first got this, I was extremely annoyed to find that it&#x27;s not only *not* a face soap, you&#x27;re also not supposed to use it on active breakouts, *and* that the recommended usage is only twice a week.  Three strikes, right on the box.  But since I already paid for it, I tried it out just to see what came of it, despite being in the midst of a truly terrible breakout.  And this stuff worked like gangbusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it help clear my skin (which might be a magic trick, since apparently that&#x27;s not at all what it&#x27;s supposed to do), but it just feels really, really good.  A lot of the reviews say it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean, but that&#x27;s not been a problem for me.  Another complaint I saw a lot of was the smell, which did not bother me at all.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like happiness or anything, but it&#x27;s not bad.  The only thing I can think of for comparison is Proactive (which was a bust) - it&#x27;s not a soapy smell, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty solid experience, considering I&#x27;d decided to be annoyed with it before even taking it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! The microdermabrasion beads are the perfect size where they really clean out my pores without irritating my sensitive skin. It reduced the size of my pores, improved my uneven skin tone, and helped clear up the excess oil around the dreaded T-zone. My face usually breaks out when I try new products, but this one was so gentle. After washing, my face felt so soft, so smooth, and so clean! This is definitely a top quality product and I absolutely recommend trying it. It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> In the bottom of by bathroom cabinet you will find quite the selection of face products.  Products that no longer get used.  I kept buying and trying new things on the hope that the promise on the bottle would hold true.  I did some extensive research on line and kept coming across a common thread.  The Cosmedicine Medi-morphosis Self Adjusting Exfoliator was getting the most rave reviews!  Could it be true....something that actually does what it says??  Absolutely!!  This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!  You notice the difference from the very first use too!  Zero irritation.  LOVE this stuff!  Thank you for creating a product that stands out from the rest...it truly is in a league all its own:)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and liked that the microbeads melt away so you cannot over-scrub your face like you can with other products that are harsher. I just wish the company would continue to produce this QUALITY product.</li>
            <li> I like this okay. It has the scrubbing power I like, but it never feels like its completely rinsed off. The scrub I&#x27;d been using for years was discontinued, so I&#x27;m searching for a replacement. This won&#x27;t be it. Too pricey for the outcome. Maybe I&#x27;ll look for a gel based scrub next and hope it won&#x27;t leave a lotiony feeling film on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read an article saying that this was a \\&quot;Top Product\\&quot;. I was looking for something to clean, tingle, scrub, and exfoliate my skin and this didn&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s dull, has beads but does nothing, smells weird, and has no tingle at all. It leaves a somewhat oily feeling too. I wasted $25 on this, when a CVS facial scrub works way better. I wish I could get my money back. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive, red blotchy skin with most exfoliators, but then break out if I don&#x27;t use any exfoliator at all: this gentle exfoliator is the perfect balance for my skin. I use it twice a week and now have almost no breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product has greatly improved my skin and diminished the appearance of my pores!!!!  All the experts recommended this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! It gently exfoliates and leaves my skin flawless. Not harsh at all. A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best exfoliate that I have ever used. After using it 2-3 times my skin was clear, smooth, and my pores seemed smaller. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This facial scrub works pretty good. It does exactly as it should. I am not sure about the whole self adjusting part but the scrub does work. I use it about twice a week and I think the price isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> This product is unlike any other exfoliator I have tried.  I have tried St. Ives, L&#x27;Oreal, Biore, Clinique, Aveeno... and this is my favorite.  The granules are very small, and thus less irritating than the larger scrubs like St. IVes.  It is most similar to Clinique&#x27;s product, but is more affordable and has the benefit of being \\&quot;self adjusting\\&quot;.  When using, the crystals become more smooth and do not feel at all abrasive.  They recommend use twice a week, which I find to be sufficient.

It claims to diminish wrinkles, something I have not seen, but it works very well at removing any dry, rough skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon&#x27;s price is not bad, but you can often find at Norstrom Rack for even less.</li>
            <li> There are some cosmedicine products I love. This unfortunately isn&#x27;t one of them. It uses witch hazel which I&#x27;m apparently allergic to. The product made my face red and my skin rashy. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then maybe you could handle the product.</li>
            <li> Works great, love it!</li>
            <li> Reviewed exfoliating products on line before purchasing. Not the most expensive but rated #1 out of 16 tested. It is actually lightening sunspots as promised and i had doubts about that. No redness or pain but definitely delivered visible results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice so far and both times it has left my face feeling so soft and smooth!  I notice no strange smell or oily feel at all.  I would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I hoped, but OK.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is not harsh on my sensitive skin either.  And I would recommend it...good value.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator.  Gentle but effective.  Been using it for years and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I am so tempted to use it every day but that would be too much.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me,  Deep cleansing without irritation, and a little goes along way. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Gently, but effectively exfoliates and removes dry skin. I live in cold and dry climate and have terribly dry skin in winter. This buffs the skin so that my moisturizer can actually get to the skin it needs to and is able to absorb. I paid too much for this product, but I think it may be discontinued and I had a hard time finding it, so it was worth the extra cost. I find this product has more beads than most exfoliators and you can actually feel them working away. It is the BEST!</li>
            <li> This helped me with my oily \\&quot;T-Zone\\&quot;, the discoloration in my skin blends more, the dark spots have faded, and how smooth my skin feels is too real :). I feel like Godiva chocolate walking out without my powder or foundation on. Friends &amp; strangers have commented on my skin. I&#x27;ve already recommended this to several friends and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for a scrub, but love it! Feels wonderful and leaves my skin smooth, glowing and prepped for my moisturizer and make up goes on smoothly.</li>
