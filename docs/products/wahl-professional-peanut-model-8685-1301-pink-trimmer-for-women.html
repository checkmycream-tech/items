            <li>I love the product!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s adorable!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Some of your more skittish dogs may not tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>They are designed to have detachable blades, which seem like a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>and I paid $50 for my own.  </li>
            <li>Bought this one as a gift for soneone who liked it as we have one of our own and use it often.</li>
            <li>excellent product, highly recommend</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Peanut Clipper!</li>
            <li>These are very powerful for their size and good for detailing around the ears and neckline.</li>
            <li>Works great!  Makes it so easy to trim me husbands whole head.</li>
            <li>The sound doesn&#x27;t scare him a bit and clips fast and perfect.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they a great deal but they cut great</li>
            <li>Grooming: The unit can get very warm, I wouldn&#x27;t say hot, and some dogs may not like this.  </li>
            <li>Super fast service and awesome deals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will do the trick for shaving his neck when he&#x27;s between haircuts.  </li>
            <li>the envy of all of your friends you hang out naked with when you come to the nudist colony with perfectly coiffed pubes in the shape of a palm tree this summer!  </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Love this product for a womans bikini area.</li>
            <li>and I have to say, I have been using them (beginner embroiderer) :)</li>
            <li>I never saw these online when looking for dog clippers because it seems they are more for people.  </li>
            <li>Noise level is acceptable, not too many devices are quieter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do however wish they&#x27;d make this product with an option for the clippers to be pushed closer to the top of the attachments for a determined length.</li>
            <li>That person is enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>was pretty good and on time</li>
            <li>I have had them for a while they are comfortable and easy to use!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d tried other styles/brands but these are the best.</li>
            <li>Sharp and perfect!</li>
            <li>easy to handle.</li>
            <li>So make sure you stop and clean out the fur often</li>
            <li>So versatile and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to manuver and comfortable on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly too!</li>
            <li>Super cute and just as described.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;He seems to dislike the noise but this little thing gets the job done and is perfect for&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ever.&lt;br /&gt;So lightweight and comfortable in my hands</li>
            <li>I really enjoy them .....</li>
            <li>Also great for trimming the back of mens hairline</li>
            <li>Buy it at AMAZON the price is more economical.</li>
            <li>Comfortable grip and light in the hand.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s good for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this product, it is great and you can use it in other areas too.</li>
            <li>and it is very durable!!!</li>
            <li>Very Useful, I been looking for them and the are on the way.</li>
            <li>I have some very nice dog clippers, but even a #10 blade wouldn&#x27;t get her ears and feet close enough.  </li>
            <li>Have had them before, so am familiar with them.</li>
            <li>Originally, My dad had one of these</li>
            <li>Peanuts are the best small clipper and Wahl is the king of Clippers.</li>
            <li>these are powerful, and the attachments allows me to give her a puppy cut just like the ones that cost $45.00!  </li>
            <li>The color is absolutely awesome and because it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li>Clean trim.  </li>
            <li>its pink and works great.</li>
            <li>love the peanut and would highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>a Really Good Job.&lt;br /&gt;Not big and bulky.</li>
            <li>Perfect peanut, only better because it&#x27;s pink.</li>
            <li>Able to cut close and straight.  </li>
            <li>will keep you posted on when she finally douse kick the bucket but for now shes going like at top an hope for many years of service from her.</li>
            <li>Personally, I will have one of these for my entire life, they are simpy the best.  </li>
            <li>It heats up relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>The power is good, but it still takes a long time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product.  </li>
            <li>Even my instructor said that they should NOT be as noisy as they were for being brand new &amp; asked me if I was sure that they weren&#x27;t refurbished.</li>
            <li>Proof that good things do come in small packages. :)</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with very clear instructions on how to pop blade off for getting hunks of hair or fur out.</li>
            <li>This is a great little clipper.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more comfortable for me to hold since I have smaller hands</li>
            <li>My wife is a beautician and needed a  replacement after using her old one for over 20 years and many sets of cutter</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s cute, cheap, and kind of louder than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a barber and needed a new trimmer, I haven&#x27;t used it at work yet, but I used it on my husband and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>so they are just the right size for them.</li>
            <li>Great little clippers!</li>
            <li>I have a very large family with a lot of males.  </li>
            <li>The small size is great.  </li>
            <li>She loved the pink!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These clippers were very noisy from the very first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>, they are great not hard to hold at all and very sharp</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Clippers came exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted me more than ten years.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that the Peanut clipper is smaller</li>
            <li>I love this and had a white pair .</li>
            <li>Wish I would have gotten them when I first started in the industry.</li>
            <li>i love these and will be buying the black peanut ones next their cute!</li>
            <li>If it is really an issue (its not for me), then simply give the blade a quick dip in water, dry it, and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great value, and because it&#x27;s plugged into the wall, I will have a much harder time dropping it into the toilet</li>
            <li>I use these on the back of design to easy get stitches out so that I do not ruin a garment.</li>
            <li>They are also very easy to meanuever and are able to make those precise cuts in tough to reach spots that larger sized clippers cannot.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my dog, to do touch ups that certain groomers miss.</li>
            <li>However, these little clippers do a beautiful job of keeping those little feet clean of hair.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to handle than large clippers.</li>
            <li>I like a very close trim.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thanks again.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product but not the color.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you about the longevity because I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This Pro Peanut was worth the purchase and works just as good as my larger clippers if not better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are just as strong as my old big bulky ones&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I use it for my cavalier king charles spaniel and the breeder highly recommends it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Way too early for that to happen!!</li>
            <li>I love this little machine.</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these little clippers, I cut my son and husband&#x27;s hair so effortlessly now.</li>
            <li>Nice and small for my yorkies, but they are too loud for them.</li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>He got his years before I did and his still works like new.  </li>
            <li>Love this little guy!</li>
            <li>It is quiet, sharp, and very light weight.  </li>
            <li>, I may have to try on my small dogs one day :)</li>
            <li>These must be older, they aren&#x27;t as powerful as the other ones I have bought</li>
            <li>For 5 stars I would&#x27;ve liked it to be a little quieter and perhaps a little more of the lubricating oil, also in it&#x27;s maiden voyage, the motor did bog down a wee bit--still worked, but I was surprised by this.  </li>
            <li>Yes my cute little peanut clipper!!</li>
            <li>They are really great for cutting wigs.</li>
            <li>My mom is a professional hairstylist and she&#x27;s uses the Peanut Clipper.</li>
            <li>but they are old.</li>
            <li>I hooked up the old ones and ZOOM, no problem.</li>
            <li>It zipped through even the wiriest hair with no trouble.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold up really well to constant use.</li>
            <li>It was also much cheaper on here than any retail store like Sally&#x27;s, would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li>&amp; they maybe lasted 6 months before they quit working completely.  </li>
            <li>This has come in handy for me when I am not happy with my embroidery stitch out.  </li>
            <li>Small enough for easy storage, and cord is long enough that you can use it easily.</li>
            <li>These clippers are so small &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sharp!</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to hold, small to store, and she doesn&#x27;t mind getting her feet trimmed anymore.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they did cut great for short time they worked which was the only reason I didn&#x27;t return them because of the noise.</li>
            <li>The blade by itself will almost shave your face and you will barely have any noticeable hairs showing.  </li>
            <li>These on Amazon seem to be the same quality as at the professional beauty store, but about $15 cheaper.</li>
            <li>Love this little peanut...great for trimming bottom of feet, and little backsides of dogs and puppies.</li>
            <li>These are some powerful little clippers!  </li>
            <li>Small but powerful, close cut.</li>
            <li>The powerful little motor in this tiny little machine IS a little noise maker but the results are worth it.</li>

            <li> These are very powerful for their size and good for detailing around the ears and neckline.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Makes it so easy to trim me husbands whole head.</li>
            <li> The sound doesn&#x27;t scare him a bit and clips fast and perfect.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they a great deal but they cut great</li>
            <li> Grooming: The unit can get very warm, I wouldn&#x27;t say hot, and some dogs may not like this.  </li>
            <li> Super fast service and awesome deals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will do the trick for shaving his neck when he&#x27;s between haircuts.  </li>
            <li> the envy of all of your friends you hang out naked with when you come to the nudist colony with perfectly coiffed pubes in the shape of a palm tree this summer!  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Love this product for a womans bikini area.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, I have been using them (beginner embroiderer) :)</li>
            <li> I never saw these online when looking for dog clippers because it seems they are more for people.  </li>
            <li> Noise level is acceptable, not too many devices are quieter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do however wish they&#x27;d make this product with an option for the clippers to be pushed closer to the top of the attachments for a determined length.</li>
            <li> That person is enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> was pretty good and on time</li>
            <li> I have had them for a while they are comfortable and easy to use!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d tried other styles/brands but these are the best.</li>
            <li> Sharp and perfect!</li>
            <li> easy to handle.</li>
            <li> So make sure you stop and clean out the fur often</li>
            <li> So versatile and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to manuver and comfortable on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly too!</li>
            <li> Super cute and just as described.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;He seems to dislike the noise but this little thing gets the job done and is perfect for&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ever.&lt;br /&gt;So lightweight and comfortable in my hands</li>
            <li> I really enjoy them .....</li>
            <li> Also great for trimming the back of mens hairline</li>
            <li> Buy it at AMAZON the price is more economical.</li>
            <li> Comfortable grip and light in the hand.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s good for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product, it is great and you can use it in other areas too.</li>
            <li> and it is very durable!!!</li>
            <li> Very Useful, I been looking for them and the are on the way.</li>
            <li> I have some very nice dog clippers, but even a #10 blade wouldn&#x27;t get her ears and feet close enough.  </li>
            <li> Have had them before, so am familiar with them.</li>
            <li> Originally, My dad had one of these</li>
            <li> Peanuts are the best small clipper and Wahl is the king of Clippers.</li>
            <li> these are powerful, and the attachments allows me to give her a puppy cut just like the ones that cost $45.00!  </li>
            <li> The color is absolutely awesome and because it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> Clean trim.  </li>
            <li> its pink and works great.</li>
            <li> love the peanut and would highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> a Really Good Job.&lt;br /&gt;Not big and bulky.</li>
            <li> Perfect peanut, only better because it&#x27;s pink.</li>
            <li> Able to cut close and straight.  </li>
            <li> will keep you posted on when she finally douse kick the bucket but for now shes going like at top an hope for many years of service from her.</li>
            <li> Personally, I will have one of these for my entire life, they are simpy the best.  </li>
            <li> It heats up relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> The power is good, but it still takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product.  </li>
            <li> Even my instructor said that they should NOT be as noisy as they were for being brand new &amp; asked me if I was sure that they weren&#x27;t refurbished.</li>
            <li> Proof that good things do come in small packages. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with very clear instructions on how to pop blade off for getting hunks of hair or fur out.</li>
            <li> This is a great little clipper.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more comfortable for me to hold since I have smaller hands</li>
            <li> My wife is a beautician and needed a  replacement after using her old one for over 20 years and many sets of cutter</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s cute, cheap, and kind of louder than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber and needed a new trimmer, I haven&#x27;t used it at work yet, but I used it on my husband and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> so they are just the right size for them.</li>
            <li> Great little clippers!</li>
            <li> I have a very large family with a lot of males.  </li>
            <li> The small size is great.  </li>
            <li> She loved the pink!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These clippers were very noisy from the very first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> , they are great not hard to hold at all and very sharp</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Clippers came exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted me more than ten years.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that the Peanut clipper is smaller</li>
            <li> I love this and had a white pair .</li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten them when I first started in the industry.</li>
            <li> i love these and will be buying the black peanut ones next their cute!</li>
            <li> If it is really an issue (its not for me), then simply give the blade a quick dip in water, dry it, and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great value, and because it&#x27;s plugged into the wall, I will have a much harder time dropping it into the toilet</li>
            <li> I use these on the back of design to easy get stitches out so that I do not ruin a garment.</li>
            <li> They are also very easy to meanuever and are able to make those precise cuts in tough to reach spots that larger sized clippers cannot.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my dog, to do touch ups that certain groomers miss.</li>
            <li> However, these little clippers do a beautiful job of keeping those little feet clean of hair.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to handle than large clippers.</li>
            <li> I like a very close trim.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thanks again.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product but not the color.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you about the longevity because I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This Pro Peanut was worth the purchase and works just as good as my larger clippers if not better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are just as strong as my old big bulky ones&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I use it for my cavalier king charles spaniel and the breeder highly recommends it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Way too early for that to happen!!</li>
            <li> I love this little machine.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these little clippers, I cut my son and husband&#x27;s hair so effortlessly now.</li>
            <li> Nice and small for my yorkies, but they are too loud for them.</li>
            <li> Brand new.</li>
            <li> He got his years before I did and his still works like new.  </li>
            <li> Love this little guy!</li>
            <li> It is quiet, sharp, and very light weight.  </li>
            <li> , I may have to try on my small dogs one day :)</li>
            <li> These must be older, they aren&#x27;t as powerful as the other ones I have bought</li>
            <li> For 5 stars I would&#x27;ve liked it to be a little quieter and perhaps a little more of the lubricating oil, also in it&#x27;s maiden voyage, the motor did bog down a wee bit--still worked, but I was surprised by this.  </li>
            <li> Yes my cute little peanut clipper!!</li>
            <li> They are really great for cutting wigs.</li>
            <li> My mom is a professional hairstylist and she&#x27;s uses the Peanut Clipper.</li>
            <li> but they are old.</li>
            <li> I hooked up the old ones and ZOOM, no problem.</li>
            <li> It zipped through even the wiriest hair with no trouble.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold up really well to constant use.</li>
            <li> It was also much cheaper on here than any retail store like Sally&#x27;s, would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> &amp; they maybe lasted 6 months before they quit working completely.  </li>
            <li> This has come in handy for me when I am not happy with my embroidery stitch out.  </li>
            <li> Small enough for easy storage, and cord is long enough that you can use it easily.</li>
            <li> These clippers are so small &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sharp!</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to hold, small to store, and she doesn&#x27;t mind getting her feet trimmed anymore.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they did cut great for short time they worked which was the only reason I didn&#x27;t return them because of the noise.</li>
            <li> The blade by itself will almost shave your face and you will barely have any noticeable hairs showing.  </li>
            <li> These on Amazon seem to be the same quality as at the professional beauty store, but about $15 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love this little peanut...great for trimming bottom of feet, and little backsides of dogs and puppies.</li>
            <li> These are some powerful little clippers!  </li>
            <li> Small but powerful, close cut.</li>
            <li> The powerful little motor in this tiny little machine IS a little noise maker but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> It bogged down and simply would not cut worth a darn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also loud, I have a decibelmeter on my phone, this came out to 87 max dB (80 on average).</li>
            <li> When the hair grows long enough to annoy her, she chews her feet.  </li>
            <li> Also, these clippers do not require countless passes over the same area, they cut EXTREMELY well.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but somehow (at least) one &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; got chipped and now cuts me on the neck every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> ive had a few over the years an as a professional</li>
            <li> every day hope it hangs in for the long haul</li>
            <li> The cord is plenty long to maneuver around wiggly pups.  </li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s overall just lighter than other models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not for overall use on your dog, not even a little one.</li>
            <li> use to older one that I replaced to trim my five dogs when they need a quick fix , before the groomer is due to arrive, since it is small and not as noisy as the bigger models they don&#x27;t get afraid when they see me</li>
            <li> I bought this because several people reviewed it favorably for clipping thier small dogs, i tried it on my yorkie last thursday and couldnt get it to trim her at all.</li>
            <li> Only reason I needed a new pair is cause a clip that holds the blade on is broken.</li>
            <li> (Like on other clippers where they have the button that slides them up and down closer or further away)</li>
            <li> but obviously, BE CAREFUL.  </li>
            <li> The pink ones ....</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> I got it in pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink girls</li>
            <li> Previously, I had bought a few different trimmers at marshalls and wal mart,</li>
            <li> This nut is sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> ive had them for awhile and their still just as sharp as ever.</li>
            <li> And yeah, it will heat up, but only under very, very heavy use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for dog trimming but at the least bit of a snag the back pops off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very comfortable one.  </li>
            <li> him down each week</li>
            <li> previous peanuts did not do so.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less than five stars from this product.</li>
            <li> Got this to cut my little dogs paws.  </li>
            <li> This little thing has been my go to clipper for everything.</li>
            <li> and they are making a god awful sound that only happens when I drop my peanuts, and this one I have not dropped yet.</li>
            <li> My clients haven&#x27;t complained about pulling like with my previous trimmers.</li>
            <li> Its little but packs a punch!</li>
            <li> it was a little hard to manage with this</li>
            <li> I have been using the Wahl Peanut Clipper for the past  years to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have small hand s</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small this product was until I received it, and my hands aren&#x27;t that small&lt;</li>
            <li> Ridiculous-</li>
            <li> I can replace it but not a good thing.</li>
            <li> and they are broken already</li>
            <li> A LOT, and stand behind it!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointing to say the least!</li>
            <li> it works ggreat for all the differant things i use it for from trimming the dogs feet to cutting threads on my sewing projects</li>
            <li> So who am I to argue since I know squat about cutting hair.</li>
            <li> the Wahl peanut was wireless and was disappointed when I found this one was not.</li>
            <li> Terrible do not buy from this seller, I am a hairstylist  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am 100% happy with this trimmer and for the price you cant beat it. Its the perfect size for any woman&#x27;s hand and it is very durable!!! If you are thinking about buying it don&#x27;t think just do it!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Personal&amp;#34; Grooming: Yes, this thing can trim your pubes--well.  I am female and so obviously there are lots of folds involved.  I like a very close trim.  If you take the guards off, you can get an exceptionally close shave but obviously, BE CAREFUL.  This nut is sharp.  I will consult my husband when he gets home to get a male opinion.  I&#x27;m sure this will do the trick for shaving his neck when he&#x27;s between haircuts.  Yes, we&#x27;re gross like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dog Grooming: The unit can get very warm, I wouldn&#x27;t say hot, and some dogs may not like this.  This would only be an issue if the guard is off.  It&#x27;s also loud, I have a decibelmeter on my phone, this came out to 87 max dB (80 on average). Some of your more skittish dogs may not tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great value, and because it&#x27;s plugged into the wall, I will have a much harder time dropping it into the toilet like I did with my last one (different shaver entirely).  The small size is great.  Not having to replace batteries will be awesome also. For 5 stars I would&#x27;ve liked it to be a little quieter and perhaps a little more of the lubricating oil, also in it&#x27;s maiden voyage, the motor did bog down a wee bit--still worked, but I was surprised by this.  It could be that I hadn&#x27;t put any of the oil on the blade yet.  Easy to clean with very clear instructions on how to pop blade off for getting hunks of hair or fur out. Comes with a wee tiny brush and 5 ml lubricating oil, 4 guards, 3 of which no one in my fam will ever use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be the envy of all of your friends you hang out naked with when you come to the nudist colony with perfectly coiffed pubes in the shape of a palm tree this summer!  4/5, would buy again or gift to a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Hi Mom!</li>
            <li> Great buy!!!!If you are a barber or a hair stylist you need this product.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed and I got it works perfect shipping was pretty good and on time</li>
            <li> Clippers came exactly as pictured.  Have had them before, so am familiar with them.</li>
            <li> great product. solid. ive had a few over the years an as a professional i use&lt;br /&gt;it A LOT, and stand behind it!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Works very well, but somehow (at least) one &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; got chipped and now cuts me on the neck every time I use it.  Way too early for that to happen!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product, it is great and you can use it in other areas too.</li>
            <li> Love it! Came quickly too!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Wahl Peanut Clipper for the past  years to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. I have small hand s and he does not have a lot of hair, so for me to \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; him down each week this is a great piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to older one that I replaced to trim my five dogs when they need a quick fix , before the groomer is due to arrive, since it is small and not as noisy as the bigger models they don&#x27;t get afraid when they see me coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the peanut and would highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> seems to overheat after a short usage.  previous peanuts did not do so.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Finally found what I was looking for years.perfect size and power.Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Super fast service and awesome deals</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my mom, she loves it!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less than five stars from this product. My first one lasted me more than ten years. I expect the same again.</li>
            <li> Best. Clippers. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;So lightweight and comfortable in my hands&lt;br /&gt;They are just as strong as my old big bulky ones&lt;br /&gt;They do make some noise, though, certainly not enough to be a &amp;#34;deal-breaker&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Perfect Beauty School Graduation gift for my sister!! She loved the pink!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for dog trimming but at the least bit of a snag the back pops off. I can replace it but not a good thing.</li>
            <li> Got this to cut my little dogs paws.  It&#x27;s perfect!  The sound doesn&#x27;t scare him a bit and clips fast and perfect.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My mom is a professional hairstylist and she&#x27;s uses the Peanut Clipper. The last one she had for probably 5 years and only had to replace it because she lost them during moving. So I decided to buy a pair for my husband to use when we cut his hair and I am thrilled with it. We&#x27;d tried other styles/brands but these are the best. Not only are they a great deal but they cut great and I love the fact that the Peanut clipper is smaller so it&#x27;s more comfortable for me to hold since I have smaller hands plus it&#x27;s overall just lighter than other models. Proof that good things do come in small packages. :)</li>
            <li> Love this clipper!  Does a great job!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy them ..... I use these at work, they are the best thing ever.  Keep up the good work..</li>
            <li> Yes Yes my cute little peanut clipper!!</li>
            <li> Nice and small for my yorkies, but they are too loud for them. Everytime I place the clipper beside there ear they jump. I guess they have to get use to them.</li>
            <li> its pink and works great. what&#x27;s not to love? Small enough for easy storage, and cord is long enough that you can use it easily.</li>
            <li> Love this product for a womans bikini area. I have two, one for each home. Also great for trimming the back of mens hairline</li>
            <li> A satisfied customer with this very good product. I would recommend it to friends.  Buy it at AMAZON the price is more economical.</li>
            <li> does everything I wanted it to do.  easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I love this and had a white pair . The pink ones ....I had to have! They are really great for cutting wigs. They are not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> Works great, great price. I&#x27;m a hair stylist and i use it every day and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> My wife is a beautician and needed a  replacement after using her old one for over 20 years and many sets of cutter heads.&lt;br /&gt;I found this company who had the best price. They delivered as promised and I would do business with them again.</li>
            <li> This is a great little clipper.  I use it for my cavalier king charles spaniel and the breeder highly recommends it.  Petite but does a good job.</li>
            <li> Terrible do not buy from this seller, I am a hairstylist  and they are broken already and I did not.even drop.them! They had to have been refurbished because ive only had them for 3 weeks and they are making a god awful sound that only happens when I drop my peanuts, and this one I have not dropped yet. Ridiculous-</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Very Useful, I been looking for them and the are on the way. Cant wait to use them. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a 5 lb. poodle who has tiny feet which grow hair between the footpads.  When the hair grows long enough to annoy her, she chews her feet.  Using regular-size clippers was a trial for both of us.  However, these little clippers do a beautiful job of keeping those little feet clean of hair.  They are comfortable to hold, small to store, and she doesn&#x27;t mind getting her feet trimmed anymore.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Peanut Clipper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these trimmers for two months. They are designed to have detachable blades, which seem like a nice feature.  However, the part that holds the blades onto the body is just a tiny plastic hinge.  Fearing the frailty of the design, I always exercised great care when reattaching the blades.  I think I removed them maybe six times, and that&#x27;s all it took to weaken that join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See attached photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my yorkie</li>
            <li> it works ggreat for all the differant things i use it for from trimming the dogs feet to cutting threads on my sewing projects it gets a good workout every day hope it hangs in for the long haul will keep you posted on when she finally douse kick the bucket but for now shes going like at top an hope for many years of service from her. thanks again.  Anna</li>
            <li> Brand new. It works great!!!</li>
            <li> Super cute and just as described. Works just as well as the regular model.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but not the color. I would suggest this item for men or women. Thank you</li>
            <li> This little thing has been my go to clipper for everything. ive had them for awhile and their still just as sharp as ever. i love these and will be buying the black peanut ones next their cute! I Love Peanut Clippers!</li>
            <li> This has come in handy for me when I am not happy with my embroidery stitch out.  I use these on the back of design to easy get stitches out so that I do not ruin a garment.</li>
            <li> I machine embroidery and saw via youtube that Wahl&#x27;s Peanut clippers are great to help pull out stitches if needed.&lt;br /&gt;They work great and I have to say, I have been using them (beginner embroiderer) :)&lt;br /&gt;Nice size too, I may have to try on my small dogs one day :)</li>
            <li> Love this little peanut...great for trimming bottom of feet, and little backsides of dogs and puppies.</li>
            <li> Originally, My dad had one of these and I would always steal it.  Finally, he drove me to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies and I paid $50 for my own.  Let me tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made.  He got his years before I did and his still works like new.  Previously, I had bought a few different trimmers at marshalls and wal mart, the Peanut dwarfs the competition.  The blades have not noticeably dulled and the power is still the same.  I have even shaved my entire head with 3-4 inches of hair with this thing.  It is truly a bite-sized beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with lubricating oil, a cleaning brush, and 4 different sized brush guards for different precision styling.  I only use this for my face and for trimming my chest.  The blade by itself will almost shave your face and you will barely have any noticeable hairs showing.  So, if you needed a quick shave but didnt have the time, these are absolutely perfect.  Also, these clippers do not require countless passes over the same area, they cut EXTREMELY well. They are also very easy to meanuever and are able to make those precise cuts in tough to reach spots that larger sized clippers cannot.  And yeah, it will heat up, but only under very, very heavy use.  If it is really an issue (its not for me), then simply give the blade a quick dip in water, dry it, and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you purchase this Peanut, you will never even think about another pair of grooming clippers.  Personally, I will have one of these for my entire life, they are simpy the best.  I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product.  Do not be fooled by the size or the name, it is a lawnmower of a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have the same brand but they are old. Its the white one that is actually shaped like a peanut. I opened these to cut my hair, take in mind my hair is already short. WITH a number 3 guard on it, it STILL could not cut my hair. It bogged down and simply would not cut worth a darn. I tried and tried. I hooked up the old ones and ZOOM, no problem. Only reason I needed a new pair is cause a clip that holds the blade on is broken. I would say these clippers are junk as they did not work for the simplest hair cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this because several people reviewed it favorably for clipping thier small dogs, i tried it on my yorkie last thursday and couldnt get it to trim her at all. dissapointed.</li>
            <li> great quality product,  i do recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber and needed a new trimmer, I haven&#x27;t used it at work yet, but I used it on my husband and so far I love it! It&#x27;s super sharp!</li>
            <li> These clippers are so small &amp; easy to use. I have shih tzu&#x27;s so they are just the right size for them. Do a really good job.</li>
            <li> I have had this cutter before,I bought it for my son and he loves it, so I decided to buy an extra one for my dog, they are great not hard to hold at all and very sharp</li>
            <li> I love this little machine. It works great. I got it on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Bought this one as a gift for soneone who liked it as we have one of our own and use it often.</li>
            <li> I have a Silky Terrier so this was Great&lt;br /&gt;at clipping her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a Really Good Job.&lt;br /&gt;Not big and bulky.</li>
            <li> Peanuts are the best small clipper and Wahl is the king of Clippers.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use for sanitary touch ups on my terriers.  It is quiet, sharp, and very light weight.  The cord is plenty long to maneuver around wiggly pups.  It zipped through even the wiriest hair with no trouble.</li>
            <li> I have some very nice dog clippers, but even a #10 blade wouldn&#x27;t get her ears and feet close enough.  A neighbor loaned me her husband&#x27;s personal Wahl Peanut clippers to try because I thought I needed smaller ones. WOW!!  These are some powerful little clippers!  They get her ear hair and feet effortlessly, and I made the mistake of clipping her back with some pressure.  They went to the skin!  Good thing she&#x27;s not a show dog...  I never saw these online when looking for dog clippers because it seems they are more for people.  Dog owners take note:  these are powerful, and the attachments allows me to give her a puppy cut just like the ones that cost $45.00!  So glad I found out about these!!!</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s cute, cheap, and kind of louder than I expected.  I bought it for my cats and need to see how it will go, but it seems sufficient.  Only thing is I read somewhere the Wahl peanut was wireless and was disappointed when I found this one was not.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s good for the price.  Clean trim.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt when trimming.  My husband uses it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who&#x27;s a hair stylist and she says it&#x27;s the best.  So who am I to argue since I know squat about cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these little clippers, I cut my son and husband&#x27;s hair so effortlessly now.</li>
            <li> excellent product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> This Pro Peanut was worth the purchase and works just as good as my larger clippers if not better.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing another soon, just for a backup.</li>
            <li> Awesome seller! Shipped super fast! Would recommend!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trimmer. I can&#x27;t tell you about the longevity because I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I thought I would. It heats up relatively quickly. I wish the blades were sharper.  Noise level is acceptable, not too many devices are quieter.&lt;br /&gt;It serves its purpose for what I purchased it for. I bought it for my dog, to do touch ups that certain groomers miss. Like around the lips and the divot that the fang tooth makes. The paws are always needing trimming and it does great in those areas. It&#x27;s definitely not for overall use on your dog, not even a little one. My dog weighs 10lbs and has cottony fur which clogs up the blades often. So make sure you stop and clean out the fur often and I think you will be very happy with this trimmer if you are buying this for your dog.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Sharp and perfect! Perfect peanut, only better because it&#x27;s pink. They&#x27;re all noisy. The powerful little motor in this tiny little machine IS a little noise maker but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy! I am a stylist and this has been perfect for my cuts. Small but powerful, close cut. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small this product was until I received it, and my hands aren&#x27;t that small&lt;br /&gt;So it was a little hard to manage with this but overall I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for my yorkie so I can save some extra money and cut his hair at home&lt;br /&gt;He seems to dislike the noise but this little thing gets the job done and is perfect for&lt;br /&gt;Short haircuts even on dogs! The color is absolutely awesome and because it&#x27;s small&lt;br /&gt;Makes it easier to store away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however wish they&#x27;d make this product with an option for the clippers to be pushed closer to the top of the attachments for a determined length. (Like on other clippers where they have the button that slides them up and down closer or further away)</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and it is great quality. She is a pro hair stylist and uses this every day. It seems to hold up really well to constant use.</li>
            <li> I have had them for a while they are comfortable and easy to use! I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> Compact and works well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So versatile and easy to use.  Keeps our hair in great shape.  Able to cut close and straight.  Easy to manuver and comfortable on the skin.  Comfortable grip and light in the hand.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I love the product! I got it in pink. However some people said they didn&#x27;t when ordering this which doesn&#x27;t make any sense? It&#x27;s pink girls and it&#x27;s adorable!</li>
            <li> Purchased for someone eelse. That person is enjoying using it. Meets their expectations.</li>
            <li> My Boyfriend loves this stuff so I got points for this purchase... 😄</li>
            <li> Perfect size for trimming around my dog&#x27;s eyes and her paws.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s durability.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Makes it so easy to trim me husbands whole head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good one,  I also like color too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetology student and recently broke the trimmers my school provided. I&#x27;m about to graduate, so I decided to try something nicer that I can bring to work with me. These are very powerful for their size and good for detailing around the ears and neckline. My clients haven&#x27;t complained about pulling like with my previous trimmers. These on Amazon seem to be the same quality as at the professional beauty store, but about $15 cheaper. For the price I am very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair-stylist and have owned peanut trimmers for years.  They are great trimmers for beards and shaping haircuts.  I have a very large family with a lot of males.  I purchased these for Christmas and graduation gifts, and every guy told me it was the best gift they ever received.</li>
            <li> Gives a better trim then my expensive clippers. Wish I would have gotten them when I first started in the industry.</li>
            <li> I bought  this to replace one that my boyfriend took over and started using for himself. I use it to groom my yorkies with and I love it! Its little but packs a punch! It was also much cheaper on here than any retail store like Sally&#x27;s, would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Purchased strictly for my Yorkies.  They don&#x27;t seem to mind it.  Much easier to handle than large clippers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the buzz with this trimmer.  It&#x27;s not a very comfortable one.  The power is good, but it still takes a long time.  I&#x27;d put it middle of the pack based on the trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> These must be older, they aren&#x27;t as powerful as the other ones I have bought</li>
            <li> These clippers were very noisy from the very first time I used them.  I bought them while I was in school &amp; they maybe lasted 6 months before they quit working completely.  VERY disappointing to say the least! Even my instructor said that they should NOT be as noisy as they were for being brand new &amp; asked me if I was sure that they weren&#x27;t refurbished. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they did cut great for short time they worked which was the only reason I didn&#x27;t return them because of the noise.</li>
            <li> Great little clippers!</li>
            <li> Love these and the color!!!</li>
            <li> The Peanut is all that you need for home grooming.  I could not be happier.</li>
