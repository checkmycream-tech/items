            <li>The smell is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Good price on a favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>This product does a nice job on your hair.  </li>
            <li>so I used more than I would have without a good outcome.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance also.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger forever.</li>
            <li>When I use it for curling, my hair will stay nicely curled for days.</li>
            <li>When you have fine hair and not a lot of it, you need some kind of hold, this helps!</li>
            <li>My new best friend!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, spray before using hot iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li>Many times I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many year&#x27;s, would reccomend it to any body.</li>
            <li>It would be great for someone wearing a straight style.</li>
            <li>I keep having to order more...</li>
            <li>A much better price than at a salon.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it out in humid conditions yet, but I love the fact that it&#x27;s protecting my hair from the iron and giving it shine</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Top this with Kendra&#x27;s Platinum Texturing Taffy and I look as if I just stepped out of a salon.</li>
            <li>Bought GHD instead, love it</li>
            <li>Been using this stuff for ages, LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love Kenra hotspray and was happy to see it offered at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Sticky if you use too much but a great product</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Hair stays straight for days!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells so good and also curls and straight hair stay all day !</li>
            <li>It works great protecting my hair from getting fried, helps me to actually GET my hair to straighten and it smells and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>
            <li>This hairspray smells good and it holds hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Moral of the story: experimenting is good, just don&#x27;t do it when you&#x27;re going someplace!    </li>
            <li>The product also does not distribute a fine mist to cover the hair evenly.  </li>
            <li>So if you have fine hair, avoid this.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I just love Kenra products, I&#x27;ve liked every one I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>It made the straightener catch, rather than glide smoothly.</li>
            <li>The smell is one of my favorites, it is light and fruity.</li>
            <li>An inch of the product leaked out, but I&#x27;m happy with what I have left.  </li>
            <li>Great for the Miracurl and flat iron.</li>
            <li>Works really great when using flat irons.  </li>
            <li>This product makes straightening it quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>This is great for heat styling, especially flat ironing or curling.</li>
            <li>This hot spray is okay.  </li>
            <li>This product is what took my hair from okay to straight and sleek and keeps it that way until I wash it!  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair incredible down to the tips of the strands.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like my hair feeling like it is full of product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full, wavy, and isn&#x27;t flopping against my face.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair super tangled and sticky.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly although some it had leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li>This really good product using with hot iron  and curling brush, use on a regular bases.</li>
            <li>Combined with a morrocan oil product first, my hair looks as good as it did when I was MUCH younger.</li>
            <li>I love Kenra platium hot spray, it protects my hair from getting fryed and gives it a very sleek shine.</li>
            <li>A bit spendy, but worth it</li>
            <li>My fine hair does not hold the curls for a curling iron and when I spray this product on first, then role with the curling iron, the curl stays in place and sets up until I am ready to comb it out.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li>but if you like more smoothness and less hold, the Hot Spray is better.</li>
            <li>It left my frizzy, over-processed hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I like this hot spray.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only product that will keep my curls holding for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>it was when I did it first.</li>
            <li>Was a hot sets fan</li>
            <li>Just soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product!</li>
            <li>love it moisturizes skin and last all day!</li>
            <li>Why I can only guess, it used to hold my hair style till I washed my hair but not any more.  </li>
            <li>The mist is very, very fine, very little is required, combs out easily and stays all day.</li>
            <li>even if you do it&#x27;ll take about half the bottle&#x27;s contents to give hair any sort of crunchy feel, but dont underestimate the hold, its amazing even in hot humid VA summers, kept my hair frizz free and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>They were soft, but firm (I know, that sounds both illogical AND obscene LOL)</li>
            <li>and I really believe that this hot spray helps my hair with maintaining the curl all day and perhaps prevents too much damage from occurring to treated hair!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is large</li>
            <li>Its scent is so pleasant, I actually look forward to spraying it on when my hair is wet.  </li>
            <li>This gives great hold but \\&quot;firm\\&quot; is poor word choice.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair straight.</li>
            <li>The product itself works very well when I&#x27;m straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair sticky (I only used 2-3 light sprays from a distance).</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Beware of using too much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Very sticky.</li>
            <li>Although it can get &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, which I don&#x27;t like, you can brush your hair to remove that stiffness and your hair remains silky straight.  </li>
            <li>The vendor didn&#x27;t package it for shipping very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>honestly I think I would only use this for curling, it will definitely serve its purpose for that</li>
            <li>I have super fine, stick straight hair &amp; this does not weight it down or make it look &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This is my new hot spray.</li>
            <li>but there are other products on the market that work as well with a much better distribution/delivery system.</li>
            <li>This really gives my hair bounce and shine - hard to do for my 57 year old hair, but it does the trick, and it smells good too</li>
            <li>Will most likely repeat the whole process next time.</li>
            <li>It was challenging getting it to stay down after that.</li>
            <li>It does have some what of a hold to it, so it can get a little crunchy if you spray too much, but just make sure your brush through your hair and that will help it.</li>
            <li>I typically purchase Kenra products from my hairdresser,price is better &amp; received faster.</li>
            <li>But this one is definitely not the same at all this ones feels more like hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I usually love Kenra Products but this spray was a mess.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wake up and can brush m hair right back into the shape</li>
            <li>Just a tiny spray keeps your hair in place and I can just refresh it the next day with a quick spritz of water!</li>
            <li>and my hair is silky smooth and longer due to the frizzy kinks flattened out.</li>
            <li>so I think I just went overboard for what I needed, but regardless my hair looked great and did not have the extra &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; texture that often accompanies regular hairspray.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m done straightening it, my hair is closer to its normal soft feel and this helps prevent heat damage.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use this product when using my hot curling iron.</li>
            <li>Makes my slightly wirey hair beautifully smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li>It actually leaves my curls soft &amp; shiny and holds very well.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for straightening my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I honestly got this spray confused with their blow-dry spray</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, truly holds all day and honestly doesn&#x27;t look half bad the next day either.</li>
            <li>With this being said, the product leaked out into the packaging making the product half full and sticky on the outside.</li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy, thick colored hair.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair lift and offers a lasting hold.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that the directions say, &amp;#34;apply liberally,&amp;#34; which I think I too far.</li>
            <li>However Kenra has other products that I really, really like.  </li>
            <li>This hot spray has enough hold that it keeps those errant hairs down and controlled when I use it before blow-drying.</li>
            <li>This product smells more like hairspray and made my hair hard to straighten due to the stickiness.</li>
            <li>I was spooked at first by the \\&quot;firm hold\\&quot; description, but it does not give crunchy, crispy or sticky feeling hair.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use so much otherwise it can weight the hair down.</li>

            <li> This is a great product, spray before using hot iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> Many times I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many year&#x27;s, would reccomend it to any body.</li>
            <li> It would be great for someone wearing a straight style.</li>
            <li> I keep having to order more...</li>
            <li> A much better price than at a salon.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it out in humid conditions yet, but I love the fact that it&#x27;s protecting my hair from the iron and giving it shine</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Top this with Kendra&#x27;s Platinum Texturing Taffy and I look as if I just stepped out of a salon.</li>
            <li> Bought GHD instead, love it</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for ages, LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love Kenra hotspray and was happy to see it offered at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Sticky if you use too much but a great product</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> Hair stays straight for days!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and also curls and straight hair stay all day !</li>
            <li> It works great protecting my hair from getting fried, helps me to actually GET my hair to straighten and it smells and feels nice.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells good and it holds hair very well.  </li>
            <li> Moral of the story: experimenting is good, just don&#x27;t do it when you&#x27;re going someplace!    </li>
            <li> The product also does not distribute a fine mist to cover the hair evenly.  </li>
            <li> So if you have fine hair, avoid this.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I just love Kenra products, I&#x27;ve liked every one I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> It made the straightener catch, rather than glide smoothly.</li>
            <li> The smell is one of my favorites, it is light and fruity.</li>
            <li> An inch of the product leaked out, but I&#x27;m happy with what I have left.  </li>
            <li> Great for the Miracurl and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Works really great when using flat irons.  </li>
            <li> This product makes straightening it quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> This is great for heat styling, especially flat ironing or curling.</li>
            <li> This hot spray is okay.  </li>
            <li> This product is what took my hair from okay to straight and sleek and keeps it that way until I wash it!  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair incredible down to the tips of the strands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my hair feeling like it is full of product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full, wavy, and isn&#x27;t flopping against my face.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair super tangled and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly although some it had leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li> This really good product using with hot iron  and curling brush, use on a regular bases.</li>
            <li> Combined with a morrocan oil product first, my hair looks as good as it did when I was MUCH younger.</li>
            <li> I love Kenra platium hot spray, it protects my hair from getting fryed and gives it a very sleek shine.</li>
            <li> A bit spendy, but worth it</li>
            <li> My fine hair does not hold the curls for a curling iron and when I spray this product on first, then role with the curling iron, the curl stays in place and sets up until I am ready to comb it out.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li> but if you like more smoothness and less hold, the Hot Spray is better.</li>
            <li> It left my frizzy, over-processed hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I like this hot spray.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only product that will keep my curls holding for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> it was when I did it first.</li>
            <li> Was a hot sets fan</li>
            <li> Just soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product!</li>
            <li> love it moisturizes skin and last all day!</li>
            <li> Why I can only guess, it used to hold my hair style till I washed my hair but not any more.  </li>
            <li> The mist is very, very fine, very little is required, combs out easily and stays all day.</li>
            <li> even if you do it&#x27;ll take about half the bottle&#x27;s contents to give hair any sort of crunchy feel, but dont underestimate the hold, its amazing even in hot humid VA summers, kept my hair frizz free and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> They were soft, but firm (I know, that sounds both illogical AND obscene LOL)</li>
            <li> and I really believe that this hot spray helps my hair with maintaining the curl all day and perhaps prevents too much damage from occurring to treated hair!  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is large</li>
            <li> Its scent is so pleasant, I actually look forward to spraying it on when my hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> This gives great hold but \\&quot;firm\\&quot; is poor word choice.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair straight.</li>
            <li> The product itself works very well when I&#x27;m straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair sticky (I only used 2-3 light sprays from a distance).</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Beware of using too much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Very sticky.</li>
            <li> Although it can get &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, which I don&#x27;t like, you can brush your hair to remove that stiffness and your hair remains silky straight.  </li>
            <li> The vendor didn&#x27;t package it for shipping very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> honestly I think I would only use this for curling, it will definitely serve its purpose for that</li>
            <li> I have super fine, stick straight hair &amp; this does not weight it down or make it look &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This is my new hot spray.</li>
            <li> but there are other products on the market that work as well with a much better distribution/delivery system.</li>
            <li> This really gives my hair bounce and shine - hard to do for my 57 year old hair, but it does the trick, and it smells good too</li>
            <li> Will most likely repeat the whole process next time.</li>
            <li> It was challenging getting it to stay down after that.</li>
            <li> It does have some what of a hold to it, so it can get a little crunchy if you spray too much, but just make sure your brush through your hair and that will help it.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase Kenra products from my hairdresser,price is better &amp; received faster.</li>
            <li> But this one is definitely not the same at all this ones feels more like hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I usually love Kenra Products but this spray was a mess.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wake up and can brush m hair right back into the shape</li>
            <li> Just a tiny spray keeps your hair in place and I can just refresh it the next day with a quick spritz of water!</li>
            <li> and my hair is silky smooth and longer due to the frizzy kinks flattened out.</li>
            <li> so I think I just went overboard for what I needed, but regardless my hair looked great and did not have the extra &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; texture that often accompanies regular hairspray.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m done straightening it, my hair is closer to its normal soft feel and this helps prevent heat damage.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product when using my hot curling iron.</li>
            <li> Makes my slightly wirey hair beautifully smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li> It actually leaves my curls soft &amp; shiny and holds very well.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for straightening my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I honestly got this spray confused with their blow-dry spray</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, truly holds all day and honestly doesn&#x27;t look half bad the next day either.</li>
            <li> With this being said, the product leaked out into the packaging making the product half full and sticky on the outside.</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy, thick colored hair.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair lift and offers a lasting hold.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that the directions say, &amp;#34;apply liberally,&amp;#34; which I think I too far.</li>
            <li> However Kenra has other products that I really, really like.  </li>
            <li> This hot spray has enough hold that it keeps those errant hairs down and controlled when I use it before blow-drying.</li>
            <li> This product smells more like hairspray and made my hair hard to straighten due to the stickiness.</li>
            <li> I was spooked at first by the \\&quot;firm hold\\&quot; description, but it does not give crunchy, crispy or sticky feeling hair.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use so much otherwise it can weight the hair down.</li>
            <li> I love this product in general, however when my package arrived it was broken and half my product was gone.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this as the final touch as she uses the wand or flat iron.</li>
            <li> This product makes it feel like you are actually cooking your hair when applied and then flat iron is used.</li>
            <li> Protects hair from damage of flat iron</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the prices deter you they last a long time</li>
            <li> Spritz this, flat iron, comb through</li>
            <li> My hair stylist just used this product on me today after drying and before using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Just spray it in dry hair and use either a curling iron or flat iron.</li>
            <li> Spray on dry hair, flat iron, brush out...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Strange...</li>
            <li> Keeps the curls all day long.  </li>
            <li> It is less firm than the Thermal Spray Kenra offers, which I have sworn by for the last several years.  </li>
            <li> I like a little sticky so that my hair does not seem as flat, gives it a little bit of texture, BUT I have noticed that this Hot Spray seems less damaging to my hair than the Thermal Spray.  </li>
            <li> I am 69 and my hair is wavy and dry.</li>
            <li> BUT then I realized it should be used for AFTER your hair is dry</li>
            <li> This makes a big difference in how my straight thin hair will hold volume.</li>
            <li> Recommend this lotion above any other for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> not a good buy has to much alcohol is diferent not like the one i used before</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make hair feel gross or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Great product but the pump is terrible!</li>
            <li> It is to protect wet hair as I&#x27;m drying it, but often I spray it on to keep my hair in place and to get that fragrance again.    </li>
            <li> This was not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and initially makes my hair stiff, like hairspray...</li>
            <li> I have to be a little careful of that.</li>
            <li> but this time I ordered it, I received it in a dull bottle still with the same name and so forth.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worse than spending a half hour curling your hair only to have it fall flat before lunch!  </li>
            <li> This works really well for fake curls.</li>
            <li> It does build up after a couple uses, and having dark hair</li>
            <li> made my hair stiff and it was harder to style.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and typically purchased from my stylist.  </li>
            <li> Typically it will hold it all day.</li>
            <li> I have medium slightly wavy hair and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair done for my wedding, my hairdresser used this, and holy cow, the curls held all day!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I use just a little in my hands, rub them together and do a section at a time.</li>
            <li> I usually end up with hairs that will stick up after blow-drying but before using some other products to take care of that.</li>
            <li> i prefer not to buy an item and have to worry about it being wasted on the packaging.</li>
            <li> but when I used it from this time it made my hair oily looking and limp..</li>
            <li> Use very little hair spray with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews saying that this product was sticky, and made your hair hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure.</li>
            <li> I have never had an issue with packaging but this has by far been a disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another one before bit I&#x27;m not sure who the seller was</li>
            <li> Overall just a bad product and definitely not worth $15.</li>
            <li> This works at least as well as the Redkin 15</li>
            <li> DUH me.  </li>
            <li> So trying to spritz it on my hair is frustrating to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thin hair</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> This is a poorly design spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> So sad that they changed it.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I saw a few reviews of people saying it was just this one from Amazon, but I bought mine from a hair salon and still got the nasty crunchy effect.</li>
            <li> So sad.  :(</li>
            <li> Because of the design of the hourglass container, it&#x27;s almost impossible to hold it with one hand and spray.  </li>
            <li> It does not build up or make you hair feel bad.  </li>
            <li> and I put a ton in my hair and tried to blow it, bad idea.  </li>
            <li> Fake!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this as the final touch as she uses the wand or flat iron. Makes your hair incredible down to the tips of the strands. I use just a little in my hands, rub them together and do a section at a time. It&#x27;s like hair spray in consistency but I use it in a section, curl that section, etc. I use hair spray when I&#x27;m done...sometimes. Many times I don&#x27;t need it. Great great product!!</li>
            <li> I just love Kenra products, I&#x27;ve liked every one I have tried so far! This is great for heat styling, especially flat ironing or curling. It works wonderfully for either. I was spooked at first by the \\&quot;firm hold\\&quot; description, but it does not give crunchy, crispy or sticky feeling hair. I don&#x27;t like my hair feeling like it is full of product. This gives great hold but \\&quot;firm\\&quot; is poor word choice. I did unwisely put this stuff on my bangs thinking I could get some lift that way... Oh yeah, it lifted, I looked like Miss 1980&#x27;s! It was challenging getting it to stay down after that. Moral of the story: experimenting is good, just don&#x27;t do it when you&#x27;re going someplace!    Edit to add: I recently tried using this stuff on damp hair before blow-drying. It&#x27;s great for that too! I have some \\&quot;texturized\\&quot; hair around the crown for lift. I usually end up with hairs that will stick up after blow-drying but before using some other products to take care of that. This hot spray has enough hold that it keeps those errant hairs down and controlled when I use it before blow-drying. It doesn&#x27;t make hair feel gross or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Kenra Platinum Hot Spray is a step up from the usual.  Its scent is so pleasant, I actually look forward to spraying it on when my hair is wet.  It is to protect wet hair as I&#x27;m drying it, but often I spray it on to keep my hair in place and to get that fragrance again.    It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but it lasts a long time.  It gives my hair a shine it would not otherwise have.  Good shine, protection, hold, AND yummy scent -- what more could I want???!!!</li>
            <li> As Reg&#x27;s wife, I have used this product for over a year now.  My fine hair does not hold the curls for a curling iron and when I spray this product on first, then role with the curling iron, the curl stays in place and sets up until I am ready to comb it out.  It is a terrific product, and I would recommend to everyone...</li>
            <li> Great product to give body to fine hair. I have been using this product for many year&#x27;s, would reccomend it to any body. Just spray it in dry hair and use either a curling iron or flat iron.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and product is great! Styles wonderfully</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be like a hair spray but it still is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, spray before using hot iron or curling iron. When you have fine hair and not a lot of it, you need some kind of hold, this helps!</li>
            <li> Good price on a favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells good and it holds hair very well.  The best thing about this hairspray is that you can easily comb out your hair anytime after application.</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have if you use a straightener on your hair.  It makes your hair shiny and silky looking.  The bottle was shipped in a bubble-wrap padded bag, and the sprayer was damaged in transit, so I had to pour the contents into another bottle, so I&#x27;ll probably buy from another seller next time.</li>
            <li> Protects hair from damage of flat iron</li>
            <li> I typically purchase Kenra products from my hairdresser,price is better &amp; received faster. Don&#x27;t let the prices deter you they last a long time cause you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> My hair now has a discernible style!  It&#x27;s full, wavy, and isn&#x27;t flopping against my face.  I use this before using my 1.5-inch curling iron, and my hair holds the curling until I finger comb it.  Kenra products are great!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair straight. I bought it to help hold style. It would be great for someone wearing a straight style. It smells great and leaves hair shiny, but takes all body and curl out.</li>
            <li> not a good buy has to much alcohol is diferent not like the one i used before, i got it at beauty shop</li>
            <li> I have no idea what this is used for, but my wife is happy with the product.  Strange...I keep having to order more...</li>
            <li> This product does a nice job on your hair.  Just don&#x27;t use so much otherwise it can weight the hair down.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Hold up to my frizzy hair and tames it so well</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have used it for years. The smell is absolutely amazing. It helps your hair hold curl or straightening and protects against heat. It does have some what of a hold to it, so it can get a little crunchy if you spray too much, but just make sure your brush through your hair and that will help it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and also curls and straight hair stay all day !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any relaxer in my hair but this product makes it look like I do. Hair stays straight for days!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and typically purchased from my stylist.  I keep an eye out for good deals on Amazon &amp; stock up when I can.  The product itself works very well when I&#x27;m straightening my hair.  Helps with shine and holds well.  Use very little hair spray with this product.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and shiny.  A much better price than at a salon.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the bomb, holds curl and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel crunchy. I spray it on before and after I curl each section and it&#x27;s the only way I can get my hair to hold curl.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! I have fine, frizzy, thick colored hair. Spritz this, flat iron, comb through and my hair is silky smooth and longer due to the frizzy kinks flattened out. Gleams and lasts for days. YAY!</li>
            <li> Not a fan. It made my hair sticky (I only used 2-3 light sprays from a distance). It made the straightener catch, rather than glide smoothly.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected it to be. I thought it was to protect my hair but instead it made my hair have a crunchy texture after straightening it. So I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s like hairspray? Not exactly sure.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair lift and offers a lasting hold.  Out of the many products I have tried, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I love this product in general, however when my package arrived it was broken and half my product was gone.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it when I want to hair to stay in place.  Works great.  Good product to use.</li>
            <li> This works really well for fake curls. The curl holds it&#x27;s shape when this is sprayed on the strand before you actually use a wand or curling iron. Hope that makes sense. And then once you have curled your entire hair, you can then run your fingers through or use a pick comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and initially makes my hair stiff, like hairspray...which I&#x27;m NOT a fan of.  Once I&#x27;m done straightening it, my hair is closer to its normal soft feel and this helps prevent heat damage.  A bit spendy, but worth it so my hair isn&#x27;t friend and doesn&#x27;t break off.</li>
            <li> Ok This is THE BESTTTTTT hairspray i have ever experienced, just don&#x27;t overdue it, even if you do it&#x27;ll take about half the bottle&#x27;s contents to give hair any sort of crunchy feel, but dont underestimate the hold, its amazing even in hot humid VA summers, kept my hair frizz free and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist just used this product on me today after drying and before using the flat iron. It left my frizzy, over-processed hair shiny and smooth! I haven&#x27;t tried it out in humid conditions yet, but I love the fact that it&#x27;s protecting my hair from the iron and giving it shine it never had before!</li>
            <li> This product was all over the packaging and box. Not sealed properly...</li>
            <li> Works as advertised - what more needs to be said!!!  A staple in my hair product arsenal!!!  Holds hair post styling hair.</li>
            <li> Pros, product arrived earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Cons, when I opened the package the two products weren&#x27;t even wrapped in plastic to keep them from spilling. With this being said, the product leaked out into the packaging making the product half full and sticky on the outside. I have never had an issue with packaging but this has by far been a disappointing experience. i prefer not to buy an item and have to worry about it being wasted on the packaging.</li>
            <li> This works at least as well as the Redkin 15 I used to use. I think it&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but nothing to do about that. It does build up after a couple uses, and having dark hair I have to be a little careful of that. I also use the Kenra 21 hairspray, and am *very* happy with that.</li>
            <li> I like this hot spray.  It is less firm than the Thermal Spray Kenra offers, which I have sworn by for the last several years.  I like a little sticky so that my hair does not seem as flat, gives it a little bit of texture, BUT I have noticed that this Hot Spray seems less damaging to my hair than the Thermal Spray.  Both products are good but if you like more smoothness and less hold, the Hot Spray is better.</li>
            <li> This product makes it feel like you are actually cooking your hair when applied and then flat iron is used.</li>
            <li> My hair looked great when using this product with a curling iron. My only problem is that the directions say, &amp;#34;apply liberally,&amp;#34; which I think I too far. I have fairly thin hair so I think I just went overboard for what I needed, but regardless my hair looked great and did not have the extra &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; texture that often accompanies regular hairspray. I will definitely continue to use this product when using my hot curling iron.</li>
            <li> This makes a big difference in how my straight thin hair will hold volume. I will NOT go without it!</li>
            <li> Expensive but okay product.</li>
            <li> This really good product using with hot iron  and curling brush, use on a regular bases.</li>
            <li> Fake!!! It ruin my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews saying that this product was sticky, and made your hair hard and crunchy. That is spot on. This product smells more like hairspray and made my hair hard to straighten due to the stickiness. I saw a few reviews of people saying it was just this one from Amazon, but I bought mine from a hair salon and still got the nasty crunchy effect. Overall just a bad product and definitely not worth $15.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than spending a half hour curling your hair only to have it fall flat before lunch!  Tried several hair sprays, but nothing holds like Kenra.  This stuff is amazing, truly holds all day and honestly doesn&#x27;t look half bad the next day either.</li>
            <li> This hot spray is okay.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again.  However Kenra has other products that I really, really like.  This just isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this is the only product that will keep my curls holding for more than an hour. Typically it will hold it all day.</li>
            <li> The only product that will make my hair hold shape and look fuller.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Arrived on time, in good condition and I am very happy.  Will most likely repeat the whole process next time.</li>
            <li> I usually love Kenra Products but this spray was a mess. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Makes my slightly wirey hair beautifully smooth look and feel. It also prolongs the length of time I can go between doing my hair. I wake up and can brush m hair right back into the shape it was when I did it first. I am 69 and my hair is wavy and dry. Combined with a morrocan oil product first, my hair looks as good as it did when I was MUCH younger. Beware of using too much. The bottle is large so I used more than I would have without a good outcome. Top this with Kendra&#x27;s Platinum Texturing Taffy and I look as if I just stepped out of a salon.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and I love the product!  Was a hot sets fan this is way better and hair feels like nothing is in it!  Holds forever</li>
            <li> Very sticky. Turns hair into wires. For that reason used it once only. Bought GHD instead, love it</li>
            <li> Great for the Miracurl and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for ages, LOVE the smell.  I use it as both styling and hair spray.  And even when I want a touch of fragrance since I don&#x27;t wear perfume.  It is lightweight but provides great hold.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love Kenra platium hot spray, it protects my hair from getting fryed and gives it a very sleek shine.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product. I have thin hair and once I spray Kenra&lt;br /&gt;on it give me lots of volume. Thank Kenra product..&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia</li>
            <li> Not for me. I didn&#x27;t like how it makes my hair feel but I do know that Kenra makes really good products.</li>
            <li> This product is great to spray on your hair then set it.  It does not build up or make you hair feel bad.  Just soft and smooth.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works really great when using flat irons.  Like the scent, too!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Just a tiny spray keeps your hair in place and I can just refresh it the next day with a quick spritz of water!</li>
            <li> I use this product before curling my hair. The smell is great and I really believe that this hot spray helps my hair with maintaining the curl all day and perhaps prevents too much damage from occurring to treated hair!  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for straightening my thick wavy hair.  Although it can get &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, which I don&#x27;t like, you can brush your hair to remove that stiffness and your hair remains silky straight.  The smell is one of my favorites, it is light and fruity.</li>
            <li> Really like this product!</li>
            <li> I had purchased another one before bit I&#x27;m not sure who the seller was and I really, really loved it! But this one is definitely not the same at all this ones feels more like hair spray.  Did not like, I have it away and that person felt the same way.</li>
            <li> This is the best holding protective spray ever.  I never go without this spray.  It has a nice fragrance also. Kenra products are great!!!</li>
            <li> love it moisturizes skin and last all day! I am nurse and I wash my hands alot! Recommend this lotion above any other for dry skin!  Feels good on skin and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I honestly got this spray confused with their blow-dry spray and I put a ton in my hair and tried to blow it, bad idea.  It made my hair super tangled and sticky.  BUT then I realized it should be used for AFTER your hair is dry but BEFORE you use your curling wand or straightener DUH me.  honestly I think I would only use this for curling, it will definitely serve its purpose for that and I can see it keeping the curl held for quite a while.</li>
            <li> The product is good.  The vendor didn&#x27;t package it for shipping very well.  An inch of the product leaked out, but I&#x27;m happy with what I have left.  My stylist uses this brand and I&#x27;m happy to have my own to use at home now.</li>
            <li> Love! Best hair product for heat treatment</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it.  It was in a bright shinny bottle but this time I ordered it, I received it in a dull bottle still with the same name and so forth.  I loved this before but when I used it from this time it made my hair oily looking and limp.. I will not be using this again.  So sad that they changed it.  Why I can only guess, it used to hold my hair style till I washed my hair but not any more.  Now it only holds my hair for a very short time.  By the time I get to where I&#x27;m going and on with my day it looks like I just got out of bed and need to fix my hair.. So sad.  :(</li>
            <li> I have been a Redken fan for over 30 years but recently have noticed a change in their &amp;#34;Hot Sets&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Spray Starch&amp;#34;.  I have not been happy with either one but could not find a product that was better.  FINALLY!  Kenra Platinum Hot Spray is wonderful.  I have super fine, stick straight hair &amp; this does not weight it down or make it look &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.  It actually leaves my curls soft &amp; shiny and holds very well.  This is my new hot spray.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 7 years. I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Kenra hotspray and was happy to see it offered at a reasonable price.  Product arrived quickly although some it had leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li> This is my GO TO hair spray.  Smells nice and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger forever.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair and smells amazing.  I love this product</li>
            <li> This product is what took my hair from okay to straight and sleek and keeps it that way until I wash it!  It works great protecting my hair from getting fried, helps me to actually GET my hair to straighten and it smells and feels nice.  This is my favorite hair product!  I have medium slightly wavy hair and a lot of it.  This product makes straightening it quick and easy.  It also has helped me to get the curls to stay in my daughters hair when we used the curling iron.  She looked great for her concert.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> made my hair stiff and it was harder to style.</li>
            <li> Sticky if you use too much but a great product</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Couple it with a Kenra 10 hairspray and it&#x27;s a great hold.</li>
            <li> Great product but the pump is terrible!</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Left hair crunchy. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a poorly design spray bottle.  Because of the design of the hourglass container, it&#x27;s almost impossible to hold it with one hand and spray.  Whoever designed this product container needs to find work in another field.  So trying to spritz it on my hair is frustrating to say the least.  The product also does not distribute a fine mist to cover the hair evenly.  So if you have fine hair, avoid this. The product itself works moderately well but there are other products on the market that work as well with a much better distribution/delivery system.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time now.  It&#x27;s great for keeping the curl.  I love it!</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  The mist is very, very fine, very little is required, combs out easily and stays all day.</li>
            <li> My new best friend!!! Love this product! Spray on dry hair, flat iron, brush out...best thing since sliced bread!!! :)</li>
            <li> This really gives my hair bounce and shine - hard to do for my 57 year old hair, but it does the trick, and it smells good too</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great for straightening and curling. When I use it for curling, my hair will stay nicely curled for days. I definitely notice a difference in hair protection. The smell is great too.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and I have a lot of it. It has never held a curl for longer than an hour, two hours tops.&lt;br /&gt;When I had my hair done for my wedding, my hairdresser used this, and holy cow, the curls held all day! They were soft, but firm (I know, that sounds both illogical AND obscene LOL) --they didn&#x27;t have the crunchy feel that I&#x27;ve gotten from gels/strong mousses/hair sprays. They were just--determined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the spray myself with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll always have this on my shelf. Best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Keeps your hair shiny and gives great protection from the heat of your appliances.  Would highly recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love it...I never do my hair in the morning without it!  Keeps the curls all day long.  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
