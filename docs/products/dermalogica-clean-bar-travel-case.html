            <li>Very nice, well made, soap bar travel case..</li>

            <li>So that&#x27;s a good thing I suppose.  </li>
            <li>It is good to have for travel or every day use at home.</li>
            <li>Great case does the job, nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>but the top has a crack in it after just 1 fall!  </li>
            <li>I have this box and honestly, I prefer a ziploc bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Nice seal.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my soap in good condition and clean.</li>
            <li>The Dermalogica Clean Bar Travel Case is a good case for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this bar holder.</li>
            <li>Nothing irritates me more than to find your soap soaking in water.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much more to say.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because the soap holder is very lightweight and soap fits in the holder it is great if you use at home or travel.</li>
            <li>Nothing more.</li>
            <li>It does the job...for the most part.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and good quality.</li>
            <li>It also rinses clean if you find some soap on top of it.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t go dropping it from the Eiffel Tower or anything, and you should be just fine.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and while the case is not too secure, I have not had any problem with it coming off.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Also good for storing the bar from one usage to the next, at home.</li>
            <li>Great for travel and keeping your bar of soap clean and other items in your luggage protected.</li>
            <li>I am sure that I will get many years of hard use out of this case.</li>
            <li>Snaps shut and holds very well.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be put together reasonably well, although it doesn&#x27;t stand out much from any run-of-the-mill bar soap holder.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t shattered yet causing trauma to precious little piggies tootsies.</li>
            <li>I wish the lid would stay attached a little better.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Not a cheap chinese knock off that will break after a few months, instead, higher quality</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s held up well.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t dropped it thus far, so I can&#x27;t judge its quality.</li>
            <li>But so far, it does the job.  </li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t any perceptible holes, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Keeps the soap nice and dry as long as you empty the water before storing it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something large enough to carry some of the higher end soap bars on the market, which tend to be longer than the average soap bar.</li>

            <li> It ventilates well enough to be dry by the next day.  </li>
            <li> soap won&#x27;t dry in here,</li>
            <li> This case keeps my soaps dry.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my soap bar dry..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too extremely loose though.  </li>
            <li> Not much to it</li>
            <li> but it works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned that it might not stay closed.  </li>
            <li> It snaps closed and stays put.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t put a dripping wet soap bar into it and expect it not to drip if turned on</li>
            <li> I expect this little box to hold up for years.</li>
            <li> It appears firm and sturdy.</li>
            <li> then I expected!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a good/hard/solid soap case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This, unfortunately, did not meet my needs in that regard.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fitted the bar of soap, nicer case then I expected!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a good/hard/solid soap case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I just moved and cannot find it...I guess I have to get another one!</li>
            <li> Good sleek soap travel box. Keeps the soap nice and dry as long as you empty the water before storing it.</li>
            <li> I have this box and honestly, I prefer a ziploc bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your soap won&#x27;t dry in here, so I just put my soap in a ziploc bag when I&#x27;m done showering at the gym and leave it top-up in my backpack without zipping the ziploc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will just keep a bar of soap damp, let the water soak through the bar, and turn it to mush. I don&#x27;t like that one bit.</li>
            <li> Its a soap travel case.  Not much to it but it works as expected.  Fits the dermalogica face bar perfectly.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s held up well.  It holds the soap well.  It ventilates well enough to be dry by the next day.  It hasn&#x27;t shattered yet causing trauma to precious little piggies tootsies. So that&#x27;s a good thing I suppose.  I wish the lid would stay attached a little better.  It&#x27;s not too extremely loose though.  Just don&#x27;t go dropping it from the Eiffel Tower or anything, and you should be just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this to be thrown into my gym bag.  I was a bit concerned that it might not stay closed.  So far, so good.  It snaps closed and stays put.  The material is rigid enough that I do not expect it to warp.  I am sure that I will get many years of hard use out of this case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this bar holder. I like its appearance. It appears firm and sturdy. I haven&#x27;t dropped it thus far, so I can&#x27;t judge its quality. But so far, it does the job.  You hear the click of it snapping shut. It also rinses clean if you find some soap on top of it. Nothing irritates me more than to find your soap soaking in water. This case keeps my soaps dry. There aren&#x27;t any perceptible holes, as far as I can tell. Before returning the holder to its designated spot, I do remove the water. The nice,elegant design is an added bonus. All in all, a winner.</li>
            <li> Very nice, well made, soap bar travel case..&lt;br /&gt;Not a cheap chinese knock off that will break after a few months, instead, higher quality and it keeps my soap bar dry..</li>
            <li> This case does the job. It&#x27;s a soap case. There isn&#x27;t much more to say. This keeps my soap in good condition and clean. It is good to have for travel or every day use at home.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Bought this for my cetaphil bar. I expect this little box to hold up for years. I have never dropped it but I dont plan to either so...</li>
            <li> What can I say, it does what its supposed to...</li>
            <li> Great for travel and keeping your bar of soap clean and other items in your luggage protected. Also good for storing the bar from one usage to the next, at home. Reasonable price and good quality.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because the soap holder is very lightweight and soap fits in the holder it is great if you use at home or travel.</li>
            <li> Great case does the job, nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Nothing more.</li>
            <li> Nice seal.  Not leak proof nor does it claim to be so don&#x27;t put a dripping wet soap bar into it and expect it not to drip if turned on it&#x27;s side.  Snaps shut and holds very well.  It doesn&#x27;t look it but it does hold the larger 5.25 oz. soap bars with no problem.</li>
            <li> holds big soap bars well but the top has a crack in it after just 1 fall!  next time, im going to the dollar store for one of these...</li>
            <li> The Dermalogica Clean Bar Travel Case is a good case for traveling.  It is sturdy and while the case is not too secure, I have not had any problem with it coming off.</li>
            <li> It does the job...for the most part.
