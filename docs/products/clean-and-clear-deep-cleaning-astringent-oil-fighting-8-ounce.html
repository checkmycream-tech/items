            <li>more thing -</li>
            <li>Product came in excellent condition and is very good for deep cleaning specially for mixed skin.</li>
            <li>No, you don&#x27;t, &#x27;cause stopping the cough is more important than the taste.</li>
            <li>But probably the most important thing, isnt the product at all.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s sounds high for one bottle, but considering the cost of shipping and handling, it really is fair.</li>
            <li>It refreshes, and does a great job keeping her skin clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>I find that it is most effective on my forehead, where the acne shows up mainly as clogged pores and whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted to have smooth, soft arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rather than a bumpy patch, my skin is now relatively smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Salicylic acid is great to prevent open pores.</li>
            <li>I give this five stars because it keeps my skin clean and free of acne.</li>
            <li>Every body has to find, I&#x27;m sure, what fits there exact skin type.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this to try and clean up said blackheads, when they occur.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Has a clean scent to it, reminds me of a soapy scent.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t own shares in Johnson and Johnson--clean and clear&#x27;s parent company--</li>
            <li>so I have crows feet at the corners of my eyes and some deep forehead wrinkles that have improved a good bit since I began using products containing Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li>so I have crows feet at the corners of my eyes and some deep forehead wrinkles that have improved a good bit since I began using products containing Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li>There are other sellers on Amazon who sell this item one bottle at a time, some Amazon sellers have it in a pack of 6, and prices vary greatly from seller to seller and from week to week or month to month.</li>
            <li>Not just a mild sting, but full-out, want-to-rip-my-face-off burn.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s me, you might be able to use Clean and Clear alone and not need benzoyl peroxide too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put some Clean &amp; Clear Oil Fighting astringent in a spray bottle to spray on his back after his showers and his back has improved tremendously in four days!!!!!</li>
            <li>I just clean my face very well in the shower then use this.</li>
            <li>It doesnt dry out my face surprisingly and my face is very clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, for me, any time I see this item available on Amazon for about $3.50 per bottle (with reasonable shipping costs) I&#x27;m stocking up, at least 6 to 10 bottles if shipping charges are fair (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</li>
            <li>, I advise you contact the seller first, and ask these two questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember, larger companies get better shipping rates than you</li>
            <li>Remember, larger companies get better shipping rates than you</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using this product, my face is nearly acne free.</li>
            <li>and I started to see result within first week of use.</li>
            <li>DD     Just saying though... everything ((except for the oil blotting clean and clear sheets-love that stuff)) from clean and clear doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>also like the fact that Clean &amp; Clear</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this Clean &amp; Clear Astringent.  </li>
            <li>I started using Clean and Clear Astringent with 2% salicylic acid about one month ago</li>
            <li>Clean and clear will get the job done.</li>
            <li>A product that contains SALICYLIC ACID like the Clean &amp; Clear Oil Fighting Astringent &amp; Blackhead Eraser Scrub keeps pores unclogged so this doesn&#x27;t happen as often.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try the Clean &amp; Clear astringent there and see if it helped.....</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that Clean &amp; Clear is just as effective and costs less.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear is made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, a name I trust as much as Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>per bottle at the very most), stock up if you can&#x27;t buy it locally, because prices of consumer goods are expected to go up 4 to 6 percent or more (more if plastic is involved) over the next 6 to 12 months, and prices will most likely continue to rise at a high percentage rate, over the next 5 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it really helps to stop breakouts</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t get much acne.</li>
            <li>I have a regime of facial products that I use to keep my skin smooth and blemish-free.</li>
            <li>And I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>This product can be used as a cleanser or, if applied in multiple layers, as a light peel.</li>
            <li>and it covers your whole face.</li>
            <li>There are fantastic treatments out there that do not cost a fortune and teenagers especially need</li>
            <li>If you got a face full of acne, clogging your pores and trapping dirt inside is the last thing you wanna do.</li>
            <li>particular listing is for 2 bottles (8 oz each)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>But if you have a problem with super dry skin or super sensitive skin you might want to try the sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And in Jesus name I receive my clear face!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried benzoyl peroxide w/o Clean and Clear and it wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>I tried Clean and Clear w/o benzoyl peroxide and it wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent,</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so you may need to play around with the Clean &amp; Clear combinations....</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so you may need to play around with the Clean &amp; Clear combinations....</li>
            <li>Deep Astringent (regular 2% formula) does not have an overpowering smell, which is very important to me since I have sensitive sinuses and inhalant</li>
            <li>But, you need to know, if you buy 10 bottles are they going to charge you $39.80 (don&#x27;t laugh, some do) or will they charge you a fair price, which would be $10 to $14 tops for 10 bottles, for Priority Mail (medium or large flat rate box), less if shipping by UPS - should be no more than $8 if by UPS.</li>

            <li>The Clean &amp; Clear Advantage products are designed for a more serious form of acne and you still may need an antibiotic or a prescription strength medication if the C &amp; C Advantage products do not clear up your skin.</li>
            <li>just finally noticed how with clean and clear this stuff and face wash, I haven&#x27;t had a clear face since 3rd grade.</li>
            <li>Cleans up the oily feeling off my face and mild enough that I can use it several times a day if need be.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and it won&#x27;t STING like alcohol does.</li>
            <li>The Salicylic Acid products have really improved my skin overall and it has lightened the sun damage and acne marks that have been with me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Salicylic Acid is drying so you may need the Sensitive Skin type or just use the treatment in the T-zone area (no cheeks).</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Clean &amp; Clear Deep Astringent for over 20 years, possibly 30 years (I lost count, or maybe I don&#x27;t want to admit how long it&#x27;s been).</li>
            <li>at least you will not go broke if you purchase a Clean &amp; Clear product if it isn&#x27;t the correct one for your skin.</li>

            <li>I needed it when I was in my teens and early twenties, and it still helps me with my skin issues well into middle age.</li>
            <li>It can be drying as well, but I use it only one time a day generally before I go to bed b/c when I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li>Before you buy from anyone, I recommend you check Amazon for other sellers, and when you do find it at a decent price (I recommend looking for $3.50 per bottle, $5. 00</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It stings, and doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve used this for years now, thinking it was working... just finally noticed how with clean and clear this stuff and face wash, I haven&#x27;t had a clear face since 3rd grade. (I&#x27;m 19)  :[[  I just have oily skin, random break outs all the time, not too bad, but seriously... can I just have a clear face most of the time? Instead of never see one? Going to a dermatologist soon to see whats up. And in Jesus name I receive my clear face!! :DD     Just saying though... everything ((except for the oil blotting clean and clear sheets-love that stuff)) from clean and clear doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m sure it does for some people. Every body has to find, I&#x27;m sure, what fits there exact skin type.</li>
            <li> This is really good for acne prone skin it burns when you put it on but it really helps to stop breakouts</li>
            <li> Short of a couple of blackheads here and there, I don&#x27;t get much acne. I wanted to use this to try and clean up said blackheads, when they occur. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or anything, and typically astringent usually stings a little at first when applied for me, but this was downright painful. It hurt really, really bad. Ouch.</li>
            <li> I give this five stars because it keeps my skin clean and free of acne. Since this exfoliates the dead skin as well, it is helping to remove the brown marks that my old acne has left behind. I agree with the first commentor that it does sting a little, but since I use salicylic acid regularly I expected it. Dealing with the acne and the scars is much worse than dealing with momentary sting. It can be drying as well, but I use it only one time a day generally before I go to bed b/c when I wake up in the morning my skin looks like it is renewed. That helps to control the drying.     I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> QUALITY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Clean &amp; Clear Deep Astringent for over 20 years, possibly 30 years (I lost count, or maybe I don&#x27;t want to admit how long it&#x27;s been). I needed it when I was in my teens and early twenties, and it still helps me with my skin issues well into middle age. The active ingredient, salicylic acid 2.0%, is the key to why it works. It also comes in a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin formula (blue-ish in color), but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s just too weak for me, doesn&#x27;t do much, it only contains 1/4 of the salicylic acid (0.5%). But if you have a problem with super dry skin or super sensitive skin you might want to try the sensitive skin formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that Clean &amp; Clear Deep Astringent (regular 2% formula) does not have an overpowering smell, which is very important to me since I have sensitive sinuses and inhalant allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product every day, sometimes 2 to 3 times a day and never have a problem with over drying or skin irritation, even though I do have pale skin that normally needs to be handled with kid gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints about the quality of this product at all, but I can say that I also need a benzoyl peroxide product to use with it. I&#x27;ve tried benzoyl peroxide w/o Clean and Clear and it wasn&#x27;t enough. I tried Clean and Clear w/o benzoyl peroxide and it wasn&#x27;t enough. But that&#x27;s me, you might be able to use Clean and Clear alone and not need benzoyl peroxide too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVAILABILITY &amp; PRICE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that it&#x27;s hard to find in stores and it&#x27;s a bit expensive, usually ranging from around $3.75 to $4.99 per 8 ounce bottle (in NYC and surrounding areas). A local pharmacy store in my area (NYC suburbs) use to carry it, but they no longer do. Why, I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s why I started buying it here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular listing is for 2 bottles (8 oz each) so keep that in mind for pricing. There are other sellers on Amazon who sell this item one bottle at a time, some Amazon sellers have it in a pack of 6, and prices vary greatly from seller to seller and from week to week or month to month. Before you buy from anyone, I recommend you check Amazon for other sellers, and when you do find it at a decent price (I recommend looking for $3.50 per bottle, $5. 00 per bottle at the very most), stock up if you can&#x27;t buy it locally, because prices of consumer goods are expected to go up 4 to 6 percent or more (more if plastic is involved) over the next 6 to 12 months, and prices will most likely continue to rise at a high percentage rate, over the next 5 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, for me, any time I see this item available on Amazon for about $3.50 per bottle (with reasonable shipping costs) I&#x27;m stocking up, at least 6 to 10 bottles if shipping charges are fair (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE ORDERING &amp; STOCKING UP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take my advice and buy in quantity when an Amazon seller has a great price, I advise you contact the seller first, and ask these two questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) What is the expiration date of the items you&#x27;ll receive? You need to know this so you can calculate how many bottles you should buy at one time. For example, if you use one bottle a month and the expiration date is only 1 year ahead, we&#x27;d advise buying no more than 10 bottles. Always give yourself a at least 2 months cushion on expiration dates, otherwise you might end up wasting your money by not using the item before it expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) What will the total shipping cost be for the total number of bottles you&#x27;ll be buying? Usually Amazon sellers post their shipping charges for one bottle, not expecting someone to buy in bulk. And for one 8 ounce bottle the cost is usually about $3.98. That&#x27;s sounds high for one bottle, but considering the cost of shipping and handling, it really is fair. Those of us who must buy this item by mail, because no local stores carry it, have to take this into consideration, buying a liquid product by mail is always going to cost us extra in shipping. But, you need to know, if you buy 10 bottles are they going to charge you $39.80 (don&#x27;t laugh, some do) or will they charge you a fair price, which would be $10 to $14 tops for 10 bottles, for Priority Mail (medium or large flat rate box), less if shipping by UPS - should be no more than $8 if by UPS. Remember, larger companies get better shipping rates than you and I do so they should be able to pass those savings on to you. Yes, you can allow them a small amount extra for \\&quot;handling\\&quot; charges, which is why I say $14 tops for Priority mail, not $11 or $12 for 10 bottles.ally is fair.

            <li> If I didn&#x27;t own shares in Johnson and Johnson--clean and clear&#x27;s parent company--I&#x27;d probably give this product three stars instead of four. So keep buying this product for my portfolio yo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and never really had an acne problem until about a year ago (hormones?)  I tried everything to control it with no good results. Thought I would give this a try. After two weeks of using this product, my face is nearly acne free. I dab it on with a cotton ball at night and moisturize with some unrefined coconut oil in the morning. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is great product for price. It cleanse well and I started to see result within first week of use. I actually reordered it.</li>
            <li> I have a regime of facial products that I use to keep my skin smooth and blemish-free. I usually use the clean&amp;clear astringent for sensitive skin, but when I went to the store, they only had the deep-cleaning astringent. So I bought it, and when I put it on at night, I was horrified to find that it burned my skin. Not just a mild sting, but full-out, want-to-rip-my-face-off burn. I immediately washed my face and moisturized. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because it does actually work, but it hurts. a lot.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Cleans GREAT.  And I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product can be used as a cleanser or, if applied in multiple layers, as a light peel. It will sting if applied liberally, but that&#x27;s a sign that it&#x27;s going deep. I don&#x27;t understand why people complain about the stinging. Do you complain about the taste of cough medicine? No, you don&#x27;t, &#x27;cause stopping the cough is more important than the taste. It&#x27;s the same with this product. Twice a week will keep your skin looking fresher and younger. Also your acne will diminish. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this Clean &amp; Clear Astringent.  It refreshes, and does a great job keeping her skin clean and clear.  It has a tingly feeling, but not the sting that rubbing alcohol or a harsher astringent does.  Two thumbs up from our house!</li>
            <li> I started using Clean and Clear Astringent with 2% salicylic acid about one month ago and I am satisfied with the results.  I have type 4 skin, with mixed complexion, and have had some form of acne since puberty.  I find that it is most effective on my forehead, where the acne shows up mainly as clogged pores and whiteheads.  Rather than a bumpy patch, my skin is now relatively smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it during the daytime, but now my use is only at night, before retiring to bed.  As I have type 4 skin, there is no stinging sensation, just a cooling effect.  It works; and I only wish that Johnson &amp; Johnson had come out with this product when I was younger.  It would have saved me, and many another person, much money and grief at the time.</li>
            <li> I like this product  good for oily skin and for pimples, i will recommend this product.great price.i will buy more of this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had adult acne for a couple of very frustrating years and have literally spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a product that helped. this is great product and i will recommend this.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time with this review if it didn&#x27;t work. I have an average skin type.. Screw proactiv. Screw Burt&#x27;s bees mock of proactiv... It&#x27;s all a waste of money and they stain everything. Clean and clear will get the job done. It literally strips everything off your face. And you&#x27;ll feel it. The only downside to this product is that it burns like the deepest pits of hell, and WILL dry your face out. DO NOT use this without a moisturizer. I use the astringant at night, wash my face with water in the morning and use a moisturizer once a day. It&#x27;s what 4$? Probably the best investment ever. Another upside, it&#x27;s liquid, and impossible to overuse. It will last. Dip one cotton ball and it covers your whole face. But probably the most important thing, isnt the product at all. If you eat like crap, you look like crap. Kick the soda and try not to eat overly processed foods. That will only help. Another thing.. I&#x27;m a girl. I use makeup. If you got a face full of acne, clogging your pores and trapping dirt inside is the last thing you wanna do. A week or two without make up is nothing compared to the results you&#x27;ll get with this stuff. And it smells good :)</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent, Oil Fighting, 8 ounce is the best for oily skin.  It keeps oil away all day.  I use a primer too...before putting on make up. Highly recommend.  My skin feels soft and it won&#x27;t STING like alcohol does.</li>
            <li> Cleans up the oily feeling off my face and mild enough that I can use it several times a day if need be.  Has a clean scent to it, reminds me of a soapy scent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Salicylic acid is great to prevent open pores. Product came in excellent condition and is very good for deep cleaning specially for mixed skin. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work. I dont use step one or step three. I just clean my face very well in the shower then use this. Also sounds crazy but after using this I also use alcohol. It doesnt dry out my face surprisingly and my face is very clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have combination skin and wrinkles. I get clogged pores which result in painful cystic acne around my jawline and chin. A product that contains SALICYLIC ACID like the Clean &amp; Clear Oil Fighting Astringent &amp; Blackhead Eraser Scrub keeps pores unclogged so this doesn&#x27;t happen as often. I seldom get one since I began using these products. I began using the Neutrogena Salicylic Acid products but I&#x27;ve found that Clean &amp; Clear is just as effective and costs less. Clean &amp; Clear is made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, a name I trust as much as Neutrogena. I also apply a sulphur mask product on my chin and jawline at night. Keep in mind, the astringent or even the astringent &amp; scrub may not be enough if you have serious acne which I do NOT have. The Clean &amp; Clear Advantage products are designed for a more serious form of acne and you still may need an antibiotic or a prescription strength medication if the C &amp; C Advantage products do not clear up your skin. Please, seek help from a dermatologist if this doesn&#x27;t work for you. There are fantastic treatments out there that do not cost a fortune and teenagers especially need acne taken care of. They can be traumatized from this so if you love your kids, please seek advice from a doctor!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have always had tiny pimples on the backs of my arms so I thought I&#x27;d try the Clean &amp; Clear astringent there and see if it helped.....the pimples were completely gone in less than a week (applied nightly). I am delighted to have smooth, soft arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teenage son has back acne so I got him some Antibacterial body wash (any kind, as long as the label reads ANTIBACTERIAL -- I got a Dial brand). I put some Clean &amp; Clear Oil Fighting astringent in a spray bottle to spray on his back after his showers and his back has improved tremendously in four days!!!!! The acne would probably be gone if he used this astringent twice daily but he&#x27;s lazy (: He is an athlete and he&#x27;s required to change clothes in the boys locker room at baseball practice and during gym so I did not want him to be embarressed while changing clothes in front of the other boys or while swimming at pool parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing - Salicylic Acid is very good at improving wrinkles too. Again, I&#x27;m 46 so I have crows feet at the corners of my eyes and some deep forehead wrinkles that have improved a good bit since I began using products containing Salicylic Acid. Remember, that extra nourishment and hydration are needed when combating wrinkles and a product that helps boost collagen is imperative so I use an eye cream, face moisturizer and sunscreen (wish I always had) too. The Salicylic Acid products have really improved my skin overall and it has lightened the sun damage and acne marks that have been with me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Salicylic Acid is drying so you may need the Sensitive Skin type or just use the treatment in the T-zone area (no cheeks). Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so you may need to play around with the Clean &amp; Clear combinations....at least you will not go broke if you purchase a Clean &amp; Clear product if it isn&#x27;t the correct one for your skin.
