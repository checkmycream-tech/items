            <li>Love this product I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve stopped selling this at most drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw,If you love Aveda cleansing gel, you might like this.</li>

            <li>Love this wash.</li>
            <li>love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many friends and they all agree.</li>

            <li>many products do not&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to love dove face cleanser</li>
            <li>Overall a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but effective and my skin feels really smooth and great after I use it.</li>
            <li>Many of us women struggle with hormonal acne and our efforts to fight it are most times fruitless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I just had to for this product because I&#x27;m so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it based on the great reviews and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>there are many non-soap wash products out there</li>
            <li>used this years ago and my acne prone skin never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Found it again and love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>For me it works better than the retinol my doctor prescribed.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it also can be used to remove eye makeup .</li>
            <li>but our water is softened so anything should work BETTER than advertised.</li>
            <li>Glad I took the chance on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely a good product, worth to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and would not be without it.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>I get break out here and there but nothing more than I was breaking out before I was using it.</li>
            <li>finally I found something that works perfect for my skin :)</li>
            <li>I bought 2 bottles -one for me and one for my best friend , who always has complain about pimples on his back .</li>
            <li>I am crediting this face wash with balancing my skin and making the oil more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I went to dermatologist, I took prescription medicine, but nothing ever worked more than two months.</li>
            <li>but nothing compared to how a use to break out (more than 10 pimples).</li>
            <li>What matters is that I love how it makes my face feels; I&#x27;m hoping it will help keep any blemishes at bay too.</li>
            <li>What matters is that I love how it makes my face feels; I&#x27;m hoping it will help keep any blemishes at bay too.</li>

            <li>I tried it and i am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Seems ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Pores are getting smaller, skin brighter, it&#x27;s an all around wonderful product.</li>

            <li>and it  felt better.  </li>

            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Or read the product description better than I did.</li>
            <li>Love all the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li>I like to be cautious about parabens as it may not be safe and could cause cancer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li>and it feels smooth!</li>
            <li>My favorite skin cleanser ever.</li>
            <li>But for oily skin and superficial acne, this stuff works for me &#x27;way better than anything with salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, alcohol, etc.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>

            <li>and i have gotten so many compliments on the way my skin looks and feel.</li>

            <li>and I think I need more exfoliation</li>
            <li>Maybe it would&#x27;ve worked better?</li>

            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I have used this product, along with the AH moisturizer and am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still pleased with these products.  </li>
            <li>Love this product .</li>
            <li>&quot; skin considering the a mouth if oil my face produced, on top of the pimples is develop.</li>
            <li>but i more so use it for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>was worried that since is a care product I wouldn&#x27;t be able to return it and that I was stuck with the face wash</li>
            <li>but Thanks to the great customer service of Amazon I was able to get a refund and dispose of the face wash.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it&#x27;s so affordable.</li>
            <li>I have now been using it for more than a year, and my face is the softest and clearest it has been in years.  </li>
            <li>Love it....:-)</li>

            <li>It has a light fragrance that is pleasant and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Hydroxy\\&quot; line is so cheap that you would almost think this stuff is too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>It has a neutral smell, foams nicely, leaves your skin feeling clean but not taut, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>It was a good price, much cheaper than I have been paying for it for years!  </li>
            <li>and I admit the product was good for the first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin perfect, never oily or dry and it clears up skin problems.  </li>
            <li>And that is what is best for my dry</li>

            <li>I also love that it has a cap so it can easily be used to travel</li>
            <li>Mild and really nice feel when you wash your face.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good face wash that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and leave them bright red with irritation.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li>It felt silky smooth in my palm and refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li>But I really think it is doing a good job cleaning.</li>

            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this face wash from Neoteric Cosmetics in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this face wash from Neoteric Cosmetics in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It really gives your face a \\&quot;new finish\\&quot; and feels great!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to find a cleanser and lotion made by Alpha Hydrox on Amazon, so I figured I would try it.</li>
            <li>I have been following this regimen for 2 months and my skin looks and feels wonderful and fresh</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable rubbing roughly over my eyes to remove my eye make-up, which it does wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean well, but needs a bit more rinsing off.  </li>
            <li>Holy Cow, what a great cleanser!</li>
            <li>use these face washes in the shower where I can take my time and easily lather up and rinse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild, and that&#x27;s how I like it.</li>
            <li>very mild around the eyes too.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it--it makes my face feel so *clean</li>
            <li>I just need it to be simple, effective and non-drying and this fits the bill at a good price.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash because it is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>Makes your face very soft and feel extremely clean great face wash</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and effectively removes all make up, including eye make up.</li>
            <li>I have used all the name brands and this one is right up there and really better than many.</li>
            <li>I have been using Alpha Hydrox products since last year and my face is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I finally have a beautiful even skin tone.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was packaged safely for delivery.</li>
            <li>So apparently the problem has mostly been more the fault of the cleansers I&#x27;ve been using rather than just my skin type or the moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried not being effective</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I find it super cheap for six bucks at TJ Max and Marshalls</li>
            <li>, this skin-care routine is cheap.  </li>
            <li>amazing line of products; inexpensive and very efficient.</li>
            <li>silky smooth skin</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very inexpensive, feels nice, smells neutral, and is one of the 3 products I&#x27;ve found that contains alpha hydroxy acid (AHA).  </li>
            <li>Foams up nicely and is gentle considering how well it cleans.</li>
            <li>Overall I have great skin</li>
            <li>It forms a nice lather, cleanses thoroughly and is never irritating.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this face wash.  </li>
            <li>but I always apply a light moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a face wash with great exfoliating properties, look no further.</li>
            <li>and it actually works great.</li>
            <li>I read such great reviews about this product I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable for my combination skin</li>
            <li>This is great, skin actually looks cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have found this product to be really effective and it works really well..</li>
            <li>Great facial soap for removing makeup</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It used to be available in Walgreens.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on Amazon, it seemed like this product would definitely be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>so I can get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Lovely foaming suds leaves my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>so I most definitely recommend using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>you, this stuff works better than most high end brands.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth and clean after I use this.</li>
            <li>Part of my problem was that my pores seemed to get clogged extremely easily and quickly, leading to acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the foaming face wash and the 10% enhanced cream, and decided that I&#x27;d use my own witch hazel as the toner between (because the toner of this line has witch hazel listed as one of the main ingredients, so I didn&#x27;t bother to spend on it).&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth face wash but nothing special.</li>
            <li>The best part is that a very little goes a long way with this, so it&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li>but I do see a significant difference in the oiliness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a cheaper alternative to Aqua Glycolic and a gentler alternative to glycolic acid peels and so far I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I use it in tandem with the Clarisonic face brush and my face is squeaky clean but not dry.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Its purpose is to clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so clean</li>
            <li>Skin feels so clean after using this foaming wash.</li>
            <li>and this face wash doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily like the peels did and seems to even reduce the amount of oil although it is a bit too early to say this for sure.  </li>
            <li>Saw it on Dr. OZ, he said you had to have an AHA to truly clean your skin where soap will not.  </li>
            <li>After using it my face feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling sift and clean.</li>
            <li>After cleansing face with the AH you can see and feel how clean your pores are without stripping your skin or drying it out.</li>
            <li>but thought I&#x27;d give it a try since there are so many positive reviews on this product and</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this foam wash.</li>
            <li>The price is right too!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing face wash if you have extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle soap based cleansers.</li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning my face - especially if I have makeup on - and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>I discovered it after years of trying to find a product that fit both requirements of being economical and efficacious.</li>
            <li>As a part of the daily routine, this is a good option if you have an oily or combination skin type.</li>
            <li>I have an almost full bottle I cant even use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face, fresh, super clean and free of acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for about 6 months and ready to order more.</li>
            <li>keeps my skin super clean, and has reduced my blackspots</li>
            <li>I could get a cleanser that does that in greater quantity and much cheaper at plenty of nearby retail stores.</li>
            <li>and it always leaves it feeling nice and soft and used with the AHA lotion</li>
            <li>Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li>No bad smell either.  </li>
            <li>Great mild cleanser when using with other alpha hydrox products.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling and looking fresh and clean every night.</li>
            <li>Without scrubbing, I just lather it on my face and eyes- a quick rinse-</li>
            <li>This face wash is not supposed to have any fragrance, but it did have a mild odor.</li>
            <li>But at the time, I was pregnant</li>
            <li>This product is super mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to finally find this product again.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great results and amazing value - hard to believe but the stuff really works.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with good success for the last year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash is a liquid cleanser from Neoteric Cosmetics, and it is smooth and pearly in texture; it looks and feels exactly like shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is inoffensive, a dime sized dollop is perfect - a bottle will last a long time</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry your face like some of them and produces good lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works fast and easy.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and the bottle lasts a good long while.  </li>
            <li>This helps my dry skin because it is gentle and great morning wash.</li>
            <li>That was all I got, a few days LOL.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of turning the skin over, which keeps my face looking fresh, without being harsh and drying.</li>
            <li>can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my skin is more sensitive now than it used to be, either way</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s useful to anyone, here&#x27;s my morning routine:  -Aveeno</li>
            <li>also got her the Alpha face moisturizer which she was not crazy about.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen it my own skin and that of several women who asked me what I was using.  </li>
            <li>I have done all the Proactive, Murad, clearox, nutrogena and so on regimens as directed, and my skin never stayed clear for more than two weeks.</li>
            <li>so this has to be the golden ticket.  </li>
            <li>I was more than eager to try this face wash though, because it, in the vein of neutral cleansers like Cetaphil, was formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling fresh but not &amp;#34;squeeky clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>I was told to try fresh lemon juice to (I guess)</li>
            <li>And now it&#x27;s back to the color of the rest of my skin, nice and even.</li>
            <li>Just as good or better than ones that are more expensive.</li>
            <li>Laugh lines around my eyes and lines on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is very gentle and has a mild smell.  </li>
            <li>Also reduces appearance of large pores and provides significant improvement on some acne scars.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face and neck clean, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is strong enough to wash off my makeup but not so strong that it irrates me</li>
            <li>That is a good thing because I have used other face washes that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>right after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>I think i have found the right wash for my type of skin.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>It just feel like it really works to clean my face without being too aggressive.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, it is gentle on my skin, removes my eye make up without irritation and has a clean smell.</li>
            <li>Very gentile with a naturally clean smell.</li>
            <li>i have combination skin that is very sensitive and scars easily.</li>
            <li>Would have been 5 stars if they just added a little perfume to it :P</li>
            <li>and I was ready to try something new and hopefully more</li>
            <li>personal favorite face wash is by Philosophy - but that&#x27;s a huge bottle and really pricey.</li>
            <li>It even surprisingly, starts to lighten the dark spots under my skin that have been there for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The alpha hydrox products work very well in keeping my skin looking healthy and clear.</li>
            <li>after a couple months of using it my skin(face) just feel more smooth and not blotchy and rough.</li>
            <li>Overall a great cleanser for daily use.</li>
            <li>I am 79 years old and I am very glad I finally found a face wash at a reasonable price that works!!</li>
            <li>Since it’s called “foaming” face wash, I expected it to be more, well, foamy!</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>The product is very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>I like this face wash very much.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain Beta Hydroxy like the Neutrogena but is very gentle.</li>
            <li>This cleanser gets rid of makeup and is very, very gentle.</li>
            <li>but it DID leave me with clean, soft and refreshed skin which was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>The face wash has a nice foaming action to it and it doesn&#x27;t dry your face which is important.  </li>
            <li>and I knew that pores getting larger with age was genetic for me because I have uncles and aunts with huge craters on their faces!</li>
            <li>For years it&#x27;s been a huge embarrassment since it looked like acne, not to mention, I am naturally a \\&quot;Picker\\</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>did not do much in my opinion!~</li>
            <li>I love this face wash, I have been using it for several years.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly like all the others on the market.</li>
            <li>No weird smells,</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple of weeks and it seemed to be working pretty well, but the smell bothered me.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>face always feels refreshed and cleansed after using and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash didn’t exactly meet my expectations as there was no foam</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my pores cleansed more than anything else and no residue is left, even compared to cleansers costing almost $30.  </li>
            <li>It does remove makeup pretty well</li>
            <li>It mostly showed on my forehead where my hair does not cover, on my checks like under where my sunglasses would be and on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I have tried most products under $20 and this is the one that I have continued to use because I actually get results.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with acne for many years and tried everything possible on the market...</li>
            <li>my skin&#x27;s still pretty oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky with face creams and washes</li>
            <li>I have one of the most challenging skin types and this one works pretty ok for me, not best</li>
            <li>regimen and at home facial peels every 2 weeks has made my skin so much better.</li>
            <li>I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different cleansers (at many price points) and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash!</li>
            <li>My skin is usually pretty oily and since using this wash I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement.  </li>
            <li>has been clearing it up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years, as it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and once a week I add baking soda to the mix and get a great facial with it.</li>
            <li>One month later, my skin had more acne, and it is certainly caused by this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash, it cleans thoroughly and leaves my face so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After using this product the makeup glides on easy and the skin is not dry anymore.  </li>
            <li>I use Alpha Hydrox instead to exfoliate (though it is probably gentle enough to use more often)  -Aveeno</li>
            <li>After reading all positive reviews about this cleanser I decided to give a try .</li>
            <li>I have been using this with the Alpha Hydroxy lotion, and I have seen positive results on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The face wash is not only easy to open with a flip top but is extremely gently if you get some in your eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I washed I used way too much and took awhile to wash it all off.  </li>
            <li>As long as the Alpha Hydrox line is available, I will be purchasing from it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products along these lines, I&#x27;m 41 and had minor signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, has no fragrance, won&#x27;t sting your eyes, and leaves your face clean, but soft, not over-stripped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be going back to the more expensive, but much more effective, Jan Marini bioglycolic line</li>
            <li>This initially felt like it was a more thorough deep clean</li>
            <li>I especially like how  it rinses off so easy.</li>
            <li>It closes my large pores and leaves my skin looking clearer.</li>
            <li>It looks like I have large 1 inch x 2 inch spots on my face that are tanner then the rest.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal.</li>
            <li>That means it isn&#x27;t too strong on skin and is gentle enough to be used</li>
            <li>Finally found a face wash that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, still need to add moisturizer after use but Fine with that.  </li>
            <li>I will try again in the future and hope for the best, but for now, I&#x27;m going back to my old face wash and will just pat the shiny areas dry as often as I can think about it.</li>
            <li>I have been using them faithfully for a little over 2 weeks now and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t object to sulfates, but having a highly comedogenic ingredient in a face wash seems pretty counter intuitive to me.</li>
            <li>warning is that AHA is known to make skin very sensitive to the sun, so I would suggest you apply sunscreen liberally after washing your face with this product (although you should be using sunscreen every day anyway!!).</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better than most other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried for my more mature, slightly acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Use of a moisturizer after applying is suggested - the moisturizer seems  better absorbed since uppermost dead cells are removed.  </li>
            <li>Huge difference, actually.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Wife uses and really like this product.</li>
            <li>but glycolic producs didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product falling for the \\&quot;Alpha hydrox\\&quot; name thinking that there is AHA in it for gentle resurfacing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup with no sting to the eyes and cleans gently and well.</li>
            <li>I used to use a gentle face wash in the morning and a benzoyl peroxide face wash at night to keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>It gently cleanses my face without overdrying my skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s the report: not too much.</li>
            <li>It really, really works.</li>
            <li>It stops breakouts in their tracks and clears my face up fast.</li>
            <li>it works really well</li>
            <li>The cream worked really well too</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>REALLY well to take off makeup.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;real guts\\&quot; to exfoliate the surface skin cells.      </li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>I noticed there wasn’t much of a scent to it</li>
            <li>But it wasn’t really foamy at up and didn’t even lather up that much.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Not only is it competitively priced with drugstore products, but it&#x27;s very widely available too.</li>
            <li>My face is much smoother and my complexion is brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li>It gently washes my face without over drying and has my acne under control.</li>
            <li>I really like the price</li>
            <li>and I tried the Alpha Hydrox lotion but didn&#x27;t like it as much as the foaming face wash.</li>
            <li>remover\\&quot; because this does it all, yet is gentle and I have no adverse reaction to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream.</li>
            <li>Not only did it make my arms smooth, it also cleared my face up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle like it claims and my face always feels refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>really tackles that issue around the mouth, hairline and ears.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This is gentle on my face, yet it cleans it very well.  </li>
            <li>Feels gentle on my skin while fading the scars.  </li>
            <li>I have used it a few times myself and can say it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite face wash in the whole wide world that I have tried.</li>
            <li>However, it is my favorite facial cleanser by far.  </li>
            <li>my skin is  more on the normal  side and not usually sensitive or reactive .</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than when I get a professional facial.</li>
            <li>Seeing a noticeable difference in skin - product is not to harsh and skin has a nice feel after use.</li>
            <li>My wife felt this product is effective on her dry skin, but my sister was truly amazed with how cleansed she felt after only her first use.  </li>
            <li>That beats Proactive/Neutrogena/Clean&amp;Clear Kits a $20 per month regimen, by far!!!</li>
            <li>I will never waste money on another face washing product or kit again!!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely ever got a pimple after regular use of Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried kits from Proactive, Neutrogena, clean and clear, and a few more.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product because of all the amazing reviews, but it really let me down!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been breaking out more around the time I started using this and while my skin doesn&#x27;t burn from the wash or the lotion, I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty sure this has been causing me to break out unfortunately.</li>
            <li>major thing I noticed was how soft and smooth my skin felt after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Much better than Proactiv or an other acne wash product.  </li>
            <li>Other products at twice the price don&#x27;t do it any better.</li>
            <li>If your skin is NOT sensitive to alpha hydroxy acid, it may be OK to use, but I have decided after using this, that my skin must be sensitive to the ingredients, so I returned</li>
            <li>Gives a terrific clean feeling immediately after rinsing it away.  </li>
            <li>As long as you immediately follow with moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin.  </li>
            <li>But I am thrilled with it so far, and will not be using any other cleansers for my face!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle and reminds me of the highly dermatologist recommended Cetaphil formula.</li>
            <li>I have very, very, very oily skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent face wash, left my face squeaky clean without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li>high concentration of active ingredients, no fragrance or coloring; i&#x27;m using the entire line-without a doubt beats high end brands like Peter Roth whose products are quite fascinating</li>
            <li>People often comment positively about my skin, and I&#x27;m 70 years old!</li>
            <li>however doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling very clean if I used alone w/o the other Alpha products.</li>
            <li>After using my wife&#x27;s Hydrox cleaner I noticed it left my face feeling clean, free of oil, yet not taught or dry.</li>
            <li>I had pretty clear skin before getting this but after using it my face felt drier than before</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say that this has solve my skin problems, but it does make my skin look radiant and much healthier than it normal is.</li>
            <li>I always try to stay with the low price range items but sometimes they don&#x27;t work as good as more expensive items.</li>
            <li>soap free cleanser,works as described.this is good if you have dry flakey skin.especially in the winter time when it is cold outside and warm inside.</li>
            <li>I notice my skin getting less wrinkly and more toned.</li>
            <li>I then have to rush and put moisturizer on my face as quick as possible to avoid/eliminate the burning.  </li>
            <li>B0009F402K Clarisonic Classic Skin Care System 7 piece]]</li>
            <li>and the price is decent.</li>
            <li>I have found that as I got older, I have had to change my skin regimen.  </li>
            <li>I think washing twice a day or even once a day with this cleanser, may be too much for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It pretty much stayed the same consistency the whole time.</li>
            <li>highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was rated so high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Good product, makes my face feel good, not oily or dry, but not sure if it&#x27;s enough for extreme stress.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a \\&quot;bland\\&quot; face wash (meaning it has no active ingredients or medicated treatments), which is exactly what every dermatologist or skin care expert has always recommended to me.</li>
            <li>, I have not had a major break out since the first couple weeks of the regimen.</li>
            <li>I have been using Aqua Glycolic for about 2 years now and wanted to try something with a little bit more punch.  </li>
            <li>I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions--positive or otherwise--and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.y sensitive to the sun, so I would suggest you apply sunscreen liberally after washing your face with this product (although you should be using sunscreen every day anyway!!).</li>
            <li>Only take a tiny amount and it foams up when you rub it into your wet hands and goes on so easily and rinses off equally as easily.</li>
            <li>This really is helping to clear my congested skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle to the skin not harsh.</li>
            <li>Does not over dry the skin and leaves it clean.</li>
            <li>leaves skin feeling clean without feeling dry .</li>
            <li>a very helpful product, has cleaned my face completely</li>
            <li>It may be OK to use a few times a week during the night.</li>
            <li>The size of the container is ample, and I use about a quarter&#x27;s worth for my whole face and decolletage, so it will go a long way.</li>
            <li>but after a few days I started to notice that my face was more oily.  </li>
            <li>Normally I would not purchase a product with parabens, let alone use it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s affordable and it doesn&#x27;t irritate (my) normal skin -</li>
            <li>I have normal skin.  </li>
            <li>So I stopped using my normal face wash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for me and totally worth every penny</li>
            <li>but to me that’s a good things because it means there aren’t unnecessary additives.</li>
            <li>and I was still getting new bumps just as fast as old ones went away.</li>
            <li>I exfoliate my skin once or twice a week using loofah gloves to remove any dead skin cells so new more radiant skin can benefit from the lotions I use.</li>
            <li>The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, the other one I use at night.  </li>
            <li>I think your skin becomes a little more sensitive to the sun after using this product</li>
            <li>three of these experiences are new to me.  </li>
            <li>I expect this will be her new go-to source for a foaming face wash.</li>
            <li>but when the bottle was finished I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>and I live in Houston (so humid).</li>
            <li>It is definitely my new nighttime</li>
            <li>It is definitely my new nighttime</li>
            <li>My face was clearing up and nothing new was forming on my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still transferring pump to new bottles.  </li>
            <li>My skin was less shiny and started to clear-up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>have dry skin during the winter and super oily during the summer.</li>
            <li>If you sunburn easily and have sensitive skin, I would caution to gradually introduce the product and test a small area first as briefed in the directions.</li>
            <li>Its so gentle but at the same time it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I might have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only drawback I&#x27;ve experienced is that it&#x27;s slightly drying, but that is to be expected with a cleanser containing acid!  </li>
            <li>I struggle with both sensitive skin and mild acne, so I am always very hesitant to try unfamiliar products that are outside of my regular \\&quot;safety zone\\&quot; skincare routine.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my face with this and looked in the mirror, I looked so different!  </li>
            <li>It works much better than several other cleansers I have</li>
            <li>After trying a number of different over-the-counter face wash products, I  found most all of them to be the same, varying only in the amount of hydration and lotion-like moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other face washes, and this is the only one I want to repurchase.</li>
            <li>normal (no harsh fragrances or ingredients that strip your skin).  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of removing my makeup if I still have any on, except the mascara which usually ends up leaving me looking like I have a couple of black eyes!</li>
            <li>I will say that several other reviews mention giving it a few weeks before making a decision about how it is working, and that turned out to be great advice.  </li>
            <li>it leaves me feeling clean, but not dried out like other face washes can.</li>
            <li>so it can be hard to find a face wash that doesn&#x27;t completely dry my face out, and this one is really good.</li>
            <li>This Alpha face wash has been the only one that has made a significant difference and much faster than the other products to my delight.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve recently weaned my baby and decided to embark on a search for a product to deal with these large pores.  </li>
            <li>The first few days my skin cleared and I was excited to have finally found a product that worked.</li>
            <li>I am a complete devotee of Alpha Hydrox products in general, and the foaming face wash in particular.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised with how well this works for me - I was expecting similar results to other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, but this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>But after that my clear face started to have acne.</li>
            <li>Obagi, Dermalogica, ProActive, Clear Skin..</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It slightly foams and leaves yoru skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It does seem to clear up my skin a bit.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but if you do, you&#x27;ll appreciate this cleanser.</li>
            <li>and it did not irritate my oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wear light makeup to hide my scars but this product leaves my skin oily and makes my makeup messy.</li>
            <li>I also have to wash my face couple of times to completely remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with acne for years and eventually it developed into adult acne that won&#x27;t subside.</li>
            <li>The Alpha Hydrox foaming face wash came just as my old face wash ran out</li>
            <li>I use the complete line of alpha hydrox products.</li>
            <li>Bonus is its gentle enough you can use it to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I am 27 year old normal/oily skin.</li>
            <li>The sun still got to my skin and marked it permanently.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Remember to moisturize after using this because it does strip the skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>use a toner (home made with bottled water and 1tsp of tea tree oil for each 6 oz water) and a natural moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper.</li>
            <li>After making my first-ever trip to the dermatogist in my mid-30&#x27;s and being prescribed a $200 medication, I was on the hunt for a cheaper solution to my adult acne problems.  </li>
            <li>It is the one thing that I have found that helps with adult acne.</li>
            <li>Also use it on my face and it leave my skin feeling baby soft after use.</li>
            <li>This face soap works better than any other face soap I have ever used, I hope they keep it on the market!!!!  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use something else with this your face can get pretty flipping dry.</li>
            <li>, I never thought I would be able to go a half day without being oily, much less a whole day.</li>
            <li>This is intended to be used with their other products so that you do not dry out the skin and keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using this product, my skin has been less dry (still dry, but no more flaking, which is awesome!)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but eradicates the oils (I&#x27;m Spanish w/ super oily skin).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put a whole lot of stock in cleansers being beneficial; they aren&#x27;t on my face long enough to really do anything.</li>
            <li>You are able to use a very small amount so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>Used for a few days and just didnt feel clean using it.</li>
            <li>It retails for $7.49 directly at Neoteric Cosmetics, but if you can, purchase it from Amazon; they have it for slightly cheaper (the price fluctuates, but as of 8/8/14, it&#x27;s only $7.09 with free shipping).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a bit surprised that this product did exactly what i expected.  </li>
            <li>This product is SO gentle, which is exactly what you need if you&#x27;re using the other Alpha Hydrox products (such as their glycolic acid or retinol products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a well priced facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was eager to try this after such high recommendations.</li>
            <li>When used properly together it has amazing results at half the price of other products with these chemicals.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m starting to think my skin is too sensitive and cannot take too much of the same thing?</li>
            <li>When I first used it, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>and right away I noticed my face felt rough and tight and dry  as if  I  had just used a strong  detergent .</li>
            <li>I found the product to be so weak as to not make much difference in how clean and clear my face was after using it.</li>
            <li>It was a little too mild for me.</li>
            <li>The first couple of weeks, I seemed to have more breakouts than before, but after a few weeks of this product doing its job, I have had very few breakouts since.  </li>
            <li>Really does make your skin feel and look younger if you keep using it for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>and I love that it only takes a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive facial skin prone to acne.</li>
            <li>Pretty mild for a face wash, I use it with a few of their other products, in fact Alpha Hydrox is all that I use.</li>
            <li>No other face wash i&#x27;ve used have had results like this and believe me ive tried a ton to try to cure my acne.</li>
            <li>After continued use I saw a major change in the way my skin look.</li>
            <li>MAJOR appeal to this Alpha Hydrox cleanser is how affordable it is.</li>
            <li>I mean, sure, I would prefer to stay away from them if possible, but almost all chemically manufactured beauty products contain parabens, so they&#x27;re not something I can avoid rigidly.</li>
            <li>I mean, sure, I would prefer to stay away from them if possible, but almost all chemically manufactured beauty products contain parabens, so they&#x27;re not something I can avoid rigidly.</li>
            <li>Major rip off.</li>
            <li>For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it makes the face feel really clean and it only takes a little to do the job.</li>
            <li>im using it together with their enhancing lotion and its the only thing that made my skin clear in years.  </li>
            <li>For 6 months I was relieved that I finally found a product that would clear my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old female with combination skin and after a move to a humid climate have been having problems with breaking out.</li>
            <li>I am surprised I am such a fan</li>
            <li>Plus I occationally have eye lid ezcema and this has so far been the only face soap that doesnt cause flare ups!</li>
            <li>skin is combo and as I get older, I&#x27;m getting dry</li>
            <li>It looks and feels more like a thin gel.</li>
            <li>So I did and my skin took about a week or so to calm back down.</li>
            <li>Unlike physical exfoliants--like most scrubs or roughly textured cleansers you may be accustomed to--chemical exfoliants feel like a regular face wash and just slough off the dead skin with the AHA.</li>
            <li>*, but having gone down the list and confirmed that the other ingredients were things</li>
            <li>I try to keep it out of my eyes, but any other cleanser would sting if I got this much on the lashes-</li>
            <li>product works very well with the other Alpha</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to clear up grotesque deep-down problem acne of the kind that bugged me as a teen.</li>
            <li>I really want to try this product however it was sent to me in a paper envelope....not a good idea for shipping a liquid as the entire contents leaked inside :(</li>
            <li>I went back to my old Trader Joe&#x27;s cleanser but will keep this as a back-up and try again later.</li>
            <li>I am African American, 28 years old</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and does not dry out skin.  </li>
            <li>I am weary of using facial cleansers because my skin is very sensitive, but as winter approached I wanted something that would really help slough off dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner.</li>
            <li>i am currently experimenting with other washes, but would certainly purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t know how to until a few minutes ago when I found the right button to click.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin but this cleanser must have something in it that I&#x27;m allergic to because it made me have tiny break-outs all over.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry to normal and I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry or irritated my skin at all.(I have sensitive and oily skin.)</li>
            <li>The nighttime cleanser I was previously using (from Mario Badescu) contains parabens as well, so it really makes no difference to me.</li>

            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t over dry.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin due to my working environment as a chef.</li>
            <li>still get the occasional pimple every month or so, but my skin texture is so much smoother and there are MUCH less blackheads and bumpy</li>
            <li>It cleanses well and thoroughly, but after about a week of usage (washing twice a day (as indicated in directions), I developed dry skin with red rosacea-like patchy bumpy areas on my skin.</li>
            <li>I used to like this cleanser in my early 20s, but I tried using it again recently and it does nothing but irritate and dry my skin.</li>
            <li>It spreads evenly all over your face without having to really \\&quot;work it\\&quot; around - either with a dry face or wet to apply.  </li>
            <li>Now I don’t really care one way or the other as long as my face is cleaned</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to remove her eye make up and does not leave your skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li>Otherthan that haven&#x27;t observed anything good or bad.</li>

            <li> Love this product I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve stopped selling this at most drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, but effective and my skin feels really smooth and great after I use it.</li>
            <li> Many of us women struggle with hormonal acne and our efforts to fight it are most times fruitless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I just had to for this product because I&#x27;m so pleased.  </li>

            <li> and I love that it also can be used to remove eye makeup .</li>
            <li> but our water is softened so anything should work BETTER than advertised.</li>

            <li> I get break out here and there but nothing more than I was breaking out before I was using it.</li>
            <li> finally I found something that works perfect for my skin :)</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles -one for me and one for my best friend , who always has complain about pimples on his back .</li>
            <li> I am crediting this face wash with balancing my skin and making the oil more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I went to dermatologist, I took prescription medicine, but nothing ever worked more than two months.</li>
            <li> but nothing compared to how a use to break out (more than 10 pimples).</li>
            <li> What matters is that I love how it makes my face feels; I&#x27;m hoping it will help keep any blemishes at bay too.</li>

            <li> and it feels smooth!</li>
            <li> My favorite skin cleanser ever.</li>

            <li> and i have gotten so many compliments on the way my skin looks and feel.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Having been using for more years than I can remember.  </li>
            <li> any more so will be ordering online.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed more irritation if anything...</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure...</li>
            <li> and I think I need more exfoliation</li>
            <li> Maybe it would&#x27;ve worked better?</li>
            <li> great price and fast ship.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this is hands-down the best facial cleanser in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> but I am satisfied with this face wash.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner.</li>
            <li> For being 44, my skin has that healthy glow I had at 19 and through my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I have used this product, along with the AH moisturizer and am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still pleased with these products.  </li>
            <li> Love this product .</li>
            <li> &quot; skin considering the a mouth if oil my face produced, on top of the pimples is develop.</li>
            <li> but i more so use it for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> was worried that since is a care product I wouldn&#x27;t be able to return it and that I was stuck with the face wash</li>
            <li> but Thanks to the great customer service of Amazon I was able to get a refund and dispose of the face wash.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it&#x27;s so affordable.</li>
            <li> I have now been using it for more than a year, and my face is the softest and clearest it has been in years.  </li>
            <li> Love it....:-)</li>
            <li> I love this line because of its quality and that it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily sometimes and with this face wash feels clean and visibly clear!!!!I love it!</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance that is pleasant and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Hydroxy\\&quot; line is so cheap that you would almost think this stuff is too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> It has a neutral smell, foams nicely, leaves your skin feeling clean but not taut, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It was a good price, much cheaper than I have been paying for it for years!  </li>
            <li> and I admit the product was good for the first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin perfect, never oily or dry and it clears up skin problems.  </li>
            <li> And that is what is best for my dry</li>
            <li> Foams up nicely and quickly.</li>
            <li> I also love that it has a cap so it can easily be used to travel</li>
            <li> Mild and really nice feel when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good face wash that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and leave them bright red with irritation.  </li>
            <li> Overall good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li> It felt silky smooth in my palm and refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li> But I really think it is doing a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this face wash from Neoteric Cosmetics in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this face wash from Neoteric Cosmetics in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It really gives your face a \\&quot;new finish\\&quot; and feels great!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to find a cleanser and lotion made by Alpha Hydrox on Amazon, so I figured I would try it.</li>
            <li> I have been following this regimen for 2 months and my skin looks and feels wonderful and fresh</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable rubbing roughly over my eyes to remove my eye make-up, which it does wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean well, but needs a bit more rinsing off.  </li>
            <li> Holy Cow, what a great cleanser!</li>
            <li> use these face washes in the shower where I can take my time and easily lather up and rinse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild, and that&#x27;s how I like it.</li>
            <li> very mild around the eyes too.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it--it makes my face feel so *clean</li>
            <li> I just need it to be simple, effective and non-drying and this fits the bill at a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash because it is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> Makes your face very soft and feel extremely clean great face wash</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and effectively removes all make up, including eye make up.</li>
            <li> I have used all the name brands and this one is right up there and really better than many.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alpha Hydrox products since last year and my face is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I finally have a beautiful even skin tone.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was packaged safely for delivery.</li>
            <li> So apparently the problem has mostly been more the fault of the cleansers I&#x27;ve been using rather than just my skin type or the moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried not being effective</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I find it super cheap for six bucks at TJ Max and Marshalls</li>
            <li> , this skin-care routine is cheap.  </li>
            <li> amazing line of products; inexpensive and very efficient.</li>
            <li> silky smooth skin</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very inexpensive, feels nice, smells neutral, and is one of the 3 products I&#x27;ve found that contains alpha hydroxy acid (AHA).  </li>
            <li> Foams up nicely and is gentle considering how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> Overall I have great skin</li>
            <li> It forms a nice lather, cleanses thoroughly and is never irritating.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this face wash.  </li>
            <li> but I always apply a light moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a face wash with great exfoliating properties, look no further.</li>
            <li> and it actually works great.</li>
            <li> I read such great reviews about this product I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable for my combination skin</li>
            <li> This is great, skin actually looks cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be really effective and it works really well..</li>
            <li> Great facial soap for removing makeup</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It used to be available in Walgreens.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on Amazon, it seemed like this product would definitely be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> so I can get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Lovely foaming suds leaves my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> so I most definitely recommend using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> you, this stuff works better than most high end brands.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth and clean after I use this.</li>
            <li> Part of my problem was that my pores seemed to get clogged extremely easily and quickly, leading to acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the foaming face wash and the 10% enhanced cream, and decided that I&#x27;d use my own witch hazel as the toner between (because the toner of this line has witch hazel listed as one of the main ingredients, so I didn&#x27;t bother to spend on it).&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth face wash but nothing special.</li>
            <li> The best part is that a very little goes a long way with this, so it&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li> but I do see a significant difference in the oiliness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a cheaper alternative to Aqua Glycolic and a gentler alternative to glycolic acid peels and so far I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I use it in tandem with the Clarisonic face brush and my face is squeaky clean but not dry.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Its purpose is to clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so clean</li>
            <li> Skin feels so clean after using this foaming wash.</li>
            <li> and this face wash doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily like the peels did and seems to even reduce the amount of oil although it is a bit too early to say this for sure.  </li>
            <li> Saw it on Dr. OZ, he said you had to have an AHA to truly clean your skin where soap will not.  </li>
            <li> After using it my face feels so clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling sift and clean.</li>
            <li> After cleansing face with the AH you can see and feel how clean your pores are without stripping your skin or drying it out.</li>
            <li> but thought I&#x27;d give it a try since there are so many positive reviews on this product and</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this foam wash.</li>
            <li> The price is right too!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing face wash if you have extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle soap based cleansers.</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning my face - especially if I have makeup on - and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> I discovered it after years of trying to find a product that fit both requirements of being economical and efficacious.</li>
            <li> As a part of the daily routine, this is a good option if you have an oily or combination skin type.</li>
            <li> I have an almost full bottle I cant even use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face, fresh, super clean and free of acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for about 6 months and ready to order more.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin super clean, and has reduced my blackspots</li>
            <li> I could get a cleanser that does that in greater quantity and much cheaper at plenty of nearby retail stores.</li>
            <li> and it always leaves it feeling nice and soft and used with the AHA lotion</li>
            <li> Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> No bad smell either.  </li>
            <li> Great mild cleanser when using with other alpha hydrox products.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling and looking fresh and clean every night.</li>
            <li> Without scrubbing, I just lather it on my face and eyes- a quick rinse-</li>
            <li> This face wash is not supposed to have any fragrance, but it did have a mild odor.</li>
            <li> But at the time, I was pregnant</li>
            <li> This product is super mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to finally find this product again.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great results and amazing value - hard to believe but the stuff really works.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with good success for the last year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash is a liquid cleanser from Neoteric Cosmetics, and it is smooth and pearly in texture; it looks and feels exactly like shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is inoffensive, a dime sized dollop is perfect - a bottle will last a long time</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your face like some of them and produces good lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works fast and easy.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and the bottle lasts a good long while.  </li>
            <li> This helps my dry skin because it is gentle and great morning wash.</li>
            <li> That was all I got, a few days LOL.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of turning the skin over, which keeps my face looking fresh, without being harsh and drying.</li>
            <li> can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my skin is more sensitive now than it used to be, either way</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s useful to anyone, here&#x27;s my morning routine:  -Aveeno</li>
            <li> also got her the Alpha face moisturizer which she was not crazy about.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen it my own skin and that of several women who asked me what I was using.  </li>
            <li> I have done all the Proactive, Murad, clearox, nutrogena and so on regimens as directed, and my skin never stayed clear for more than two weeks.</li>
            <li> so this has to be the golden ticket.  </li>
            <li> I was more than eager to try this face wash though, because it, in the vein of neutral cleansers like Cetaphil, was formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling fresh but not &amp;#34;squeeky clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I was told to try fresh lemon juice to (I guess)</li>
            <li> And now it&#x27;s back to the color of the rest of my skin, nice and even.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better than ones that are more expensive.</li>
            <li> Laugh lines around my eyes and lines on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle and has a mild smell.  </li>
            <li> Also reduces appearance of large pores and provides significant improvement on some acne scars.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face and neck clean, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is strong enough to wash off my makeup but not so strong that it irrates me</li>
            <li> That is a good thing because I have used other face washes that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> right after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I think i have found the right wash for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> It just feel like it really works to clean my face without being too aggressive.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, it is gentle on my skin, removes my eye make up without irritation and has a clean smell.</li>
            <li> Very gentile with a naturally clean smell.</li>
            <li> i have combination skin that is very sensitive and scars easily.</li>
            <li> Would have been 5 stars if they just added a little perfume to it :P</li>
            <li> and I was ready to try something new and hopefully more</li>
            <li> personal favorite face wash is by Philosophy - but that&#x27;s a huge bottle and really pricey.</li>
            <li> It even surprisingly, starts to lighten the dark spots under my skin that have been there for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The alpha hydrox products work very well in keeping my skin looking healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> after a couple months of using it my skin(face) just feel more smooth and not blotchy and rough.</li>
            <li> Overall a great cleanser for daily use.</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old and I am very glad I finally found a face wash at a reasonable price that works!!</li>
            <li> Since it’s called “foaming” face wash, I expected it to be more, well, foamy!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> The product is very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I like this face wash very much.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain Beta Hydroxy like the Neutrogena but is very gentle.</li>
            <li> This cleanser gets rid of makeup and is very, very gentle.</li>
            <li> but it DID leave me with clean, soft and refreshed skin which was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> The face wash has a nice foaming action to it and it doesn&#x27;t dry your face which is important.  </li>
            <li> and I knew that pores getting larger with age was genetic for me because I have uncles and aunts with huge craters on their faces!</li>
            <li> For years it&#x27;s been a huge embarrassment since it looked like acne, not to mention, I am naturally a \\&quot;Picker\\</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> did not do much in my opinion!~</li>
            <li> I love this face wash, I have been using it for several years.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly like all the others on the market.</li>
            <li> No weird smells,</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of weeks and it seemed to be working pretty well, but the smell bothered me.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> face always feels refreshed and cleansed after using and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash didn’t exactly meet my expectations as there was no foam</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my pores cleansed more than anything else and no residue is left, even compared to cleansers costing almost $30.  </li>
            <li> It does remove makeup pretty well</li>
            <li> It mostly showed on my forehead where my hair does not cover, on my checks like under where my sunglasses would be and on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I have tried most products under $20 and this is the one that I have continued to use because I actually get results.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with acne for many years and tried everything possible on the market...</li>
            <li> my skin&#x27;s still pretty oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky with face creams and washes</li>
            <li> I have one of the most challenging skin types and this one works pretty ok for me, not best</li>
            <li> regimen and at home facial peels every 2 weeks has made my skin so much better.</li>
            <li> I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different cleansers (at many price points) and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash!</li>
            <li> My skin is usually pretty oily and since using this wash I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement.  </li>
            <li> has been clearing it up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years, as it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and once a week I add baking soda to the mix and get a great facial with it.</li>
            <li> One month later, my skin had more acne, and it is certainly caused by this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash, it cleans thoroughly and leaves my face so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After using this product the makeup glides on easy and the skin is not dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> I use Alpha Hydrox instead to exfoliate (though it is probably gentle enough to use more often)  -Aveeno</li>
            <li> After reading all positive reviews about this cleanser I decided to give a try .</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the Alpha Hydroxy lotion, and I have seen positive results on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The face wash is not only easy to open with a flip top but is extremely gently if you get some in your eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I washed I used way too much and took awhile to wash it all off.  </li>
            <li> As long as the Alpha Hydrox line is available, I will be purchasing from it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products along these lines, I&#x27;m 41 and had minor signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, has no fragrance, won&#x27;t sting your eyes, and leaves your face clean, but soft, not over-stripped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to the more expensive, but much more effective, Jan Marini bioglycolic line</li>
            <li> This initially felt like it was a more thorough deep clean</li>
            <li> I especially like how  it rinses off so easy.</li>
            <li> It closes my large pores and leaves my skin looking clearer.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have large 1 inch x 2 inch spots on my face that are tanner then the rest.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal.</li>
            <li> That means it isn&#x27;t too strong on skin and is gentle enough to be used</li>
            <li> Finally found a face wash that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, still need to add moisturizer after use but Fine with that.  </li>
            <li> I will try again in the future and hope for the best, but for now, I&#x27;m going back to my old face wash and will just pat the shiny areas dry as often as I can think about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using them faithfully for a little over 2 weeks now and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t object to sulfates, but having a highly comedogenic ingredient in a face wash seems pretty counter intuitive to me.</li>
            <li> warning is that AHA is known to make skin very sensitive to the sun, so I would suggest you apply sunscreen liberally after washing your face with this product (although you should be using sunscreen every day anyway!!).</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better than most other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried for my more mature, slightly acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Use of a moisturizer after applying is suggested - the moisturizer seems  better absorbed since uppermost dead cells are removed.  </li>
            <li> Huge difference, actually.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Wife uses and really like this product.</li>
            <li> but glycolic producs didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product falling for the \\&quot;Alpha hydrox\\&quot; name thinking that there is AHA in it for gentle resurfacing.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup with no sting to the eyes and cleans gently and well.</li>
            <li> I used to use a gentle face wash in the morning and a benzoyl peroxide face wash at night to keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> It gently cleanses my face without overdrying my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the report: not too much.</li>
            <li> It really, really works.</li>
            <li> It stops breakouts in their tracks and clears my face up fast.</li>
            <li> it works really well</li>
            <li> The cream worked really well too</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> REALLY well to take off makeup.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;real guts\\&quot; to exfoliate the surface skin cells.      </li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> I noticed there wasn’t much of a scent to it</li>
            <li> But it wasn’t really foamy at up and didn’t even lather up that much.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Not only is it competitively priced with drugstore products, but it&#x27;s very widely available too.</li>
            <li> My face is much smoother and my complexion is brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li> It gently washes my face without over drying and has my acne under control.</li>
            <li> I really like the price</li>
            <li> and I tried the Alpha Hydrox lotion but didn&#x27;t like it as much as the foaming face wash.</li>
            <li> remover\\&quot; because this does it all, yet is gentle and I have no adverse reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my arms smooth, it also cleared my face up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle like it claims and my face always feels refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> really tackles that issue around the mouth, hairline and ears.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This is gentle on my face, yet it cleans it very well.  </li>
            <li> Feels gentle on my skin while fading the scars.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times myself and can say it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite face wash in the whole wide world that I have tried.</li>
            <li> However, it is my favorite facial cleanser by far.  </li>
            <li> my skin is  more on the normal  side and not usually sensitive or reactive .</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than when I get a professional facial.</li>
            <li> Seeing a noticeable difference in skin - product is not to harsh and skin has a nice feel after use.</li>
            <li> My wife felt this product is effective on her dry skin, but my sister was truly amazed with how cleansed she felt after only her first use.  </li>
            <li> That beats Proactive/Neutrogena/Clean&amp;Clear Kits a $20 per month regimen, by far!!!</li>
            <li> I will never waste money on another face washing product or kit again!!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely ever got a pimple after regular use of Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried kits from Proactive, Neutrogena, clean and clear, and a few more.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because of all the amazing reviews, but it really let me down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out more around the time I started using this and while my skin doesn&#x27;t burn from the wash or the lotion, I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty sure this has been causing me to break out unfortunately.</li>
            <li> major thing I noticed was how soft and smooth my skin felt after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Much better than Proactiv or an other acne wash product.  </li>
            <li> Other products at twice the price don&#x27;t do it any better.</li>
            <li> If your skin is NOT sensitive to alpha hydroxy acid, it may be OK to use, but I have decided after using this, that my skin must be sensitive to the ingredients, so I returned</li>
            <li> Gives a terrific clean feeling immediately after rinsing it away.  </li>
            <li> As long as you immediately follow with moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin.  </li>
            <li> But I am thrilled with it so far, and will not be using any other cleansers for my face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely gentle and reminds me of the highly dermatologist recommended Cetaphil formula.</li>
            <li> I have very, very, very oily skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent face wash, left my face squeaky clean without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> high concentration of active ingredients, no fragrance or coloring; i&#x27;m using the entire line-without a doubt beats high end brands like Peter Roth whose products are quite fascinating</li>
            <li> People often comment positively about my skin, and I&#x27;m 70 years old!</li>
            <li> however doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling very clean if I used alone w/o the other Alpha products.</li>
            <li> After using my wife&#x27;s Hydrox cleaner I noticed it left my face feeling clean, free of oil, yet not taught or dry.</li>
            <li> I had pretty clear skin before getting this but after using it my face felt drier than before</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say that this has solve my skin problems, but it does make my skin look radiant and much healthier than it normal is.</li>
            <li> I always try to stay with the low price range items but sometimes they don&#x27;t work as good as more expensive items.</li>
            <li> soap free cleanser,works as described.this is good if you have dry flakey skin.especially in the winter time when it is cold outside and warm inside.</li>
            <li> I notice my skin getting less wrinkly and more toned.</li>
            <li> I then have to rush and put moisturizer on my face as quick as possible to avoid/eliminate the burning.  </li>
            <li> B0009F402K Clarisonic Classic Skin Care System 7 piece]]</li>
            <li> and the price is decent.</li>
            <li> I have found that as I got older, I have had to change my skin regimen.  </li>
            <li> I think washing twice a day or even once a day with this cleanser, may be too much for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It pretty much stayed the same consistency the whole time.</li>
            <li> highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was rated so high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good product, makes my face feel good, not oily or dry, but not sure if it&#x27;s enough for extreme stress.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a \\&quot;bland\\&quot; face wash (meaning it has no active ingredients or medicated treatments), which is exactly what every dermatologist or skin care expert has always recommended to me.</li>
            <li> , I have not had a major break out since the first couple weeks of the regimen.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aqua Glycolic for about 2 years now and wanted to try something with a little bit more punch.  </li>
            <li> I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions--positive or otherwise--and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.y sensitive to the sun, so I would suggest you apply sunscreen liberally after washing your face with this product (although you should be using sunscreen every day anyway!!).</li>
            <li> Only take a tiny amount and it foams up when you rub it into your wet hands and goes on so easily and rinses off equally as easily.</li>
            <li> This really is helping to clear my congested skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle to the skin not harsh.</li>
            <li> Does not over dry the skin and leaves it clean.</li>
            <li> leaves skin feeling clean without feeling dry .</li>
            <li> a very helpful product, has cleaned my face completely</li>
            <li> It may be OK to use a few times a week during the night.</li>
            <li> The size of the container is ample, and I use about a quarter&#x27;s worth for my whole face and decolletage, so it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> but after a few days I started to notice that my face was more oily.  </li>
            <li> Normally I would not purchase a product with parabens, let alone use it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s affordable and it doesn&#x27;t irritate (my) normal skin -</li>
            <li> I have normal skin.  </li>
            <li> So I stopped using my normal face wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for me and totally worth every penny</li>
            <li> but to me that’s a good things because it means there aren’t unnecessary additives.</li>
            <li> and I was still getting new bumps just as fast as old ones went away.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate my skin once or twice a week using loofah gloves to remove any dead skin cells so new more radiant skin can benefit from the lotions I use.</li>
            <li> The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, the other one I use at night.  </li>
            <li> I think your skin becomes a little more sensitive to the sun after using this product</li>
            <li> three of these experiences are new to me.  </li>
            <li> I expect this will be her new go-to source for a foaming face wash.</li>
            <li> but when the bottle was finished I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> and I live in Houston (so humid).</li>
            <li> It is definitely my new nighttime</li>
            <li> It is definitely my new nighttime</li>
            <li> My face was clearing up and nothing new was forming on my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still transferring pump to new bottles.  </li>
            <li> My skin was less shiny and started to clear-up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> have dry skin during the winter and super oily during the summer.</li>
            <li> If you sunburn easily and have sensitive skin, I would caution to gradually introduce the product and test a small area first as briefed in the directions.</li>
            <li> Its so gentle but at the same time it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I might have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback I&#x27;ve experienced is that it&#x27;s slightly drying, but that is to be expected with a cleanser containing acid!  </li>
            <li> I struggle with both sensitive skin and mild acne, so I am always very hesitant to try unfamiliar products that are outside of my regular \\&quot;safety zone\\&quot; skincare routine.</li>
            <li> The first time I washed my face with this and looked in the mirror, I looked so different!  </li>
            <li> It works much better than several other cleansers I have</li>
            <li> After trying a number of different over-the-counter face wash products, I  found most all of them to be the same, varying only in the amount of hydration and lotion-like moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other face washes, and this is the only one I want to repurchase.</li>
            <li> normal (no harsh fragrances or ingredients that strip your skin).  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of removing my makeup if I still have any on, except the mascara which usually ends up leaving me looking like I have a couple of black eyes!</li>
            <li> I will say that several other reviews mention giving it a few weeks before making a decision about how it is working, and that turned out to be great advice.  </li>
            <li> it leaves me feeling clean, but not dried out like other face washes can.</li>
            <li> so it can be hard to find a face wash that doesn&#x27;t completely dry my face out, and this one is really good.</li>
            <li> This Alpha face wash has been the only one that has made a significant difference and much faster than the other products to my delight.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve recently weaned my baby and decided to embark on a search for a product to deal with these large pores.  </li>
            <li> The first few days my skin cleared and I was excited to have finally found a product that worked.</li>
            <li> I am a complete devotee of Alpha Hydrox products in general, and the foaming face wash in particular.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised with how well this works for me - I was expecting similar results to other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, but this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> But after that my clear face started to have acne.</li>
            <li> Obagi, Dermalogica, ProActive, Clear Skin..</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear and no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It slightly foams and leaves yoru skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It does seem to clear up my skin a bit.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but if you do, you&#x27;ll appreciate this cleanser.</li>
            <li> and it did not irritate my oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wear light makeup to hide my scars but this product leaves my skin oily and makes my makeup messy.</li>
            <li> I also have to wash my face couple of times to completely remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for years and eventually it developed into adult acne that won&#x27;t subside.</li>
            <li> The Alpha Hydrox foaming face wash came just as my old face wash ran out</li>
            <li> I use the complete line of alpha hydrox products.</li>
            <li> Bonus is its gentle enough you can use it to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I am 27 year old normal/oily skin.</li>
            <li> The sun still got to my skin and marked it permanently.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Remember to moisturize after using this because it does strip the skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> use a toner (home made with bottled water and 1tsp of tea tree oil for each 6 oz water) and a natural moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper.</li>
            <li> After making my first-ever trip to the dermatogist in my mid-30&#x27;s and being prescribed a $200 medication, I was on the hunt for a cheaper solution to my adult acne problems.  </li>
            <li> It is the one thing that I have found that helps with adult acne.</li>
            <li> Also use it on my face and it leave my skin feeling baby soft after use.</li>
            <li> This face soap works better than any other face soap I have ever used, I hope they keep it on the market!!!!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use something else with this your face can get pretty flipping dry.</li>
            <li> , I never thought I would be able to go a half day without being oily, much less a whole day.</li>
            <li> This is intended to be used with their other products so that you do not dry out the skin and keep it clean.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this product, my skin has been less dry (still dry, but no more flaking, which is awesome!)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but eradicates the oils (I&#x27;m Spanish w/ super oily skin).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put a whole lot of stock in cleansers being beneficial; they aren&#x27;t on my face long enough to really do anything.</li>
            <li> You are able to use a very small amount so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Used for a few days and just didnt feel clean using it.</li>
            <li> It retails for $7.49 directly at Neoteric Cosmetics, but if you can, purchase it from Amazon; they have it for slightly cheaper (the price fluctuates, but as of 8/8/14, it&#x27;s only $7.09 with free shipping).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a bit surprised that this product did exactly what i expected.  </li>
            <li> This product is SO gentle, which is exactly what you need if you&#x27;re using the other Alpha Hydrox products (such as their glycolic acid or retinol products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a well priced facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this after such high recommendations.</li>
            <li> When used properly together it has amazing results at half the price of other products with these chemicals.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m starting to think my skin is too sensitive and cannot take too much of the same thing?</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> and right away I noticed my face felt rough and tight and dry  as if  I  had just used a strong  detergent .</li>
            <li> I found the product to be so weak as to not make much difference in how clean and clear my face was after using it.</li>
            <li> It was a little too mild for me.</li>
            <li> The first couple of weeks, I seemed to have more breakouts than before, but after a few weeks of this product doing its job, I have had very few breakouts since.  </li>
            <li> Really does make your skin feel and look younger if you keep using it for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> and I love that it only takes a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive facial skin prone to acne.</li>
            <li> Pretty mild for a face wash, I use it with a few of their other products, in fact Alpha Hydrox is all that I use.</li>
            <li> No other face wash i&#x27;ve used have had results like this and believe me ive tried a ton to try to cure my acne.</li>
            <li> After continued use I saw a major change in the way my skin look.</li>
            <li> MAJOR appeal to this Alpha Hydrox cleanser is how affordable it is.</li>
            <li> I mean, sure, I would prefer to stay away from them if possible, but almost all chemically manufactured beauty products contain parabens, so they&#x27;re not something I can avoid rigidly.</li>
            <li> I mean, sure, I would prefer to stay away from them if possible, but almost all chemically manufactured beauty products contain parabens, so they&#x27;re not something I can avoid rigidly.</li>
            <li> Major rip off.</li>
            <li> For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it makes the face feel really clean and it only takes a little to do the job.</li>
            <li> im using it together with their enhancing lotion and its the only thing that made my skin clear in years.  </li>
            <li> For 6 months I was relieved that I finally found a product that would clear my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old female with combination skin and after a move to a humid climate have been having problems with breaking out.</li>
            <li> I am surprised I am such a fan</li>
            <li> Plus I occationally have eye lid ezcema and this has so far been the only face soap that doesnt cause flare ups!</li>
            <li> skin is combo and as I get older, I&#x27;m getting dry</li>
            <li> It looks and feels more like a thin gel.</li>
            <li> So I did and my skin took about a week or so to calm back down.</li>
            <li> Unlike physical exfoliants--like most scrubs or roughly textured cleansers you may be accustomed to--chemical exfoliants feel like a regular face wash and just slough off the dead skin with the AHA.</li>
            <li> *, but having gone down the list and confirmed that the other ingredients were things</li>
            <li> I try to keep it out of my eyes, but any other cleanser would sting if I got this much on the lashes-</li>
            <li> product works very well with the other Alpha</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to clear up grotesque deep-down problem acne of the kind that bugged me as a teen.</li>
            <li> I really want to try this product however it was sent to me in a paper envelope....not a good idea for shipping a liquid as the entire contents leaked inside :(</li>
            <li> I went back to my old Trader Joe&#x27;s cleanser but will keep this as a back-up and try again later.</li>
            <li> I am African American, 28 years old</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and does not dry out skin.  </li>
            <li> I am weary of using facial cleansers because my skin is very sensitive, but as winter approached I wanted something that would really help slough off dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner.</li>
            <li> i am currently experimenting with other washes, but would certainly purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t know how to until a few minutes ago when I found the right button to click.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin but this cleanser must have something in it that I&#x27;m allergic to because it made me have tiny break-outs all over.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry to normal and I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry or irritated my skin at all.(I have sensitive and oily skin.)</li>
            <li> The nighttime cleanser I was previously using (from Mario Badescu) contains parabens as well, so it really makes no difference to me.</li>
            <li> The nighttime cleanser I was previously using (from Mario Badescu) contains parabens as well, so it really makes no difference to me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t over dry.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin due to my working environment as a chef.</li>
            <li> still get the occasional pimple every month or so, but my skin texture is so much smoother and there are MUCH less blackheads and bumpy</li>
            <li> It cleanses well and thoroughly, but after about a week of usage (washing twice a day (as indicated in directions), I developed dry skin with red rosacea-like patchy bumpy areas on my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to like this cleanser in my early 20s, but I tried using it again recently and it does nothing but irritate and dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It spreads evenly all over your face without having to really \\&quot;work it\\&quot; around - either with a dry face or wet to apply.  </li>
            <li> Now I don’t really care one way or the other as long as my face is cleaned</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to remove her eye make up and does not leave your skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li> Otherthan that haven&#x27;t observed anything good or bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way past legal drinking age, but I get carded all the time when I use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> get that first dull layer off.</li>
            <li> Not in a bad way--I just mean to say it absorbed all the oiliness, which I love!</li>
            <li> Only draw back is that my skin feels dry after I use it</li>
            <li> As for long term benefits, I couldn&#x27;t say yet as I have only been using it for about a week.  </li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I still get the occasional minor pimple.</li>
            <li> I thought well maybe I just  need to wait a few minutes for my skin to acclimate to the new product</li>
            <li> My skin seems brighter and smoother, and it no longer feels dry and irritated, even as I write this in the middle of December in Ohio.  </li>
            <li> You need less of any cleanser in soft water.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is my eye makeup didn&#x27;t really come off with this</li>
            <li> At first the scent is a little odd, if you&#x27;re used to scented products (it has no added fragrance).</li>
            <li> They had pumps years back for a limited time</li>
            <li> I, sadly, was an other :)</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very dry</li>
            <li> It definitely feels the same if not better then my wife&#x27;s more expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Using this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that facial washes really do not exfoliate your skin..</li>
            <li> I have oily, dry, sensitive and uneven skin texture.  </li>
            <li> As a man who would use this product at some point after shaving I have further concerns as to whether a small razor nick might represent a superhighway for these compounds - compounds that have estrogen-like factors no less.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it might help get rid of the post-acne red marks on my very pale sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, if you have dry skin, you may want to steer clear from this cleanser; if it dried ME out, it would definitely dry you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had to stop using it due to the excess oil on my face; this product is definitely not for my skin type!</li>
            <li> Due to the added sensitivity it causes, I will only be using this cleanser at night.</li>
            <li> Due to the added sensitivity it causes, I will only be using this cleanser at night.</li>
            <li> As you all know, it takes a very long time to find a product that is compatible with one&#x27;s face chemistry,</li>
            <li> I have also noticed some dry patches on my face since beginning to use this.  </li>
            <li> My wife has dry skin and her sister has oily.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have no problems at all with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> My face would be dry for an hour then greasy for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> It does not over dry my skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend for dry skin though because it can leave it drier.</li>
            <li> my blackheads are going away and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all...</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin on my forehead, to the point where it flakes off even if I slather on the moisturizer</li>
            <li> but now it makes my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> since my skin Is so dry</li>
            <li> and I started noticing my face was itching and a small swelling near my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have dry to very dry skin</li>
            <li> After that all hell broke loose.</li>
            <li> My blemishes were calmed down and healing within 48 hours of use last month.</li>
            <li> This is less than a third of the price</li>
            <li> After it I put on the alpha hydroxy lotion and my skin is very soft and the sun spots are slowly fading.  </li>
            <li> (One exception to this: my lips do get very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive to, I had to toss this product due to the SLS.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Dry skin can play host to all kinds of other problems.  </li>
            <li> Stupid, I know, but I kind of wanted to see if it would burn?</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I&#x27;ve experienced horrible breakouts ever since.</li>
            <li> After stopping using it, I continued to have red patches and bumps on my skin which took about a few weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> It did burn but not nearly as much as some others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> but it wasn’t what I expected based on the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> I had a few stubborn whiteheads that simply would not go away no matter what products I used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have moved to a remote area where there are no retailers who carry it.</li>
            <li> Once you massage it onto your wet skin it does lather up and get foamy.</li>
            <li> There are hundreds of products out there that will empty your wallet</li>
            <li> and I have minimal break outs,</li>
            <li> Get rid of all the dead skin cells and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> + I expected a cleanser that had glycolic acid (AHA) in it, not a cleanser that just balances my skin&#x27;s pH level and nothing else.  </li>
            <li> but it left my skin feeling a little tight and dry.</li>
            <li> It is gentle but packs a serious punch!</li>
            <li> skin was so soft and seriously, after one day of use my skin cleared up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit so a bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It foams ever so slightly (just enough to work, not too much to be harsh).</li>
            <li> Skin does not feel tight or dry after washing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight or dry.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off my skin felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Over the last several years I&#x27;ve been getting really bad breakouts on my chin and around my hairline (thanks hormones)...</li>
            <li> Some other reviews stated that this foaming face wash contains AHA.</li>
            <li> Use other products (which will stay on your skin longer) to treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this face wash every morning and sometime again at night if I need to take make-up off before using my other face wash.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena also makes a product that contains alpha hydroxy acids, but it contains other acids as well that don&#x27;t improve perfomance and burn your eyes if any seeps in.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had breakouts into my 50&#x27;s when I decided to try this face wash (along with some of Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s other skin care products).  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t change any other products in my routine</li>
            <li> I use this ever other day in not sure if it makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> your face ready&amp;#34; for other products with alpha hydroxy acid in them.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and have yet to find anything other than bc pills to control my acne.</li>
            <li> probably due to a lot of stress from an upcoming knee surgery).  </li>
            <li> I am done with all other skin care lines but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not abrasive like other washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> And by better, I mean that my face used to be colored red so badly from acne</li>
            <li> (It isn&#x27;t a strong or bad smell- just not \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;.)</li>
            <li> I use it every morning - hte active ingredients are recommended by experts for oily skin problems.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out, it cleans well, but I also use a separate exfoliating scrub to get off any dead skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find products to improve my skin without breaking out like a teenage boy.</li>
            <li> This entire product line works wonders for my skin when it starts to dull.</li>
            <li> My skin still feels very tight and dry</li>
            <li> I had switched to another brand of face wash and my skin broke out badly, so I swear this kept my skin blemish free for years.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and went back to my old face wash, I cleared up, then went back to this and broke out again, except it wasn&#x27;t as bad.  </li>
            <li> It does not sting my eyes and a small amount goes a long way...</li>
            <li> My skin just doesn&#x27;t seem to agree with it and it sucks since I have quite a lot of the soap left.</li>
            <li> The dichotomy for me is that it works really well on the one hand, yet contains questionable ingredients on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until I started seeing dark patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I do not have the money for laser treatments or to spend hundreds on dark skin correctors that make me break out.</li>
            <li> Gentle and hydrating without it being too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching for something I could use on my face to cut down the oil product.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to find a way to cut that down.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut down my oil production at all.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup reallly well and has kept my blemishes down a bit</li>
            <li> I have to say this removes the nasty mess after work while leaving my skin in good condition.</li>
            <li> ive almost given up trying other stuff because its all a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance and soap-free, so it won&#x27;t cause irritation like other harsh face cleansers out there can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I figured I would find the ingredients in this regimen and see if I could find something for less money.  </li>
            <li> And I still have over half the bottle of AHA cleanser</li>
            <li> Just remind yourself that no added scent &#x3D; less to irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> and I have had a lot less breakouts since beginning this regimen.</li>
            <li> I BUY A HALF DOZEN AT A TIME.</li>
            <li> Serious facial cleanser for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> And since, as a previous reviewer wrote, a \\&quot;pea-size\\&quot; dab of the product is all that&#x27;s needed, a bottle of it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I usually read ingredient lists carefully, but I guess the name fulled me</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my face tight.</li>
            <li> Junk...made my skin super dry..even following the instructions on how to apply and then limiting myself to less times than the instructions called for...just hated it and made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> It helped a little with my acne.</li>
            <li> &quot; I pick at every little thing.</li>
            <li> Took a little longer than anticipated, but it&#x27;s peak Holiday time, so I took that into consideration.</li>
            <li> I buy directly from the product website, however, because it is less expensive than Amazon.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to blackheads and small white pimples (not the big, deep, painful ones).  </li>
            <li> I spent about $40, instead of $300!!!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far too expensive.</li>
            <li> deal!&lt;br /&gt;This manufacturer gets a round of applause from me.  </li>
            <li> I use it sometimes a few times a day to take off dirt and grime off my face.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my face without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> almost like it was dried out.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> If you like Aqua Glycolic or just want an everyday glycolic acid product, give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a fan of Freeman&#x27;s Dead Sea mineral mask.</li>
            <li> I found that gycolic acid helps with exfoliating the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> In less than a week of using this foaming cleanser, all of my pimples are gone !  </li>
            <li> They all left residue or over dried my face usually just making things worse.</li>
            <li> but they are usually very expensive but this one is still reasonably priced and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> I was devastated, as I found out that these dark spots are called melasma and are basically permanent unless you want to spend thousands on laser or dark spot corrector treatments.&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research, I found that alpha hydrox makes your skin almost like paper thin.</li>
            <li> and I would get very little acne.</li>
            <li> I ordered this so long ago it&#x27;s difficult to remember all the little details of how I felt about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer a pump, instead (for one-handed use), but I can look past that, because I like this wash so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are not many affective products in my arsenal when my body is the cause.</li>
            <li> I rewashed my face again with my usual cleanser</li>
            <li> -__- guess it didn&#x27;t agree with my skin :/</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any of these things with any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> However, I am going to try something new now because I have been breaking out terribly bad for the past 2 weeks (</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin and was dreading the summer months as I hate looking shiny an hour into the day.  </li>
            <li> I had dark spots and they are slowly clearing up, but the oil production has SIGNIFICANTLY decreased.</li>
            <li> if you skin feels dull use this cleanser and is will be refreshed .</li>
            <li> If I could find any complaint with this product, it would be the smell-</li>
            <li> At 52yrs old people are always trying to guess my age and are shocked when I tell them that I am not 40.</li>
            <li> Had a late in life</li>
            <li> Perhaps they aren&#x27;t doing this intentionally, but it is confusing</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the intent of using it on my upper arms for keratosis pilaris aka chicken skin.</li>
            <li> At least try it, you don&#x27;t have anything to lose.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was waaay too drying (even for my relatively oily skin) and gave me a terrible reaction right away.</li>
            <li> While this wash was unable to help me with my acne issues as it did for some other reviewers, it did do eveything it promised.</li>
            <li> Leaves very little make up residue behind</li>
            <li> I do get about 1 to two pimples (very small)</li>
            <li> Not as I expected mad my face dry.and</li>
            <li> No more scrubbing my poor eyelashes trying to get it all off!  </li>
            <li> Nothing overpowering, but I was looking for something totally odor-free, and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Some have mentioned it was weak.  </li>
            <li> (hopefully it is not too late!).</li>
            <li> I read another reviewers comments that this face wash was non irritating to your eyes &amp; decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Ordered twice seal broken both times.</li>
            <li> I started using this one month ago and have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonder cleanser also the night cream works no more cystic acne and painful needles.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice all the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but the makeup I do wear has sunscreen in it and it can be difficult to wash off.  </li>
            <li> The alpha hydrox line is difficult to find in stores, so I always order my supply online.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything from expensive serums to oxy stuff and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> I had terrible oily skin and cystic acne as a teen.</li>
            <li> , sorry Amazon.</li>
            <li> An I didnt have to go to a expensive department store..</li>
            <li> After a few uses I start to break out terribly.</li>
            <li> They look dirty, like I forgot to wash some spots on face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave it dirty or oily.</li>
            <li> My nose and forehead areas get SO oily that it makes makeup impossible.</li>
            <li> ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IT IN THE DRUG STORES</li>
            <li> I had bad acne from using the pill and was on ProActive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Bad experience for me.</li>
            <li> However it is not that bad of a face wash, it just is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> just a bad day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated.</li>
            <li> It made me break out in painful rash like bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Stupid me, I gave it a chance and continued using it, thinking it might be the weather or something I ate that harmed my face.</li>
            <li> so I hate to be a  \\&quot; Debbie</li>
            <li> but my skin would peel like crazy even after months of using it and the make up looks terrible on skin like that.</li>
            <li> Got a very bad rush from it.</li>
            <li> I have/had really horrible</li>
            <li> I was on accutane also which worked but was horrible side effects.</li>
            <li> The SLS in this product (helps the foaming, acts as a surfactant/cleanser) caused really terrible cystic acne after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> This has cured my embarrassing \\&quot;chicken skin.\\&quot; YAY!!!</li>

            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty mild for a face wash, I use it with a few of their other products, in fact Alpha Hydrox is all that I use. If you don&#x27;t use something else with this your face can get pretty flipping dry.</li>
            <li> I have/had really horrible skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to blackheads and small white pimples (not the big, deep, painful ones).  Part of my problem was that my pores seemed to get clogged extremely easily and quickly, leading to acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Foaming Face Wash about two years ago and have been extremely happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my winning routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AM:  Wash with Foaming Face wash, follow up with Alpha Hydrox Toner, then make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PM:  Wash with Foaming Face wash, follow up with Alpha Hydrox Souffle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get the occasional pimple every month or so, but my skin texture is so much smoother and there are MUCH less blackheads and bumpy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, this skin-care routine is cheap.  That&#x27;s pretty important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but if you do, you&#x27;ll appreciate this cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle, has no fragrance, won&#x27;t sting your eyes, and leaves your face clean, but soft, not over-stripped. I know I can use this around my eyes with no problems.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seem life-changing results, but there definitely is an improvement in the number of skin eruptions, as well as in the tone and surface of my aging skin. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have suspicions that this  may be a counterfeit.  I purchased this because it was rated so high.  After washing and drying my face, my face starts to burn.  I then have to rush and put moisturizer on my face as quick as possible to avoid/eliminate the burning.  I have also noticed some dry patches on my face since beginning to use this.  Finally, my face burns during the day if I happened to sweat outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three of these experiences are new to me.  I have never experienced any of these things with any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Junk...made my skin super dry..even following the instructions on how to apply and then limiting myself to less times than the instructions called for...just hated it and made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> As a man it took me a while to understand the importance of using a face wash that doesnt strip moisture away.  After using my wife&#x27;s Hydrox cleaner I noticed it left my face feeling clean, free of oil, yet not taught or dry. Amazing. So off to Amazon I went and found this wash which seem to be a good price. It definitely feels the same if not better then my wife&#x27;s more expensive stuff. I highly recommend it. Also its alot neater than having a bar of soap floating aroung bathroom sink all the time.</li>
            <li> Drying. I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be a paraben-free product because the ingredients listed on the site does not say paraben. However, the ingredients listed on the box lists both methylparaben and propylparaben. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer skin and leaves it refreshed. Pleasant smell. For different skin types. Perfect you use in the day and high times.    By carissa f.</li>
            <li> Wife uses and really like this product.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. if you skin feels dull use this cleanser and is will be refreshed . get that first dull layer off.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive facial skin prone to acne. I began using this night and day, as directed, for about 1 week. It cleanses well and thoroughly, but after about a week of usage (washing twice a day (as indicated in directions), I developed dry skin with red rosacea-like patchy bumpy areas on my skin. I think washing twice a day or even once a day with this cleanser, may be too much for very sensitive skin. It may be OK to use a few times a week during the night. After stopping using it, I continued to have red patches and bumps on my skin which took about a few weeks to heal. If your skin is NOT sensitive to alpha hydroxy acid, it may be OK to use, but I have decided after using this, that my skin must be sensitive to the ingredients, so I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: you should make sure to wear a good sunscreen since using any products with AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good to even out skin tone. I would use this with the Alpha lotion with good results.</li>
            <li> I do see some smoothness in the skin after a week of use.  Otherthan that haven&#x27;t observed anything good or bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried many soaps in my time to deal with acne and skin issues on my face. They all left residue or over dried my face usually just making things worse. I been using alpha hydroxy for just over a week and have seen great improvement. I have normal to oily skin due to my working environment as a chef. I have to say this removes the nasty mess after work while leaving my skin in good condition. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she shared with her sister.  My wife has dry skin and her sister has oily.  My wife felt this product is effective on her dry skin, but my sister was truly amazed with how cleansed she felt after only her first use.  I expect this will be her new go-to source for a foaming face wash.</li>
            <li> Great face wash, it is very mild and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Using this for a long time.  Just ordered another one.  Does a good job cleaning my face - especially if I have makeup on - and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> I purchase this cleanser over and over. It does a great job of removing all dirt and makeup, even eye makeup. I have dry skin and have no problems at all with this cleanser. I don&#x27;t put a whole lot of stock in cleansers being beneficial; they aren&#x27;t on my face long enough to really do anything. I just need it to be simple, effective and non-drying and this fits the bill at a good price.</li>
            <li> amazing line of products; inexpensive and very efficient. high concentration of active ingredients, no fragrance or coloring; i&#x27;m using the entire line-without a doubt beats high end brands like Peter Roth whose products are quite fascinating but glycolic producs didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.</li>
            <li> GREAT product...silky smooth skin</li>
            <li> I used to like this cleanser in my early 20s, but I tried using it again recently and it does nothing but irritate and dry my skin. After a few uses I start to break out terribly. Perhaps my skin is more sensitive now than it used to be, either way I would not recommend this cleanser as anything more than a brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old and I am very glad I finally found a face wash at a reasonable price that works!!</li>
            <li> This really is helping to clear my congested skin. Glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin but this cleanser must have something in it that I&#x27;m allergic to because it made me have tiny break-outs all over. It is non-drying though. I went back to my old Trader Joe&#x27;s cleanser but will keep this as a back-up and try again later.</li>
            <li> I am 26, female and constantly has problem with acne. I&#x27;ve tried kits from Proactive, Neutrogena, clean and clear, and a few more. None of them worked. My face would be dry for an hour then greasy for the rest of the day.  I saw on oprah, a skin care regimen that cost over $300. A scrub, a cleanser, and a lotion. So I figured I would find the ingredients in this regimen and see if I could find something for less money.  One of the key ingredients in the cleanser and the lotion was AHA. It was easy to find a cleanser and lotion made by Alpha Hydrox on Amazon, so I figured I would try it. I also got a scrub (I like the apricot scrub). I spent about $40, instead of $300!!!  I used the scrub once a week, the AHA cleanser 2 times a day (morning and night), and the AHA lotion just at night. I also got an Olay lotion with spf for the morning and during the day to protect from the sun.  I have been following this regimen for 2 months and my skin looks and feels wonderful and fresh, I have not had a major break out since the first couple weeks of the regimen. And I still have over half the bottle of AHA cleanser left. The lotion I feel will last me almost all year!!! That beats Proactive/Neutrogena/Clean&amp;Clear Kits a $20 per month regimen, by far!!! I think I will call it the Mariah Regimen lol!!!  I will never waste money on another face washing product or kit again!!! I recommend it to any one with or without acne!!!  Hope this helps!!  ~Mariah</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product falling for the \\&quot;Alpha hydrox\\&quot; name thinking that there is AHA in it for gentle resurfacing. And I was dissapointed to see only Citric acid in it out of all array of AHAs. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice all the ingredients listed. Oh well. It&#x27;s a good cleanser, foams up well and takes off all the makeup. I just wish it didn&#x27;t have Parabens and Urea. I am not too fond of those.</li>
            <li> i have combination skin that is very sensitive and scars easily. i also have acne problems. While this wash was unable to help me with my acne issues as it did for some other reviewers, it did do eveything it promised. It is very gentle and effectively removes all make up, including eye make up. i am currently experimenting with other washes, but would certainly purchase this again.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for years but we cant find it locally. This is a good price and it&#x27;s the same product she&#x27;s used to. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great product for oily skin.  I use it every morning - hte active ingredients are recommended by experts for oily skin problems.</li>
            <li> I purchased all 3 products in this line and like this one the best.  It does what it claims to do and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Love this product I love the way it makes my skin feel and I love that it only takes a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Good but not my favorite......Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash - 6 fl oz.......had some hormonal break outs ....did not do much in my opinion!~</li>
            <li> this is the best face wash. ive had acne all my life and i have tried everything and i swear by this product. ive almost given up trying other stuff because its all a waste of money. i was thankful i tried this one and will stick with it. im using it together with their enhancing lotion and its the only thing that made my skin clear in years.  i just hope they wont take it off the market--please.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash, I have been using it for several years.  It leaves your skin perfect, never oily or dry and it clears up skin problems.  This face soap works better than any other face soap I have ever used, I hope they keep it on the market!!!!  I definitely reccomend trying it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash on and off for YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;I just saw this at Ulta for around $6 so I will use this until they stop selling it.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Alpha Hydrox about 8 years ago. I had bad acne from using the pill and was on ProActive.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser worked just as well and it wasn&#x27;t $40!&lt;br /&gt;My skin was so soft and seriously, after one day of use my skin cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found this again. They&#x27;ve stopped selling this at most drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin during the winter and super oily during the summer. This is great cleanser during the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit drying on my skin during the winter so I use Aveda moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw,If you love Aveda cleansing gel, you might like this.</li>
            <li> I am a complete devotee of Alpha Hydrox products in general, and the foaming face wash in particular. It removes makeup with no sting to the eyes and cleans gently and well. I just wish I could still buy it in stores. No one seems to carry it anymore. We must keep them in business! Buy this!!</li>
            <li> I started using this one month ago and have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin.  I initially purchased it because I thought that it included alpha-hydroxy acids (which I do not see in the ingredients list).  Regardless, I immediately noticed an improvement in my skin.  My skin was less shiny and started to clear-up very quickly.  It does not sting my eyes and a small amount goes a long way... I use it twice daily and can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I used to use a gentle face wash in the morning and a benzoyl peroxide face wash at night to keep my acne at bay. Even with moisturizing, this was drying my skin, so I figured it was time to change. Since switching to this three weeks ago, I now only have to wash my face in the morning when I shower. As a college age guy, this is incredibly liberating for me. My skin seems brighter and smoother, and it no longer feels dry and irritated, even as I write this in the middle of December in Ohio.  If it&#x27;s useful to anyone, here&#x27;s my morning routine:  -Aveeno Calming face wash (for most days)  -On Wednesday and Sunday I use Alpha Hydrox instead to exfoliate (though it is probably gentle enough to use more often)  -Aveeno Calming lotion with SPF 15 after shower  EDIT:  I have since switched using only this face wash and the [[ASIN:B000N9IQLS Alpha Hydrox Sheer Silk Moisturizer SPF 15 UVA/UVB Sunscreen &amp; AHA 1 oz.]] in the morning. My skin has never looked or felt better. If this company ever goes out of business, I will be organizing a raid on their storage centers in order to get a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> I got this based on the reviews and I have to say that I will keep using it.  I buy directly from the product website, however, because it is less expensive than Amazon.    I won&#x27;t say it has changed my life or anything.  I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.  But I really think it is doing a good job cleaning. I use it in tandem with the Clarisonic face brush and my face is squeaky clean but not dry.[[ASIN:B0009F402K Clarisonic Classic Skin Care System 7 piece]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of soaps and face washes, and this is the only one that does not break me out. It gently cleanses my face without overdrying my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone, whether or not they have acne problems.</li>
            <li> Some other reviews stated that this foaming face wash contains AHA. It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a \\&quot;bland\\&quot; face wash (meaning it has no active ingredients or medicated treatments), which is exactly what every dermatologist or skin care expert has always recommended to me. Its purpose is to clean. Use other products (which will stay on your skin longer) to treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite face wash. It foams ever so slightly (just enough to work, not too much to be harsh). At first the scent is a little odd, if you&#x27;re used to scented products (it has no added fragrance). Just remind yourself that no added scent &#x3D; less to irritate your skin. This product is SO gentle, which is exactly what you need if you&#x27;re using the other Alpha Hydrox products (such as their glycolic acid or retinol products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d prefer a pump, instead (for one-handed use), but I can look past that, because I like this wash so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain parabens and SLS, for people trying to avoid those things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching for something I could use on my face to cut down the oil product. My nose and forehead areas get SO oily that it makes makeup impossible. I shine so brightly with or without makeup that it got to be a problem and I wanted to find a way to cut that down. I saw all the great reviews that were posted on amazon and I actually found it at my local drug store on sale. Score one for me!  Yes, it cleans very well. It also makes my skin so smooth. I love the feeling after I&#x27;ve washed my face. The problem? Didn&#x27;t cut down my oil production at all. I&#x27;m still just as shiny as I&#x27;ve ever been so this didn&#x27;t help me one bit. I also noticed that when I began using it, I broke out. I guess my skin needed to get used to it so I continued for about 2 weeks and I was still getting new bumps just as fast as old ones went away. I stopped using it and went back to my old face wash, I cleared up, then went back to this and broke out again, except it wasn&#x27;t as bad.  I will try again in the future and hope for the best, but for now, I&#x27;m going back to my old face wash and will just pat the shiny areas dry as often as I can think about it.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth and clean after I use this. Top it off with the lotion and you&#x27;ll have great feeling skin.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin well. There&#x27;s never any make-up residue. Plus, it&#x27;s so gentle it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but the makeup I do wear has sunscreen in it and it can be difficult to wash off.  Also my eye makeup is always a chore to remove, especially the mascara.  I had read a review on this and decided to give it a try- it is really amazing!  Without scrubbing, I just lather it on my face and eyes- a quick rinse- and every trace of makeup is gone.  No more scrubbing my poor eyelashes trying to get it all off!  It just vanishes like magic.  I try to keep it out of my eyes, but any other cleanser would sting if I got this much on the lashes- this has caused no stinging or discomfort at all.  If I could find any complaint with this product, it would be the smell- but I can&#x27;t fault them for that, as it only smells because it has no added perfumes. (It isn&#x27;t a strong or bad smell- just not \\&quot;pretty\\&quot;.) And that is what is best for my dry, rosacea sprinkled complexion.  As for long term benefits, I couldn&#x27;t say yet as I have only been using it for about a week.  But I am thrilled with it so far, and will not be using any other cleansers for my face!</li>
            <li> I feel that this cleanser is on a par with the Neutrogena stuff I used to buy. It cleanses, but it also strips my skin of moisture, and the accompanying lotion and cream are not moisturizing enough to restore the balance. I&#x27;ll be going back to the more expensive, but much more effective, Jan Marini bioglycolic line once I&#x27;m out of this stuff, maybe before then!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife, and she really loved it.  I have used it a few times myself and can say it is a nice product.  It spreads evenly all over your face without having to really \\&quot;work it\\&quot; around - either with a dry face or wet to apply.  Gives a terrific clean feeling immediately after rinsing it away.  At the price of $6-9 (depending on shipping) for 6 fl oz it is a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got her the Alpha face moisturizer which she was not crazy about.</li>
            <li> Makes your face very soft and feel extremely clean great face wash</li>
            <li> I wanted a good face wash that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and leave them bright red with irritation.  I read another reviewers comments that this face wash was non irritating to your eyes &amp; decided to give it a try. It does the job and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes unless I intentionally open them while I&#x27;m washing my face. Stupid, I know, but I kind of wanted to see if it would burn? So here&#x27;s the report: not too much. It did burn but not nearly as much as some others I&#x27;ve tried AND it washed out instantly &amp; didn&#x27;t leave my eyes scarlet with irritation.&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite face wash is by Philosophy - but that&#x27;s a huge bottle and really pricey. This is a great size, doesn&#x27;t take up too much real estate on my bathroom counter &amp; does the job.  I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid is where it&#x27;s at if you have problem skin.  And what better way to start treating your problem skin than with this face wash.      I have oily, dry, sensitive and uneven skin texture.  These products do work!  I have been using them faithfully for a little over 2 weeks now and the difference is amazing.  The face wash has a nice foaming action to it and it doesn&#x27;t dry your face which is important.  Dry skin can play host to all kinds of other problems.  Hydrating your skin makes it look amazing.    The price of the \\&quot;Alpha Hydroxy\\&quot; line is so cheap that you would almost think this stuff is too good to be true.  But it isn&#x27;t.  You won&#x27;t find a better deal on products with the glycolic acid in them that work....trust me I have tried.    One thing you have to understand about these products is that you have to be consistant in using them.  Wash once in the morning and once in the evening and try out their lotions and souffles too.  You have got to use them for them to work.    Taking care of your skin is one of the best gifts you can give yourself.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products, professional, cheap, expensive and this stuff does the trick. Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li> I think this works wonders. It&#x27;s the only face wash I feel comfortable rubbing roughly over my eyes to remove my eye make-up, which it does wonderfully. It&#x27;s extremely gentle and reminds me of the highly dermatologist recommended Cetaphil formula. It&#x27;s a one-stop shop for cleaning my skin and make-up off at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for cleaning oily skin and preventing.  Also reduces appearance of large pores and provides significant improvement on some acne scars.  They&#x27;ve never made the claim about the acne scars but I&#x27;ve seen it my own skin and that of several women who asked me what I was using.  I didn&#x27;t realize how big a difference it made on me until I saw their results.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 20 years.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a lot of foam, after washing the face becomes slippery.</li>
            <li> I have used this product along with the night replenishing cream and enhanced cream for 6 wks now- I can definately see the difference in my skin. My skin appears firmer, pores smaller and I have had a lot less breakouts since beginning this regimen. I would definately recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this face wash every morning and sometime again at night if I need to take make-up off before using my other face wash. I have moderate acne but it&#x27;s been under control since I started using this along with panoxyl 4% creamy wash. This helps my dry skin because it is gentle and great morning wash. I would recommend this to all skin types!</li>
            <li> Love this wash. It makes my face feel so clean and it removes the makeup well. Would recommend. Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this foam wash. It is exactly like all the others on the market. Too over-rated. Save your money</li>
            <li> This does not contain any glycolic acid like I thought. It&#x27;s a smooth face wash but nothing special. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 20 YEARS...EVER SINCE IT WAS FAVORABLY COMPARED TO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES.  ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IT IN THE DRUG STORES NOW SO THANK HEAVEN FOR AMAZON.  I BUY A HALF DOZEN AT A TIME.</li>
            <li> I like the face wash. It feels good on my face and when I finish my face is very smooth</li>
            <li> Skin feels so clean after using this foaming wash. Skin does not feel tight or dry after washing.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I ordered this so long ago it&#x27;s difficult to remember all the little details of how I felt about it [I keep getting prompted to review this so I figure I finally will]. I liked this product a lot but when the bottle was finished I decided to try something new. No weird smells, nothing funky and it did not irritate my oily, sensitive skin. Just remember that not every product will work for every person.</li>
            <li> I like how this is working on my skin. Gentle to the skin not harsh.</li>
            <li> does not foam, like I thought it would</li>
            <li> This was the one product that helped me elimate my acne after suffering with it almost 20 years.  It&#x27;s also very inexpensive, feels nice, smells neutral, and is one of the 3 products I&#x27;ve found that contains alpha hydroxy acid (AHA).  The nearest thing I&#x27;ve found to it was a dermatologist-supplied product that costs $29.95 for 8 fl oz.  This is less than a third of the price and I like it better!  Neutrogena also makes a product that contains alpha hydroxy acids, but it contains other acids as well that don&#x27;t improve perfomance and burn your eyes if any seeps in.  The alpha hydrox product does not sting your eyes.  The alpha hydrox line is difficult to find in stores, so I always order my supply online.  If the company ever went out of business I&#x27;d have to attempt to buy a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> Ordered twice seal broken both times.</li>
            <li> Amazing results using this product. It really, really works. I have recommended it to many friends and they all agree. It is also not overpriced like so many cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face wash i&#x27;ve ever used. It stops breakouts in their tracks and clears my face up fast. No other face wash i&#x27;ve used have had results like this and believe me ive tried a ton to try to cure my acne. Will continue to use this from now on.</li>
            <li> Good product at a very good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with good success for the last year.  I decided to try Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash based on good reviews (see beautypedia dot com) and a sale price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I washed I used way too much and took awhile to wash it all off.  After that I switched to pea-sized squirts and it foams up and cleans great.  My skin is dry to normal and I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to alternate the three products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and like the fact that it remains the same&lt;br /&gt;so many products do not&lt;br /&gt;the price is fair</li>
            <li> This face wash is not supposed to have any fragrance, but it did have a mild odor. Nothing overpowering, but I was looking for something totally odor-free, and I was disappointed. I used it for a couple of weeks and it seemed to be working pretty well, but the smell bothered me.</li>
            <li> After reading wonderful reviews, I bought this product right away. I have been using this product for two weeks now and I am getting acne all around my skin. I wear light makeup to hide my scars but this product leaves my skin oily and makes my makeup messy. I also have to wash my face couple of times to completely remove my makeup. I used to love dove face cleanser but it has been discontinued but dove soap helped a lot too and I would get very little acne. Proactive helped too but it&#x27;s far too expensive.</li>
            <li> Foams up nicely and is gentle considering how well it cleans. I use this before a salicylic acid toner, then their 5% glycolic acid cream. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out, it cleans well, but I also use a separate exfoliating scrub to get off any dead skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you!! A+A+A+A+A+</li>
            <li> For what it does, this is a good value.  It seems to clean well, but needs a bit more rinsing off.  Overall a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The face wash is not only easy to open with a flip top but is extremely gently if you get some in your eyes. A little bit goes a long way! Foams up nicely and quickly. This product does a fantastic job of cleansing and my skin feels great! You bet I will order Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash again! .</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the moisturizer by mistake, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better than most other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried for my more mature, slightly acne prone, sensitive skin. It&#x27;s gentle, but effective and my skin feels really smooth and great after I use it. I&#x27;ve noticed that it seems to make the Alpha Hydrox Moisturizer more effective. Definitely a plus. The size of the container is ample, and I use about a quarter&#x27;s worth for my whole face and decolletage, so it will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Overall I have great skin but I have some pih spots that I am trying to get rid of. This cleanser works smashingly well when used in conjunction with a glycolic face cream. I use both daily and have had no irritation or adverse effects whatsoever. Try it- it works really well and the price is decent. With daily use, the bottle lasts about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for years and eventually it developed into adult acne that won&#x27;t subside. I have done all the Proactive, Murad, clearox, nutrogena and so on regimens as directed, and my skin never stayed clear for more than two weeks. This is after the 4 weeks these products took to start working. This Alpha face wash has been the only one that has made a significant difference and much faster than the other products to my delight. I have moderate acne caused by hormones. There are not many affective products in my arsenal when my body is the cause. Many of us women struggle with hormonal acne and our efforts to fight it are most times fruitless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a difference in the texture of my skin immediately after using this. Washing the night before and waking up to a clearer face is wonderful. It even surprisingly, starts to lighten the dark spots under my skin that have been there for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I do not claim that this is the cure for anyone&#x27;s acne. I review my wonderful experience with this face wash and intend to use the rest of the Alpha products that are offered.</li>
            <li> I have never left a review.  I actually didn&#x27;t know how to until a few minutes ago when I found the right button to click.  But I just had to for this product because I&#x27;m so pleased.  About two years I started noticing my pores were bigger than before and I knew that pores getting larger with age was genetic for me because I have uncles and aunts with huge craters on their faces! But at the time, I was pregnant and so I had to pause use of beauty products.  Well, I&#x27;ve recently weaned my baby and decided to embark on a search for a product to deal with these large pores.  I learned that glycolic acid is what would help and then found this product line here on amazon.  I purchased it based on the great reviews and reasonable price.  I got the foaming face wash and the 10% enhanced cream, and decided that I&#x27;d use my own witch hazel as the toner between (because the toner of this line has witch hazel listed as one of the main ingredients, so I didn&#x27;t bother to spend on it).&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am so pleased!  The first time I washed my face with this and looked in the mirror, I looked so different!  My skin was brighter and glowed and it looked like I&#x27;d washed two or three years off of it!  The cream worked really well too but I&#x27;ll put the details of that in the review that I&#x27;m going to leave for that.  The best part is that a very little goes a long way with this, so it&#x27;s a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;This manufacturer gets a round of applause from me.  I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It forms a nice lather, cleanses thoroughly and is never irritating. It is perfect for all skin types and I have very sensitive skin. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> there are many non-soap wash products out there but they are usually very expensive but this one is still reasonably priced and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> used this years ago and my acne prone skin never looked better.  Found it again and love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  For me it works better than the retinol my doctor prescribed.  Thrilled to be using it  again.</li>
            <li> I used it years ago so was thrilled to see it on Amazon. It works much better than several other cleansers I have and I love that it also can be used to remove eye makeup . It closes my large pores and leaves my skin looking clearer.</li>
            <li> Used for a few days and just didnt feel clean using it. I have combo skin but our water is softened so anything should work BETTER than advertised. You need less of any cleanser in soft water. I will give to my Mom...she uses their lotions/creams.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this face wash.  It foams nicely and cleans well with the added benefit of Alpha Hydrox.  You are able to use a very small amount so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> A very nice cleansing wash.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out more around the time I started using this and while my skin doesn&#x27;t burn from the wash or the lotion, I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty sure this has been causing me to break out unfortunately. My skin just doesn&#x27;t seem to agree with it and it sucks since I have quite a lot of the soap left.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a bit surprised that this product did exactly what i expected.  Perfect cleansing, gentle to my skin, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I have found that as I got older, I have had to change my skin regimen.  The alpha hydrox products work very well in keeping my skin looking healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite face wash in the whole wide world that I have tried. It has a light fragrance that is pleasant and fades quickly. It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. It does not over dry my skin but I always apply a light moisturizer after. It seems to last a long time. You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Over the last several years I&#x27;ve been getting really bad breakouts on my chin and around my hairline (thanks hormones)... I tried everything from expensive serums to oxy stuff and nothing has worked. Nothing... Then I read somewhere that AHA works for these kinds of \\&quot;adult\\&quot; breakouts and have been using this wash plus the lotion - I cannot believe how well my skin has cleared up and stabilized. Great results and amazing value - hard to believe but the stuff really works. Glad I took the chance on it.</li>
            <li> Great Alpha Hydroxy face wash, I use it in the morning and at night, even keep a bottle in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely a good product, worth to give it a shot. I have oil combination skin so this product works good for me well!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash because it is gentle and effective.  It works REALLY well to take off makeup.  I use it sometimes a few times a day to take off dirt and grime off my face.  It just feel like it really works to clean my face without being too aggressive.  Works well with the enhanced lotion.</li>
            <li> Cleans face will with out residue.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best face wash I have ever used.  I had breakouts into my 50&#x27;s when I decided to try this face wash (along with some of Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s other skin care products).  I very rarely ever got a pimple after regular use of Alpha Hydrox products.  I had tried lots of different products, but none worked.  As long as the Alpha Hydrox line is available, I will be purchasing from it!</li>
            <li> After trying a number of different over-the-counter face wash products, I  found most all of them to be the same, varying only in the amount of hydration and lotion-like moisturizing. Because I have thicker, problem prone skin I needed something with \\&quot;real guts\\&quot; to exfoliate the surface skin cells.      This product, along with use of the 12% AHA souffle two or three times/week is what I have been looking for.  My skin feels smoother without feeling dry. Use of a moisturizer after applying is suggested - the moisturizer seems  better absorbed since uppermost dead cells are removed.  If you sunburn easily and have sensitive skin, I would caution to gradually introduce the product and test a small area first as briefed in the directions. Even with my thicker skin I initially experienced some tingling and reddness,which goes away with repeated use.</li>
            <li> This product is super mild. It was a little too mild for me.</li>
            <li> Holy Cow, what a great cleanser! This is one of the best best cleansers I have come across. Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you, this stuff works better than most high end brands. It is gentle but packs a serious punch! This stuff cleans your skin so well and will not break you out. It also has a great smell too!</li>
            <li> I really want to try this product however it was sent to me in a paper envelope....not a good idea for shipping a liquid as the entire contents leaked inside :(</li>
            <li> Pretty good face wash! I have dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight or dry. My only complaint is my eye makeup didn&#x27;t really come off with this but if I use a makeup remover first, its great!</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old female with combination skin and after a move to a humid climate have been having problems with breaking out. I have been using Aqua Glycolic for about 2 years now and wanted to try something with a little bit more punch.  This initially felt like it was a more thorough deep clean but after a few days I started to notice that my face was more oily.  I lasted about 2.5 to 3 weeks using this product and I had to stop using it due to the excess oil on my face; this product is definitely not for my skin type!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face wash I have ever found.  Cleans well and does not dry out skin.  I think your skin becomes a little more sensitive to the sun after using this product but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I&#x27;ve found it works best when you use your hands to rinse it off well.  Does not irritate skin and seems to aid with occasional acne.  Great for combination skin also.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other face washes, and this is the only one I want to repurchase. It gets all my makeup off without drying the heck out of my face. Its so gentle but at the same time it cleans very well. I suffer from occasional acne, and this is the only cleaner that I feel like is helping diminish my acne. I also love that it has a cap so it can easily be used to travel and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it spilling. The price is right too! Great face wash for every skin issues!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for the last 10 years and I always get compliments on my skin. This product is one that if they ever stopped making it, I would try and buy a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> The best product or your money, glowing fresh skin! Give it a try so worth it, trust me;) I have been using for months great results!</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> Great for taking makeup off, follow through with a more aggressive acne cleanser after.</li>
            <li> deep cleans and takes off all your makeup even waterproof makeup. I wouldnt recommend for dry skin though because it can leave it drier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and would not be without it.  It was a good price, much cheaper than I have been paying for it for years!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products. My skin looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> I even use Alpha Hydros Foaming Face Wash  to remove my mascara at night.  It cleans my face without being harsh.</li>
            <li> This product was just what needed. After continued use I saw a major change in the way my skin look. It didn&#x27;t leave my face tight. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> At my age taking good care of my skin is one of the most important things I can do for myself. The Alpha Hydrox foaming face wash came just as my old face wash ran out and I was ready to try something new and hopefully more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these face washes in the shower where I can take my time and easily lather up and rinse. I noticed there wasn’t much of a scent to it but to me that’s a good things because it means there aren’t unnecessary additives. It felt silky smooth in my palm and refreshing on my face. Since it’s called “foaming” face wash, I expected it to be more, well, foamy! But it wasn’t really foamy at up and didn’t even lather up that much. It pretty much stayed the same consistency the whole time. Now I don’t really care one way or the other as long as my face is cleaned but it wasn’t what I expected based on the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face always feels refreshed and cleansed after using and feels soft and smooth. It does a pretty good job of removing my makeup if I still have any on, except the mascara which usually ends up leaving me looking like I have a couple of black eyes! But it doesn’t claim to be a makeup remover so I didn’t expect it to do two jobs in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash didn’t exactly meet my expectations as there was no foam but it DID leave me with clean, soft and refreshed skin which was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for about 2 months. The first week I was impressed by how my face was smooth and cleaned. It didn&#x27;t dry or irritated my skin at all.(I have sensitive and oily skin.) But after that my clear face started to have acne. Stupid me, I gave it a chance and continued using it, thinking it might be the weather or something I ate that harmed my face. One month later, my skin had more acne, and it is certainly caused by this product. Now I have to find a treatment for my acned face! Bad experience for me. So not recommend this!</li>
            <li> I am weary of using facial cleansers because my skin is very sensitive, but as winter approached I wanted something that would really help slough off dead skin cells.  This cleanser is very gentle and has a mild smell.  It really gives your face a \\&quot;new finish\\&quot; and feels great!  The only drawback I&#x27;ve experienced is that it&#x27;s slightly drying, but that is to be expected with a cleanser containing acid!  As long as you immediately follow with moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I get break out here and there but nothing more than I was breaking out before I was using it. My face probably getting used to it since  i&#x27;ve been using it only for almost 3 weeks.  Good price, easy to use, and cleanse dirt and excess oil.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> ... but thought I&#x27;d give it a try since there are so many positive reviews on this product and... YES, this is an awesome product!! I have severe acne and oily skin and I can&#x27;t say that this has solve my skin problems, but it does make my skin look radiant and much healthier than it normal is. You also can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon- love it and will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very dry I did not like that part of it at all and I would not buy anymore at all.  It might work for others, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Breaks my face out. No thanks.</li>
            <li> my blackheads are going away and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all...finally I found something that works perfect for my skin :)</li>
            <li> This product does not contain glycolic acid as some reviewers claim. However, it is my favorite facial cleanser by far.  I discovered it after years of trying to find a product that fit both requirements of being economical and efficacious. It leaves my skin feeling and looking fresh and clean every night.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I use. I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised with how well this works for me - I was expecting similar results to other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, but this is my new favorite. I have extremely dry skin on my forehead, to the point where it flakes off even if I slather on the moisturizer right after I wash my face. Since I started using this product, my skin has been less dry (still dry, but no more flaking, which is awesome!) So apparently the problem has mostly been more the fault of the cleansers I&#x27;ve been using rather than just my skin type or the moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried not being effective enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for review purposes; all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser.  Even gets makeup off.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but eradicates the oils (I&#x27;m Spanish w/ super oily skin).</li>
            <li> After reading all positive reviews about this cleanser I decided to give a try . I have a pretty good skin without any problems and I have to assume that this facewash leaving my skin clean from make-up , great exfoliates and do not overdry it . I bought 2 bottles -one for me and one for my best friend , who always has complain about pimples on his back . After 1 week using it like body wash the pimples gone !  I&#x27;m happy I found my product and very happy for my friend !</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin and was dreading the summer months as I hate looking shiny an hour into the day.  I am crediting this face wash with balancing my skin and making the oil more manageable.  I haven&#x27;t change any other products in my routine so this has to be the golden ticket.  I am not saying that everything is perfect but I do see a significant difference in the oiliness of my skin.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000052YM4 Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash - 6 fl oz]]    I have been looking for this product on the shelves for years and finally decided to go online. Not only did I find a great price, but I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! It came quickly and was packaged safely for delivery. (no spills)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything...Obagi, Dermalogica, ProActive, Clear Skin..etc. Finally I found Alpha Hydrox. I am African American, 28 years old and I live in Houston (so humid). I have very, very, very oily skin and adult acne. My face was gorgeous in highschool, but as soon as I went to college disaster struck. I went to dermatologist, I took prescription medicine, but nothing ever worked more than two months. I have been using Alpha Hydrox products since last year and my face is beautiful. I had dark spots and they are slowly clearing up, but the oil production has SIGNIFICANTLY decreased. Im so suprised I must admit, I never thought I would be able to go a half day without being oily, much less a whole day. I do get about 1 to two pimples (very small) every now and then, but nothing compared to how a use to break out (more than 10 pimples). I use the complete line of alpha hydrox products. I will never use anything else. Thank you so much I feel like I have my life back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated. Normally I would not purchase a product with parabens, let alone use it. In my case I began using it and didn&#x27;t notice until some weeks after the fact that it contained parabens. The dichotomy for me is that it works really well on the one hand, yet contains questionable ingredients on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is inoffensive, a dime sized dollop is perfect - a bottle will last a long time, it&#x27;s affordable and it doesn&#x27;t irritate (my) normal skin - in fact, it improves it noticeably. As you all know, it takes a very long time to find a product that is compatible with one&#x27;s face chemistry, &lt;sigh&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m compelled, though, to toss it. As a man who would use this product at some point after shaving I have further concerns as to whether a small razor nick might represent a superhighway for these compounds - compounds that have estrogen-like factors no less.</li>
            <li> This is one of the two face washes I can use and don&#x27;t break out and the only face wash I can use during pregnancy. My favorite face wash for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent face wash, left my face squeaky clean without drying my skin out. It helped a little with my acne.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite facial cleanser.  It leaves my pores cleansed more than anything else and no residue is left, even compared to cleansers costing almost $30.  I just wish Walmart or Target would carry it</li>
            <li> I struggle with both sensitive skin and mild acne, so I am always very hesitant to try unfamiliar products that are outside of my regular \\&quot;safety zone\\&quot; skincare routine. I was more than eager to try this face wash though, because it, in the vein of neutral cleansers like Cetaphil, was formulated for sensitive skin. It is fragrance and soap-free, so it won&#x27;t cause irritation like other harsh face cleansers out there can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash is a liquid cleanser from Neoteric Cosmetics, and it is smooth and pearly in texture; it looks and feels exactly like shampoo. It lathers up really nicely and feels very nice and smooth when I rub it onto my face. I have oily skin, and immediately after washing my face, I could feel it felt tighter and almost like it was dried out. Not in a bad way--I just mean to say it absorbed all the oiliness, which I love! However, if you have dry skin, you may want to steer clear from this cleanser; if it dried ME out, it would definitely dry you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major thing I noticed was how soft and smooth my skin felt after using this cleanser. The AHA extracts are acne fighting and have chemically exfoliating properties, which makes skin baby-soft. Unlike physical exfoliants--like most scrubs or roughly textured cleansers you may be accustomed to--chemical exfoliants feel like a regular face wash and just slough off the dead skin with the AHA. That means it isn&#x27;t too strong on skin and is gentle enough to be used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MAJOR appeal to this Alpha Hydrox cleanser is how affordable it is. It retails for $7.49 directly at Neoteric Cosmetics, but if you can, purchase it from Amazon; they have it for slightly cheaper (the price fluctuates, but as of 8/8/14, it&#x27;s only $7.09 with free shipping). Not only is it competitively priced with drugstore products, but it&#x27;s very widely available too. You can find it anywhere online and at Ulta, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning is that AHA is known to make skin very sensitive to the sun, so I would suggest you apply sunscreen liberally after washing your face with this product (although you should be using sunscreen every day anyway!!). Due to the added sensitivity it causes, I will only be using this cleanser at night. Another FYI is that this product contains parabens, which may be a turn-off to some people, but it doesn&#x27;t affect me. I mean, sure, I would prefer to stay away from them if possible, but almost all chemically manufactured beauty products contain parabens, so they&#x27;re not something I can avoid rigidly. The nighttime cleanser I was previously using (from Mario Badescu) contains parabens as well, so it really makes no difference to me. What matters is that I love how it makes my face feels; I&#x27;m hoping it will help keep any blemishes at bay too. It is definitely my new nighttime cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this face wash from Neoteric Cosmetics in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

            <li> I have reordered this product many times.  It deep cleans without over drying my skin. No bad smell either.  I use it with my Clarisonic most days and my skin feels great afterwards.  The price is right, and the bottle lasts a good long while.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a well priced facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> This face wash is an excellent addition to my antiaging  skincare routine. I tried it and i am pleased with the results. I think i have found the right wash for my type of skin. If you are looking for a face wash with great exfoliating properties, look no further.</li>
            <li> Great for clearing pores from acne breakouts and removing oil from sling to a balance PH ( meaning see clearer skin!) I love it! I buy 3-4 bottles to last me 6months as I use it for my daily body and face wash.</li>
            <li> Great mild cleanser when using with other alpha hydrox products.  Some have mentioned it was weak.  The description does not say it has alpha hydroxy.  Alpha hydrox is a brand.  This is intended to be used with their other products so that you do not dry out the skin and keep it clean.  I use the wash, toner (alcohol but also witch hazel), 14% serum, &amp;amp; 10% lotion.  When used properly together it has amazing results at half the price of other products with these chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing face wash if you have extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle soap based cleansers. It leaves your face feeling fresh but not &amp;#34;squeeky clean&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s very mild, and that&#x27;s how I like it.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Seems ok. I use this ever other day in not sure if it makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product only for a week and I see results already.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day.  I have normal skin.  This works great.  Fades my freckles.  Better than expensive products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to finally find this product again. Seems to have disappeared from store shelves. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks. Pores are getting smaller, skin brighter, it&#x27;s an all around wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service was great.&lt;br /&gt;This product works very well with the other Alpha products.&lt;br /&gt;It however doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling very clean if I used alone w/o the other Alpha products.</li>
            <li> This face wash does not contain alpha hydroxy acids as it&#x27;s brand may present that it may have. However it is not that bad of a face wash, it just is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I have my masters in Cosmetics and Fragrance Marketing and I work in the beauty industry.  This is the best face wash that keeps your pH normal (no harsh fragrances or ingredients that strip your skin).  I would suggest you use a makeup remover for the eye makeup but this does a great job for cleansing your face.  Also the AHA face peel is amazing too.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser . I had a few stubborn whiteheads that simply would not go away no matter what products I used. In less than a week of using this foaming cleanser, all of my pimples are gone !  My face is much smoother and my complexion is brighter and clearer. I&#x27;ve now been using the product for almost two weeks.I especially like how  it rinses off so easy. Leaving skin feeling toned and refreshed. Goodbye shiny face !</li>
            <li> Finally found a face wash that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, still need to add moisturizer after use but Fine with that.  Bonus is its gentle enough you can use it to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Great face wash - I currently use this with the alpha hydroxy moisturizer as well. Been pimple free ever since I started using them! If I stop for a week or so, I start to break out again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of things at the dermatologists. I was on accutane also which worked but was horrible side effects. This is a wonder cleanser also the night cream works no more cystic acne and painful needles.</li>
            <li> Really does make your skin feel and look younger if you keep using it for several weeks.  We use it with the moisturizer, and we&#x27;re pleased!</li>
            <li> Every time I use this face wash I get carded. I&#x27;m way past legal drinking age, but I get carded all the time when I use this product regularly. I like that it leaves me feeling clean, but not dried out like other face washes can.</li>
            <li> O.K. this has a lot of fans so I hate to be a  \\&quot; Debbie Downer\\&quot;: but I used this once and right away I noticed my face felt rough and tight and dry  as if  I  had just used a strong  detergent . I thought well maybe I just  need to wait a few minutes for my skin to acclimate to the new product so I waited for about 5 minutes and my skin started to itch and felt irritated.  I rewashed my face again with my usual cleanser and it  felt better.  I didn:t realize this has Sodium Laureth Sulfate in it although not listed as one of the ingredients on the Amazon site .  Unless they have reformulated it without it .  Here&#x27;s the ingredient list  I have for it .  Water; Glycerin; Decyl Polyglucose; Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate; PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate; Cocamidopropyl Betaine; PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate; Citric Acid; Propylene Glycol; Diazolidinyl Urea; Methylparaben; Propylparaben; Sodium Laureth Sulfate; PEG-3 Distearate; Sodium Chloride  It does remove makeup pretty well though so 1 give it props for that .  Oh just for reference  my skin is  more on the normal  side and not usually sensitive or reactive .</li>
            <li> I use this product with a buffing sponge in the mornings, and with my hands at night.  After it I put on the alpha hydroxy lotion and my skin is very soft and the sun spots are slowly fading.  I have used retin-A for years but my skin would peel like crazy even after months of using it and the make up looks terrible on skin like that. After using this product the makeup glides on easy and the skin is not dry anymore.  I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Mild and really nice feel when you wash your face. I have used all the name brands and this one is right up there and really better than many. very mild around the eyes too. I am surprised I am such a fan but truly it is good so the truth is the truth-:)</li>
            <li> i gave this face wash a shot since i can never seem to find that works and it actually works great. after a couple months of using it my skin(face) just feel more smooth and not blotchy and rough. i love it but i wish i could buy it in stores!!lol.thank you! Just edited this . Was supposed to be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am 27 year old normal/oily skin. With constant sparatic acne. When I came across this product I thought I would give it a try, considering all of the great reviews. I could instantly see a difference. My face was clearing up and nothing new was forming on my face. For 6 months I was relieved that I finally found a product that would clear my face.&lt;br /&gt;Until I started seeing dark patches on my face. It looks like I have large 1 inch x 2 inch spots on my face that are tanner then the rest. They look dirty, like I forgot to wash some spots on face. It mostly showed on my forehead where my hair does not cover, on my checks like under where my sunglasses would be and on my upper lip. I was devastated, as I found out that these dark spots are called melasma and are basically permanent unless you want to spend thousands on laser or dark spot corrector treatments.&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research, I found that alpha hydrox makes your skin almost like paper thin. Despite that I use SPF 30 for my morning and night moisturizer. The sun still got to my skin and marked it permanently. I do not have the money for laser treatments or to spend hundreds on dark skin correctors that make me break out. I have discontinued using any face washes containing rentinol or alpha hydrox ingrediants. I was told to try fresh lemon juice to (I guess) bleach my forhead, checks and upper lip. I am trying that now. Hopefully it will work. This is just my situation, I hope that it is help to those of you thinking to try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have moved to a remote area where there are no retailers who carry it.</li>
            <li> Obviously not a miracle product or anything but does the job.  Does not over dry the skin and leaves it clean. Would recommend to try.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very nicely and I like the cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good face wash, just don&#x27;t get fooled by the packaging. Or read the product description better than I did. There isn&#x27;t any AHA in this product. It&#x27;s just a face wash that &amp;#34;gets your face ready&amp;#34; for other products with alpha hydroxy acid in them.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Probably the best I have ever bought! My skin is oily sometimes and with this face wash feels clean and visibly clear!!!!I love it!</li>
            <li> Love all the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
            <li> Lovely foaming suds leaves my face feeling super clean. I would buy two bottles for every one bottle of the alpha hydrox lotion, because it gets used faster.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser, but didn&#x27;t realize it contained parabens until purchasing.  I like to be cautious about parabens as it may not be safe and could cause cancer.  I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle, but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> soap free cleanser,works as described.this is good if you have dry flakey skin.especially in the winter time when it is cold outside and warm inside.</li>
            <li> The SLS in this product (helps the foaming, acts as a surfactant/cleanser) caused really terrible cystic acne after about a month of use. I wanted to love it--it makes my face feel so *clean*, but having gone down the list and confirmed that the other ingredients were things I know I&#x27;m not sensitive to, I had to toss this product due to the SLS. Having checked CosDNA, SLS is a known high-level comedogen. I don&#x27;t object to sulfates, but having a highly comedogenic ingredient in a face wash seems pretty counter intuitive to me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Only take a tiny amount and it foams up when you rub it into your wet hands and goes on so easily and rinses off equally as easily. I notice my skin getting less wrinkly and more toned. I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> One of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Nondrying, great for removing makeup.  I also use this in combination with the face swipes.  Overall a great cleanser for daily use.</li>
            <li> As a part of the daily routine, this is a good option if you have an oily or combination skin type.</li>
            <li> I have tried most products under $20 and this is the one that I have continued to use because I actually get results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a cheaper alternative to Aqua Glycolic and a gentler alternative to glycolic acid peels and so far I am very pleased.  I have extremely oily skin and this face wash doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily like the peels did and seems to even reduce the amount of oil although it is a bit too early to say this for sure.  If you like Aqua Glycolic or just want an everyday glycolic acid product, give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I like this no nonsense face wash.  No smell, cleans my face well.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Overall good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Very good face wash. Doesn&#x27;t dry your face like some of them and produces good lather.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I will definately buy again!  It does a good job cleaning my face and it feels smooth! Good price too.</li>
            <li> Loved this product in my 20&#x27;s and love it now in my 60&#x27;s.  Serious facial cleanser for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> bought this because the reviews seemed good and I admit the product was good for the first 3 weeks. but now it makes my skin extremely dry. and I started breaking out on my forehead,and I never breakout there. since my skin Is so dry now I stopped using it -__- guess it didn&#x27;t agree with my skin :/</li>
            <li> Im in my 30&#x27;s and still break out from time to time. I read such great reviews about this product I decided to give it a try. The first few days my skin cleared and I was excited to have finally found a product that worked. That was all I got, a few days LOL. After that all hell broke loose. I got huge under the skin cyst like pimples that hurt! I asked my doctor about the \\&quot;purging\\&quot; theory and he sd basically its bull. (maybe I should keep with it?) Your skin does not \\&quot;purge\\&quot; and if something irritates it to STOP. So I did and my skin took about a week or so to calm back down. Im still breaking out but not like I did using this. Just like anything else it works for some and not for others. I, sadly, was an other :) i even attempted it again thinking it was something in my diet or I was stressed and the same thing happened. I have an almost full bottle I cant even use.</li>
            <li> Bought this product before. I like it because it makes the face feel really clean and it only takes a little to do the job. Will be again.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with acne for many years and tried everything possible on the market...both prescription and over the counter items and nothing has worked for me. This face wash is the best thing! It gently washes my face without over drying and has my acne under control. I don&#x27;t have breakouts anymore. For anyone out there like me you HAVE to try this product!!</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable for my combination skin</li>
            <li> My favorite skin cleanser ever. I had terrible oily skin and cystic acne as a teen. Even now that I&#x27;m in my 50s my skin&#x27;s still pretty oily and I still get the occasional minor pimple. Using this product regularly cuts &#x27;way back on that tendency. It does a great job of turning the skin over, which keeps my face looking fresh, without being harsh and drying. (One exception to this: my lips do get very dry. Minor annoyance.) I use it morning and night and my face has never been happier. And since, as a previous reviewer wrote, a \\&quot;pea-size\\&quot; dab of the product is all that&#x27;s needed, a bottle of it lasts for months. I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to clear up grotesque deep-down problem acne of the kind that bugged me as a teen. For that, try switching your diet to Paleo -- Loren Cordain has a book about Paleo eating for acne. Above all, cut out the sugary drinks (sodas AND fruit juices), and cut &#x27;way back on coffee. Meditating and exercise can also help, as can purging your life of whatever stresses you out. But for oily skin and superficial acne, this stuff works for me &#x27;way better than anything with salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, alcohol, etc.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. Lathers well, non drying to skin. Price is right. All in all a very nice cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank-you&lt;br /&gt;  Abbygail</li>
            <li> Leaves my face, fresh, super clean and free of acne. Have started to use it on my hands and arms to prevent wrinkles too.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foaming Face Wash is for all skin types and is Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s #1 selling facial cleaner. When I first used it, it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. It looks and feels more like a thin gel. Once you massage it onto your wet skin it does lather up and get foamy. After rinsing it off my skin felt tight and dry. Since using the face wash my skin has felt a lot smoother. I haven&#x27;t seen any physical changes yet. My skin still feels very tight and dry so I only use it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years and I swear by it.  Keeps my skin clear and no breakouts.  I had switched to another brand of face wash and my skin broke out badly, so I swear this kept my skin blemish free for years. I absolutely love this product and I find it super cheap for six bucks at TJ Max and Marshalls, sorry Amazon. I buy every bottle on the shelf when i see it there lol</li>
            <li> Been using it for years, as it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and once a week I add baking soda to the mix and get a great facial with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Saw it on Dr. OZ, he said you had to have an AHA to truly clean your skin where soap will not.  This is great, skin actually looks cleaner. I am now using the Alpha Hydrox Souffle you leave on, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser for acne prone skin.  LOVE IT.  After using it my face feels so clean.  Much better than Proactiv or an other acne wash product.  Try it!</li>
            <li> THis soap is perfect. It is the perfect soap for all skin types. I have oily skin and this soap cleans it without stripping it. Its the perfect soap before any glycolic, retinol treatment.It slightly foams and leaves yoru skin feeling clean. I use the alpha hydrox cream souffle and the alpha hydrox 14% pads, so this is the perfect soap to use. I love the companies products.</li>
            <li> I love this product line. I have sensitive skin so it&#x27;s hard to find products to improve my skin without breaking out like a teenage boy. This entire product line works wonders for my skin when it starts to dull.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected mad my face dry.and did  not do anything to my face. no improvement . wont buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for overestimate ten years.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to remove her eye make up and does not leave your skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and have yet to find anything other than bc pills to control my acne. This however made me break out. Guess it works for some skin types and not for others..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do without it</li>
            <li> i always come back to this face wash . it works the best for my sensitive acne prone skin . leaves skin feeling clean without feeling dry .</li>
            <li> Great face wash.  I use this about 3-4 times a week in conjuction with another exfoliating wash and I think my skin looks better. I&#x27;ve used for about 6 months and ready to order more. I&#x27;m pretty picky with face creams and washes and I think this does the job in the description.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using this facial cleanser for many years and its the best I have seen in the market.  The product is very gentle on the skin and i have gotten so many compliments on the way my skin looks and feel.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and great for super oily skin. It leaves my skin feeling sift and clean. Remember to moisturize after using this because it does strip the skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> This product works fast and easy. I have only used it for about a week and already my skin is clearing and feeling smoother. Only draw back is that my skin feels dry after I use it so I most definitely recommend using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with my acne.  It does seem to clear up my skin a bit.  I really like the price and I tried the Alpha Hydrox lotion but didn&#x27;t like it as much as the foaming face wash.</li>
            <li> Very good face wash and was a recommendation in the Dr Oz &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Good Life&amp;#34; magazine.  I use it with a battery operated spinning brush for best results.</li>
            <li> I recently had a facial and the esthetician recommended  using glycolic lotion.  I bought the foaming fash wash to start my regimen to  use with the lotion.  My skin feels refreshed in the morning and it feels smoother and tighter.  I only have been using it for about 2 weeks.  I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and still breakout so I am trying to get back to daily routine and it seems to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I do not think you have to get the wash for the lotion to work but I decided to get the pair to give my skin a leg-up since I have trying to take a better care of my skin (hopefully it is not too late!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this face wash for 3-4 days but there&#x27;s a noticeable difference in my skin. Huge difference, actually. My tone got a lot better. And by better, I mean that my face used to be colored red so badly from acne and nothing would get rid of it - nothing. And now it&#x27;s back to the color of the rest of my skin, nice and even. The product isn&#x27;t over-drying either. It gets rid of acne faster than any prescription medicine I&#x27;ve ever tried (Duac, clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide), along with any over-the-counters. There are too many to name. Try this stuff. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> She likes it, though I was a bit concerned the box wasn&#x27;t sealed she told me that&#x27;s how it is.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this after such high recommendations. I was hoping it might help get rid of the post-acne red marks on my very pale sensitive skin. Unfortunately this was waaay too drying (even for my relatively oily skin) and gave me a terrible reaction right away. It made me break out in painful rash like bumps on my face. I think I must just be allergic to AHA...I know it works amazingly for others, but just wanted to share my experience.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash, it cleans thoroughly and leaves my face so soft and smooth.  I can also tell my face isn&#x27;t as oily when using it.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin super clean, and has reduced my blackspots&lt;br /&gt;definitely a very helpful product, has cleaned my face completely</li>
            <li> I have always called myself the lotion and potion queen. At 52yrs old people are always trying to guess my age and are shocked when I tell them that I am not 40. I have been using this product for years, it is gentle on my skin, removes my eye make up without irritation and has a clean smell. I exfoliate my skin once or twice a week using loofah gloves to remove any dead skin cells so new more radiant skin can benefit from the lotions I use. There are hundreds of products out there that will empty your wallet and you&#x27;ll have nothing to show for it.... this is not one of them. It&#x27;s simply the best!!</li>
            <li> I just brought this and it&#x27;s great.  My skin looks better than when I get a professional facial. I use this with Hydrox face cream. Can&#x27;t believe that a great product is also super inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Seeing a noticeable difference in skin - product is not to harsh and skin has a nice feel after use.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Having been using for more years than I can remember.  I&#x27;m 66 and I look much younger.  Can&#x27;t find it stores any more so will be ordering online.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they stopped making this.  Truly a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was so impressed with the Alpha Hydroxy Face Lotion, as it leaves my skin bright and clear and I have minimal break outs, so I figured the facial wash would do the same.. So I stopped using my normal face wash and I used this product instead for about a month and I noticed more irritation if anything... It wasn&#x27;t really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal. I thought using the both in conjunction would just work best but I&#x27;m starting to think my skin is too sensitive and cannot take too much of the same thing? I am not quite sure... but I&#x27;m going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion. Another thing is that facial washes really do not exfoliate your skin.. They just tone it.. and I think I need more exfoliation or I wish they had exfoliation beads in this product.. Maybe it would&#x27;ve worked better? Idk..</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash - gentle and exfoliating.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> great price and fast ship.  I have found this product to be really effective and it works really well.. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> 10 per cent glycol in this very effective product. Just as good or better than ones that are more expensive.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work in the beginning, I would still get one or 2 big pimples, but wasn&#x27;t such a pizza face anymore.  However, I am going to try something new now because I have been breaking out terribly bad for the past 2 weeks (probably due to a lot of stress from an upcoming knee surgery).  Good product, makes my face feel good, not oily or dry, but not sure if it&#x27;s enough for extreme stress.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is hands-down the best facial cleanser in my opinion.  I have two others that I also like (Mary Kay 3-in-1, and 100% pure Brightening cleanser - see my reviews), but out of the three, the Alpha Hydrox Foaming face wash is the best.  After cleansing face with the AH you can see and feel how clean your pores are without stripping your skin or drying it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since shortly after it was introduced.  No need to use \\&quot;eye makeup remover\\&quot; because this does it all, yet is gentle and I have no adverse reaction to it.  Only thing is it should come in a pump bottle rather than flip &amp; squeeze.  They had pumps years back for a limited time and I&#x27;m still transferring pump to new bottles.  Every friend I&#x27;ve ever introduced to this facial cleanser has continued to use it.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a lower cost alternative to DDF&#x27;s glycolic acid cleanser and I ordered this one.  I found the product to be so weak as to not make much difference in how clean and clear my face was after using it.</li>
            <li> Great facial soap for removing makeup but it left my skin feeling a little tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I like how it works for me. I have one of the most challenging skin types and this one works pretty ok for me, not best but I am satisfied with this face wash.</li>
            <li> This face soap is great for removing ALL makeup, even eye makeup which I think is just great because it saves you from that extra step of removing eye makeup and THEN the rest of your makeup.  Plus I occationally have eye lid ezcema and this has so far been the only face soap that doesnt cause flare ups!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t a miracle and didn&#x27;t cure me, but has kept things under control.&lt;br /&gt;It is strong enough to wash off my makeup but not so strong that it irrates me skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use a toner (home made with bottled water and 1tsp of tea tree oil for each 6 oz water) and a natural moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;This regimen and at home facial peels every 2 weeks has made my skin so much better.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Had a late in life flare-up this cleared it up in no time.  Makes my face feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Olay Cleaning system. Leaves his refreshed and glowing. Other products at twice the price don&#x27;t do it any better.</li>
            <li> Used this foaming face wash for years.  Cleans skin without drying out skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and not dry. That is a good thing because I have used other face washes that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually read ingredient lists carefully, but I guess the name fulled me and I thought this product had some AHA&#x27;s.  After using it for a while and not seeing or feeling any difference (AHA&#x27;s should sting a bit) I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs.  I wanted a product with AHAs and think the company&#x27;s name is deceiving on such a product.  I thought they only sold products with AHAs.  Perhaps they aren&#x27;t doing this intentionally, but it is confusing and I wanted to let everyone know in case you were fooled too.</li>
            <li> Very good soap to make sure all make-up and dirt is removed.</li>
            <li> I called the Alpha Hydrox company out of curiosity before ordering!  I ordered their entire line.  I&#x27;m 44 years old, I&#x27;ve never been a sun-worshiper. Three years ago someone asked me if I was 29.  I was so flattered. As a teenager, i never had blemishes.  For the past two years, I&#x27;ve been dealing with mild adult acne.  My Mom is a licensed hairdresser/cosmetologist.  A dear friend of mine is a licensed esthetician.  I called this friend, and she suggested I try the Alpha Hydrox line.  I found their products, and ordered the foaming facial cleaner, toner/astringent, oil free moisturizer, and their heavier 2 oz jar of moisturizer for normal skin.  As four weeks went by, I am down to the last of my first bottle of cleanser, and ran out of toner. I just ordered two more bottles of cleanser, and two additional bottles of toner. The oil free moisturizer I use in the daytime, the other one I use at night.  My blemishes were calmed down and healing within 48 hours of use last month. My skin GLOWED after a week of use.  All of their products I purchased are 10% glycolic acid. I really want to try their 12% AHA body lotion and their foot cream. PHENOMENAL, amazing stuff!!!  I would not trade these products for anything in the universe.  For being 44, my skin has that healthy glow I had at 19 and through my 20&#x27;s. I used Mary Kay from 1991 to 2003, I&#x27;ve sold Mary Kay 3 different times.  I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil and nothing but this product line has cleared up my skin.  Eight years ago when my child was born, I became allergic to MK Timewise. I am done with all other skin care lines but Alpha Hydrox!  :)  My pores are GONE.  I&#x27;m also a fan of Freeman&#x27;s Dead Sea mineral mask.</li>
            <li> Gentle and hydrating without it being too expensive.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! I have tried many different cleansers (at many price points) and always come back to this one. I think it does a great job cleansing my skin, and I love that I can use it on my eyes.  I have been using it with my Mia 2, and it had been a great combination.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, along with the AH moisturizer and am pleased with it.  My skin texture and color have noticeably improved since I began to use it. Update:  I&#x27;m still pleased with these products.  People often comment positively about my skin, and I&#x27;m 70 years old!</li>
            <li> Love this product . Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash very much.  It used to be available in Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Leaves very little make up residue behind</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the intent of using it on my upper arms for keratosis pilaris aka chicken skin. I had tiny white bumps on my upper arms that are similar to acne. For years it&#x27;s been a huge embarrassment since it looked like acne, not to mention, I am naturally a \\&quot;Picker\\&quot; I pick at every little thing. I have been that way since I was a child. I have seen doctors, dermatologist, estheticians, you name it. I have tried all kinds of different things with no luck at all. Doctors told me it was just allergies. I have done tons of research on treating this condition. I found that gycolic acid helps with exfoliating the dead skin cells. This has cured my embarrassing \\&quot;chicken skin.\\&quot; YAY!!! Not only did it make my arms smooth, it also cleared my face up. I have suffered with oily skin FOREVER. I have tried every product out there almost, from the cheapest to the most expensive. My face was combination skin. I had lots of break outs. I thought I needed face wash for \\&quot;oily\\&quot; skin considering the a mouth if oil my face produced, on top of the pimples is develop. It didn&#x27;t help I constantly picked at the blemishes. I started to use this as my facial cleanser, since doing so I don&#x27;t have blemishes. When I do it&#x27;s every great now &amp; then. My face is no longer oily. I finally have a beautiful even skin tone. I have used this for 2 years now without any problems. You can purchase this at CVS &amp; Walgreens for almost twice the cost of what you can get it on amazon for. At least try it, you don&#x27;t have anything to lose.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the great reviews. but After using this product I had break outs. I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a month now. Removes makeup reallly well and has kept my blemishes down a bit but i more so use it for makeup removal. Very gentle and perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This foaming face wash is a great substitution for the Neutrogena face wash. It doesn&#x27;t contain Beta Hydroxy like the Neutrogena but is very gentle.</li>
            <li> Love this product an it inexpensive thank you a great face cream. An I didnt have to go to a expensive department store..</li>
            <li> Got a very bad rush from it. I might have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt; Used it two days and I started noticing my face was itching and a small swelling near my cheeks. I thought it was something I ate or just a bad day.&lt;br /&gt;I continued using face wash for 3 days and rash wouldn&#x27;t go away. I stopped using it and notice rash disappeared. This is just my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that since is a care product I wouldn&#x27;t be able to return it and that I was stuck with the face wash but Thanks to the great customer service of Amazon I was able to get a refund and dispose of the face wash.</li>
            <li> I have used this face wash for several years. I have combination skin and this cleans it and removes my eye makeup without drying out my skin. I have to order it online since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash! I have dry to very dry skin so it can be hard to find a face wash that doesn&#x27;t completely dry my face out, and this one is really good. It&#x27;s really gentle like it claims and my face always feels refreshed after using it. I love foaming face washes! And this one foams up really good when I use my olay cleansing system. But it works just as well with hands (; I know a lot of people try to avoid fragrance scented product but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it had some kind of scent to it. I like using that&#x27;s also going to clean my face but makes it smell good as well. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s so affordable. I always try to stay with the low price range items but sometimes they don&#x27;t work as good as more expensive items. I love that this product does work good! Would have been 5 stars if they just added a little perfume to it :P</li>
            <li> After making my first-ever trip to the dermatogist in my mid-30&#x27;s and being prescribed a $200 medication, I was on the hunt for a cheaper solution to my adult acne problems.  After reading many reviews on Amazon, it seemed like this product would definitely be worth a shot. I cannot say enough about this product.  I have now been using it for more than a year, and my face is the softest and clearest it has been in years.  I will say that several other reviews mention giving it a few weeks before making a decision about how it is working, and that turned out to be great advice.  The first couple of weeks, I seemed to have more breakouts than before, but after a few weeks of this product doing its job, I have had very few breakouts since.  I have tried tons of different acne medications over the years and none of them has worked like this one.  I am hooked!  I tell all my friends to try this!  The best part is that even though I bought it for acne relief, my skin actually appears softer and more youthful than before I started using it!</li>
            <li> Great if you suffer from seborrheic dermatitis...really tackles that issue around the mouth, hairline and ears. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Get rid of all the dead skin cells and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It leaves my face and neck clean, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Took a little longer than anticipated, but it&#x27;s peak Holiday time, so I took that into consideration.</li>
            <li> Misleading Brand Name.  For $10+ I expected a cleanser that had glycolic acid (AHA) in it, not a cleanser that just balances my skin&#x27;s pH level and nothing else.  I could get a cleanser that does that in greater quantity and much cheaper at plenty of nearby retail stores. Major rip off.</li>
            <li> It is the one thing that I have found that helps with adult acne. Love it....:-)</li>
            <li> This face wash is an excellent gentle wash.  I tried it because even Cetaphil and Purpose were drying out my skin and I have had no problems with this one.  My skin is usually pretty oily and since using this wash I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement.  It has a neutral smell, foams nicely, leaves your skin feeling clean but not taut, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is my HG cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is combo and as I get older, I&#x27;m getting dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy it 3-4 at a time so I can get free shipping. I also keep one on my counter (for night) and one in my shower (for morning).  This cleanser gets rid of makeup and is very, very gentle. Doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave it dirty or oily. You just need a little bit so a bottle goes a long way. I docked the packaging b/c a pump would be better.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a US company and they always send a signed note thanking me for my business. That&#x27;s a nice touch. And it&#x27;s not a million dollars, so that is GREAT!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great. I&#x27;ve been using on my boyfriend&#x27;s backne for about a week now and it always leaves it feeling nice and soft and used with the AHA lotion has been clearing it up pretty well. Also use it on my face and it leave my skin feeling baby soft after use. It&#x27;s not abrasive like other washes I&#x27;ve used. Very gentile with a naturally clean smell.</li>
            <li> This is gentle on my face, yet it cleans it very well.  I have been using this with the Alpha Hydroxy lotion, and I have seen positive results on my skin.  I recommend this cleaner.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because of all the amazing reviews, but it really let me down! I switched over from Bliss No Zit Sherlock face wash because this one was cheaper but unfortunately I&#x27;ve experienced horrible breakouts ever since. My pores are clogged and I&#x27;m getting zits all around my hairline and chin.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who has acne. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products along these lines, I&#x27;m 41 and had minor signs of aging.  Laugh lines around my eyes and lines on my forehead.  The lines around my eyes I can tell a visible difference the ones on my forehead and genetic...lol, but i see improvement there as well.  I would recommend and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My skin loves it!  I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for me and totally worth every penny and then some!  Feels gentle on my skin while fading the scars.  I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t over dry.  Update: A couple months later I&#x27;m still using this product.  I&#x27;ve also started using the AHA cream in addition to the wash.  I love this line because of its quality and that it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this face wash after seeing reviews on Amazon and thought it could be the best choice for my oily-combination skin. I had pretty clear skin before getting this but after using it my face felt drier than before and I started getting bumps regularly which I wasn&#x27;t expecting so I finished this off as soon as I could. Will not purchase again.</li>
