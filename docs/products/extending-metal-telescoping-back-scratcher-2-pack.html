            <li>Product is incredibly poorly-made and flimsy.</li>
            <li>loved it until it broke after a week!</li>
            <li>Good buy for price as well!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a stocking stuffer and thought two would be great- one for home and one for work.</li>
            <li>sort of works, but not that great of scratching ability</li>

            <li>Great for travel.  </li>
            <li>scratching end of the item is great.</li>
            <li>The two pack of telescoping backscratchers was a great bargain and the men who received them rave about the pocket clip and telescoping attributes.  </li>
            <li>you will not be happy at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great these are compact and extend.</li>

            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>They are great gifts.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this thinking the extending ability and portability would be great.  </li>
            <li>This item is a great gadget.</li>
            <li>Great for kids</li>
            <li>They came and work great</li>
            <li>but thisis great for a pocket</li>
            <li>It seems durable and it&#x27;s very handy.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice concept.</li>
            <li>Good size and collapsed very nicely</li>
            <li>they did however come in a package of two, so i will put them to relatively good use elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>Good buy for how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li>Good luck getting this thing to tickle your itch.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>Flimsiness to be determined (but it&#x27;s good that the set is of 2 vs 1, in case it decides to fall apart like its predecessor.)</li>
            <li>good for a good scratch, no mater when, where, or how, scratch it to the max.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a good product and a good price.</li>
            <li>The one thing I hadn&#x27;t liked about the bamboo version was that it wasn&#x27;t very effective through cloth (for example, through a shirt)</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with their service.</li>
            <li>love it, an itch u can&#x27;t scratch, this works great.</li>
            <li>These are very unique and make great gifts.  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s created many laughs!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Telescoping feature is really nice.  </li>
            <li>the price, a nice purchase.</li>
            <li>I would tell you how I liked this product if I would have ever gotten it.  </li>
            <li>I then knew it was the product because I baby everything I own.</li>
            <li>So handy.</li>
            <li>GREAT product and a Super price.</li>
            <li>Good concept, but it breaks too easily.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re more effective than some of the wood ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>And, a set of two for $5 is a super deal!!</li>
            <li>Very light weight but sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>The alloy it&#x27;s made of is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>These do the job just fine &amp; are nice &amp; compact.</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful addition to my work bag and provides instant relief!</li>
            <li>i was given one by a friend , and wanted to purchase more</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great item.</li>
            <li>If you put more than 2 lbs of force on it, it&#x27;s going to bend in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves it and uses it more than I thought she would price</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a bit flimsy, but you have to take that into consideration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pay more and get a better quality product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>WIll be buying more as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t retract it from the top, or it will bend.</li>
            <li>It could have bee wider to cover more area.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s telescoping.</li>
            <li>i bought this wooden one instead and am very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>they bend easily.</li>
            <li>They extend easily and are well made.</li>
            <li>Since I am not supermans mother, I have to believe it was not sturdy since he broke it so easily.  </li>
            <li>Fit in my backpack easily.  </li>
            <li>Came fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>Small and conveniently fits perfect in my purse or pocket, and scratches well, love this item may</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m not always available when he needs a scratch, fits easily in his shirt pocket.</li>
            <li>the things work fine for being so cheap.  </li>
            <li>For the cost, the little scratcher is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>They immedatley offered a FREE replacement.</li>
            <li>They are made so cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This telescoping back scratcher is great.  </li>
            <li>I can fit this in my drawer in my nightstand or in my purse.</li>
            <li>I also use one in bed to flip off the light switch on the wall.  </li>
            <li>Great back scratchers.</li>
            <li>These extenable back scratchers are great to stuff just about anywhere.  </li>
            <li>CHEAP MATERIAL.</li>
            <li>These are great- when they don&#x27;t retract back onto itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they sent 2 since the first was the \\&quot;practice\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the gym bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it is good deal for the price and convenient for travel purpose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not tough and strong but if you take care of it and don&#x27;t act like a brute, it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>The recipient was so happy with them that they bought additional ones to leave in the car and other places.</li>
            <li>It scratches nicely and is firm and effective.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this two pack of metal telescoping back scratchers!</li>
            <li>its not loose,  its just that the claw spins more freely than i want.</li>
            <li>They came in pairs but one of them did not last more then one day!</li>
            <li>It generally meets my need, although I would like it to be a bit more &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;, more like having fingernails, so I can really scratch an itchy spot.</li>
            <li>It unfolds smoothly and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>so it hurts to bend my wrist to scratch my own back.  </li>
            <li>Nice telescoping back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>Always nice to find a device with multiple uses.  </li>
            <li>it was well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Practical and economical.</li>
            <li>The second one stays in his travel bag so he always has it handy,</li>
            <li>He could use these to scratch his back or whatever he couldn&#x27;t reach on his own.</li>
            <li>I gave these out as stocking stuffer and we had/have fun w/ them.  </li>
            <li>cheap, breaks easy if not careful</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as describes and came quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this handy little tool!</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, but takes forever to ship (ships from Hong Kong).&lt;br /&gt;Pretty nicely made and works better after a slight bending of the teeth to about a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li>If it was a little stronger It would be the perfect back scratcher</li>
            <li>Look for a good old fashioned back scratcher made from bamboo.</li>
            <li>They do not take a lot of stress, so young children can break them easily.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and gets to that elusive itch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay except while you&#x27;re scratching the scratcher keeps twisting around to the back.</li>
            <li>The ends of the backscratcher came off as soon as it was used the first time.</li>
            <li>and they bent the first time I tried to use them.</li>
            <li>but I guess there is a First time for everything.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>The first thing my husband did was bent his to appear as if it was giving &amp;#34;the bird&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>How funny is that.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described in the product description.</li>
            <li>Broke after first use.</li>
            <li>I always refer people looking for the same items as myself to Amazon for many things.  </li>
            <li>One of two broke during the first use.</li>
            <li>Love these back scratchers.</li>
            <li>It has been such a help and relief, enabling me to sleep better and to sit in an armchair and read, etc.  </li>
            <li>Although if you want more pressure you will need to get the wooden ones.  </li>
            <li>Liked the telescoping aspect because it makes for easy storing, however the head tends to twist around and makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li>However, a little super glue and it was as good as new, or better.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>so I pretty much had a 50/50 chance of getting it right.</li>
            <li>It was certainly well worth the totally reasonable and affordable price.  </li>
            <li>This back scratcher is great for reaching areas that are harder to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li>I actually bought them for my daddy, who was in a nursing home and bed ridden and only had one good arm after a stroke.</li>
            <li>Very good price on such simple tools -- a couple months later</li>
            <li>They advertised this item as being 28 inches; bought two of these and the first one broke in about a week and since it was the not the length advertised and such cheap quality I still have second still in the original packaging!</li>
            <li>Third, the head tends to turn away from its target all too easily.</li>
            <li>The back scratchers arrived with a strong solvent odor.  </li>
            <li>This item is pure junk.  </li>
            <li>and a great little back scratcher.</li>
            <li>This has all the earmarks of a great product, but it has several deadly weaknesses.</li>
            <li>Cheap and last about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is such a great simple way to have to stop scratching my boyfriends back!  </li>
            <li>Beware, these do not look anything like the ones in the picture and mine went straight in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>was reasonable</li>
            <li>It reaches anywhere and folds up to fit in a tiny drawer.</li>
            <li>Delivery time was much sooner than stated.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate resultant  jagged edge did not slice up my back!</li>
            <li>so I have a backup ready to go just in case.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much everyone thank me for these.</li>
            <li>job - thank you much.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient when you have an itch you can&#x27;t reach and no one around to scratch it.</li>
            <li>so you are always ready when that itch occurs.</li>
            <li>the smooth back is rubbing against me which has no effect).  </li>
            <li>thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>it would be a waste of time and my own money to return them.    </li>
            <li>Liked  that there was two for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I have bought a far better product at the same price from Walgreen&#x27;s in Seattle itself!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t easily collapse on itself so you can use it under parkas, sweaters, t-shirts and long underwear without it losing length.</li>
            <li>Not bad overall.</li>
            <li>The folding design is the main reason I picked this up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This takes a little more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had such good experiences with Amazon in the past</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t even worth purchasing at a deep discount.  </li>
            <li>First one out of the package broke after only two full extensions the other ones shaft bent first time it was used.  </li>
            <li>Hard metal - very sturdy -- telescoping very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Nice little back scratcher, folds down for easy storagae.</li>
            <li>One thing to note, though, I have pulled too hard on the &#x27;hand/scratcher&#x27; part a couple of times and it came off of the extending rod, but it easily goes right back on and is secure enough to not fall off.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the products specs more closely  because this is much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li>One word of advice to mothers of very young children.</li>
            <li>The back scratcher does exactly the job for which it was designed.  </li>
            <li>The stem broke within the first three hours of me opening the package, on my second time extending it to scratch my shoulder.</li>
            <li>My back thanks you!</li>
            <li>.. blunt up the scratcher end with some fancy ribbons and whatnot, and give it to a tween who wants a \\&quot;magic wand\\&quot; because it&#x27;s not really fit to be a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>First, the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are not bent in far enough.</li>
            <li>The problem (caused by showering with water that was too hot and removed the necessary oils in my skin and dried out my back) has now been resolved, but it is there already if the same thing happens--and just knowing it is handy eases tension and stress.  </li>
            <li>So I have fixed it with electrician&#x27;s tape</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t completely telescope as it did before it broke</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s 20 years old &amp; he kept it in his truck.</li>
            <li>This can be fixed with a pliers.</li>
            <li>My husband uses both of his: one in the bedroom and one near his living room chair.</li>
            <li>I will not be surprised if they breat soon</li>
            <li>Once extended my 3 yr old pulled it completely out of the shaft and began bending it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space and has a clip to keep in your pocket if you need it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Useful and came quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent I spent.  </li>
            <li>These are so handy to have around, instead of the old fashion wooden ones they are small and get the job done !</li>
            <li>Telescope to a small easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does, exactly as it expected.</li>
            <li>These back scratchers are chap and crappy and the little fingers are kind of sharp and they can hurt you if you get too vigorous with the scratching.</li>
            <li>I got these for my husband who cannot live without a back scratcher at home &amp; wanted to have 1 for travelling as well as work.</li>
            <li>However, the end where the scratch part is rotates as you try to use it, which makes it difficult to use effectively.</li>
            <li>Back scratcher snapped in half under moderate pressure on the very first use.</li>
            <li>Fourth, that telescoping arm is not firm enough when extended.</li>
            <li>I have other back scratchers that are very satisfactory and so got this 2 PACK to have one at the office and one in the gym bag.  </li>
            <li>Also, after having extended/retracted the item several times, the handle loosens up significantly and the arm progressively loses rigidity, and ultimately falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Good buy for price as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer and thought two would be great- one for home and one for work.</li>
            <li> sort of works, but not that great of scratching ability</li>
            <li> Work great and so compact.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  </li>
            <li> scratching end of the item is great.</li>
            <li> The two pack of telescoping backscratchers was a great bargain and the men who received them rave about the pocket clip and telescoping attributes.  </li>
            <li> you will not be happy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great these are compact and extend.</li>
            <li> It worked great for couple weeks until extending it the handle came off</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li> so they were great gifts.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> They are great gifts.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this thinking the extending ability and portability would be great.  </li>
            <li> This item is a great gadget.</li>
            <li> Great for kids</li>
            <li> They came and work great</li>
            <li> but thisis great for a pocket</li>
            <li> It seems durable and it&#x27;s very handy.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice concept.</li>
            <li> Good size and collapsed very nicely</li>
            <li> they did however come in a package of two, so i will put them to relatively good use elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Good buy for how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> Good luck getting this thing to tickle your itch.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> Flimsiness to be determined (but it&#x27;s good that the set is of 2 vs 1, in case it decides to fall apart like its predecessor.)</li>
            <li> good for a good scratch, no mater when, where, or how, scratch it to the max.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a good product and a good price.</li>
            <li> The one thing I hadn&#x27;t liked about the bamboo version was that it wasn&#x27;t very effective through cloth (for example, through a shirt)</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with their service.</li>
            <li> love it, an itch u can&#x27;t scratch, this works great.</li>
            <li> These are very unique and make great gifts.  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s created many laughs!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Telescoping feature is really nice.  </li>
            <li> the price, a nice purchase.</li>
            <li> I would tell you how I liked this product if I would have ever gotten it.  </li>
            <li> I then knew it was the product because I baby everything I own.</li>
            <li> So handy.</li>
            <li> GREAT product and a Super price.</li>
            <li> Good concept, but it breaks too easily.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re more effective than some of the wood ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> And, a set of two for $5 is a super deal!!</li>
            <li> Very light weight but sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Very light weight.</li>
            <li> The alloy it&#x27;s made of is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> These do the job just fine &amp; are nice &amp; compact.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful addition to my work bag and provides instant relief!</li>
            <li> i was given one by a friend , and wanted to purchase more</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great item.</li>
            <li> If you put more than 2 lbs of force on it, it&#x27;s going to bend in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves it and uses it more than I thought she would price</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a bit flimsy, but you have to take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pay more and get a better quality product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> WIll be buying more as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t retract it from the top, or it will bend.</li>
            <li> It could have bee wider to cover more area.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s telescoping.</li>
            <li> i bought this wooden one instead and am very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> and I think they will love.  </li>
            <li> The telescoping feature of this back scratcher proved to be a wonderful asset.</li>
            <li> Love these -- have one at work.</li>
            <li> My dogs love it on their backs too.</li>
            <li> (I love them</li>
            <li> I will order  more.  </li>
            <li> that ok.  .</li>
            <li> Very practical and great reach.</li>
            <li> Good product, very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> They scratch just right, and I love that is adjustable!</li>
            <li> they bend easily.</li>
            <li> They extend easily and are well made.</li>
            <li> Since I am not supermans mother, I have to believe it was not sturdy since he broke it so easily.  </li>
            <li> Fit in my backpack easily.  </li>
            <li> Came fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> Small and conveniently fits perfect in my purse or pocket, and scratches well, love this item may</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m not always available when he needs a scratch, fits easily in his shirt pocket.</li>
            <li> the things work fine for being so cheap.  </li>
            <li> For the cost, the little scratcher is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> They immedatley offered a FREE replacement.</li>
            <li> They are made so cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This telescoping back scratcher is great.  </li>
            <li> I can fit this in my drawer in my nightstand or in my purse.</li>
            <li> I also use one in bed to flip off the light switch on the wall.  </li>
            <li> Great back scratchers.</li>
            <li> These extenable back scratchers are great to stuff just about anywhere.  </li>
            <li> CHEAP MATERIAL.</li>
            <li> These are great- when they don&#x27;t retract back onto itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they sent 2 since the first was the \\&quot;practice\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the gym bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it is good deal for the price and convenient for travel purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tough and strong but if you take care of it and don&#x27;t act like a brute, it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> The recipient was so happy with them that they bought additional ones to leave in the car and other places.</li>
            <li> It scratches nicely and is firm and effective.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this two pack of metal telescoping back scratchers!</li>
            <li> its not loose,  its just that the claw spins more freely than i want.</li>
            <li> They came in pairs but one of them did not last more then one day!</li>
            <li> It generally meets my need, although I would like it to be a bit more &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;, more like having fingernails, so I can really scratch an itchy spot.</li>
            <li> It unfolds smoothly and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> so it hurts to bend my wrist to scratch my own back.  </li>
            <li> Nice telescoping back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> Always nice to find a device with multiple uses.  </li>
            <li> it was well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Practical and economical.</li>
            <li> The second one stays in his travel bag so he always has it handy,</li>
            <li> He could use these to scratch his back or whatever he couldn&#x27;t reach on his own.</li>
            <li> I gave these out as stocking stuffer and we had/have fun w/ them.  </li>
            <li> cheap, breaks easy if not careful</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as describes and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this handy little tool!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, but takes forever to ship (ships from Hong Kong).&lt;br /&gt;Pretty nicely made and works better after a slight bending of the teeth to about a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li> If it was a little stronger It would be the perfect back scratcher</li>
            <li> Look for a good old fashioned back scratcher made from bamboo.</li>
            <li> They do not take a lot of stress, so young children can break them easily.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and gets to that elusive itch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay except while you&#x27;re scratching the scratcher keeps twisting around to the back.</li>
            <li> The ends of the backscratcher came off as soon as it was used the first time.</li>
            <li> and they bent the first time I tried to use them.</li>
            <li> but I guess there is a First time for everything.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> The first thing my husband did was bent his to appear as if it was giving &amp;#34;the bird&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> How funny is that.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described in the product description.</li>
            <li> Broke after first use.</li>
            <li> I always refer people looking for the same items as myself to Amazon for many things.  </li>
            <li> One of two broke during the first use.</li>
            <li> Love these back scratchers.</li>
            <li> It has been such a help and relief, enabling me to sleep better and to sit in an armchair and read, etc.  </li>
            <li> Although if you want more pressure you will need to get the wooden ones.  </li>
            <li> Liked the telescoping aspect because it makes for easy storing, however the head tends to twist around and makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> However, a little super glue and it was as good as new, or better.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> so I pretty much had a 50/50 chance of getting it right.</li>
            <li> It was certainly well worth the totally reasonable and affordable price.  </li>
            <li> This back scratcher is great for reaching areas that are harder to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li> I actually bought them for my daddy, who was in a nursing home and bed ridden and only had one good arm after a stroke.</li>
            <li> Very good price on such simple tools -- a couple months later</li>
            <li> They advertised this item as being 28 inches; bought two of these and the first one broke in about a week and since it was the not the length advertised and such cheap quality I still have second still in the original packaging!</li>
            <li> Third, the head tends to turn away from its target all too easily.</li>
            <li> The back scratchers arrived with a strong solvent odor.  </li>
            <li> This item is pure junk.  </li>
            <li> and a great little back scratcher.</li>
            <li> This has all the earmarks of a great product, but it has several deadly weaknesses.</li>
            <li> Cheap and last about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is such a great simple way to have to stop scratching my boyfriends back!  </li>
            <li> Beware, these do not look anything like the ones in the picture and mine went straight in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> was reasonable</li>
            <li> It reaches anywhere and folds up to fit in a tiny drawer.</li>
            <li> Delivery time was much sooner than stated.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate resultant  jagged edge did not slice up my back!</li>
            <li> so I have a backup ready to go just in case.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much everyone thank me for these.</li>
            <li> job - thank you much.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient when you have an itch you can&#x27;t reach and no one around to scratch it.</li>
            <li> so you are always ready when that itch occurs.</li>
            <li> the smooth back is rubbing against me which has no effect).  </li>
            <li> thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> it would be a waste of time and my own money to return them.    </li>
            <li> Liked  that there was two for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I have bought a far better product at the same price from Walgreen&#x27;s in Seattle itself!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t easily collapse on itself so you can use it under parkas, sweaters, t-shirts and long underwear without it losing length.</li>
            <li> Not bad overall.</li>
            <li> The folding design is the main reason I picked this up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This takes a little more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had such good experiences with Amazon in the past</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t even worth purchasing at a deep discount.  </li>
            <li> First one out of the package broke after only two full extensions the other ones shaft bent first time it was used.  </li>
            <li> Hard metal - very sturdy -- telescoping very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Nice little back scratcher, folds down for easy storagae.</li>
            <li> One thing to note, though, I have pulled too hard on the &#x27;hand/scratcher&#x27; part a couple of times and it came off of the extending rod, but it easily goes right back on and is secure enough to not fall off.  </li>
            <li> I should have read the products specs more closely  because this is much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> One word of advice to mothers of very young children.</li>
            <li> The back scratcher does exactly the job for which it was designed.  </li>
            <li> The stem broke within the first three hours of me opening the package, on my second time extending it to scratch my shoulder.</li>
            <li> My back thanks you!</li>
            <li> .. blunt up the scratcher end with some fancy ribbons and whatnot, and give it to a tween who wants a \\&quot;magic wand\\&quot; because it&#x27;s not really fit to be a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> First, the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are not bent in far enough.</li>
            <li> The problem (caused by showering with water that was too hot and removed the necessary oils in my skin and dried out my back) has now been resolved, but it is there already if the same thing happens--and just knowing it is handy eases tension and stress.  </li>
            <li> So I have fixed it with electrician&#x27;s tape</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t completely telescope as it did before it broke</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s 20 years old &amp; he kept it in his truck.</li>
            <li> This can be fixed with a pliers.</li>
            <li> My husband uses both of his: one in the bedroom and one near his living room chair.</li>
            <li> I will not be surprised if they breat soon</li>
            <li> Once extended my 3 yr old pulled it completely out of the shaft and began bending it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space and has a clip to keep in your pocket if you need it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Useful and came quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent I spent.  </li>
            <li> These are so handy to have around, instead of the old fashion wooden ones they are small and get the job done !</li>
            <li> Telescope to a small easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does, exactly as it expected.</li>
            <li> These back scratchers are chap and crappy and the little fingers are kind of sharp and they can hurt you if you get too vigorous with the scratching.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband who cannot live without a back scratcher at home &amp; wanted to have 1 for travelling as well as work.</li>
            <li> However, the end where the scratch part is rotates as you try to use it, which makes it difficult to use effectively.</li>
            <li> Back scratcher snapped in half under moderate pressure on the very first use.</li>
            <li> Fourth, that telescoping arm is not firm enough when extended.</li>
            <li> I have other back scratchers that are very satisfactory and so got this 2 PACK to have one at the office and one in the gym bag.  </li>
            <li> Also, after having extended/retracted the item several times, the handle loosens up significantly and the arm progressively loses rigidity, and ultimately falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This back scratcher is pretty small and can&#x27;t compete with a full size bamboo model, but if you have shoulder problems or just can&#x27;t reach that one spot on your back that is driving you crazy, this product will allow you to get that, but not to do your whole back.  </li>
            <li> You have to be VERY careful when reaching behind yourself to even be able to use the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, nearly every other aspect of this item is problematic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more asking the wife to scratch a little higher, a little low, to the right, to left, etc.</li>
            <li> this product was sooooooo small it really didnt work well.</li>
            <li> The bamboo version had a flat handle</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy enough as long as you don&#x27;t bend it.</li>
            <li> While the scratcher technically works, the shaft is weak, a bit on the short side, and the head could be larger - especially for scratching large house cats.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but it won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The head twists loosely as you try to use it on your back.</li>
            <li> Trying to find some where to store a normal size back scratcher is hard.</li>
            <li> so much - keep one in my purse, one in my nightstand and one in the common area downstairs)</li>
            <li> Shipping was long.</li>
            <li> Well, they arrived being silver only, a lot smaller and with 2 less prongs (5 prong instead of 7) than the picture showed</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because, unlike other users, this product is still intact after being purchased a month later.</li>
            <li> Telescopes down so it can be stored in places a larger one can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t always stay in the longer position and slips back down while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these telescoping back scratchers, and some time down the road</li>
            <li> No more, no less.</li>
            <li> For those used to a classic wooden back scratcher, one is immediately annoyed at the hard metal fingers which seem to be lacerating your back.</li>
            <li> Not actually very useful for scratching ones back.</li>
            <li> So it does work minimally for emergencies when there&#x27;s nothing else around which</li>
            <li> They are littlerally the size of a Bic pen when closed.  </li>
            <li> The metal tube on one of my units bent/broke after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Both of the back scratchers broke within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought it was because he was too rough with it...</li>
            <li> You have to use it ever so carefully.  </li>
            <li> Before these back scratchers I was forced to use rulers, combs, or anything else I could find to scratch my back.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the telescoping handle is a little less sturdy that I had expected.</li>
            <li> Probably has a few other uses such as getting into tight spots and fishing out car keys or loose change.</li>
            <li> The stick is very weak and will break at first use.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and other hand/wrist issues including carpel tunnel</li>
            <li> No more looking for a sharp corner to rub my back against to scratch.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these this past July, and they&#x27;re terrific.  </li>
            <li> product is small hardly performs well enough to scratch my back or my partner&#x27;s.    </li>
            <li> It was just a little flimsier than I expected.</li>
            <li> This would have received a 5 star if the back scratcher wasn&#x27;t so hard to fully extend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the need to press hard to get the pressure needed to relieve the itch with these back scratchers.  </li>
            <li> Little flimsy but works, just need to be a little careful</li>
            <li> it is portable and convenient.my only complaint is that the telescopin is just a little not snug.  </li>
            <li> My order arrived within less than a week from the seller.  </li>
            <li> Need to be careful of not scratching to hard in your skin.</li>
            <li> It is a 100% waste of money.  </li>
            <li> dont waste your effort on this product.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s round you can&#x27;t tell which way</li>
            <li> They also had a sticky material on them and uneven surface color.</li>
            <li> Like I said - a bit childish</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$.</li>
            <li> Giving four stars because I found the scratching head a little small.</li>
            <li> I can foresee it slipping back with enough pressure on the base.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers say theirs have broken, but mine haven&#x27;t broken yet, and at this point even if one would break, for the price I&#x27;d simply buy another pair.</li>
            <li> Its a little flimsy, not sure if it will last, but they haven&#x27;t broken yet!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the scratching hand becomes so loose that it spins around when you attempt to reach behind your back and ends up oriented the wrong way</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think it was this  small</li>
            <li> I purchased these because the picture showed ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past with the colored rubber gripper on the handle.  </li>
            <li> not sure what the pen clip is for.</li>
            <li> Small scratching surface.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty!</li>
            <li> No more using a wall edge to get that itch.</li>
            <li> but they are flimsy and extremely small.  </li>
            <li> It takes away those hard to get itches when you don&#x27;t have help.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time even bending the fingers to adjust them.</li>
            <li> I read a reviewer state you can&#x27;t press too hard otherwise</li>
            <li> the part which scratches is very small and it hard to get it where you want it</li>
            <li> The metal is quite thin and it broke apart after no more than a dozen uses.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s: Not good through clothes.</li>
            <li> Quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> Too slippery ,and  too thin.</li>
            <li> It folds up to the size of a thin pen.</li>
            <li> Sorry....</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Bad buy.</li>
            <li> Boo Hoo :-(</li>
            <li> garbage quality crap crap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product, very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Work well. Telescoping feature is really nice.  Fit in my backpack easily.  Very light weight but sturdy.  About the size of a pen collapsed.</li>
            <li> I kept finding myself at work with an itch from a tag on clothing and nothing to reach the itch will except at totally unsatisfactory pen. This was a wonderful addition to my work bag and provides instant relief!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay except while you&#x27;re scratching the scratcher keeps twisting around to the back. You have to keep stopping and turning it around. Quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> This back scratcher is pretty small and can&#x27;t compete with a full size bamboo model, but if you have shoulder problems or just can&#x27;t reach that one spot on your back that is driving you crazy, this product will allow you to get that, but not to do your whole back.  So it does work minimally for emergencies when there&#x27;s nothing else around which is the purpose of a travel item.</li>
            <li> This item is pure junk.  It is a 100% waste of money.  Do not even think about it!!  Cheap and last about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Item is awsome as a back scratcher.  It did have a defect months later &amp; I contacted the seller.  They immedatley offered a FREE replacement. Would buy from them anytime withthis policy</li>
            <li> this product was sooooooo small it really didnt work well. i was given one by a friend , and wanted to purchase more so i looked it up and found this product. it looks like the one i have in the pic, buy it is nothing at all like mine. it is a third the size.</li>
            <li> product is small hardly performs well enough to scratch my back or my partner&#x27;s.    they did however come in a package of two, so i will put them to relatively good use elsewhere.  it would be a waste of time and my own money to return them.    i will instead purchase a bamboo one.  dont waste your effort on this product.</li>
            <li> I got this back scratcher for Christmas stocking. They came in pairs but one of them did not last more then one day! The stick is very weak and will break at first use.</li>
            <li> The back scratcher does exactly the job for which it was designed.  You also get two of them, so you can give one away or use it as a stocking stuffer.  Thanks for a great item.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift.  I was very happy when it arrived with the quality and design.  My order arrived within less than a week from the seller.  I was very pleased with their service.</li>
            <li> These are awesome gifts at Christmas time. Order in advance to avoid any delays.</li>
            <li> I have one of these in every room in the house!</li>
            <li> We only received one.</li>
            <li> This is such a great simple way to have to stop scratching my boyfriends back!  He loves it!!  Since it came with two, he keeps one at home and one at work.  I use it myself.  I have arthritis and other hand/wrist issues including carpel tunnel so it hurts to bend my wrist to scratch my own back.  This is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think it was this  small</li>
            <li> This back scratcher is great for reaching areas that are harder to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband who cannot live without a back scratcher at home &amp; wanted to have 1 for travelling as well as work. These do the job just fine &amp; are nice &amp; compact.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer and thought two would be great- one for home and one for work. The recipient was so happy with them that they bought additional ones to leave in the car and other places.</li>
            <li> This item is not well made. The ends of the backscratcher came off as soon as it was used the first time. However, a little super glue and it was as good as new, or better.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, a nice purchase.</li>
            <li> They advertised this item as being 28 inches; bought two of these and the first one broke in about a week and since it was the not the length advertised and such cheap quality I still have second still in the original packaging!</li>
            <li> This would have received a 5 star if the back scratcher wasn&#x27;t so hard to fully extend. It seems durable and it&#x27;s very handy. Good buy for how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> Both of the Back Scratchers were in pieces within a month. A hunk of junk if there every was one. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> the part which scratches is very small and it hard to get it where you want it no I wouldn&#x27;t reaommend</li>
            <li> I purchased these because the picture showed ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past with the colored rubber gripper on the handle.  Well, they arrived being silver only, a lot smaller and with 2 less prongs (5 prong instead of 7) than the picture showed and they bent the first time I tried to use them. They are made so cheap and flimsy.  Beware, these do not look anything like the ones in the picture and mine went straight in the garbage.  They are littlerally the size of a Bic pen when closed.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I have had such good experiences with Amazon in the past but I guess there is a First time for everything.  Won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again.  Sorry....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bamboo back scratcher for years. The one thing I hadn&#x27;t liked about the bamboo version was that it wasn&#x27;t very effective through cloth (for example, through a shirt) so I decided to upgrade to a state of the art, compact, metal version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging, shipping, etc. were good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a miniature garden tool (rake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scratching surface is about 1/2 the size of the bamboo version I&#x27;d had. I tried using it on my back through a t-shirt.  I put some pressure on it (about the same as I would have with the bamboo version) and it buckled (bent) in the middle.  I&#x27;m glad they sent 2 since the first was the \\&quot;practice\\&quot; version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It telescopes just like any radio antennae. Since it&#x27;s round you can&#x27;t tell which way the scratching surface is pointing.  The bamboo version had a flat handle so I pretty much had a 50/50 chance of getting it right. This takes a little more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the pen clip is for. Not something I&#x27;m going to be carrying around with me in my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Lightweight and portable. Telescopes down so it can be stored in places a larger one can&#x27;t. Probably has a few other uses such as getting into tight spots and fishing out car keys or loose change. Could also use as a rake for a miniature sand or Japanese rock garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Not good through clothes. Small scratching surface.</li>
            <li> sort of works, but not that great of scratching ability</li>
            <li> These are very unique and make great gifts.  Shipping was long. Portability was a selling plus.</li>
            <li> Good luck getting this thing to tickle your itch. If you put more than 2 lbs of force on it, it&#x27;s going to bend in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice.. blunt up the scratcher end with some fancy ribbons and whatnot, and give it to a tween who wants a \\&quot;magic wand\\&quot; because it&#x27;s not really fit to be a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Nice telescoping back scratcher.  Telescope to a small easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;Long enough to reach every spot.  Little flimsy but works, just need to be a little careful</li>
            <li> Gag gift for my wife She loves it and uses it more than I thought she would price was reasonable</li>
            <li> This telescoping back scratcher is great.  It reaches anywhere and folds up to fit in a tiny drawer. It is metal, not plastic and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I gave one for Christmas and kept one for myself.  It takes away those hard to get itches when you don&#x27;t have help.</li>
            <li> Love this! Exactly what we needed. They scratch just right, and I love that is adjustable! Trying to find some where to store a normal size back scratcher is hard. I can fit this in my drawer in my nightstand or in my purse.</li>
            <li> They are awesome! Work great and so compact. Love them! Bought 4!! Delivery time was much sooner than stated. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as describes and came quickly. Liked  that there was two for such a low price. Boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> Came fine. Works fine.  Flimsiness to be determined (but it&#x27;s good that the set is of 2 vs 1, in case it decides to fall apart like its predecessor.)</li>
            <li> These back scratchers are chap and crappy and the little fingers are kind of sharp and they can hurt you if you get too vigorous with the scratching.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a set of two back scratchers and there was only one in the package .</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for the occasional back itch you can&#x27;t reach.  Great for travel.  Hard metal - very sturdy -- telescoping very smooth.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I always have an itch back.  Especially in a place I can&#x27;t reach. So these are perfect.  I luv them</li>
            <li> Love it! Really handy!!</li>
            <li> I bought two... stress makes me itchy; now I can find relief!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!  For the cost, the little scratcher is wonderful.  I have one at work, in my purse and at my bedside.</li>
            <li> The back scratchers arrived with a strong solvent odor.  They also had a sticky material on them and uneven surface color.</li>
            <li> Back scratcher snapped in half under moderate pressure on the very first use. I was fortunate resultant  jagged edge did not slice up my back!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because, unlike other users, this product is still intact after being purchased a month later. It works as it&#x27;s described. Sure, it&#x27;s a bit flimsy, but you have to take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> Does not have rubber grips as pictured. Very light weight. Seems like it could break at any moment but it is a two-pack so I have a backup ready to go just in case.</li>
            <li> I have other back scratchers that are very satisfactory and so got this 2 PACK to have one at the office and one in the gym bag.  The metal is quite thin and it broke apart after no more than a dozen uses.  So I have fixed it with electrician&#x27;s tape so it doesn&#x27;t completely telescope as it did before it broke but it&#x27;s serviceable.  Good enough for the gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay more and get a better quality product.</li>
            <li> I gave these to my son and husband.  The first thing my husband did was bent his to appear as if it was giving &amp;#34;the bird&amp;#34;.  That said, it&#x27;s become a hit around the house and work as a &#x27;prop&#x27; to communicate.  For example, to telescopically flip someone off over the cubicle wall.  Like I said - a bit childish but it&#x27;s created many laughs!  I also use one in bed to flip off the light switch on the wall.  Always nice to find a device with multiple uses.  :)</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, but takes forever to ship (ships from Hong Kong).&lt;br /&gt;Pretty nicely made and works better after a slight bending of the teeth to about a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li> This style back scratcher IS functional, but has several problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scratching end of the item is great. It scratches nicely and is firm and effective.  However, nearly every other aspect of this item is problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is too flimsy overall to be used for any vigorous scratching. The metal tube on one of my units bent/broke after only a few uses. Also, after having extended/retracted the item several times, the handle loosens up significantly and the arm progressively loses rigidity, and ultimately falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the scratching hand becomes so loose that it spins around when you attempt to reach behind your back and ends up oriented the wrong way so you cannot scratch. You have to be VERY careful when reaching behind yourself to even be able to use the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be moving back to a traditional bamboo scratcher for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Littler than I thought but sturdy and practical; I am giving them away as stocking stuffers; everyone seems to appreciate them.</li>
            <li> I would tell you how I liked this product if I would have ever gotten it.  Its been 30 days.  They did send the email for me to review it though.  How funny is that.</li>
            <li> It help me on my back</li>
            <li> Made out of tin foil it seems. Would not buy ever again. Breaks easier than a 1980&#x27;s car antennae. Bad buy.</li>
            <li> Small and conveniently fits perfect in my purse or pocket, and scratches well, love this item may but now later</li>
            <li> Great back scratchers. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> The product description did not do it justice.  The two pack of telescoping backscratchers was a great bargain and the men who received them rave about the pocket clip and telescoping attributes.  WIll be buying more as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Too slippery ,and  too thin. Need to be careful of not scratching to hard in your skin. Good size and collapsed very nicely</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t retract it from the top, or it will bend.</li>
            <li> love it, an itch u can&#x27;t scratch, this works great. Its a little flimsy, not sure if it will last, but they haven&#x27;t broken yet!</li>
            <li> loved it until it broke after a week!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a back scratcher. Nothing special. The head twists loosely as you try to use it on your back.</li>
            <li> It does the trick. No more asking the wife to scratch a little higher, a little low, to the right, to left, etc.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice concept. It folds up to the size of a thin pen. In extended mode it can reach up to your bottom. Giving four stars because I found the scratching head a little small. It could have bee wider to cover more area. Overall it is good deal for the price and convenient for travel purpose.</li>
            <li> These are so inexpensive and they arrived in a simple bubble pouch. They&#x27;re perfect for what they are. Love them.</li>
            <li> It was just a little flimsier than I expected. All in all it was well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Before these back scratchers I was forced to use rulers, combs, or anything else I could find to scratch my back. Heavy duty! I had a hard time even bending the fingers to adjust them. Sturdy, compact since they telescope, and versitile. The head screws off so you can even use it as a pointer! RDE</li>
            <li> This is a substandard product and quite different from the picture shown on Amazon website. The picture shows rubber grips while the actual product has nothing like that. The scratching prongs are not rounded off and they hurt you. I have bought a far better product at the same price from Walgreen&#x27;s in Seattle itself! Amazon should take this product off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s portable to take to work and keep on hand.  Even the cat loves this!  I will think about this to give as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> they bend easily. They suck. Do not buy these. you will not be happy at all. garbage quality crap crap</li>
            <li> I like it, but it won&#x27;t last very long.  Metal &amp;#34;scratchers&amp;#34; invariably fall off at some point.</li>
            <li> fell apart within weeks of buying.  bought 4, have 2 left.  i&#x27;m just waiting for them to break also.  do not buy these!</li>
            <li> Love it! One for work and one by the bed. I like the metal because it soothes the itching immediately.</li>
            <li> works get always have in my purse</li>
            <li> Works great!!!!! I got them for Christmas gifts for everyone.</li>
            <li> Both of the back scratchers broke within a few weeks. I gave one to my son &amp; when he told me his broke I thought it was because he was too rough with it...he&#x27;s 20 years old &amp; he kept it in his truck. Then mine broke. I then knew it was the product because I baby everything I own. I would NOT recommend this item, not even for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance and she likes it, uses it what I am not there to scratch her back.</li>
            <li> Now I have relief from the iching on my back. No more looking for a sharp corner to rub my back against to scratch.</li>
            <li> I should have read the products specs more closely  because this is much smaller than I expected.  However, it does still do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this handy little tool! Gets the job done where I can&#x27;t. Very sturdy and I love that it&#x27;s telescoping.</li>
            <li> This has all the earmarks of a great product, but it has several deadly weaknesses. (But you can fix some.) First, the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are not bent in far enough. This can be fixed with a pliers. Second, the fingers are too &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;. For those used to a classic wooden back scratcher, one is immediately annoyed at the hard metal fingers which seem to be lacerating your back. Third, the head tends to turn away from its target all too easily. I suppose you could fix this with duct tape, but then, the telescoping arm would not collapse. Fourth, that telescoping arm is not firm enough when extended. I can foresee it slipping back with enough pressure on the base. Look for a good old fashioned back scratcher made from bamboo.</li>
            <li> when extended all the way out, the pole bends and i think im going to snap it.  i bought this wooden one instead and am very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DM8M46/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i00</li>
            <li> GREAT product and a Super price. Love this item.</li>
            <li> Practical and economical. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> the things work fine for being so cheap.  My issue is it took 1 1/2 months to get to me.</li>
            <li> These extenable back scratchers are great to stuff just about anywhere.  They extend easily and are well made. Good buy for price as well!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Bother!. This is a case of you get what you pay for. Both of these broke within days of getting them.</li>
            <li> good for a good scratch, no mater when, where, or how, scratch it to the max. ahhh, ooooh, eeeerr. hah.</li>
            <li> Avoid this one.  Low quality materials.  First one out of the package broke after only two full extensions the other ones shaft bent first time it was used.  AVOID AVOID AVOID</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great these are compact and extend. They are lightweight and do the job. However, the end where the scratch part is rotates as you try to use it, which makes it difficult to use effectively.</li>
            <li> Product is incredibly poorly-made and flimsy. The stem broke within the first three hours of me opening the package, on my second time extending it to scratch my shoulder.</li>
            <li> giving these at work as an office present to my co workers,  I have one and I think they will love.  It&#x27;s not tough and strong but if you take care of it and don&#x27;t act like a brute, it&#x27;s just fine.  I&#x27;ve had mine for two years now.</li>
            <li> It worked great for couple weeks until extending it the handle came off</li>
            <li> I recently had a surgery that restricted my movements. The telescoping feature of this back scratcher proved to be a wonderful asset. I whole-heartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, but they only sent me one. I emailed them and they are sending me another one. It seems sturdy enough as long as you don&#x27;t bend it.</li>
            <li> These are awesome while they work and they do what they say they do, but both of mine fell apart in a matter of a couple months. Boo Hoo :-(</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffers.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much everyone thank me for these.</li>
            <li> I keep one in the car and in my purse. Several co workers had asked for one so they were great gifts.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are a very good buy. I especially like the portability and the pocket clip. Look, these are not the highest quality out there, but they remain a very good value.</li>
            <li> Very good price on such simple tools -- a couple months later and I still use it. Love these -- have one at work.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, and as promised.  Very good job - thank you much.</li>
            <li> Telescoping Back Scratcher, 2 PACK. Does exactly what it says it does, exactly as it expected. No more, no less.</li>
            <li> Useful and came quicker than expected. They are exactly as described in the product description. One word of advice to mothers of very young children. They do not take a lot of stress, so young children can break them easily.</li>
            <li> Works great. The only problem I have is that the telescoping handle is a little less sturdy that I had expected. If it was a little stronger It would be the perfect back scratcher</li>
            <li> Purchased as gifts, these are awesome to use as well!</li>
            <li> Bent and broke almost immediately</li>
            <li> Snapped in two within 1 week of purchase &amp; it wasn&#x27;t a lot of pressure</li>
            <li> Broke after first use. Very poorly made. CHEAP MATERIAL. Bought two and now have four pieces. A BIG JOKE.</li>
            <li> My back thanks you! Nice little back scratcher, folds down for easy storagae. My dogs love it on their backs too.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this two pack of metal telescoping back scratchers! They get the job done - reach the itch and handle it. I read a reviewer state you can&#x27;t press too hard otherwise it breaks...I don&#x27;t find the need to press hard to get the pressure needed to relieve the itch with these back scratchers.  I think they&#x27;re more effective than some of the wood ones I&#x27;ve used. One thing to note, though, I have pulled too hard on the &#x27;hand/scratcher&#x27; part a couple of times and it came off of the extending rod, but it easily goes right back on and is secure enough to not fall off.  I just need to be mindful when I&#x27;m extending the scratcher and pull the rod, not the hand. And, a set of two for $5 is a super deal!! They work for me and I recommend to anyone looking to purchase. (I love them so much - keep one in my purse, one in my nightstand and one in the common area downstairs)</li>
            <li> I keep one in my purse and one in my desk at work.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t even worth purchasing at a deep discount.  It broke by the third use.  Save yourself the headache and buy another product.</li>
            <li> Liked the telescoping aspect because it makes for easy storing, however the head tends to twist around and makes it hard to use.</li>
            <li> These are great- when they don&#x27;t retract back onto itself. It won&#x27;t always stay in the longer position and slips back down while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. I&amp;#34;m not always available when he needs a scratch, fits easily in his shirt pocket. The second one stays in his travel bag so he always has it handy,</li>
            <li> I purchased these telescoping back scratchers, and some time down the road I will order  more.  They are great gifts.  I thought the way it was manufactured was well and length also.  I rate these back scratchers on a scale of 1-5; Five is what I give because its the highest score you can get on my scale.  I always refer people looking for the same items as myself to Amazon for many things.  I like the shipping and delivery methods and they come in on time for me.</li>
            <li> Rinky dink. Don&#x27;t waste your $$.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d bought one for everyone at Christmas because everyone wanted one! Doesn&#x27;t easily collapse on itself so you can use it under parkas, sweaters, t-shirts and long underwear without it losing length. Unbeatable price  product.</li>
            <li> These are so handy to have around, instead of the old fashion wooden ones they are small and get the job done !</li>
            <li> The ones I received are metal, not bamboo, unless that refers to the fact that it telescopes? My husband uses both of his: one in the bedroom and one near his living room chair. I recommend this to any women who ends up scratching her husband&#x27;s back all the time.</li>
            <li> One of two broke during the first use. Quite fragile. Otherwise, a good product and a good price. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these this past July, and they&#x27;re terrific.  Other reviewers say theirs have broken, but mine haven&#x27;t broken yet, and at this point even if one would break, for the price I&#x27;d simply buy another pair. It&#x27;s very convenient when you have an itch you can&#x27;t reach and no one around to scratch it.</li>
            <li> Love these back scratchers. So handy. I actually bought them for my daddy, who was in a nursing home and bed ridden and only had one good arm after a stroke. He could use these to scratch his back or whatever he couldn&#x27;t reach on his own.</li>
            <li> and a great little back scratcher. It&#x27;s worth every cent I spent.  Buy several and give them to your itchy friends.</li>
            <li> Good concept, but it breaks too easily.</li>
            <li> .good product i would buy again</li>
            <li> THese are inexpensive and you get what you pay for.  I gave these out as stocking stuffer and we had/have fun w/ them.  I will not be surprised if they breat soon but at this price that ok.  .</li>
            <li> Purchased this thinking the extending ability and portability would be great.  Not so, it is the cheapest, flimsiest quality.  Once extended my 3 yr old pulled it completely out of the shaft and began bending it. Since I am not supermans mother, I have to believe it was not sturdy since he broke it so easily.  You have to use it ever so carefully.  Not built to last or withstand toddlers.</li>
            <li> Very practical and great reach.</li>
            <li> This item is a great gadget. Very reasonably priced and gets to that elusive itch. I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves it! It&#x27;s compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space and has a clip to keep in your pocket if you need it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Never again be without a extra hand to reach the itch on your back. Telescoping yet it fits perfectly into a pocket or purse so you are always ready when that itch occurs. No more using a wall edge to get that itch.</li>
            <li> cheap, breaks easy if not careful</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> I thought it will be bigger than  what it is</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as I thought the extending handles would be.</li>
            <li> It generally meets my need, although I would like it to be a bit more &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;, more like having fingernails, so I can really scratch an itchy spot.</li>
            <li> it is portable and convenient.my only complaint is that the telescopin is just a little not snug.  its not loose,  its just that the claw spins more freely than i want.</li>
            <li> Great for kids I guess but they are flimsy and extremely small.  Not actually very useful for scratching ones back.</li>
            <li> It is perfect.  (I do have to be carefull that the tip does not twist around so the smooth back is rubbing against me which has no effect).  It has been such a help and relief, enabling me to sleep better and to sit in an armchair and read, etc.  The problem (caused by showering with water that was too hot and removed the necessary oils in my skin and dried out my back) has now been resolved, but it is there already if the same thing happens--and just knowing it is handy eases tension and stress.  It was certainly well worth the totally reasonable and affordable price.  Others have asked me where I got it and stated they plan to order one now, too.</li>
            <li> While the scratcher technically works, the shaft is weak, a bit on the short side, and the head could be larger - especially for scratching large house cats.  Not bad overall.</li>
            <li> The folding design is the main reason I picked this up. It unfolds smoothly and does not take up much space. The alloy it&#x27;s made of is very smooth.  They came and work great thank you so much.  Although if you want more pressure you will need to get the wooden ones.  but thisis great for a pocket (looks like a pen clipped in your pocket) or purse.</li>
