            <li>I like the OPI removal wraps better than the Shellac wraps - with OPI</li>
            <li>the acetone works better in the warmth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then google and search for the pdf \\&quot;Shellac Step by Steps Creative Nail</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve heard too many stories of infections, etc.</li>
            <li>I love love this nail polish system.</li>

            <li>Really like the package, a good start.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to be able to do it myself now and save money and not leave the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure your cuticles are back and in GREAT shape.  </li>
            <li>Be sure your cuticles are back and in GREAT shape.  </li>
            <li>And do be sure to seal the nail ends like they say, otherwise the shell can just lift right up at the top edge.  </li>
            <li>With shellac your manicure is super shiny and lasts for 2 plus weeks!  </li>
            <li>*Remember to buy a UV light.  </li>
            <li>wish this product would have been available years ago.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy doing my oun nails.</li>
            <li>this Intro is available for all to try.  </li>
            <li>This has everything you need to do a Shellac manicure except the UV light.  </li>
            <li>like I said, it&#x27;s important to follow them to a T.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the entire kit except that one of the shellac  colors had a  cap no bristles.  </li>
            <li>Clean nails</li>
            <li>Clean nails</li>
            <li>This is specially formulated and can&#x27;t be altered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to finalize with the alcohol as otherwise they are very sticky.  </li>
            <li>Of the 4 colors of polish included, \\&quot;negligee\\&quot; and \\&quot;cream puff\\&quot; combine for a gorgeous french manicure.</li>
            <li>It came packaged very nicely and delivered faster than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>I also ordered some other colors but these are a great start.</li>
            <li>perfect nails that last and last..</li>
            <li>Not crazy about colours that came with kit,</li>
            <li>I have bought more nail colors as I&#x27;m more of a pink person.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;re only exposed to our own germs.  </li>
            <li>Even with the purchase of a UV light , I will be saving money after only 2 more manicures.</li>
            <li>My manicure looks great and while it took me a little longer the first time...</li>
            <li>My manicure looks great and while it took me a little longer the first time...</li>
            <li>Nail Babble Blogspot (see manicure under menu on right), everything except the ending polish step.  </li>
            <li>My nails are strong and I must say my nails look professional.  </li>
            <li>It is very important to follow the steps and UV times, I usually go 1 minute longer on colour and top coat.  </li>
            <li>The concept of them is great, however, they are hard to put on yourself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a little slow but am so proud of my nails because they look as good as the salon</li>
            <li>scrub fresh since you can find bigger bottles at very low prices, but this is a good kit to get you started and to give you an idea of what you need.</li>
            <li>I would suggest a more diverse nail color selection especially for a beginner.  </li>
            <li>The three things I love most:  1)  No more going to the salon.  </li>
            <li>but I believe I have several more times of use.  </li>
            <li>You will need one and I purchased the &#x27;Thermal Spa 49135 Professional UV  Gel Light</li>
            <li>Read and follow the directions exactly</li>
            <li>Doing exactly as explained...</li>
            <li>the directions exactly</li>
            <li>Doing exactly as explained...</li>
            <li>I love the nail polish colors especially the fedora.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do be sure to use lint-free pads for the last polishing step.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and looks professional now</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing other colors as they have such beautiful ones to choose from.</li>
            <li>so it looks like my natural nail tips, but I can paint the white to make it look like my tips are longer, nicely shaped, uniform, etc.  </li>
            <li>The scrubfresh and acetone evaporates after you use it the first time, even if you tighten the cap really well.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s no unhealthy digging/roughing up our nail beds first with this system.  </li>
            <li>But for less than $200, I&#x27;ve invested in the full Shellac system, all the above and lamp, and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this intro kit!  </li>
            <li>&amp; I ran out of the acetone, however that&#x27;s cheap enough to buy anywhere.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIERY</li>
            <li>This dryer does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a trial run on Shellac manicures.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a trial run on Shellac manicures.  </li>
            <li>And also gently file any snagged edges</li>
            <li>The aluminum foil and cotton round method is easier to use if you are doing your own nails, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This does include all the products necessary for a complete shellac manicure and removal, except for the *lamp* (be sure to get a 36-watt model).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested out the top or bottom coats yet because I still have some from my other purchases.</li>
            <li>But you can carefully file it smooth and apply a shiny polish to keep it sealed.  </li>
            <li>love their french manicure technique of painting half my nail with any of their whites AFTER applying the base and first color, then dipping a french manicure brush in the alcohol and just paint the white away into a perfect smile line instead of applying a thick line of white polish side-to-side in a ridge, hopefully in a perfect curved line.  </li>
            <li>All other products are more than enough for several more except the alcohol and scrub will be the next</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the same colors at a local salon and they were fine</li>
            <li>This system really does shine, it stiffens my nails and allows them to grow without peeling and snapping off like they do naturally and is not thick like the gel polishes, so it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting nail polish, easy to use at home.</li>
            <li>Pretty standard kit.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that the base coat and top coat are considered part of the nail colors...but still a nice all-in-one set.</li>
            <li>Quick curing and long lasting, it saves a lot of money from having a salon manicure.</li>
            <li>I love to polish my nails, but traditional polish only lasts a few days to a week.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve had fun with applying a sheer color (their Iced Coral), then the white tip followed by a second layer of Iced Coral.  </li>
            <li>I am even testings overlaying two different colors to create a new one.  </li>
            <li>There are 2 fantastic dark shades (a pretty red and a darker raisin/burgundy shade) in the kit and 2 other colors to do a French manicure.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets for my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle, but shiny, smooth and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is very important to follow the steps and UV times, I usually go 1 minute longer on colour and top coat.  </li>
            <li> The concept of them is great, however, they are hard to put on yourself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little slow but am so proud of my nails because they look as good as the salon</li>
            <li> scrub fresh since you can find bigger bottles at very low prices, but this is a good kit to get you started and to give you an idea of what you need.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a more diverse nail color selection especially for a beginner.  </li>
            <li> The three things I love most:  1)  No more going to the salon.  </li>
            <li> but I believe I have several more times of use.  </li>
            <li> You will need one and I purchased the &#x27;Thermal Spa 49135 Professional UV  Gel Light</li>
            <li> Read and follow the directions exactly</li>
            <li> Doing exactly as explained...</li>
            <li> the directions exactly</li>
            <li> Doing exactly as explained...</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish colors especially the fedora.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be sure to use lint-free pads for the last polishing step.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and looks professional now</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing other colors as they have such beautiful ones to choose from.</li>
            <li> so it looks like my natural nail tips, but I can paint the white to make it look like my tips are longer, nicely shaped, uniform, etc.  </li>
            <li> The scrubfresh and acetone evaporates after you use it the first time, even if you tighten the cap really well.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s no unhealthy digging/roughing up our nail beds first with this system.  </li>
            <li> But for less than $200, I&#x27;ve invested in the full Shellac system, all the above and lamp, and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this intro kit!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I ran out of the acetone, however that&#x27;s cheap enough to buy anywhere.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIERY</li>
            <li> This dryer does the job very well.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a trial run on Shellac manicures.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a trial run on Shellac manicures.  </li>
            <li> And also gently file any snagged edges</li>
            <li> The aluminum foil and cotton round method is easier to use if you are doing your own nails, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This does include all the products necessary for a complete shellac manicure and removal, except for the *lamp* (be sure to get a 36-watt model).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested out the top or bottom coats yet because I still have some from my other purchases.</li>
            <li> But you can carefully file it smooth and apply a shiny polish to keep it sealed.  </li>
            <li> love their french manicure technique of painting half my nail with any of their whites AFTER applying the base and first color, then dipping a french manicure brush in the alcohol and just paint the white away into a perfect smile line instead of applying a thick line of white polish side-to-side in a ridge, hopefully in a perfect curved line.  </li>
            <li> All other products are more than enough for several more except the alcohol and scrub will be the next</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the same colors at a local salon and they were fine</li>
            <li> This system really does shine, it stiffens my nails and allows them to grow without peeling and snapping off like they do naturally and is not thick like the gel polishes, so it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting nail polish, easy to use at home.</li>
            <li> Pretty standard kit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the base coat and top coat are considered part of the nail colors...but still a nice all-in-one set.</li>
            <li> Quick curing and long lasting, it saves a lot of money from having a salon manicure.</li>
            <li> I love to polish my nails, but traditional polish only lasts a few days to a week.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve had fun with applying a sheer color (their Iced Coral), then the white tip followed by a second layer of Iced Coral.  </li>
            <li> I am even testings overlaying two different colors to create a new one.  </li>
            <li> There are 2 fantastic dark shades (a pretty red and a darker raisin/burgundy shade) in the kit and 2 other colors to do a French manicure.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets for my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but shiny, smooth and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, a dark color will make the new growth very obvious, so you&#x27;ll want to remove it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is going to save me lots of money in the long run</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t want to mess around cutting my own foil.  </li>
            <li> It was a special treat to myself but it became too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Whether this is due to the long acetone time or having the Shellac on is not clear to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it fits into my lifestyle of housecleaning, laundry, gardening, setting up/taking down banners and apparel boxes/tables for booster clubs and just overall busy/hard on my hands</li>
            <li> And, no smell/fumes at all which is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be careful having a salon manicure with this -</li>
            <li> The white shellac&#x27;s brush was stiff like it had gotten UV rays onto it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never be a fully time user of shellac based nail products due to the length of time to remove.  </li>
            <li> but I did buy other colours in additon.</li>
            <li> the other colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , you just line up the pad, wrap over your finger, take one side and crimp it over then the other side.  </li>
            <li> But do be careful around any chemicals!  </li>
            <li> I can replace the other products as I run out of them (ScrubFresh, alcohol, acetone, etc.)</li>
            <li> And the more I have my hands in water, it tends to show - small lifting/bubbles on the sides (maybe gloves aren&#x27;t a bad idea?)  </li>
            <li> The 3 liquid bottles are small in the kit but there is enough for a few manicures and you can reorder any product here at Amazon.  </li>

            <li> When placing the base coat, color and top coat ... stay off skin and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> When placing the base coat, color and top coat ... stay off skin and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only in my life ever had a manicure once - too expensive, but my regular polishes were always chipped in a day</li>
            <li> The remover wraps are way easier than trying to use cotton &amp; foil - and they stay moist so there is less evaporation and less wasted acetone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over 2 months</li>
            <li> but 2 of the polishes came what it seems old and I am unable to use them as they are way to thick.</li>
            <li> Drys in seconds and no more scuffing my manicure.  </li>
            <li> I am close on the acetone &amp; not sure if I&#x27;ll get another removal with it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is slightly disappointing is that the bottles of Alcohol, Acetone, and Scrub are very small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To extend your manicure, as your nails grow out past 10 days, you can feel the bump of the Shellac shell which bugs me (and if you pick at it, it peels off!)  </li>
            <li> shows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful in how I do my prep manicure and lotion my hands after removing the Shellac and wait a couple hours before applying new polish (that acetone is horrible for our nails!)  </li>
            <li> and women have been having horrible results if the Shellac System isn&#x27;t followed exactly.  </li>
            <li> My tips aren&#x27;t thick at all!  </li>
            <li> I can attest that cuticle remover is an absolute - my nails just looked horrible without it and all the polish starts peeling from the sides if you get any overlap onto your cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the polish remover wraps, tricky to get on and then keep on (using one hand is difficult).  </li>
            <li> so I hated them and hardly ever polished my nails.</li>
            <li> And 30 seconds for base coat.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I love love love this...  I will never go to the nail salon again.&lt;br /&gt;picture perfect nails that last and last..</li>
            <li> Love the products!  Great to get started.  I&#x27;ll never be a fully time user of shellac based nail products due to the length of time to remove.  That has no impact on the products - which are terrific.  *Remember to buy a UV light.  I bought the Royal Nails brand and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I really love the product and would give it 5 stars but 2 of the polishes came what it seems old and I am unable to use them as they are way to thick. I ended up buying the same colors at a local salon and they were fine</li>
            <li> I choose this kit to start my shellac apllications and it really works. Its perfect for beginners as a trial kit.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived as promised.  Pretty standard kit.</li>
            <li> This kit contains everything you need to do Shellac manicures at home, except for the UV lamp.  I am very happy with everything that came in the intro pack, Fedora is my new favorite color.  Once I run out, I will probably substiture store brand products for the acetone, alcohol, and scrub fresh since you can find bigger bottles at very low prices, but this is a good kit to get you started and to give you an idea of what you need.</li>
            <li> The white shellac&#x27;s brush was stiff like it had gotten UV rays onto it. The scrubfresh and acetone evaporates after you use it the first time, even if you tighten the cap really well. Everything else is good. I haven&#x27;t tested out the top or bottom coats yet because I still have some from my other purchases.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a more diverse nail color selection especially for a beginner.  I didn&#x27;t realize that the base coat and top coat are considered part of the nail colors...but still a nice all-in-one set.</li>
            <li> Got this as a starter kit and LOVE it.  Comes with directions on how to do Shellac nails.  It is very important to follow the steps and UV times, I usually go 1 minute longer on colour and top coat.  And 30 seconds for base coat.  Make sure to finalize with the alcohol as otherwise they are very sticky.  Using the finger pads to remove is way too easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome.  Not crazy about colours that came with kit, but I did buy other colours in additon.</li>
            <li> I just received my kit today and just love it! It came packaged very nicely and delivered faster than I had expected.  I used to get the shellac manicure at a nail salon.  It was a special treat to myself but it became too expensive.  I am so excited to be able to do it myself now and save money and not leave the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything you need (except the UV lamp) is included in this kit. There are 2 fantastic dark shades (a pretty red and a darker raisin/burgundy shade) in the kit and 2 other colors to do a French manicure.  I did the French, and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this product would have been available years ago.  I love to polish my nails, but traditional polish only lasts a few days to a week.  With shellac your manicure is super shiny and lasts for 2 plus weeks!  I highly recommend this intro kit!  I will be purchasing other colors as they have such beautiful ones to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love this complete nail system, it is easy and works perfect, colors are beautiful. ten stars! try it you too will love it.</li>
            <li> They give you everything in this intro pack you need.  It&#x27;s been a little over 2 months &amp; I ran out of the acetone, however that&#x27;s cheap enough to buy anywhere. I enjoy doing my oun nails.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to buy every thing you need to do shellac nails (except the uv nail dryer).I would recommend this to anyone wanting to do they&#x27;re own nails at home.</li>
            <li> This Shellac starter kit is a great way to get everything you need to do a Shellac manicure, with the exception of the light.  The only thing that is slightly disappointing is that the bottles of Alcohol, Acetone, and Scrub are very small.  Otherwise, the kit is great.  The kit also includes a book that shows all of the Shellac colors and how to apply (including drying times) and remove the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note - I will not re-purchase the soak-off wraps.  The concept of them is great, however, they are hard to put on yourself.  The aluminum foil and cotton round method is easier to use if you are doing your own nails, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Beyond expectations! Great shipper! Nothing more to be said - wonderful product and experience.  Do not have any more word to say!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. FAST DELIERY</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  10/1/13-Ladies...just want to update and let all know that I&#x27;m still using this system.  My nails are strong and I must say my nails look professional.  I LOVE the products in this kit.  My nails stay nice for 14 days, sometimes longer.  The system is now very easy to do and I&#x27;m good at it.  The three things I love most:  1)  No more going to the salon.  I have figured my investment into the method of Shellac and I&#x27;m saving money.  2)  Lasts a minimum of 14 days.  3)  Drys in seconds and no more scuffing my manicure.  These are great products and I love taking time for myself.  I am even testings overlaying two different colors to create a new one.  Again, check out the CND site for ideas.  I have no regrets for my purchase. I have added several CND polishes to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/27/13...Still love this Intro. My manicure lasted 3 wks.  I am close on the acetone &amp; not sure if I&#x27;ll get another removal with it. Remember...this is an Intro to see if you like.  All other products are more than enough for several more except the alcohol and scrub will be the next but I believe I have several more times of use.  I have bought more nail colors as I&#x27;m more of a pink person.  I bought Rose Bud and Gotcha... I have tried both &amp; love the colors.  I just bought and put on top of Gotcha tonight Mother of Pearl.  It puts glitter on top of the color.  Very nice!  I am so happy I got this product and I&#x27;m so glad this Intro is available for all to try.  I&#x27;m still a little slow but am so proud of my nails because they look as good as the salon and I am not a nail salon professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!!  I am so glad I made this investment.  This is going to save me lots of money in the long run and I will be able to do my nails at home, any time.  This has everything you need to do a Shellac manicure except the UV light.  You will need one and I purchased the &#x27;Thermal Spa 49135 Professional UV  Gel Light Dryer\\&quot;.  This dryer does the job very well.  Read and follow the directions exactly and you too can do this.  Another suggestion is viewing on You Tube, the CND how to do Shellac and CND how to remove Shellac.  Very good and to the point.  Tips:  Clean nails well.  Be sure your cuticles are back and in GREAT shape.  When placing the base coat, color and top coat ... stay off skin and cuticles.  Your manicure will last longer.  I am very impressed and even more impressed because I could do it myself.  My nail salon told me I could not purchase all the products required and I could not remove myself.  Well I had my Shellac manicure when my products came in.  I was able to remove and redo my manicure myself.  No damage to my nails.  I use the oil that comes with the kit.  It smells great.  My manicure looks great and while it took me a little longer the first time...each time gets easier to do.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a trial run on Shellac manicures.  Doing exactly as explained...anyone can do.  This also comes with instructions and a booklet of CND polish colors.  The 3 liquid bottles are small in the kit but there is enough for a few manicures and you can reorder any product here at Amazon.  Very pleased and I keep thinking about all the money I am now saving as my manicures were costing $25 +.  My manicures are lasting about 14 days and sometimes longer.

            <li> Very good bargain. It  contains all you need for beautiful a manicure. I love the nail polish colors especially the fedora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only in my life ever had a manicure once - too expensive, but my regular polishes were always chipped in a day so I hated them and hardly ever polished my nails. And acrylics seemed like a sure-fire money pit plus damaging.  But for less than $200, I&#x27;ve invested in the full Shellac system, all the above and lamp, and absolutely love it! This system really does shine, it stiffens my nails and allows them to grow without peeling and snapping off like they do naturally and is not thick like the gel polishes, so it looks natural.  (I researched and found lots of pictures and seen it on friends.)  And there&#x27;s no unhealthy digging/roughing up our nail beds first with this system.  And, no smell/fumes at all which is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be careful having a salon manicure with this - they mix manufacturers colors, etc. and women have been having horrible results if the Shellac System isn&#x27;t followed exactly.  This is specially formulated and can&#x27;t be altered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the on-line MSDS for their Scrub-Fresh and just mix my own 50-50 mix of 99% isopropyl alcohol and 100% acetone (1/2 capful each) with one drop of essential orange oil (the additional solvent they use) and follow their instructions to a T, including shaking each and every nail polish bottle for a full 30 seconds before use (need to get those solvents in their patented formula to perfectly mix or it doesn&#x27;t apply/cure correctly)  I also use rubber gloves with the tips cut off to protect my hands when drying/curing under the UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be sure to use lint-free pads for the last polishing step. But I can&#x27;t find any substitute for their Solaroil - it&#x27;s ultra-fine to absorb into their honey-combed polish shell and reach our nail beds so I just bought a big bottle to save money. Do use it daily as they say because it makes a big difference in the quality of the shell.  When I forget, it shows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very careful in how I do my prep manicure and lotion my hands after removing the Shellac and wait a couple hours before applying new polish (that acetone is horrible for our nails!)  I like the OPI removal wraps better than the Shellac wraps - with OPI, you just line up the pad, wrap over your finger, take one side and crimp it over then the other side.  And I don&#x27;t want to mess around cutting my own foil.  Never, never, never just soak your fingers in acetone!  And shame on salons if they do it!  Do keep your hands warm - I like to put my hand halfway into my rubber glove - the acetone works better in the warmth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love their french manicure technique of painting half my nail with any of their whites AFTER applying the base and first color, then dipping a french manicure brush in the alcohol and just paint the white away into a perfect smile line instead of applying a thick line of white polish side-to-side in a ridge, hopefully in a perfect curved line.  My tips aren&#x27;t thick at all!  Also, I&#x27;ve had fun with applying a sheer color (their Iced Coral), then the white tip followed by a second layer of Iced Coral.  It looks like I have on sheer polish - the white shows through but not glaringly white so it looks like my natural nail tips, but I can paint the white to make it look like my tips are longer, nicely shaped, uniform, etc.  It&#x27;s subtle, but shiny, smooth and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can just afford salon nails and don&#x27;t want to bother, I envy you. But otherwise give it a chance. Here are the instructions I use: Nail Babble Blogspot (see manicure under menu on right), everything except the ending polish step.  Then google and search for the pdf \\&quot;Shellac Step by Steps Creative Nail Design\\&quot; guide. There are lots of You Tube tutorials also, but I like the manufacturer&#x27;s directions and like I said, it&#x27;s important to follow them to a T.  I can attest that cuticle remover is an absolute - my nails just looked horrible without it and all the polish starts peeling from the sides if you get any overlap onto your cuticles.  And do be sure to seal the nail ends like they say, otherwise the shell can just lift right up at the top edge.  And also gently file any snagged edges you may get over the days so it doesn&#x27;t lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To extend your manicure, as your nails grow out past 10 days, you can feel the bump of the Shellac shell which bugs me (and if you pick at it, it peels off!)  But you can carefully file it smooth and apply a shiny polish to keep it sealed.  I like to use OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy.  Of course, a dark color will make the new growth very obvious, so you&#x27;ll want to remove it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it fits into my lifestyle of housecleaning, laundry, gardening, setting up/taking down banners and apparel boxes/tables for booster clubs and just overall busy/hard on my hands and I never wear gloves. But do be careful around any chemicals!  And the more I have my hands in water, it tends to show - small lifting/bubbles on the sides (maybe gloves aren&#x27;t a bad idea?)  But this does pay for itself in just 4-5 applications. And no, I&#x27;m not a spokesperson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find an entire system cheaper on E-Bay than here.  And I do like keeping my nails out of salons - I&#x27;ve heard too many stories of infections, etc. and it makes sense here at home we&#x27;re only exposed to our own germs.  And to be absolutely, completely honest, it does seem when I remove it, that my nails are thinner and not as strong.  Whether this is due to the long acetone time or having the Shellac on is not clear to me.  But my nails always cracked off before getting to this length, so perhaps this is how they would have been anyway.  Good luck and have fun!</li>
            <li> awesome transaction...love the product</li>
            <li> I love love this nail polish system. It goes on smoothly and looks professional now I&#x27;m hoping it will last without chipping</li>
            <li> This does include all the products necessary for a complete shellac manicure and removal, except for the *lamp* (be sure to get a 36-watt model). Of the 4 colors of polish included, \\&quot;negligee\\&quot; and \\&quot;cream puff\\&quot; combine for a gorgeous french manicure. I can replace the other products as I run out of them (ScrubFresh, alcohol, acetone, etc.) CND is the only brand of gel manicure I have used, and I find it to last longer than 2 weeks, unless I&#x27;m extra-rough on my nails (cleaning without gloves.) Quick curing and long lasting, it saves a lot of money from having a salon manicure.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the entire kit except that one of the shellac  colors had a  cap no bristles.  I have used it 4 times and it seems to be identical to the salon results.  Even with the purchase of a UV light , I will be saving money after only 2 more manicures.</li>
            <li> awesome set, everything you need (except the UV lamp) to do your own shellac nails.  Great value.  The remover wraps are way easier than trying to use cotton &amp; foil - and they stay moist so there is less evaporation and less wasted acetone.  The mini bottles will last for a good while and also will be great to refill to keep everything in one spot.  I also ordered some other colors but these are a great start.</li>
            <li> Long lasting nail polish, easy to use at home. Nice colours added in the package. Safes a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Really like the package, a good start.  I didn&#x27;t care for the polish remover wraps, tricky to get on and then keep on (using one hand is difficult).  I&#x27;m happy to do my own nails.</li>
