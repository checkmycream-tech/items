            <li>No odor, nice clean spray that has super-strength hold!</li>

            <li>Also, my hair was really static after using this product.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff even use it as a finishing spray</li>
            <li>It also has a nice, light scent.  </li>
            <li>Which is a shame because I love Kenra products.</li>
            <li>you want to be able to brush out curls</li>
            <li>tamer :)</li>
            <li>and I love how it helps keep my clients sets in longer.  </li>
            <li>You can even use this product with a shampoo and set that goes under a dryer for a better hold.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Kenra line and have used this product for two years now.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Most of the time, that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li>After a month or so, I could tell my hair was in better condition.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for love a year .  </li>
            <li>i love this thermal spray.</li>
            <li>May like the aerosol can better, though.  </li>
            <li>satisfied customer</li>
            <li>Smooths &amp; holds individual curls/straightened sections great!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love Amazon, because you can basically buy and return anything without leaving your house.</li>
            <li>tried to return it through Amazon online, and it just kept telling me something about &amp;#34;not being able to ship&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Gave my roots a nice lift and kept my hair smooth all day in spite of humidity.</li>
            <li>If you use it with your blowdryer, you won&#x27;t be able to curl it afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for setting hair when curling with hot curlers.  </li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product for extra hold (better than using mousse alone) in your curling iron and hot roller sets!!!  </li>
            <li>Try: enjoy pomade instead - to get curls to look wonderful, not frizzy, and last all day, and though you have to use a light hand with enjoy</li>
            <li>Keeps curls in place even with extreme humidity which is really impressive.</li>
            <li>Even though it costs more than grocery store brands, it is definitely worth the money since it has much better holding power.  </li>
            <li>It is a strong hold</li>
            <li>And, the hold was too strong -</li>
            <li>love this stuff - it really works great to put curl in my hair with a straight iron</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and this helps keep it in place.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that has no body.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Spray makes my fine hair hold its style</li>
            <li>As a thermal spray, it does its job perfectly and also provide a little lift.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks great all day and if I don&#x27;t wash it the next day, I can restyle with the blow drier and spray again.</li>
            <li>Each day, clean or not-clean hair, even with hairspray, the curl falls out.  </li>
            <li>and I have to clean the nozzle often.</li>
            <li>I had used Kenra products before, and I love this stuff (much better than hair spray for soft curls)</li>
            <li>I got it right away!</li>
            <li>This has worked the best for my hard to straighten hair, I&#x27;ve tried dozens.  </li>
            <li>It seems to last forever which makes it a good value in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Super firming spray and just what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Kenra Thermal Styling Spray (set #19) is great styling product;  it makes my hair set last much, much longer.</li>
            <li>In years past, I had a wonderful spray that was intended for hot rollers -</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with it providing a good hold without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my dry hair before straightening, and it seems to work good.</li>
            <li>My hair:  fine, extremely straight.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s well worth trying this product if you have any of the issues I described.</li>
            <li>Helps curl the hair wonderfully and keep it shiny if you want tight curls, or spray very carefully you might be able to get away with looser curls-</li>
            <li>Received right away from seller.</li>
            <li>You will find this item to really keep your hair nice and your flat iron clean.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that, like many styling sprays, the bottle will clog quickly</li>
            <li>Yeah I can spend good money on getting my hair cut and styled just to walk out of the salon and within a half hour, I have no volume.  </li>
            <li>I use hot curlers on my very straight hair and this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>*if you use a tiny bit!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can always add more if needed...</li>
            <li>This product actually makes my hair feel like it&#x27;s in better shape after heat styling than when it&#x27;s air-dried.</li>
            <li>This hair spray really works!</li>
            <li>I use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To hair from hot iron use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a blowout spray for all over volume and with hot tools.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great that it doubles as a blowout spray (in very, very small amounts and if you do your blowout properly-section by section).</li>
            <li>Some might find it a bit heavy, so i would say to use a light hand with this. :)</li>
            <li>I will not buy this product again, but I would definitely recommend it for people with hair that holds a curl easily.</li>
            <li>I even use this a a hair spray and it keeps my short fine hair in place with no issues.  </li>
            <li>If you blow dry and then just use it section by section with hot tools your hair will curl just fine.</li>
            <li>I like this product, not too sticky but holds very well.</li>
            <li>It protects my hair when using curing iron and holds very well.</li>
            <li>I find that this really works well.</li>
            <li>It really does protect against heat damage.</li>
            <li>The product really holds the hair color.  </li>
            <li>It really truly feels like I&#x27;m just putting hairspray in my hair.</li>
            <li>so we really have no humidity</li>
            <li>and thanks to PRIME</li>
            <li>but it really dries out my hair.</li>
            <li>First, make sure you completely detangle your hair before you spray this stuff on it, and blow dry one section at a time.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find it at the same price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I even went back to the spray&#x27;s original posting and noted that it did NOT say that I could not return it.</li>
            <li>The styling spray shipped super fast (even though I didn&#x27;t pay any extra to the seller).</li>
            <li>When it does fall out, the ends are very straight - no slight curve, no body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only takes a little product to achieve a good hold.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x60;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I dont style my hair much or use alot of product, a freind of mine suggested I try this with the new heat brush I purchased, still playing with it.</li>
            <li>LESS IS MORE with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal user of this Thermal Spray for several years now.  </li>
            <li>Again, less is more with this stuff I guess… The heat protection factor was my main reason for purchasing so for me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my color treated, dry, very fine, fragile hair.</li>
            <li>Great for thin hair!</li>
            <li>Normally I just use it on my bangs for when I plan to just wear the rest of my hair curly.</li>
            <li>I do love this product anyway, because I like the firm hold</li>
            <li>how does this without feeling stiff and you are still able to get a comb or brush through it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;do not like the new one,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Utah</li>
            <li>Best product for limp thin hair.</li>
            <li>Mom first got this as a sample size from the hairdresser and bought a regular sized one after.  </li>
            <li>It protects my hair while hot ironing, and it has an extra ingredient for holding your style.  </li>
            <li>That means back to hot curlers, curling irons, etc.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product, after reading many of the reviews (and all of the product information), knowing that I have had problems with hair products in the past.</li>
            <li>when you curl as it will weigh the hair down and be too greasy), it can be brushed out and allows for more play with the hair</li>
            <li>I use this after blowdrying and before I flat iron my colored, dry, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse, straight hair</li>
            <li>Protects my hair, and makes it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I spray this product directly on my damp hair and proceed with hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have used Redken Hot Sets for probably as long as it has been available--nearly 20 years</li>
            <li>I use it, then curl and it comes out soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>We will keep buying this kenra spray even though it is more expensive than many other brands.</li>
            <li>This gives it a lot more volume/fluff (she is short and blow drys her short hair with a round brush to give her an extra inch ;)).</li>
            <li>This product is for use on dry hair, and although I&#x27;ve tried it with success, I was really looking for something to use on wet hair before blow drying..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now, on both clean hair and hair that hadn&#x27;t been washed for a day.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Goldwell&#x27;s Thermal Spray, and I am switching back to that immediately.</li>
            <li>unless you want that super firm hold, then go ahead, otherwise I spray the strands I am going to curl from about a 3/4 foot away from hair</li>
            <li>I was looking for a styling spray that would hold my fine, limp, straight hair for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I love this, my hair usually loses curl by mid day, I don&#x27;t even use hair spray now and my curls stay until next wash.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and shiny and it didn&#x27;t start to wave at all</li>
            <li>Gives your hair very bouncy flexible hold, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I have used the Kenra Thermal Styling Spray for years to round brush blow dry to smooth hair that stays in place all day.</li>
            <li>probably not- leave this spray to the experts as it takes a very careful hand to use- too much</li>
            <li>With my extremely fine hair it&#x27;s tough to get any body into a hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;ll re-purchase… I have incredibly fine hair and am constantly searching for my miracle product… Something that holds, protects, and detangles without weighing my hair down.</li>

            <li> I have fine hair that has no body.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Spray makes my fine hair hold its style</li>
            <li> As a thermal spray, it does its job perfectly and also provide a little lift.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks great all day and if I don&#x27;t wash it the next day, I can restyle with the blow drier and spray again.</li>
            <li> Each day, clean or not-clean hair, even with hairspray, the curl falls out.  </li>
            <li> and I have to clean the nozzle often.</li>
            <li> I had used Kenra products before, and I love this stuff (much better than hair spray for soft curls)</li>
            <li> I got it right away!</li>
            <li> This has worked the best for my hard to straighten hair, I&#x27;ve tried dozens.  </li>
            <li> It seems to last forever which makes it a good value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Super firming spray and just what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Kenra Thermal Styling Spray (set #19) is great styling product;  it makes my hair set last much, much longer.</li>
            <li> In years past, I had a wonderful spray that was intended for hot rollers -</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with it providing a good hold without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my dry hair before straightening, and it seems to work good.</li>
            <li> My hair:  fine, extremely straight.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s well worth trying this product if you have any of the issues I described.</li>
            <li> Helps curl the hair wonderfully and keep it shiny if you want tight curls, or spray very carefully you might be able to get away with looser curls-</li>
            <li> Received right away from seller.</li>
            <li> You will find this item to really keep your hair nice and your flat iron clean.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that, like many styling sprays, the bottle will clog quickly</li>
            <li> Yeah I can spend good money on getting my hair cut and styled just to walk out of the salon and within a half hour, I have no volume.  </li>
            <li> I use hot curlers on my very straight hair and this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> *if you use a tiny bit!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can always add more if needed...</li>
            <li> This product actually makes my hair feel like it&#x27;s in better shape after heat styling than when it&#x27;s air-dried.</li>
            <li> This hair spray really works!</li>
            <li> I use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To hair from hot iron use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a blowout spray for all over volume and with hot tools.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great that it doubles as a blowout spray (in very, very small amounts and if you do your blowout properly-section by section).</li>
            <li> Some might find it a bit heavy, so i would say to use a light hand with this. :)</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again, but I would definitely recommend it for people with hair that holds a curl easily.</li>
            <li> I even use this a a hair spray and it keeps my short fine hair in place with no issues.  </li>
            <li> If you blow dry and then just use it section by section with hot tools your hair will curl just fine.</li>
            <li> I like this product, not too sticky but holds very well.</li>
            <li> It protects my hair when using curing iron and holds very well.</li>
            <li> I find that this really works well.</li>
            <li> It really does protect against heat damage.</li>
            <li> The product really holds the hair color.  </li>
            <li> It really truly feels like I&#x27;m just putting hairspray in my hair.</li>
            <li> so we really have no humidity</li>
            <li> and thanks to PRIME</li>
            <li> but it really dries out my hair.</li>
            <li> First, make sure you completely detangle your hair before you spray this stuff on it, and blow dry one section at a time.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find it at the same price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I even went back to the spray&#x27;s original posting and noted that it did NOT say that I could not return it.</li>
            <li> The styling spray shipped super fast (even though I didn&#x27;t pay any extra to the seller).</li>
            <li> When it does fall out, the ends are very straight - no slight curve, no body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes a little product to achieve a good hold.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x60;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I dont style my hair much or use alot of product, a freind of mine suggested I try this with the new heat brush I purchased, still playing with it.</li>
            <li> LESS IS MORE with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user of this Thermal Spray for several years now.  </li>
            <li> Again, less is more with this stuff I guess… The heat protection factor was my main reason for purchasing so for me</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my color treated, dry, very fine, fragile hair.</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair!</li>
            <li> Normally I just use it on my bangs for when I plan to just wear the rest of my hair curly.</li>
            <li> I do love this product anyway, because I like the firm hold</li>
            <li> how does this without feeling stiff and you are still able to get a comb or brush through it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;do not like the new one,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Utah</li>
            <li> Best product for limp thin hair.</li>
            <li> Mom first got this as a sample size from the hairdresser and bought a regular sized one after.  </li>
            <li> It protects my hair while hot ironing, and it has an extra ingredient for holding your style.  </li>
            <li> That means back to hot curlers, curling irons, etc.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product, after reading many of the reviews (and all of the product information), knowing that I have had problems with hair products in the past.</li>
            <li> when you curl as it will weigh the hair down and be too greasy), it can be brushed out and allows for more play with the hair</li>
            <li> I use this after blowdrying and before I flat iron my colored, dry, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, straight hair</li>
            <li> Protects my hair, and makes it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I spray this product directly on my damp hair and proceed with hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have used Redken Hot Sets for probably as long as it has been available--nearly 20 years</li>
            <li> I use it, then curl and it comes out soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> We will keep buying this kenra spray even though it is more expensive than many other brands.</li>
            <li> This gives it a lot more volume/fluff (she is short and blow drys her short hair with a round brush to give her an extra inch ;)).</li>
            <li> This product is for use on dry hair, and although I&#x27;ve tried it with success, I was really looking for something to use on wet hair before blow drying..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now, on both clean hair and hair that hadn&#x27;t been washed for a day.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Goldwell&#x27;s Thermal Spray, and I am switching back to that immediately.</li>
            <li> unless you want that super firm hold, then go ahead, otherwise I spray the strands I am going to curl from about a 3/4 foot away from hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for a styling spray that would hold my fine, limp, straight hair for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I love this, my hair usually loses curl by mid day, I don&#x27;t even use hair spray now and my curls stay until next wash.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft and shiny and it didn&#x27;t start to wave at all</li>
            <li> Gives your hair very bouncy flexible hold, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have used the Kenra Thermal Styling Spray for years to round brush blow dry to smooth hair that stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> probably not- leave this spray to the experts as it takes a very careful hand to use- too much</li>
            <li> With my extremely fine hair it&#x27;s tough to get any body into a hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll re-purchase… I have incredibly fine hair and am constantly searching for my miracle product… Something that holds, protects, and detangles without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> (very small amount on each section of hair like a dimes worth...</li>
            <li> My hair will stay styled without going flat.  </li>
            <li> but my hair always goes flat within an hour.  </li>
            <li> I definitely could not live without this item.  </li>
            <li> This product helped my hair hold curls for a little longer than usual, but by 4 hours my hair was only curled under at the ends and all my pretty waves were gone.  </li>
            <li> The bottle also lasts a really long time before running out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to target the spray only to hair, so some is for sure going to get on your hands (and neck).  </li>
            <li> Prevents dry damaged hair ends and styling lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> And I think I&#x27;ve tried just about every hair product to tame my hair and this is the only one that actually works (if you combine it with a flat iron).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more difficult to use on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I spray on my hair after I blow it dry</li>
            <li> OR you can read the directions and \\&quot;spray-as-you-go\\&quot; so it doesnt dry and lake your hair unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Use it in conjunction with the blow dry spray.</li>
            <li> so if your looking for loose hold this may not be the product for</li>
            <li> I apply this when my hair is wet, then I blow dry it and style it.  </li>
            <li> however, I will say it seems to dry my hair a bit and does not seem to protect from the heat damage the way other sprays so.  </li>
            <li> This is not really it, but I will use it until I find another.  </li>
            <li> The Tresseme spray does not even begin to compare and leaves her hair flat and limp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely sticky on my hands.  </li>
            <li> that being said I will still use this item kenra thermal styling spray for tight curls, but for even slightly loose curls, or waves,</li>
            <li> If you wash, blow dry and style your hair everyday, then this is the hair spray for you.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of spraying it all over before straightening, and then it kinda dried before i got to it, so it was harder to straighten.</li>
            <li> I just get my hair in the round brush, put a little spray at the roots for lift and the ends for styling, and blow dry.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, this did not weigh down my hair or make it feel crunchy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> Any Walgreens or Beauty Supply Store down your street will let you return it, so give them your money instead</li>
            <li> I tried adding some as a finishing spray and it seemed to just weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It does provide a firm hold compared to other heat sprays which is what I like about it...</li>
            <li> did not like this product, made my hair sticky and not full at all.</li>
            <li> The results are shiny hair with a little hold to boot.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t comb through the curl, it will hold a little longer, but if I comb through with fingers or comb, the hold reduces by about 60-70%.</li>
            <li> I was completely destroying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Use everyday and helps style my hair.</li>
            <li> - at least they offer to give you your money back if you are not satisfied!</li>
            <li> It seems stiff upon spraying, but it does not stay stiff.  </li>
            <li> Before getting this product, I&#x27;d been using Dove Flexible Hold hairspray before setting, and that seems to work better (without the horrible hand feeling).  </li>
            <li> This product does not leave your hair feeling soft at all....makes it very difficult to style after spraying.  </li>
            <li> helps hold the shape but is not sticky&lt;br /&gt;and hard to comb out.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> When they changed their formula (for the worst)</li>
            <li> This spray is NASTY!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great! I spray on my hair after I blow it dry and it sure helps keep my hair style. My hair is fine and this helps keep it in place.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a thermal protection spray to use when I straighten my hair. This product actually does that AND works as \\&quot;hairspray\\&quot; to hold your style. It even smells like the aerosol stuff. I made the mistake of spraying it all over before straightening, and then it kinda dried before i got to it, so it was harder to straighten. Also, my hair was really static after using this product. Normally I just use it on my bangs for when I plan to just wear the rest of my hair curly. OR you can read the directions and \\&quot;spray-as-you-go\\&quot; so it doesnt dry and lake your hair unmanageable. I use it maily for it&#x27;s thermal protecting abilities, because I&#x27;m not a fan of hair spray for hold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I like the product or not because I haven&#x27;t gotten it yet and it has taken almost a MONTH to get .I know I like Kendra products but I will never order it off Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I use hot curlers on my very straight hair and this&lt;br /&gt;product helps hold the shape but is not sticky&lt;br /&gt;and hard to comb out. I had used onesta curl for years&lt;br /&gt;and they have stopped making that product and&lt;br /&gt;do not like the new one,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;glad to find this</li>
            <li> Love it.  Super firming spray and just what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I use this after blowdrying and before I flat iron my colored, dry, fine hair.  Somehow it gives body AND shine to my hair, it seems a lot thicker than before using it.  My hair also \\&quot;moves\\&quot; differently, like those girls in hair commercials.  I LOVE this product.  My husband commented on how great my hair looked, as well.  This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years...it is the only styling spray that holds and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Mom first got this as a sample size from the hairdresser and bought a regular sized one after.  In an attempt to save money, after that bottle ran out, she bought the popular Tresseme hair spray on Amazon.  The Tresseme spray does not even begin to compare and leaves her hair flat and limp. This gives it a lot more volume/fluff (she is short and blow drys her short hair with a round brush to give her an extra inch ;)). We will keep buying this kenra spray even though it is more expensive than many other brands.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff even use it as a finishing spray</li>
            <li> I like this product, not too sticky but holds very well. It seems to last forever which makes it a good value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Kenra Thermal Styling Spray (set #19) is great styling product;  it makes my hair set last much, much longer.</li>
            <li> I am so happy one of my friends gave me a bottle of this to try.  I was completely destroying my hair.  This spray has helped me heal my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this.  This is the greatest product if you straighten your hair.  Not only does it protect your hair, but it keeps the curl out until you wash your hair.  It some how does this without feeling stiff and you are still able to get a comb or brush through it.  A must if you straighten your hair.  I almost never rave about a product, but this stuff it great!  And I think I&#x27;ve tried just about every hair product to tame my hair and this is the only one that actually works (if you combine it with a flat iron).</li>
            <li> This product is for use on dry hair, and although I&#x27;ve tried it with success, I was really looking for something to use on wet hair before blow drying.. my mistake. It&#x27;s a little more difficult to use on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, straight hair so I&#x27;m always looking for a heat protector that will help hold curls in my hair for longer than an hour.  This product helped my hair hold curls for a little longer than usual, but by 4 hours my hair was only curled under at the ends and all my pretty waves were gone.  On the plus side, this did not weigh down my hair or make it feel crunchy or sticky.  It also has a nice, light scent.  I will not buy this product again, but I would definitely recommend it for people with hair that holds a curl easily.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave your hair feeling soft at all....makes it very difficult to style after spraying.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product.  Which is a shame because I love Kenra products.</li>
            <li> I definitely could not live without this item.  It protects my hair while hot ironing, and it has an extra ingredient for holding your style.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Too sticky in my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great for use with blow dryer and curling iron. Takes out frizz, and it honestly holds style until I wash it out. In my book, it&#x27;s the best thermal product there is!</li>
            <li> Spray this product on hair sections, it sizzles which doesn&#x27;t harm your hair, curl hair &amp; it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Helps curl the hair wonderfully and keep it shiny if you want tight curls, or spray very carefully you might be able to get away with looser curls- YOU CANNOT SPRAY THIS TOO CLOSE TO THE HAIR OR IT WILL GET CRUNCHY-unless you want that super firm hold, then go ahead, otherwise I spray the strands I am going to curl from about a 3/4 foot away from hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want to be able to brush out curls it is damaging to the hair and makes hair frizzy- i recommend washing the hair after using this-BEFORE brushing it out- or you will break your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said I will still use this item kenra thermal styling spray for tight curls, but for even slightly loose curls, or waves, probably not- leave this spray to the experts as it takes a very careful hand to use- too much and you will ruin your hair style/damage your hair&lt;br /&gt;*******AS AN ALTERNATIVE: Try: enjoy pomade instead - to get curls to look wonderful, not frizzy, and last all day, and though you have to use a light hand with enjoy (very small amount on each section of hair like a dimes worth...when you curl as it will weigh the hair down and be too greasy), it can be brushed out and allows for more play with the hair ***if you use a tiny bit!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can always add more if needed...its also great as a frizz/fly away tamer :) I replaced all my curl enhancing products with this one</li>
            <li> I dont style my hair much or use alot of product, a freind of mine suggested I try this with the new heat brush I purchased, still playing with it.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product for extra hold (better than using mousse alone) in your curling iron and hot roller sets!!!  I just started using this product in my beauty shop and I love how it helps keep my clients sets in longer.  You can even use this product with a shampoo and set that goes under a dryer for a better hold.  You can buy this product in a refill bottle, too!</li>
            <li> My hair:  fine, extremely straight.  I&#x27;d worn it short for years, but recently started letting it grow.  That means back to hot curlers, curling irons, etc.  In years past, I had a wonderful spray that was intended for hot rollers - I can&#x27;t find it, and can&#x27;t even remember the name anymore (it was about 20 years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So . . . I was looking for a styling spray that would hold my fine, limp, straight hair for a few hours.  After reading reviews, this styling spray seemed to meet all my qualifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now, on both clean hair and hair that hadn&#x27;t been washed for a day.  Observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s extremely sticky on my hands.  It&#x27;s impossible to target the spray only to hair, so some is for sure going to get on your hands (and neck).  I want to get up mid-set to wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It doesn&#x27;t hold like I&#x27;d like it to.  Each day, clean or not-clean hair, even with hairspray, the curl falls out.  Before getting this product, I&#x27;d been using Dove Flexible Hold hairspray before setting, and that seems to work better (without the horrible hand feeling).  When it does fall out, the ends are very straight - no slight curve, no body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be ordering again.  The search continues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my color treated, dry, very fine, fragile hair. This product actually makes my hair feel like it&#x27;s in better shape after heat styling than when it&#x27;s air-dried. For the price, it&#x27;s well worth trying this product if you have any of the issues I described. I love it.</li>
            <li> This hair spray really works! Even though it costs more than grocery store brands, it is definitely worth the money since it has much better holding power.  The bottle also lasts a really long time before running out.</li>
            <li> I love the Kenra line and have used this product for two years now. I have tried others but this one seems to work the best for my thinning, color treated hair. It protects my hair when using curing iron and holds very well. I would recommend this product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that, like many styling sprays, the bottle will clog quickly and I have to clean the nozzle often. Not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I love this, my hair usually loses curl by mid day, I don&#x27;t even use hair spray now and my curls stay until next wash.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that has no body.  This spray keeps it from damage from the curling iron.  My hair will stay styled without going flat.  I love it</li>
            <li> did not like this product, made my hair sticky and not full at all. wouldnt buy this again and wouldnt recommend it</li>
            <li> I tested three products from Amazon, looking for something to replace what I used to use for &amp;#34;spot styling&amp;#34; with my curling iron.  This does the job.  Not too sticky.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I apply this when my hair is wet, then I blow dry it and style it.  I have been pleased with it providing a good hold without being too stiff.  It only takes a little product to achieve a good hold.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for curl hair and straigtening it</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Creates a barrier between your hair and the heat used to style.  The results are shiny hair with a little hold to boot.</li>
            <li> I find that this really works well. Protects my hair, and makes it soft and shiny. Especially when i curl my hair. Some might find it a bit heavy, so i would say to use a light hand with this. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome thermal styling spray. Works great!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x60;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but when I use this product, I have the fullness needed for my hair style.  I spray this product directly on my damp hair and proceed with hair dryer.  Most of the time, that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken Hot Sets for probably as long as it has been available--nearly 20 years I think?  When they changed their formula (for the worst) I had to find an alternative.  This is not really it, but I will use it until I find another.  If I don&#x27;t comb through the curl, it will hold a little longer, but if I comb through with fingers or comb, the hold reduces by about 60-70%.</li>
            <li> If you wash, blow dry and style your hair everyday, then this is the hair spray for you.  After a month or so, I could tell my hair was in better condition.  It really does protect against heat damage.</li>
            <li> Prevents dry damaged hair ends and styling lasts for a long time.  Gives your hair plenty of body and I do not have to use any hair spray!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for love a year .  It is the best hair product I have ever bought. It holds the style all day no matter the weather.  It is a strong hold so if your looking for loose hold this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;  I use to purchase this at the salon I was excited to find it at the same price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> i love this thermal spray. It is not sticky at all like the others I have used and I&#x27;ve tried them all. I even use this a a hair spray and it keeps my short fine hair in place with no issues.  If I could give it 10 stars I would. Give it a try..........you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Continue to order, great product!</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user of this Thermal Spray for several years now.  One of the must have styling products for me.  It does provide a firm hold compared to other heat sprays which is what I like about it... however, I will say it seems to dry my hair a bit and does not seem to protect from the heat damage the way other sprays so.  I do love this product anyway, because I like the firm hold</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair! Keeps curls in place even with extreme humidity which is really impressive.</li>
            <li> The best hair stylist I ever had turned me on to this excellent product.  I won&#x27;t be with out it . . . especially for this price!</li>
            <li> Very good product to care for color treated hair.  The product really holds the hair color.  As a thermal spray, it does its job perfectly and also provide a little lift.  My hair is in great shape.</li>
            <li> Like this product.  It&#x27;s good for setting hair when curling with hot curlers.  May like the aerosol can better, though.  Received right away from seller.</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it says, but it was leaking when i received it and the pump stopd working too soon.</li>
            <li> The styling spray shipped super fast (even though I didn&#x27;t pay any extra to the seller). I had used Kenra products before, and I love this stuff (much better than hair spray for soft curls)</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I use hot rollers.  This sprays on sticky.  When I take the rollers out, my hair is stuck together and remains brittle all day.  The curls do not stay.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> satisfied customer one of the bottles did leak some out.</li>
            <li> This spray is NASTY! It really truly feels like I&#x27;m just putting hairspray in my hair. It smells like hairspray (gross), it feels sticky like hairspray, and it makes my hair clump together. I normally use Goldwell&#x27;s Thermal Spray, and I am switching back to that immediately.</li>
            <li> I used this on my dry hair before straightening, and it seems to work good. Left my hair soft and shiny and it didn&#x27;t start to wave at all</li>
            <li> Smooths &amp; holds individual curls/straightened sections great!</li>
            <li> Wife seemed to like it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !  I use this when I want to hold my curls - or if i need some volume at the crown when blow drying.</li>
            <li> Best product for limp thin hair.</li>
            <li> This product does hold style when using a curling iron but I felt it took away some of the shine and softness of my hair..it brushes out but  if you use it again without washing your hair it does cause build up..</li>
            <li> love this stuff - it really works great to put curl in my hair with a straight iron</li>
            <li> This is the only hair spray I will use.... Have been using it for about 8 years now!  No odor, nice clean spray that has super-strength hold!</li>
            <li> I went to visit my sister in NC and she had Kenra products for me to use in her bathroom.  Oh my gosh and I am hooked.  I live in Utah so we really have no humidity but my hair always goes flat within an hour.  Yeah I can spend good money on getting my hair cut and styled just to walk out of the salon and within a half hour, I have no volume.  Well, this hairspray works and my hair stays full and beautiful all day.  and thanks to PRIME I got it right away!</li>
            <li> I like this hair product.  Great hold.  It gives protection&lt;br /&gt;To hair from hot iron use.  This product holds&lt;br /&gt;As advertised.</li>
            <li> You will find this item to really keep your hair nice and your flat iron clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This spray is a great thermal spray protects the hair and has a good soft hold. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Use everyday and helps style my hair. I love it</li>
            <li> The best volume product I have used.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair and it has a lot of body, but it is frizzy if it just air dries. I have used the Kenra Thermal Styling Spray for years to round brush blow dry to smooth hair that stays in place all day. I just get my hair in the round brush, put a little spray at the roots for lift and the ends for styling, and blow dry. My hair looks great all day and if I don&#x27;t wash it the next day, I can restyle with the blow drier and spray again. It isn&#x27;t so sticky that you can&#x27;t brush through it and it doesn&#x27;t flake when you brush it out either. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> Great holding ability</li>
            <li> Spray makes my fine hair hold its style but it really dries out my hair.</li>
            <li> For styling, this is a great product.  It seems stiff upon spraying, but it does not stay stiff.  I use it, then curl and it comes out soft and manageable.  I can run my fingers thru hair with no problem but it still retains style.  Use it in conjunction with the blow dry spray.</li>
            <li> Holds your style perfect</li>
            <li> I love Amazon, because you can basically buy and return anything without leaving your house. Not here, though. I bought this product, after reading many of the reviews (and all of the product information), knowing that I have had problems with hair products in the past. If I spend $$ on a product and it does not do as it says in the Product Description, I return it.&lt;br /&gt;This spray came in time, and what most customers said was that is smelled good, which it does. But, so does my hair and my shampoo. I would NOT spend $17 on a bottle of &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; hair!&lt;br /&gt;When I used it as directed with my curling iron, it made my ends incredibly frizzy. And, the hold was too strong - the frizz would NOT come out!&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it through Amazon online, and it just kept telling me something about &amp;#34;not being able to ship&amp;#34; hazardous products. No one called to confirm or explain and I did not receive a follow-up email, as stated would happen when I tried to return the product - three times. I even went back to the spray&#x27;s original posting and noted that it did NOT say that I could not return it. I felt deceived! I will NEVER buy hair products from this company again! Any Walgreens or Beauty Supply Store down your street will let you return it, so give them your money instead - at least they offer to give you your money back if you are not satisfied!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a blowout spray for all over volume and with hot tools. First, make sure you completely detangle your hair before you spray this stuff on it, and blow dry one section at a time. LESS IS MORE with this stuff. Gave my roots a nice lift and kept my hair smooth all day in spite of humidity. If you use it with your blowdryer, you won&#x27;t be able to curl it afterwards. If you blow dry and then just use it section by section with hot tools your hair will curl just fine. Gives your hair very bouncy flexible hold, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I tried adding some as a finishing spray and it seemed to just weigh my hair down. Again, less is more with this stuff I guess… The heat protection factor was my main reason for purchasing so for me it&#x27;s great that it doubles as a blowout spray (in very, very small amounts and if you do your blowout properly-section by section). Not sure if I&#x27;ll re-purchase… I have incredibly fine hair and am constantly searching for my miracle product… Something that holds, protects, and detangles without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> This has worked the best for my hard to straighten hair, I&#x27;ve tried dozens.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> With my extremely fine hair it&#x27;s tough to get any body into a hairstyle.  Kenra Thermal Styling spray is the only product I have ever found that gives me some fullness and style.  It&#x27;s the best product for my hair that I have ever found!</li>
