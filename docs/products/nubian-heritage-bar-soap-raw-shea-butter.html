            <li>I absolutely LOVE Nubian Heritage&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, clean soap, and</li>
            <li>This soap is very, very gentle, and it smells good, too.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is perfect for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>So absolutely use a good moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>I had a slight billing problem and Amazon provided excellent customer service that satisfied the problem.</li>
            <li>Best soap for dry skin!!!</li>
            <li>In any case, I really love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, sulfate free, paraben free...</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and smells great, fresh and sexy scent.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my face and leaves my face smooth</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin and leaves your skin smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Raw Shea is the best for your skin.  </li>
            <li>So Fresh ad So Clean!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, first off.</li>
            <li>When I use my exfoliating clarifying lotion after washing my face, the cotton balls come away clean...</li>
            <li>When I wash, I leave the lather on for about five minutes or until I&#x27;m ready to take my shower so that all the nourishing, moisturising and healing oils can work their magic.</li>
            <li>a true testament to the power of cleanse.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size after taking it out of the box (its a nice size).</li>
            <li>This soap is hands down the most perfect daily soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>would buy this soap again, and the seller delivered my soap quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used this soap mainly over the winter months it isn&#x27;t all that chocalaty but smells rich and makes leaves you skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>Please use all natural products stop putting cancer causing stuff in or on your body.. PLEASE!!!!!</li>
            <li>This soap was nice the frankenscense and murr will have you wanting to smell the soap constantly after i showered</li>
            <li>(Coconut and Papaya is my personal favorite), but I really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>but some may consider it more masculine smelling.</li>
            <li>I enjoy feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It is made with high quality natural ingredients and leaves my skin soft and clean with a nice light scent that goes well with the coconut oil that I use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But after seeing all these positive reviews I couldn&#x27;t help myself!</li>
            <li>I can, although at $2.99 per soap, it can get pricey depending on how many you get, but since this soap looks like its gonna last at least a month; getting say 3 at one time should be good; I shower once a day, some people depending on their job/activities may have more usage than me.</li>
            <li>My skin feel smooth and soft after washing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve tried almost every readily available product.</li>
            <li>but I felt the soap didn&#x27;t smell exactly like the Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li>and Myrrh was not the first soap I tried</li>
            <li>I personally think that a man or woman could use this bar (because you know how some scents seem to be \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; than others, more for men?)</li>
            <li>Very nice soap -  does not leave soap scum like some soaps do.  </li>
            <li>If you have mostly problem free but dry, sensitive skin like me, try this soap!</li>
            <li>Once I get out the shower and dry off, I no longer smell it (which is fine with me; but it leaves your skin clean).</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft as other Shea Butter soaps.</li>
            <li>Seems expensive, but it&#x27;s super dense, good quality!</li>
            <li>I already have an excellent natural black soap with shea butter that I ordered here from Amazon that I only use for my face.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful (without being artificially perfumed) and leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and does not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong, which I like and is something left to the imagination.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this soap and</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>I think it really is what it says it is.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really moisturizing and gentle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>It removes make up very neatly.</li>
            <li>We all need to get back to basics and use natural products instead of paraben filled soaps!</li>
            <li>I tell you one thing it smells better than the other \\&quot;Shea</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my face while using my electric facial brush</li>
            <li>We found this soap in a small shop in Colorado on vacation and both my wife and I really liked this soap.  </li>
            <li>This is the greatest soap ever because I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, it is the dead of January, and I&#x27;ve hardly needed to use my hand moisturizers at all.  </li>
            <li>I also love Nubian Heritage Black Soap.</li>
            <li>I like black &amp; carrot soaps better ...</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the bar is a decent size and lasts a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap renders down fairly quick, a weeks worth at a shower a day.</li>
            <li>Many brands have natural ingredients, in addition to sodium lauryl sulfate, or DMDM hydantoin, or other things</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to soaps and face washes (so sensitive that I have to use hypoallergenic makeup), so I was looking for a more organic product that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to break out in rashes, leave me with painfully dry skin, or cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>Shea butter properties have significantly improved dry, chaffing and cracking skins.  </li>
            <li>that clean feeling sticks with you a long time, as well as the scent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably only recommend this product to men who are okay with smelling like whatever this scent is all day long.</li>
            <li>I bruise so easily, and can expect even the most minor of bruises to last for weeks on end, more serious ones will last for months!</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my skin looks fresh and dewy, and it&#x27;s the softest and clearest it has ever been.</li>
            <li>There is not much more to it other than it does lather very nice.</li>
            <li>Most kinds of soaps that come at the B.S. are small and overpriced.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, prone to eruptions, so I am able to use very few face cleansing products.</li>
            <li>Since using the soap, my skin is softer, brighter and overall much healthier.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and all the time people say I look 40..  </li>
            <li>so it lasts forever, 100% natural</li>
            <li>Makes you feel soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Bought this soap for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, there are no granules in this bar that may cause irritation, like oatmeal or whatnot.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a natural body soap for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>Infused with a special essential&lt;br /&gt;oil blend of Frankincense, Myrrh, Cardamom, Ginger, and Black Pepper.  </li>
            <li>All natural &#x3D; not super sudsy, which is totally cool with me.</li>
            <li>It not only moisturises but heals the skin of any existing issues and prevents new ones from surfacing!</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed instantly after using the first time was that my face brightened and the tiny lines on the forehead became visibly smoother!</li>
            <li>I was honestly curious about the Bible stories that included frankincense and myrrh, which is why I tried it, haha.</li>
            <li>What good is a soap when you&#x27;re afraid of leaving the house after using it?</li>
            <li>Nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to mild bar soaps.</li>
            <li>As a result of being able to use such a small amount it should last a really long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received several compliments on how soft and glowing my skin is however it is unfortnate that i can find it locally or</li>
            <li>So when I was shopping for a new bar of bathroom hand soap at my local mom and pop natural food market, I thought I would give this a try, because it was one of the few bar soaps on the shelf that was truly 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>but i like african raw black soap better .</li>
            <li>I feel like this soap leaves a film on my skin and didn&#x27;t do anything to help with my sensitive, dry skin.  </li>

            <li> I will buy more of it.  </li>
            <li> I really love this soap.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Nubian Heritage&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, clean soap, and</li>
            <li> This soap is very, very gentle, and it smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is perfect for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> So absolutely use a good moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> I had a slight billing problem and Amazon provided excellent customer service that satisfied the problem.</li>
            <li> Best soap for dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> In any case, I really love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, sulfate free, paraben free...</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and smells great, fresh and sexy scent.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my face and leaves my face smooth</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin and leaves your skin smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Raw Shea is the best for your skin.  </li>
            <li> So Fresh ad So Clean!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, first off.</li>
            <li> When I use my exfoliating clarifying lotion after washing my face, the cotton balls come away clean...</li>
            <li> When I wash, I leave the lather on for about five minutes or until I&#x27;m ready to take my shower so that all the nourishing, moisturising and healing oils can work their magic.</li>
            <li> a true testament to the power of cleanse.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size after taking it out of the box (its a nice size).</li>
            <li> This soap is hands down the most perfect daily soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> would buy this soap again, and the seller delivered my soap quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap mainly over the winter months it isn&#x27;t all that chocalaty but smells rich and makes leaves you skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> Please use all natural products stop putting cancer causing stuff in or on your body.. PLEASE!!!!!</li>
            <li> This soap was nice the frankenscense and murr will have you wanting to smell the soap constantly after i showered</li>
            <li> (Coconut and Papaya is my personal favorite), but I really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> but some may consider it more masculine smelling.</li>
            <li> I enjoy feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It is made with high quality natural ingredients and leaves my skin soft and clean with a nice light scent that goes well with the coconut oil that I use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But after seeing all these positive reviews I couldn&#x27;t help myself!</li>
            <li> I can, although at $2.99 per soap, it can get pricey depending on how many you get, but since this soap looks like its gonna last at least a month; getting say 3 at one time should be good; I shower once a day, some people depending on their job/activities may have more usage than me.</li>
            <li> My skin feel smooth and soft after washing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve tried almost every readily available product.</li>
            <li> but I felt the soap didn&#x27;t smell exactly like the Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> and Myrrh was not the first soap I tried</li>
            <li> I personally think that a man or woman could use this bar (because you know how some scents seem to be \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; than others, more for men?)</li>
            <li> Very nice soap -  does not leave soap scum like some soaps do.  </li>
            <li> If you have mostly problem free but dry, sensitive skin like me, try this soap!</li>
            <li> Once I get out the shower and dry off, I no longer smell it (which is fine with me; but it leaves your skin clean).</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft as other Shea Butter soaps.</li>
            <li> Seems expensive, but it&#x27;s super dense, good quality!</li>
            <li> I already have an excellent natural black soap with shea butter that I ordered here from Amazon that I only use for my face.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful (without being artificially perfumed) and leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and does not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t strong, which I like and is something left to the imagination.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this soap and</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> I think it really is what it says it is.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really moisturizing and gentle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> It removes make up very neatly.</li>
            <li> We all need to get back to basics and use natural products instead of paraben filled soaps!</li>
            <li> I tell you one thing it smells better than the other \\&quot;Shea</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my face while using my electric facial brush</li>
            <li> We found this soap in a small shop in Colorado on vacation and both my wife and I really liked this soap.  </li>
            <li> This is the greatest soap ever because I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, it is the dead of January, and I&#x27;ve hardly needed to use my hand moisturizers at all.  </li>
            <li> I also love Nubian Heritage Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I like black &amp; carrot soaps better ...</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the bar is a decent size and lasts a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap renders down fairly quick, a weeks worth at a shower a day.</li>
            <li> Many brands have natural ingredients, in addition to sodium lauryl sulfate, or DMDM hydantoin, or other things</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to soaps and face washes (so sensitive that I have to use hypoallergenic makeup), so I was looking for a more organic product that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to break out in rashes, leave me with painfully dry skin, or cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Shea butter properties have significantly improved dry, chaffing and cracking skins.  </li>
            <li> that clean feeling sticks with you a long time, as well as the scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably only recommend this product to men who are okay with smelling like whatever this scent is all day long.</li>
            <li> I bruise so easily, and can expect even the most minor of bruises to last for weeks on end, more serious ones will last for months!</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my skin looks fresh and dewy, and it&#x27;s the softest and clearest it has ever been.</li>
            <li> There is not much more to it other than it does lather very nice.</li>
            <li> Most kinds of soaps that come at the B.S. are small and overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, prone to eruptions, so I am able to use very few face cleansing products.</li>
            <li> Since using the soap, my skin is softer, brighter and overall much healthier.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and all the time people say I look 40..  </li>
            <li> so it lasts forever, 100% natural</li>
            <li> Makes you feel soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Bought this soap for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, there are no granules in this bar that may cause irritation, like oatmeal or whatnot.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural body soap for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> Infused with a special essential&lt;br /&gt;oil blend of Frankincense, Myrrh, Cardamom, Ginger, and Black Pepper.  </li>
            <li> All natural &#x3D; not super sudsy, which is totally cool with me.</li>
            <li> It not only moisturises but heals the skin of any existing issues and prevents new ones from surfacing!</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed instantly after using the first time was that my face brightened and the tiny lines on the forehead became visibly smoother!</li>
            <li> I was honestly curious about the Bible stories that included frankincense and myrrh, which is why I tried it, haha.</li>
            <li> What good is a soap when you&#x27;re afraid of leaving the house after using it?</li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to mild bar soaps.</li>
            <li> As a result of being able to use such a small amount it should last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received several compliments on how soft and glowing my skin is however it is unfortnate that i can find it locally or</li>
            <li> So when I was shopping for a new bar of bathroom hand soap at my local mom and pop natural food market, I thought I would give this a try, because it was one of the few bar soaps on the shelf that was truly 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> but i like african raw black soap better .</li>
            <li> I feel like this soap leaves a film on my skin and didn&#x27;t do anything to help with my sensitive, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is positively radiant since I&#x27;ve been using raw shea butter soap.</li>
            <li> African black soap is high in glyernic than this soap.</li>
            <li> I love raw shea butter, and it can be hard to find too.  </li>
            <li> I still choose african raw soap because it is 100% real directly from Ghana</li>
            <li> 100% natural soap and body products are hard to find, even at the natural foods store.  </li>
            <li> Definitely helps my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I could smell it on me all day long.</li>
            <li> Lasted long.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, then I don&#x27;t recommend this because it can be harsh being that it cleans literally the dead skin off and leaves a dry soft feel to it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product especially if you have skin issues and want less chemicals in your soap.</li>
            <li> Wish the bar was a little big bigger though since I also use for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I know other regular soap has done this before to me, like Caress, I believe.</li>
            <li> Supermarket stores dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Needs to be stored in a dry place because it tends to melt if stored in a puddle of water.</li>
            <li> and I notice it clears the black marks on my face though it is not long i am using this soap.</li>
            <li> and I still have the same bar I bought it to get ride of dark marks on my face</li>
            <li> This soap cut the healing time in half, I don&#x27;t have to fret anymore when I wear shorts simply because of how well this soap works.    </li>
            <li> Through you may have to carefully keep African raw soap closed because of glernic and it doesn&#x27;t have scent as pleasent like that soap.</li>
            <li> I still had to lather on lotion once I bathed, just like with other body soaps and washes.  </li>
            <li> well due to the fact that I can not put on lotion and my skin doesn&#x27;t itch (say I&#x27;m in a rush somewhere).</li>
            <li> I think I have &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; skin (caucasian, male, late 20&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> This is another product that i wish that price would come down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a good or a bad thing, but it feels weird.</li>
            <li> I work in a warehouse, so I&#x27;m constantly either burning up or freezing, and that takes a serious toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super drying and</li>
            <li> Butter\\&quot; soap that is offered in this line, the one in the black package, I believe.</li>
            <li> I was using neutrogena bars to treat my acne and scarring 4 over a year with little to no progress.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase the Raw Shea Butter soap at first, because I was afraid the frankincense &amp; myrrh would make me smell like an apothecary.</li>
            <li> It cleans and moisturizes as well as (if not better than) expensive, high end department store soaps.</li>
            <li> The soap label boasts that the soap contains Raw Shea Butter, Vitamin E, Soy Milk, and Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> Usually I have itchy skin after getting out the shower, and must put on lotion.</li>
            <li> And no more itchiness.</li>
            <li> The soap is hard milled and holds up well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, and I appreciate this product jut because is natural.</li>
            <li> I also noticed soap scum in my tub</li>
            <li> The soap was didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but the smell wasn&#x27;t to my liking unfortunately.</li>
            <li> So, I will say I&#x27;m mildly disappointed and will be looking for another product when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The soap was didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but the smell wasn&#x27;t to my liking unfortunately. The smell was a dealbreaker because it strong, kind of manly smelling(I&#x27;m a girl) and it made me self-conscious after using it.What good is a soap when you&#x27;re afraid of leaving the house after using it? I could smell it on me all day long. I&#x27;d probably only recommend this product to men who are okay with smelling like whatever this scent is all day long.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, first off. It isn&#x27;t overpowering nor understated, just perfect for me.     I work in a warehouse, so I&#x27;m constantly either burning up or freezing, and that takes a serious toll on my skin. My thighs are also covered in bruises from pulling boxes off of a conveyor belt, and believe it or not, this soap literally eliminated the time it used to take them to heal.    I bruise so easily, and can expect even the most minor of bruises to last for weeks on end, more serious ones will last for months! This soap cut the healing time in half, I don&#x27;t have to fret anymore when I wear shorts simply because of how well this soap works.    Since using the soap, my skin is softer, brighter and overall much healthier. It cleanses and removes dirt without over drying, and moisturizes without leaving you feeling greasy. It&#x27;s a dream to shave with, I don&#x27;t even need lotion anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years. I&#x27;ve received several compliments on how soft and glowing my skin is however it is unfortnate that i can find it locally or that now the price as gone lup per 5oz bar of soap. This is another product that i wish that price would come down</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Makes my skin feel so good. Not greasy and no residue left on my body. Does geat for all skin types and colors. Was shipped in a timely manner and very easy to communicate with the wonderful people that I got it from. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> 100% natural soap and body products are hard to find, even at the natural foods store.  Many brands have natural ingredients, in addition to sodium lauryl sulfate, or DMDM hydantoin, or other things I&#x27;d prefer not to have.  So when I was shopping for a new bar of bathroom hand soap at my local mom and pop natural food market, I thought I would give this a try, because it was one of the few bar soaps on the shelf that was truly 100% natural.  I love raw shea butter, and it can be hard to find too.  A lot of shea butter products use refined shea.      But enough about all that.  This is the greatest soap ever because I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, it is the dead of January, and I&#x27;ve hardly needed to use my hand moisturizers at all.  I&#x27;ve even started using it to wash my face.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, prone to eruptions, so I am able to use very few face cleansing products. Well, this soap is a miracle worker. It not only moisturises but heals the skin of any existing issues and prevents new ones from surfacing! When I wash, I leave the lather on for about five minutes or until I&#x27;m ready to take my shower so that all the nourishing, moisturising and healing oils can work their magic. One thing I noticed instantly after using the first time was that my face brightened and the tiny lines on the forehead became visibly smoother! So I&#x27;m  definitely going to keep using and you should too!</li>
            <li> A+ transaction. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and all the time people say I look 40..  I had a man come to my door and say to me last month &amp;#34; I talked to your dad last week about the truck he has for sale Is he home now?.&amp;#34;  I laughed and said yes my husband is home..  Please use all natural products stop putting cancer causing stuff in or on your body.. PLEASE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was using neutrogena bars to treat my acne and scarring 4 over a year with little to no progress. Ive been using the Nubian Heritage shea butter soap for 2 1/2 months and my skin looks flawlessly rediant!! Everyone noticed the difference this soap is amazing. It smells good, it has a great lather, moisturizing, its huge so it lasts forever, 100% natural and it has an eraser like property that has my skin looking youthfully beautiful!!! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> A great soap. Lathers very well. As a result of being able to use such a small amount it should last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap mainly over the winter months it isn&#x27;t all that chocalaty but smells rich and makes leaves you skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this soap! I use it to clean my face while using my electric facial brush and I&#x27;m so happy with my results. This soap gives the perfect balance with moisture, toning and smoothing. The smell is amazing too! This is a must have!</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to soaps and face washes (so sensitive that I have to use hypoallergenic makeup), so I was looking for a more organic product that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to break out in rashes, leave me with painfully dry skin, or cause me to break out. This is the perfect facial soap! It smells wonderful (without being artificially perfumed) and leaves my skin soft and clean. When I use my exfoliating clarifying lotion after washing my face, the cotton balls come away clean... a true testament to the power of cleanse. My skin is positively radiant since I&#x27;ve been using raw shea butter soap. My pores are smaller, my skin looks fresh and dewy, and it&#x27;s the softest and clearest it has ever been. I think that it may have also helped to even out my skin tone a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another soap on my face now that I have found this product! If you have mostly problem free but dry, sensitive skin like me, try this soap! It cleans and moisturizes as well as (if not better than) expensive, high end department store soaps.</li>
            <li> Great lather, great smell! I&#x27;m going to be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous!  Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> One star for the natural ingredients; one star for the awesome smell.  I feel like this soap leaves a film on my skin and didn&#x27;t do anything to help with my sensitive, dry skin.  I still had to lather on lotion once I bathed, just like with other body soaps and washes.  I also noticed soap scum in my tub was quicker to build up with this soap than others.  I wish the company would make a perfume or body spray with the smell of this soap.  I&#x27;d buy the scent in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> We found this soap in a small shop in Colorado on vacation and both my wife and I really liked this soap.  It is smooth and does not dry your skin.  Add a great smell and this is just a wonderful soap.  We bought more for ourselves and for gifts.</li>
            <li> This is good soap.  Supermarket stores dry my skin out.  I think I have &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; skin (caucasian, male, late 20&#x27;s).  My skin looks and feels moist and much better after using this.  The smell is a bit stronger than I would prefer, but it smells nice.  I also love Nubian Heritage Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you will love this soap, it also is good on your skin. It leaves your skin soft and smells great, fresh and sexy scent.</li>
            <li> Now, this is for me.  I really, really like this soap and the price and shipping was just excellent.</li>
            <li> Best soap for dry skin!!! Been using it for years! And the body lotion is great!</li>
            <li> Makes you feel soft and supple.  Cleans you too. Has a nice fragrance and not to over bearing.  I enjoy feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. Lasted long. Never got mushy and my skin never was drive from it. Will buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is very good, but I have since started using the nubian heritage body wash and hope to always have it on hand My husband and I both love it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for my face. I do it before my vitamin c cream. It&#x27;s not super drying and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps my extremely dry skin.  Shea butter is perfect for dry skin.  I would recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this soap for my sensitive skin.  Worked great - planning to buy more.  Wish the bar was a little big bigger though since I also use for my skin.  Raw Shea is the best for your skin.  We all need to get back to basics and use natural products instead of paraben filled soaps!</li>
            <li> So Fresh ad So Clean!</li>
            <li> The soap label boasts that the soap contains Raw Shea Butter, Vitamin E, Soy Milk, and Cocoa Butter. Infused with a special essential&lt;br /&gt;oil blend of Frankincense, Myrrh, Cardamom, Ginger, and Black Pepper.  The soap is hard milled and holds up well. It has a pleasant fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft as other Shea Butter soaps. So, I will say I&#x27;m mildly disappointed and will be looking for another product when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> I think it really is what it says it is.....lol...lasts forever, too! Seems expensive, but it&#x27;s super dense, good quality!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. All natural ingredients and it smells absolutely delicious. Needs to be stored in a dry place because it tends to melt if stored in a puddle of water.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase the Raw Shea Butter soap at first, because I was afraid the frankincense &amp; myrrh would make me smell like an apothecary. But after seeing all these positive reviews I couldn&#x27;t help myself! I am so happy I went for it: the smell is beautiful, fresh yet sensual, but not heavy at all! It&#x27;s really moisturizing and gentle. All natural &#x3D; not super sudsy, which is totally cool with me. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it is a great natrual soap but i like african raw black soap better . it has more moisturing than this soap. African black soap is high in glyernic than this soap. Through you may have to carefully keep African raw soap closed because of glernic and it doesn&#x27;t have scent as pleasent like that soap. I still choose african raw soap because it is 100% real directly from Ghana made with shea and cocoa.</li>
            <li> If I made soap myself, this is what it would be like!</li>
            <li> This soap was nice the frankenscense and murr will have you wanting to smell the soap constantly after i showered i could still smell it in the bathroom for a while</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local beauty supply for $2.99. I was surprised at the size after taking it out of the box (its a nice size). Most kinds of soaps that come at the B.S. are small and overpriced. The smell isn&#x27;t strong, which I like and is something left to the imagination. Once I get out the shower and dry off, I no longer smell it (which is fine with me; but it leaves your skin clean). I tell you one thing it smells better than the other \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; soap that is offered in this line, the one in the black package, I believe. That stuff stunk! Anyways, it leaves a \\&quot;film\\&quot; over my skin, I notice once I wash it off in the shower....I don&#x27;t know if this is a good or a bad thing, but it feels weird. I know other regular soap has done this before to me, like Caress, I believe. Anyhow, I believe this moisturizes well due to the fact that I can not put on lotion and my skin doesn&#x27;t itch (say I&#x27;m in a rush somewhere). Usually I have itchy skin after getting out the shower, and must put on lotion. I can go a day or so with doing that but after that, I MUST put lotion on. Using this soap, I dont have that problem. Im going to stock up next time I can, although at $2.99 per soap, it can get pricey depending on how many you get, but since this soap looks like its gonna last at least a month; getting say 3 at one time should be good; I shower once a day, some people depending on their job/activities may have more usage than me.</li>
            <li> My skin feel smooth and soft after washing. I also use this soap to wash my hair. It works wonderfully, smells great, and I will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li> I constantly purchase the Frankincense  and Myrrh.  Turned to the internet because many beauty supply stores do not sell this sent.</li>
            <li> My shipment arrived quickly and in perfect shape. This soap is very, very gentle, and it smells good, too. I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve tried almost every readily available product. This soap is hands down the most perfect daily soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Shea butter properties have significantly improved dry, chaffing and cracking skins.  This product does improve skin texture and resilience.  The soap renders down fairly quick, a weeks worth at a shower a day.</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is wonderful. It feels great on my face. It does not include chemicals and i would recommend it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> It dryes my skin and it melts very easy. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, and I appreciate this product jut because is natural. But, not for my skin, definitelly!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes the spin-off. And no more itchiness.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap and now I am going to try it as well.</li>
            <li> The soap is ok. Nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to mild bar soaps. I guess it&#x27;s nice to try out if you are into bar soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and the way it makes me smell after a shower, this was a good buy for me, as I need to drive across town to buy it from the store ,,</li>
            <li> Tried this brand of soap and found it to be everything they claimed it would be.. Great for sensitive skin and leaves your skin smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a chocolate smelling soap and after paying 3 times the cost of the soap to have it shipped I was sorely disappointed. There is not much more to it other than it does lather very nice.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase, it smells so lovely and the price was just as lovely. I will recommend this item and seller to others and I will be purchasing from Nubian Heritage again; as a matter of fact I am going to the it and order more soap now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and I like the smell!</li>
            <li> Great smell, great lather, I love it...</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and will be ordering more soon. Has awesome ingredients to soothe and heal . I would definitely recommend this product especially if you have skin issues and want less chemicals in your soap.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that good .. I like black &amp; carrot soaps better ... I think it depends on the type of your skin ... What surprise me that we are using a lot of myrrh in my country .. But this one has no effect on me</li>
            <li> This soap is great. If you have sensitive skin, then I don&#x27;t recommend this because it can be harsh being that it cleans literally the dead skin off and leaves a dry soft feel to it. So absolutely use a good moisturizer after. It also helps with body odor in all areas.</li>
            <li> I like is.It cleanses my face and leaves my face smooth and I notice it clears the black marks on my face though it is not long i am using this soap.It removes make up very neatly.</li>
            <li> I love this sent but I felt the soap didn&#x27;t smell exactly like the Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Left skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this soap.  This soap smells wonderful.  I will buy more of it.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap in October 2014 and it is now March 2015 and I still have the same bar I bought it to get ride of dark marks on my face and it has lightened them a lot still have a ways to go but Definitely a improvement I will order again once this bar is done</li>
            <li> Very nice soap -  does not leave soap scum like some soaps do.  Seems like it might have a bit of vanilla scent to it, which I don&#x27;t like, otherwise it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> Only bar soap I use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell and the feeling left on my skin, not drying.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap. It works well and keeps my skin and hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this soap again, and the seller delivered my soap quickly.</li>
            <li> The bar of soap is healing to my body. It&#x27;s moisture is great for my lichens and I will continue to use this soap. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My husband is the one that convinced me to switch from soaps that use sulfates, and this is the soap brand he introduced me to! Am I ever thankful! I absolutely LOVE Nubian Heritage&#x27;s products. I&#x27;ve never felt a film on my skin after showering, they moisturize well, my acne prone skin looks better, and they smell magnificent. Not to mention, the bar is a decent size and lasts a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense and Myrrh was not the first soap I tried (Coconut and Papaya is my personal favorite), but I really enjoy the smell. I was honestly curious about the Bible stories that included frankincense and myrrh, which is why I tried it, haha. It&#x27;s a nice, clean soap, and that clean feeling sticks with you a long time, as well as the scent! If you have sensitive skin, there are no granules in this bar that may cause irritation, like oatmeal or whatnot. I personally think that a man or woman could use this bar (because you know how some scents seem to be \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; than others, more for men?) but some may consider it more masculine smelling. In any case, I really love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, sulfate free, paraben free...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...if you&#x27;re looking for a great soap that you&#x27;ll want to use again and again, try this out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural body soap for quite some time now. I already have an excellent natural black soap with shea butter that I ordered here from Amazon that I only use for my face. I saw/smelled this Nubian heritage soap in Walmart and I always said that I would buy it but for some reason I never did and the store doesn&#x27;t keep it in stock. This is an excellent soap! It is made with high quality natural ingredients and leaves my skin soft and clean with a nice light scent that goes well with the coconut oil that I use as a moisturizer. The frankincense and myrrh scent is a nice, sexy \\&quot;grown people\\&quot; scent that makes me feel like a queen. I am going to order the multi pack next. ***I had a slight billing problem and Amazon provided excellent customer service that satisfied the problem. The Amazon representative was very courteous and the matter was handled fairly and expeditiously.*** *I am LC from NC*</li>
