            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with the outcome</li>

            <li>absolutely amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Really, the best one out there for the 55+ gang.</li>
            <li>C products are an excellent choice for older skin.</li>
            <li>Great product at the best price I could find after shopping with other companies.</li>
            <li>This product is supposed to be a very light &#x27;buttery&#x27; color.  </li>
            <li>that is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and would not know what to do without it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for over 20 years and love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now 67 and my skin is better than many 45 year olds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more then 20 years, love it...</li>
            <li>It worked fantastic and I really liked it</li>
            <li>Believe me, if this was better,</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, tried Clinique, Estee Lauder, Strevictin, and wasn&#x27;t pleased with any of them  </li>
            <li>I intentionally delayed writing my review just to be sure I can attest to the products&#x27; effectivity.</li>
            <li>I normally love this product, and was introduced to it by my esthetician.  </li>
            <li>Luckily,  it seems effective.  </li>
            <li>I have used Cellex-C advanced serum for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>but this one really a difference in my skin (for the good).  </li>
            <li>so smooth &amp; fine wrinkles are disappearing.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy &amp; light weight.  </li>
            <li>I can buy C at the drugstore that has a more of a tingle thanks Jennifer</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get instant gratification, but you&#x27;ll see excellent results in the form of better skin texture after a few weeks with consistent use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 20 years, it helps so much with skin tone, and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>This brand is an old favorite.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try, but no cigar, on this one.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase from this Amazon supplier as it always arrives clear and authentic.</li>
            <li>It stays fresh.</li>
            <li>The combination of the two products are a good night skin cream.. be careful as Vit C products can stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li>I would not trust buying this online; find a reputable skin care professional in your area.</li>
            <li>However, this Advanced serum doesn&#x60;t seem to be as effective as it&#x60;s counterpart, so I&#x60;m going back to my old faithful!!  </li>
            <li>have used other products in the Cellex-C line, under eye and moisturizer, and they are all good.</li>
            <li>I am used to the bottle but new users should beware, it does tip and spill easily.</li>
            <li>or I think through Canada to get the most recently produced bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cellex-C high potency serum for years and years, so I knew what to expect from this line...which was a lot!!  </li>
            <li>Pores look much smaller and complexion improved (much more glow)</li>
            <li>Run as fast as you can from this product!</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering from Amazon, they completely blew away the competition on pricing, the expiration date is 2015, so far completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Cost was high but results were worth it.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks skin tone is enhanced, clarity and I Love it!</li>
            <li>I will send the opened one back with Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.</li>
            <li>I transfer my weekly supply into a tiny travel glass container with dropper lid and keep the rest in the original container in the refrigerator and in it&#x27;s shipping box.</li>
            <li>but there might be other products which can provide better results when it comes to face firming.</li>
            <li>The actual product is superior to other vit c serums in my opinion!</li>
            <li>(it wasn&#x27;t really clear anymore which it should be), probably better to buy directly from the company outside the U.S.</li>
            <li>When I contacted Amazon about this, they said no problem and mailed me a new one, but it was also expired!</li>
            <li>I have less spots and wrinkles than most people I know.  </li>
            <li>I really love this serum; I&#x27;ve tried many (some expensive too)</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly to anyone.  </li>
            <li>is sending me a new bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old and have used this product for a number of years.  </li>
            <li>This product is old.  </li>
            <li>I requested it to be replaced and the replacement was old as well.  </li>
            <li>I realized how much it did when I ran out on vacation, and I saw a big difference in my skin from the lack of it!  </li>
            <li>I purchased through the internet from several different sites, each offering a 20% discount at different times, one sent me an expired product (make sure you check expiration date) had to send it back 3 times, prompted me to see if Amazon offered it.  </li>
            <li>So ready for something different now that I&#x27;m in  my 60&#x27;s , so went with this product.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been about three weeks</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not entirely sure mine really arrived 100% fresh</li>
            <li>I will say though it was pretty much the only one I could find that isn&#x27;t loaded with preservatives and other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>However the produce I actually received is the Cellex-C High Potency Serum, NOT Advanced-C.  </li>
            <li>People frequently compliment my skin and such compliments are a testimony to this product.  </li>
            <li>My article also has a link to other beauty products that really work - I use them all and Paula Begoun blesses them on her list too.</li>
            <li>Just be aware, the first time you use it you may experience a little tingling, but that goes away after a few days use.</li>

            <li> it is expensive to buy, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the low toxicity rating on the EWG website.  </li>
            <li> This product turned a putrid yellow color before it was half way used.  </li>
            <li> Really does work if use other recommended product like hydration complex with it!</li>
            <li> I used it, I noticed the color of the solution was unusually dark and upon applying it, the serum had crystals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was dark gold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other serum, none have worked!  </li>
            <li> When I tried to make a complaint via Amazon to have a new, up to date, serum sent to me to replace this clearly outdated one, there was no place in which to write this request or get customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Hydra 5 B Complex companion product - Check out how I found self-acceptance at a med spa and didn&#x27;t spend a dime - [...]/.</li>
            <li> The other high dollar crap you buy at department stores don&#x27;t hold a candle to this stuff.</li>
            <li> but the price is just too expensive as it does go bad so quickly.</li>
            <li> She sorts out the frauds from the effectives and has saved me a fortune that I might otherwise have spent on useless products.</li>
            <li> and I feel it is helping to slowly correct years of sun damage as a child.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to apply and once you do your skin feels dry and has an unpleasant film.  </li>
            <li> In writing to Cellex-C, they say that on undesignated seller sites like Amazon, there is a lot of fake packaging of said product, and that this must be the case with the Cellex-C product that  I received through their seller.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not notice until after the packaging had been thrown away so I am stuck with the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This brand is an old favorite. I have been using this product for many years and would not know what to do without it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy anything without consulting Paula Begoun&#x27;s Beautipedia web site. She sorts out the frauds from the effectives and has saved me a fortune that I might otherwise have spent on useless products. Use Cellex-C each morning under your makeup, but before your sunscreen. You won&#x27;t get instant gratification, but you&#x27;ll see excellent results in the form of better skin texture after a few weeks with consistent use. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Hydra 5 B Complex companion product - Check out how I found self-acceptance at a med spa and didn&#x27;t spend a dime - [...]/. My article also has a link to other beauty products that really work - I use them all and Paula Begoun blesses them on her list too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years after learning about it from my plastic surgeon&#x27;s Spa Office.  It has delayed wrinkles for years.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old and have used this product for a number of years.  People frequently compliment my skin and such compliments are a testimony to this product.  Cellex-C greatly assists with fine lines and wrinkles as well as preventing breakouts.  Yes, even at my age I still have those occasionally.  Cellex-C is the only serum/treatment product I use.  I apply this product each morning after cleansing and then follow with a Murad age-defense moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Super great product! Really does work if use other recommended product like hydration complex with it!</li>
            <li> Really a great product and I do see a difference immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for over 20 years and love it!&lt;br /&gt;The serum sent also had a stamped expiration date 2011.&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, I noticed the color of the solution was unusually dark and upon applying it, the serum had crystals.&lt;br /&gt;I then checked the expiration which was stamped 1/2014. There was a lighter stamp 2011.&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon and the company is sending me a new bottle whereupon I will send the opened one back with Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.</li>
            <li> I started using Cellex C about 10 years ago when I noticed my post-menopausal skin starting to sag. I am now 67 and my skin is better than many 45 year olds. I would never bewithout my Cellex C.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other serum, none have worked!  Cellex-C Advance is the best!  I have skin melasna &amp; acne, this serum stops the acne &amp; erases my brown spots.  It is non greasy &amp; light weight.  it is expensive to buy, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Really, the best one out there for the 55+ gang. I use it every night. Have used others but keep coming back to this one.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but nothing works as well at Cellex C</li>
            <li> I have used Cellex-C advanced serum for more than 10 years. It became a sort of personalized item for me.</li>
            <li> Great product at the best price I could find after shopping with other companies.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s too deluded I can buy C at the drugstore that has a more of a tingle thanks Jennifer</li>
            <li> This product is old.  This product is supposed to be a very light &#x27;buttery&#x27; color.  This was dark gold.  I requested it to be replaced and the replacement was old as well.  I will not re0order.</li>

            <li> It worked fantastic and I really liked it but the price is just too expensive as it does go bad so quickly. And I&#x27;m not entirely sure mine really arrived 100% fresh (it wasn&#x27;t really clear anymore which it should be), probably better to buy directly from the company outside the U.S. or I think through Canada to get the most recently produced bottles. I will say though it was pretty much the only one I could find that isn&#x27;t loaded with preservatives and other harmful ingredients. The actual product is superior to other vit c serums in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cellex-C high potency serum for years and years, so I knew what to expect from this line...which was a lot!!  However, this Advanced serum doesn&#x60;t seem to be as effective as it&#x60;s counterpart, so I&#x60;m going back to my old faithful!!  It was worth a try, but no cigar, on this one.  Believe me, if this was better, I&#x60;d share this info in a heartbeat, but it just isn&#x60;t....sorry!!</li>
            <li> I really love this serum; I&#x27;ve tried many (some expensive too) but this one really a difference in my skin (for the good).  Pores look much smaller and complexion improved (much more glow)</li>
            <li> This formula is great for all the benefits including a tightening effect. I will continue to purchase from this Amazon supplier as it always arrives clear and authentic. I transfer my weekly supply into a tiny travel glass container with dropper lid and keep the rest in the original container in the refrigerator and in it&#x27;s shipping box. It stays fresh.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to apply and once you do your skin feels dry and has an unpleasant film.  It is not moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> great price and great product!</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a Vit C based moisturizer.  The combination of the two products are a good night skin cream.. be careful as Vit C products can stain your clothes.  That&#x27;s why I use it at night</li>
            <li> I love it. It brightens up my face immediately.</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing product.  About 10 years ago my dermatologist had suggested Dr. Murad or Cellex-C and I went with Dr. Murad... loved it, but I think I became immune to it after using it for about 5 years.... Anyway, tried Clinique, Estee Lauder, Strevictin, and wasn&#x27;t pleased with any of them  So ready for something different now that I&#x27;m in  my 60&#x27;s , so went with this product.  After a few weeks skin tone is enhanced, clarity and I Love it! Can&#x27;t wait to see after 6 weeks!</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin feels so smooth &amp; fine wrinkles are disappearing. Cellex- C products are an excellent choice for older skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I believe it has kept my skin looking much younger than my age. I am used to the bottle but new users should beware, it does tip and spill easily.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for 4 months now after I purchased it. Luckily,  it seems effective.  I intentionally delayed writing my review just to be sure I can attest to the products&#x27; effectivity. I&#x27;m quite happy with the outcome but there might be other products which can provide better results when it comes to face firming.</li>
            <li> I normally love this product, and was introduced to it by my esthetician.  However, I ordered it from Amazon and it was an expired product! When I contacted Amazon about this, they said no problem and mailed me a new one, but it was also expired! I would not trust buying this online; find a reputable skin care professional in your area.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Did not notice a difference in my skin and also made me break out! Run as fast as you can from this product!</li>
            <li> Even my review came requesting that I \\&quot;review\\&quot; the item I purchased, Cellex-C Advanced-C.  However the produce I actually received is the Cellex-C High Potency Serum, NOT Advanced-C.  Unfortunately I did not notice until after the packaging had been thrown away so I am stuck with the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I m on my second bottle of this product.  I have less spots and wrinkles than most people I know.  To protect my skin, after using this product or skin renewal/peeling products like Retinal A or fruit acid, I would use physical sunblock by Alba, or Fancl.</li>
            <li> This form of Vitamin C is something I used way back in the 80&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s the best form of C I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ll definitely order it again!</li>
            <li> Have strayed away, but always seem to come back to Cellex-C.  Yes it is pricey, but it does what it claims.  The other high dollar crap you buy at department stores don&#x27;t hold a candle to this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Cellex-C, the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!  I bought this product due to the low toxicity rating on the EWG website.  I am nursing so that is very important to me.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product and I feel it is helping to slowly correct years of sun damage as a child.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been about three weeks and I see no change</li>
