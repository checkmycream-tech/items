            <li>Great Product.  </li>

            <li>work good.</li>
            <li>I bought this set of sharpening heads over a year ago, and I have really loved them.</li>
            <li>It did a good job.</li>
            <li>The disassembly and reassembly are what takes a bit of time, but it&#x27;s needed anyway to do a good job of cleaning the shaver periodically.</li>
            <li>This got a lot of good reviews, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>(finger nail works good...</li>
            <li>good way to save money and keep your razor sharpe  </li>
            <li>so it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and worked great.</li>
            <li>followed the instructions and was very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, it will save you a lot of time shaving just buy being able to sharpen the blades on your electric razor.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I promise you will LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>and I must say i was really impressed from the first time I&#x27;ve re-sharpened my blades to now.</li>
            <li>Sharpens amazingly well.</li>
            <li>-Should come with some kind of case</li>
            <li>Despite this, this product does appear to work and should be cost effective compared to replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Nice idea...</li>
            <li>nice would recommend ;;</li>
            <li>Kind of.</li>
            <li>Make your own.</li>
            <li>cost effective.</li>
            <li>and I get great clean shaves after using this.  </li>
            <li>Very Cool !</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok, but I would have liked better.</li>
            <li>It probably was not as good as it felt when brand new, BUT it was about 90% as good, or as it might have felt a month or 2 after it was brand new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then did it once more using a circular motion with the blades with very light pressure.</li>
            <li>We really weren&#x27;t sure how this would work, but it does a wonderful job and is a tremendous money saver.</li>
            <li>product will have paid for itself with one more use.  </li>
            <li>The difference in my shave is certainly better.</li>
            <li>Be sure to not drop your blades or damage the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am more convinced the kit was probably not the cause.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>and I was still getting a close comfortable shave!</li>
            <li>If it continues to work as well as today, I could up my stars one more.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied  with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Yes they do work, I have a better shave thank you</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep the blade and screen together when you remove and replace the blades after sharpening.</li>
            <li>There is probably a limit to how many times you can sharpen a given set of blades as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This should save me anywhere from $100 to $200, depending on how many times it will sharpen the blades.  </li>
            <li>Now ordering more because word has gotten around.  </li>
            <li>I will update on if it appears to get any better as time passes.</li>
            <li>So much better than spending $60 on replacement heads.</li>
            <li>and we couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I suggest that you layout the heads on the table in a triangle pattern and then place the blades in the razor in a matching sequence so you will be able to keep them paired as suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I may sharpen the blades again for a bit longer and see if it is more noticeable.</li>
            <li>My shaves are definitely better.</li>
            <li>I brushed-out and blew-out the Norelco shave after every use, but the shave deteriorated after many years (I have been using this shaver for about 7 years).</li>
            <li>Ripoff--didn&#x27;t make the head any better.</li>
            <li>One more use</li>
            <li>This really works great.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I THINK THAT I MAY HAVE TOP</li>
            <li>my electric shaver was mostly sharper when i used these heads.</li>
            <li>more closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure your razor model is listed.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love there?</li>
            <li>Do not know how many times I can continue resharping the heads I have now but saving money once surely offsets the purchase price.</li>
            <li>When I got home and opened it up I sharpened the two Norelco &amp;#34;Relfex Action&amp;#34; razors that I had for many many years.</li>
            <li>They worked great - shaved off a three day beard like a new razor!</li>
            <li>Have an electric shaver that pulls your whiskers and doesn&#x27;t get that nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It did work, but not that great, and not like having brand new blades</li>
            <li>Great product so far!</li>
            <li>After first sharpening, he was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I did get good fast shipping A+</li>
            <li>The razor is as good as new many years ago....</li>
            <li>-easy to use: pop off your head assembly, disassemble the whole head including blade retainer, blades, and blade covers, and give it all a good brushing/cleaning while your at it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed that the blades come back like-new every time I use it (once every 4 months or so).  </li>
            <li>God I hope these guys  are successful because they helped me by not having to pay an arm and a leg for new blades.</li>
            <li>These are a 1 time use and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am sure it helped to thoroughly clean the heads in the process.</li>
            <li>Were they as good as new?</li>
            <li>My razor cuts as good as when it was new.  </li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>and it should work fine.</li>
            <li>Glued into the bottom of each of these cups was a circle of fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li>While I was waiting for the Vollco Sharpening Heads to arrive in the mail, I went out to Walmart and bought a cheap $20 Remington rotary head shaver.  </li>
            <li>Either way, the seller was fantastic, so though I rate the kit 4 stars, I rate the seller 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if nothing else get the cleaner spray, As it is cheap and works.</li>
            <li>I remember my grandpa telling me about razor blade sharpeners back in the great depression.</li>
            <li>Cleaner face and faster shave and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After sharpening it shaved close and comfortable again.</li>
            <li>I used to replace my blades every year or 2 as I have a light beard.</li>
            <li>but what can you expect from free shipping</li>
            <li>This is really quite amazing.</li>
            <li>Cheap way to keep your shave comfotable.  </li>
            <li>Not all blades will fit.</li>
            <li>This product fit the bill at 1/2 cost of replacement heads.</li>
            <li>He loved his old electric razor, but it didn&#x27;t cut so well anymore.  </li>
            <li>have added a ~5min video documentation of the sharpening process for my Philips/Norelco 7110X (a very popular electric razor with the added trimmer on the back) to demoonstrate how easy and quick it is.</li>
            <li>Since one could re-sharpen few more times (probably), before the blades could not be sharpened any more, maybe it is a good buy, before buying a replacement head.</li>
            <li>Being a very fine sandpaper, it will get used up pretty quickly, so don&#x27;t sharpen the heads longer than recommended by the instructions or too often.</li>
            <li>I need the return of the original product</li>
            <li>This is allowing me to use my original Norelco razor with the blade that came with it three years ago.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t move it and without putting any significant pressure on the cutter, turn on the motor for about 5 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I have since bought another NEW set of blades and screens, and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Either way, for me the blades give a clean shave and I have the advantage to keep them sharpened at this level</li>
            <li>Quick, comfortable close shave this morning.</li>
            <li>Clean everything</li>
            <li>(Suggestions: Clean your heads first with a good water rinse; when you take out the cutters, make sure you put them back into the screens they came out of; while the screens are out, clean them with water again and look for hair, etc.</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference right away!</li>
            <li>As it turns out, it did a very good job in just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>I just used the first of my extra rotary blade set yesterday, and again got a great shave with that one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These things have paid for themselves dozens of times over, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even been using them a full year.</li>
            <li>And if I can use them with a credit from another source its better than buying them straight from the vendor.</li>
            <li>I only need to sharpen the blades using this once a year and the Norelco is as good as it was before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the end result isn&#x27;t as good as new blades, but it is very close.</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to follow as the shaver head assembly was just like mine.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think, better than new!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t smart enought to look online for part!!    </li>
            <li>This is a real money saver and worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>&quot; work as well and as quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li>they save you lots of money in the long run they arrived on time and in good condition</li>
            <li>nice and fast and decent shave.</li>
            <li>Eventually you will need to buy new blades, but with this you can get more use out of your existing ones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times this can be done but even once is cheaper than buying new blades.</li>
            <li>More than a new one in USA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple of times, and it somewhat sharpens them, but I still think I might have been better off buying a new head.</li>
            <li>No the blades don&#x27;t feel like new, but they are definitely better.</li>
            <li>Easy to use fast</li>
            <li>Sharpening procedure was easy &amp; fast.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re too cheap to buy these, many folks reported success from using the the shavers&#x27; weight and holding the bare blades against the bottom of a ceramic plate or cup and running it for a couple seconds.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this item over buying replacement blades!!!</li>
            <li>Take the top off, remove the sharpeners and put the original heads back in with the original blades.  </li>
            <li>This worked great to get my electric razor real sharp again in about 5 seconds of operation.  </li>
            <li>I really get a close smooth shave with this baby.</li>
            <li>It really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It did sharpen my year old blade and am satisfied with the shave after.     </li>
            <li>Another thing that works is the Norelco head cleaner spray, cleans and lubricates the heads for a nice drag free shave.</li>
            <li>, I was convinced this was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try.</li>
            <li>And I can continue to use my old Norelco, which I like MUCH more than the &#x27;improved&#x27; Norelco products.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money - YES.</li>
            <li>why: the razor was more than four years old and the heads had never been changed.</li>
            <li>A very simple and effective way to sharper the blades on my Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I tried some of the other &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; for sharpening the blades, but this was much easier and more effective.</li>
            <li>The sharpening process is very simple: you just remove the shaver heads like you would to clean them and drop these sharpeners in in place of the screens; you run the shaver for 3 to 5 seconds (I&#x27;d say five or a touch more) and there you go.</li>
            <li>But they can&#x27;t really restore the heads all the way to their original condition.</li>
            <li>yea right, GL</li>
            <li>Just pick the right sharpener for your shaver.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need to buy new blades some time in the future, but even saving one set is a money-saver, and saving more than that</li>
            <li>New heads cost more and give you the same shave better to save the $</li>
            <li>What came in the package was three plastic cups which fit where the screens normally go.</li>
            <li>I plan to sharpen the heads quarterly and see how long the Vollco Sharpening Heads For Select Norelco Models is effective.    </li>
            <li>These plastic discs contain a tiny circle of very fine sandpaper that didactically nothing to sharpen the blades.  </li>
            <li>There is a little triangular fitting on top of that post that holds the spider.</li>
            <li>also mentioned that your razor may not need a blade sharpener, just a good cleaning, but routine cleaning of ANY razor is both important and assumed, and blades DO get dull with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One clue that it works: before sharpening, you could hear almost every whisker as it got chopped off.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled into a very inexpensive way to extend the life of my favorite old Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>IT WORKED LIKE BRAND NEW!!!  </li>
            <li>So this is actually a great deal because you can re-sharpen the blades a number of times before having to break down and get new ones.</li>
            <li>5 seconds, then clean and reinstall as normal.</li>
            <li>Great improvement for the old-old dull razors.</li>
            <li>It really takes very little time and works great.</li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical at first, but these do work quite well.</li>
            <li>, drop the sharpeners into teh top pert of the head assembly, place the blades in, put it back together and run your shaver WITHOUT pressing it to anything for \\&quot;3-5 seconds\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Ceramic cups DO work great for sharpening kitchen knives, but i was too paranoid to use it on delicate shaver blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure someone will chime in and add that its not necessary to match cutters and screens once you use this sharpener..</li>
            <li>My husband didn&#x27;t think it worked the first time he tried again</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it should not to be so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sharpener appears to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>It was the first time it was sharpened in well over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I have had this Vollco shaver sharpening heads kit for over a month but just put it to use for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Then be sure you match the same cutter and head when when you reassemble them.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>It has been about 8 weeks since I sharpened the blades and the shaver still works well, though probably not as well as when it was first sharpened.</li>
            <li>The vendor, Total Vac, is more interested in letting the buyer know who they are than allowing you to read the instructions.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work okay, hoping to extend the life of my razor&#x27;s blades and save the expense of replacing them before absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I were using these sharpening heads at an earlier stage in the life of my blades they&#x27;d be in better shape...</li>
            <li>I got a close shave after the first useage.</li>
            <li>Blades feels like the first time I used my Norelco shaving machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They worked exactly as described, sharpening both shavers and saving me $25.00 plus.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, Amazon let us know the price had dropped by five dollars and subsequently refunded that amount to us.</li>
            <li>This product works very well !</li>
            <li>to remove; and do make sure the cutters go back into the screen they came out of.)</li>
            <li>Seems like I am always throwing out otherwise perfectly good stuff because I cannot get something minor fixed.</li>
            <li>I tried it again, tripling the recommended run time with a little better result but nowhere near as good as a new set of heads.</li>
            <li>put the new heads away in a safe place and have been re-sharpening the old ones and re-using them since then.</li>
            <li>The sharpener did not make my shaver work as new - new blades shave much faster and better.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say for certain it returned it to brand new condition, but definitely good enough to save me from buying new blades, so has already paid for itself with first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried these on my model Norelco 6940 razor that is 3 years old with original blades.  </li>
            <li>I ordered and got it quickly, and used it according to instructions and the cutters had a nice sharp edge , like new.</li>
            <li>I then used my new Remington and it was far better with a very close</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times I can sharpen it before I finally need new blades, but these are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This simple device will restore your old blades good as new.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try the Vollco sharpener heads based on the positive reviews but was sceptical.  </li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift, the recipient used the sharpening heads and evidently they accomplished the purpose intended.</li>
            <li>I could really tell the difference on the first sharpening, so</li>
            <li>Lay a sheet of 400 grit wetordry sandpaper (available at most auto parts and home centers) flat on a table, desk or workbench, gritty side up.  </li>
            <li>With 3 razors in need of new blades, this was certainly worth a try</li>
            <li>, it is easy to use and as stated above, can be used over and over again...</li>
            <li>would certainly recommend this to anyone who want to save some bucks-instead of purchasing replacement blades.</li>
            <li>It did sharpen the blades and my next shave was much better, however not as close as a new set of blades.</li>
            <li>I believe the sharpening heads are a worthwhile investment, especially when comparing their cost to the cost of new blades.</li>
            <li>it took better than 20 minutes to worry it loose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much difference it makes in how fast it cuts and how much less it pulls.</li>
            <li>A small cheap jeweler&#x27;s screw driver set&#x27;s flat blade works good.</li>
            <li>They had both become dull and were not doing a good shaving job.  </li>
            <li>Good idea, but hard to tell if it works.</li>
            <li>So this nice cheap little product has been a big money saver.</li>
            <li>I followed the simple instructions and there was a huge improvement in the performance of my year-old blades.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference in performance after using this product.</li>
            <li>Well here is the 2009 equivalent ... except this one really works and really does save money.</li>
            <li>I was  hoping it would have been more like a wet stone.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>You reassemble your shaver and your ready to go.</li>
            <li>He said it worked really well</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>Sharpens fast and don&#x27;t have to buy a newer shaver.  </li>
            <li>...seemed all straight forward to me.    </li>
            <li>This whole process took maybe 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Really work very well and a lot cheaper than replacing blades.</li>
            <li>Much closer shave and does not pull anymore.</li>
            <li>I found these sharpeners to work very well for my shaver.</li>
            <li>i would recommend  Thanks</li>
            <li>I expect they may not continue a whole lot longer to respond as well as they are now to this procedure, but who cares?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I really saved any money with this.  </li>
            <li>BOUGHT TO SHARPEN ONE NORELCO SHAVER, THE KIT STILL WORKS ON ANY ROTARY SHAVER THAT THE HEADS FIT PROPERLY.</li>
            <li>reviews said to do it longer for a better sharpening, but my experience with thin metal is you can always do it more</li>
            <li>The shave was much smoother and it was very much like when the shaver was new.</li>
            <li>At half the cost if it works even half as good, I am fine, right?&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>After one use decided to get new blades, but a new razor  costs only 5 dollars more than replacing the blades-</li>
            <li>No surprise, I was reminded of why I purchased a new shaver in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>After the first use, it made them new again.</li>
            <li>I will see how future uses go, but will probably end up breaking out the bucks to get the original blades.</li>
            <li>I would estimate that I will probably get a good shave for at least 3 or 4 months per set based on my first 1 1/2 month experience so far.</li>
            <li>After deciding to take a chance, I was surprised at not only how easy they were to use on my Norelco Reflex plus (Model 6423 LC) shaver but also in the difference it made.</li>
            <li>so I get up the shaver up to full speed and last longer than one shave</li>
            <li>First of all the product got here a day early.</li>
            <li>AROUND HOLIDAYS ESPECIALLY CHRISTMAS, YOU CAN GET NEW RAZORS ON SALE VERY CHEAPLY AND REPLACEMENT BLADES USUALLY COST THE SAME OR MORE!</li>
            <li>and his razor was like brand new!</li>
            <li>The glass will sharpen the blade, and you will save yourself $30 on new heads, and $20 on the head sharpener!</li>
            <li>the shaver works like new!</li>
            <li>Like new!</li>
            <li>They really work and now I have two razors that both work like new.</li>
            <li>but it really sharpened the heads, just like new.  </li>
            <li>Maybe older.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this device a short while,but it seems to have worked ok.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This sharpener definitely works, and  is easily worth the price, especially if you end up getting another Norelco later that may also be able to use this sharpener.</li>
            <li>Product seems to sharpen the blades, but does not seem to be highly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sharpener.</li>
            <li>The heads are more than half the cost of new blades.</li>
            <li>They seemed to be a great alternative to purchasing those extremely expensive HQ6 shaver heads.  </li>
            <li>I noticed an immediate improvement, but after a few shaves it was significantly better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good daily shaves for the past month after sharpening the blades twice.</li>
            <li>this is pretty good, i was wrong.    </li>
            <li>After reading all of these reviews I decided to try simply taking out the blades and turning them by hand on a fresh piece of 220 grit sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely been saving me money in the long run :)</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it gives me a very clean shave and with money tight</li>
            <li>but after using it twice now I can say with due respect, that it does a fine job of sharpening your razor heads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little skeptical on how many times i will be able to sue them before the blades become too short, but even using it ONCE was certainly wortt buying them, as a new set of heads was more than 2x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I tested it, it shaved a little better but very far from new.  </li>
            <li>Second, the price was right compared to spending 45 to 50 bucks on a new set of heads for your Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this product when I was looking for new blades for my Norelco razor because I didn&#x27;t even know this existed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this new Remington gave me something to compare my sharpened blades to.  </li>
            <li>I may have to do a head-to-head comparison against a set of new blades.</li>
            <li>I swapped the used/sharpened blades for new ones, and the new ones did not seem to affect my skin like that.</li>
            <li>saved me from buying new heads.</li>
            <li>I will not have to purchase new razor heads as often as I have been.</li>
            <li>suggest you buy a new one</li>
            <li>They made my razor feel like it was brand new.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this to try to sharpen my husbands razor rather than get new blades.  </li>
            <li>;  I refused to pay for a new set of rotary blades.  </li>
            <li>Replacement blades cost almost as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li>New blades would have cost almost as much as a new shaver</li>
            <li>After i used them on my cleaned heads, the razor was \\&quot;ok\\&quot; for maybe a week although i cant say it would be on par with purchasing a new set of heads.     </li>
            <li>It began shaving like new again.</li>
            <li>For the price of replacement blades, I might as well have bought a new razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a new razor now.</li>
            <li>After looking at the cost of new heads I was considering just getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li>and  they are like new.</li>
            <li>My blades were months overdue for new ones, so I thought what the heck?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice since I&#x27;ve bought it; it sharpens those blades like new.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item, hoping to not need a new set of blades for a while.</li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d have to buy new one</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li>Five seconds sharpening time restored them like new.</li>
            <li>A new set of blades for my Norelco can cost upwards of $30.</li>
            <li>Each time I use this my razor shaves like it has new blades.</li>
            <li>Mine worked like new after doing this.</li>
            <li>Save your money buying new blades.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying new Heads.</li>
            <li>That was like getting two new razors.</li>
            <li>, THEN THEY ARE TOO WORN OUT TO TAKE A NEW EDGE.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical as most, but once product arrived I opened the securely packaged sharpening heads and mounted them immediately into my Norleco.  </li>
            <li>i followed the directions to the letter and behold it was simple, fast and very</li>
            <li>Maintenance consisted of dusting out the heads daily, rinsing with water weekly, and spraying with head lubricant after the rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was pulling hairs and pinching to an unacceptable degree.&lt;br /&gt;The new brand-name heads arrived first</li>
            <li>some will suggest - because the first time was only 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only my first try, but it worked today.</li>
            <li>I had some difficulty reassembling the sharpener at first but, after a Five (5) second spin on the Vollco blade sharpener</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly and only ran the sharpener for 5 seconds as recommended.  </li>
            <li>I think the key is to remove the blade assembly and wash everything in hot, soapy water.</li>
            <li>It restored my razor head to the point where I actually got razor burn the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>later, when the Vollco Sharpening Heads arrived I tried them out for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But judging by the looks of them after the first use I should get several uses.</li>
            <li>Inserting these into my 20 or 30 year old shaver made it shave like new.  </li>
            <li>The sharpening heads helped since my blades are three years old but they still don&#x27;t cut like they did when they were new.</li>
            <li>And he said that while it takes him 4&#x27; to shave with new razors, it was 15&#x27; - with old and  after he sharpened &amp;#34;the saw&amp;#34;, it was 7&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money purchasing new heads for your electric razor.</li>
            <li>I bought new ones now and would probably rather recommend spending a little more and get actual new heads.</li>
            <li>I tried sharpening them 3 more times and still not very good.  </li>
            <li>I was originally shopping for blade replacements, but found this sharpener advertised and with the price at half of the new blades and favorable reviews</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned if this work with my Models shaver it did work just fine</li>
            <li>I like this idea, have used something similar, and agree it is a much better alternative than going with a new package when money is tight.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, simply pop the razor open like you are cleaning it, take the blades out of the heads, place these in where the heads should be, replace the blades and put the razor back</li>
            <li>The razor was now more dull than before.    </li>
            <li>I used it for 4 seconds on my shaver heads that are about 8 years old.</li>
            <li>I ran the old Norelco 10 seconds with the sharpening heads - as suggested by one reviewer.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well my Norelco electric shaver worked after sharpening the blades with this product.</li>
            <li>Now can continue to use his old razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sharpened two different shavers with them, and they really help.</li>
            <li>I have gotten two fixed under warranty or extended warranty.</li>
            <li>The shaver is probably 12+ years old.</li>
            <li>Today, after sharpening my old blades with the Vollco sharpening kit, I got the cleanest shave I have had in months.</li>
            <li>Ordered this item for my 20 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Be sure to match your shaver model number with the correct sharpening heads, there are at least three</li>
            <li>I did a test shave and there was a very obvious difference, and the shave was much closer than before.  </li>
            <li>Now it is about 20% as loud.  </li>
            <li>I figure to save at least $75 by getting three sharpenings or more.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at the amount of stuff in there, that ,after thoroughly cleaning with tweezers and brush, I thought I would see if the shaver worked again - before sharpening.</li>
            <li>I still saved my old heads and waited for the Vollco product.&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li>I gave the old heads 5 seconds with the sharpening heads, figuring I could give them a longer spin if that wasn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised at how well these sharpening heads worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now added a 5-second spin with the sharpening heads to my weekly razor maintenance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised it worked so well.</li>
            <li>My old blades were so old &amp; worn, I thought they would have to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These cutters are 3 years old.</li>
            <li>I can tell it had an effect on the blades, but not enough to really tell any difference.  </li>
            <li>There was a distinct improvement after following the simple usage instructions.</li>
            <li>When I used it, according to the directions, it did improve blade sharpness, but they were not nearly as sharp as new ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since not every razor is assembled the same way, reasonably so, the instructions are pretty loosely stated, presuming that the user knows how to disassemble their razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think the moral of the story is:  Buy new blades (although a ripoff for the low-end shavers) or a complete new shaver.  </li>
            <li>definitely cheaper that replacing dull cutters, also fast and easy to use</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need this product (cleverly priced just slightly below the price of new heads).</li>
            <li>skin is feeling very sensitive lately to shaving for some reason, and it could be this kit is just fine,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely easy to use and only take a few seconds.</li>
            <li>really doubt that I ran the sharpening blades too long - as I know</li>
            <li>I then ran into this little jewel by Volloco  on amazon at half the cost of new rotary blades, maybe more.</li>
            <li>(Walmart had another Norelco shaver for $24.97 - the same price as new HQ55 blades) and now I have 3 shavers - one for travel, one for home, and one for backup.</li>
            <li>Works like brand new once you swap the blade back in.</li>
            <li>Cheaper alternative at present rather than purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li>I am buying new cutters next time.</li>
            <li>I was back in business  without having to go get a bank loan for new blades.</li>
            <li>After a cleaning and 4 second sharpening, my razor shaved like new again.</li>
            <li>It beats paying big $ for new blades .</li>
            <li>I ordered new blades and the difference was totally different.</li>
            <li>However, the blades were not sharpened at the same level as a brand new pair.  </li>
            <li>experience may of course be different than mine, but I could not tell the difference between the re-sharpened heads and the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they weren&#x27;t like brand new, but you could definitely feel the difference</li>
            <li>Without this, I&#x27;d have had to buy new blades last year.</li>
            <li>Somehow it manages to sharpen the existing heads well enough to improve their cuts, and on very old heads, too.</li>
            <li>Worked simply as shown online and definitely improved my blades considerably and stopped me having to dump them for new ones.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical but there were enough positive reviews to put me over the top.</li>
            <li>I read many positive reviews on the Vollco Sharpening Heads prior to purchasing them, but I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li>They even have other styles that fit other brands.</li>
            <li>After I did this and used the blades, my skin developed red whelts/rashses from where the shaver passed over.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li>(I have an old Norelco 7885XL where i already replaced heads + batteries multiple times).    </li>
            <li>The blades were several years old and the shaver was from my grandpa who used the living</li>
            <li>old three blades were not sharp, put sharping heads on old three blades and keep old three blades sharp well</li>
            <li>I have bought other shavers but my old shaver, even with the dull heads, often worked better than the newer shavers, on my face.</li>
            <li>Its been too long to remember how they would compare to new blades</li>
            <li>New blades for my model is almost half the price of a new unit.</li>
            <li>After 10 seconds with the sharpening heads, my razor blades feel like new, and for less than the cost of a new set of blades.</li>
            <li>Well new blades can suck your wallet dry.</li>
            <li>This simple set of ultra-fine sandpaper sharpening heads actually do sharpen the old razor heads.</li>
            <li>I suspect you do come to the point where the material removed by the sharpening and the natural wear of the foils from use is such that further resharpening won&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I wanted not to buy a new package at 35 dollars a pop but wanted to preserve what I had and continue their usage for as long as necessary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts but it does appear to sharpen old heads.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful, you might miss this and the blades may not align properly with the stone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they are equivalent to new heads (hard to remember back that far!), but I do get a decent, close shave now which I wasn&#x27;t getting for the last 3 years or so.</li>
            <li>My Norelco with the Advantage heads was 5-10 years old and had the original heads, so they were extremely dull, more like whacking off my beard than actually cutting it.</li>
            <li>So, the real improvement from the \\&quot;sharpening\\&quot; process is probably the removal of the gunk that can&#x27;t be reached with the little cleaning brush, or be seen externally.</li>
            <li>The new shaver shaved very close but was large, cheap feeling, uncomfortable to hold, and the back retractable trimmer was pretty lame with crappy little springs.&lt;br</li>

            <li> But it works great.</li>
            <li> The product is great once I received it.  </li>
            <li> Great Product.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Vollco sharpening blades for my $35 Norelco and they worked great.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> These are great.  </li>
            <li> and they still work great sharpening the blades.  </li>
            <li> The sharpener worked great</li>
            <li> these sharpeners work great</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and best of all it works!</li>
            <li> Very nice service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it works    good value</li>
            <li> work good.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of sharpening heads over a year ago, and I have really loved them.</li>
            <li> It did a good job.</li>
            <li> The disassembly and reassembly are what takes a bit of time, but it&#x27;s needed anyway to do a good job of cleaning the shaver periodically.</li>
            <li> This got a lot of good reviews, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> (finger nail works good...</li>
            <li> good way to save money and keep your razor sharpe  </li>
            <li> so it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and worked great.</li>
            <li> followed the instructions and was very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, it will save you a lot of time shaving just buy being able to sharpen the blades on your electric razor.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I promise you will LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> and I must say i was really impressed from the first time I&#x27;ve re-sharpened my blades to now.</li>
            <li> Sharpens amazingly well.</li>
            <li> -Should come with some kind of case</li>
            <li> Despite this, this product does appear to work and should be cost effective compared to replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Nice idea...</li>
            <li> nice would recommend ;;</li>
            <li> Kind of.</li>
            <li> Make your own.</li>
            <li> cost effective.</li>
            <li> and I get great clean shaves after using this.  </li>
            <li> Very Cool !</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok, but I would have liked better.</li>
            <li> It probably was not as good as it felt when brand new, BUT it was about 90% as good, or as it might have felt a month or 2 after it was brand new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then did it once more using a circular motion with the blades with very light pressure.</li>
            <li> We really weren&#x27;t sure how this would work, but it does a wonderful job and is a tremendous money saver.</li>
            <li> product will have paid for itself with one more use.  </li>
            <li> The difference in my shave is certainly better.</li>
            <li> Be sure to not drop your blades or damage the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am more convinced the kit was probably not the cause.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> and I was still getting a close comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> If it continues to work as well as today, I could up my stars one more.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied  with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Yes they do work, I have a better shave thank you</li>
            <li> Be sure to keep the blade and screen together when you remove and replace the blades after sharpening.</li>
            <li> There is probably a limit to how many times you can sharpen a given set of blades as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This should save me anywhere from $100 to $200, depending on how many times it will sharpen the blades.  </li>
            <li> Now ordering more because word has gotten around.  </li>
            <li> I will update on if it appears to get any better as time passes.</li>
            <li> So much better than spending $60 on replacement heads.</li>
            <li> and we couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I suggest that you layout the heads on the table in a triangle pattern and then place the blades in the razor in a matching sequence so you will be able to keep them paired as suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I may sharpen the blades again for a bit longer and see if it is more noticeable.</li>
            <li> My shaves are definitely better.</li>
            <li> I brushed-out and blew-out the Norelco shave after every use, but the shave deteriorated after many years (I have been using this shaver for about 7 years).</li>
            <li> Ripoff--didn&#x27;t make the head any better.</li>
            <li> One more use</li>
            <li> This really works great.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I THINK THAT I MAY HAVE TOP</li>
            <li> my electric shaver was mostly sharper when i used these heads.</li>
            <li> more closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure your razor model is listed.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love there?</li>
            <li> Do not know how many times I can continue resharping the heads I have now but saving money once surely offsets the purchase price.</li>
            <li> When I got home and opened it up I sharpened the two Norelco &amp;#34;Relfex Action&amp;#34; razors that I had for many many years.</li>
            <li> They worked great - shaved off a three day beard like a new razor!</li>
            <li> Have an electric shaver that pulls your whiskers and doesn&#x27;t get that nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It did work, but not that great, and not like having brand new blades</li>
            <li> Great product so far!</li>
            <li> After first sharpening, he was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I did get good fast shipping A+</li>
            <li> The razor is as good as new many years ago....</li>
            <li> -easy to use: pop off your head assembly, disassemble the whole head including blade retainer, blades, and blade covers, and give it all a good brushing/cleaning while your at it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed that the blades come back like-new every time I use it (once every 4 months or so).  </li>
            <li> God I hope these guys  are successful because they helped me by not having to pay an arm and a leg for new blades.</li>
            <li> These are a 1 time use and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am sure it helped to thoroughly clean the heads in the process.</li>
            <li> Were they as good as new?</li>
            <li> My razor cuts as good as when it was new.  </li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> and it should work fine.</li>
            <li> Glued into the bottom of each of these cups was a circle of fine sandpaper.</li>
            <li> While I was waiting for the Vollco Sharpening Heads to arrive in the mail, I went out to Walmart and bought a cheap $20 Remington rotary head shaver.  </li>
            <li> Either way, the seller was fantastic, so though I rate the kit 4 stars, I rate the seller 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if nothing else get the cleaner spray, As it is cheap and works.</li>
            <li> I remember my grandpa telling me about razor blade sharpeners back in the great depression.</li>
            <li> Cleaner face and faster shave and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After sharpening it shaved close and comfortable again.</li>
            <li> I used to replace my blades every year or 2 as I have a light beard.</li>
            <li> but what can you expect from free shipping</li>
            <li> This is really quite amazing.</li>
            <li> Cheap way to keep your shave comfotable.  </li>
            <li> Not all blades will fit.</li>
            <li> This product fit the bill at 1/2 cost of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> He loved his old electric razor, but it didn&#x27;t cut so well anymore.  </li>
            <li> have added a ~5min video documentation of the sharpening process for my Philips/Norelco 7110X (a very popular electric razor with the added trimmer on the back) to demoonstrate how easy and quick it is.</li>
            <li> Since one could re-sharpen few more times (probably), before the blades could not be sharpened any more, maybe it is a good buy, before buying a replacement head.</li>
            <li> Being a very fine sandpaper, it will get used up pretty quickly, so don&#x27;t sharpen the heads longer than recommended by the instructions or too often.</li>
            <li> I need the return of the original product</li>
            <li> This is allowing me to use my original Norelco razor with the blade that came with it three years ago.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t move it and without putting any significant pressure on the cutter, turn on the motor for about 5 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I have since bought another NEW set of blades and screens, and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Either way, for me the blades give a clean shave and I have the advantage to keep them sharpened at this level</li>
            <li> Quick, comfortable close shave this morning.</li>
            <li> Clean everything</li>
            <li> (Suggestions: Clean your heads first with a good water rinse; when you take out the cutters, make sure you put them back into the screens they came out of; while the screens are out, clean them with water again and look for hair, etc.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference right away!</li>
            <li> As it turns out, it did a very good job in just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I just used the first of my extra rotary blade set yesterday, and again got a great shave with that one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These things have paid for themselves dozens of times over, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even been using them a full year.</li>
            <li> And if I can use them with a credit from another source its better than buying them straight from the vendor.</li>
            <li> I only need to sharpen the blades using this once a year and the Norelco is as good as it was before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the end result isn&#x27;t as good as new blades, but it is very close.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to follow as the shaver head assembly was just like mine.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think, better than new!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t smart enought to look online for part!!    </li>
            <li> This is a real money saver and worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> &quot; work as well and as quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li> they save you lots of money in the long run they arrived on time and in good condition</li>
            <li> nice and fast and decent shave.</li>
            <li> Eventually you will need to buy new blades, but with this you can get more use out of your existing ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times this can be done but even once is cheaper than buying new blades.</li>
            <li> More than a new one in USA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of times, and it somewhat sharpens them, but I still think I might have been better off buying a new head.</li>
            <li> No the blades don&#x27;t feel like new, but they are definitely better.</li>
            <li> Easy to use fast</li>
            <li> Sharpening procedure was easy &amp; fast.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re too cheap to buy these, many folks reported success from using the the shavers&#x27; weight and holding the bare blades against the bottom of a ceramic plate or cup and running it for a couple seconds.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this item over buying replacement blades!!!</li>
            <li> Take the top off, remove the sharpeners and put the original heads back in with the original blades.  </li>
            <li> This worked great to get my electric razor real sharp again in about 5 seconds of operation.  </li>
            <li> I really get a close smooth shave with this baby.</li>
            <li> It really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It did sharpen my year old blade and am satisfied with the shave after.     </li>
            <li> Another thing that works is the Norelco head cleaner spray, cleans and lubricates the heads for a nice drag free shave.</li>
            <li> , I was convinced this was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> It was worth a try.</li>
            <li> And I can continue to use my old Norelco, which I like MUCH more than the &#x27;improved&#x27; Norelco products.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money - YES.</li>
            <li> why: the razor was more than four years old and the heads had never been changed.</li>
            <li> A very simple and effective way to sharper the blades on my Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I tried some of the other &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; for sharpening the blades, but this was much easier and more effective.</li>
            <li> The sharpening process is very simple: you just remove the shaver heads like you would to clean them and drop these sharpeners in in place of the screens; you run the shaver for 3 to 5 seconds (I&#x27;d say five or a touch more) and there you go.</li>
            <li> But they can&#x27;t really restore the heads all the way to their original condition.</li>
            <li> yea right, GL</li>
            <li> Just pick the right sharpener for your shaver.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need to buy new blades some time in the future, but even saving one set is a money-saver, and saving more than that</li>
            <li> New heads cost more and give you the same shave better to save the $</li>
            <li> What came in the package was three plastic cups which fit where the screens normally go.</li>
            <li> I plan to sharpen the heads quarterly and see how long the Vollco Sharpening Heads For Select Norelco Models is effective.    </li>
            <li> These plastic discs contain a tiny circle of very fine sandpaper that didactically nothing to sharpen the blades.  </li>
            <li> There is a little triangular fitting on top of that post that holds the spider.</li>
            <li> also mentioned that your razor may not need a blade sharpener, just a good cleaning, but routine cleaning of ANY razor is both important and assumed, and blades DO get dull with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One clue that it works: before sharpening, you could hear almost every whisker as it got chopped off.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled into a very inexpensive way to extend the life of my favorite old Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> IT WORKED LIKE BRAND NEW!!!  </li>
            <li> So this is actually a great deal because you can re-sharpen the blades a number of times before having to break down and get new ones.</li>
            <li> 5 seconds, then clean and reinstall as normal.</li>
            <li> Great improvement for the old-old dull razors.</li>
            <li> It really takes very little time and works great.</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical at first, but these do work quite well.</li>
            <li> , drop the sharpeners into teh top pert of the head assembly, place the blades in, put it back together and run your shaver WITHOUT pressing it to anything for \\&quot;3-5 seconds\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Ceramic cups DO work great for sharpening kitchen knives, but i was too paranoid to use it on delicate shaver blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure someone will chime in and add that its not necessary to match cutters and screens once you use this sharpener..</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t think it worked the first time he tried again</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it should not to be so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sharpener appears to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> It was the first time it was sharpened in well over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I have had this Vollco shaver sharpening heads kit for over a month but just put it to use for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Then be sure you match the same cutter and head when when you reassemble them.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> It has been about 8 weeks since I sharpened the blades and the shaver still works well, though probably not as well as when it was first sharpened.</li>
            <li> The vendor, Total Vac, is more interested in letting the buyer know who they are than allowing you to read the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work okay, hoping to extend the life of my razor&#x27;s blades and save the expense of replacing them before absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I were using these sharpening heads at an earlier stage in the life of my blades they&#x27;d be in better shape...</li>
            <li> I got a close shave after the first useage.</li>
            <li> Blades feels like the first time I used my Norelco shaving machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They worked exactly as described, sharpening both shavers and saving me $25.00 plus.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, Amazon let us know the price had dropped by five dollars and subsequently refunded that amount to us.</li>
            <li> This product works very well !</li>
            <li> to remove; and do make sure the cutters go back into the screen they came out of.)</li>
            <li> Seems like I am always throwing out otherwise perfectly good stuff because I cannot get something minor fixed.</li>
            <li> I tried it again, tripling the recommended run time with a little better result but nowhere near as good as a new set of heads.</li>
            <li> put the new heads away in a safe place and have been re-sharpening the old ones and re-using them since then.</li>
            <li> The sharpener did not make my shaver work as new - new blades shave much faster and better.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say for certain it returned it to brand new condition, but definitely good enough to save me from buying new blades, so has already paid for itself with first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried these on my model Norelco 6940 razor that is 3 years old with original blades.  </li>
            <li> I ordered and got it quickly, and used it according to instructions and the cutters had a nice sharp edge , like new.</li>
            <li> I then used my new Remington and it was far better with a very close</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many times I can sharpen it before I finally need new blades, but these are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This simple device will restore your old blades good as new.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try the Vollco sharpener heads based on the positive reviews but was sceptical.  </li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, the recipient used the sharpening heads and evidently they accomplished the purpose intended.</li>
            <li> I could really tell the difference on the first sharpening, so</li>
            <li> Lay a sheet of 400 grit wetordry sandpaper (available at most auto parts and home centers) flat on a table, desk or workbench, gritty side up.  </li>
            <li> With 3 razors in need of new blades, this was certainly worth a try</li>
            <li> , it is easy to use and as stated above, can be used over and over again...</li>
            <li> would certainly recommend this to anyone who want to save some bucks-instead of purchasing replacement blades.</li>
            <li> It did sharpen the blades and my next shave was much better, however not as close as a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> I believe the sharpening heads are a worthwhile investment, especially when comparing their cost to the cost of new blades.</li>
            <li> it took better than 20 minutes to worry it loose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much difference it makes in how fast it cuts and how much less it pulls.</li>
            <li> A small cheap jeweler&#x27;s screw driver set&#x27;s flat blade works good.</li>
            <li> They had both become dull and were not doing a good shaving job.  </li>
            <li> Good idea, but hard to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> So this nice cheap little product has been a big money saver.</li>
            <li> I followed the simple instructions and there was a huge improvement in the performance of my year-old blades.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference in performance after using this product.</li>
            <li> Well here is the 2009 equivalent ... except this one really works and really does save money.</li>
            <li> I was  hoping it would have been more like a wet stone.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> You reassemble your shaver and your ready to go.</li>
            <li> He said it worked really well</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> Sharpens fast and don&#x27;t have to buy a newer shaver.  </li>
            <li> ...seemed all straight forward to me.    </li>
            <li> This whole process took maybe 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Really work very well and a lot cheaper than replacing blades.</li>
            <li> Much closer shave and does not pull anymore.</li>
            <li> I found these sharpeners to work very well for my shaver.</li>
            <li> i would recommend  Thanks</li>
            <li> I expect they may not continue a whole lot longer to respond as well as they are now to this procedure, but who cares?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I really saved any money with this.  </li>
            <li> BOUGHT TO SHARPEN ONE NORELCO SHAVER, THE KIT STILL WORKS ON ANY ROTARY SHAVER THAT THE HEADS FIT PROPERLY.</li>
            <li> reviews said to do it longer for a better sharpening, but my experience with thin metal is you can always do it more</li>
            <li> The shave was much smoother and it was very much like when the shaver was new.</li>
            <li> At half the cost if it works even half as good, I am fine, right?&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> After one use decided to get new blades, but a new razor  costs only 5 dollars more than replacing the blades-</li>
            <li> No surprise, I was reminded of why I purchased a new shaver in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> After the first use, it made them new again.</li>
            <li> I will see how future uses go, but will probably end up breaking out the bucks to get the original blades.</li>
            <li> I would estimate that I will probably get a good shave for at least 3 or 4 months per set based on my first 1 1/2 month experience so far.</li>
            <li> After deciding to take a chance, I was surprised at not only how easy they were to use on my Norelco Reflex plus (Model 6423 LC) shaver but also in the difference it made.</li>
            <li> so I get up the shaver up to full speed and last longer than one shave</li>
            <li> First of all the product got here a day early.</li>
            <li> AROUND HOLIDAYS ESPECIALLY CHRISTMAS, YOU CAN GET NEW RAZORS ON SALE VERY CHEAPLY AND REPLACEMENT BLADES USUALLY COST THE SAME OR MORE!</li>
            <li> and his razor was like brand new!</li>
            <li> The glass will sharpen the blade, and you will save yourself $30 on new heads, and $20 on the head sharpener!</li>
            <li> the shaver works like new!</li>
            <li> Like new!</li>
            <li> They really work and now I have two razors that both work like new.</li>
            <li> but it really sharpened the heads, just like new.  </li>
            <li> Maybe older.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this device a short while,but it seems to have worked ok.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This sharpener definitely works, and  is easily worth the price, especially if you end up getting another Norelco later that may also be able to use this sharpener.</li>
            <li> Product seems to sharpen the blades, but does not seem to be highly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sharpener.</li>
            <li> The heads are more than half the cost of new blades.</li>
            <li> They seemed to be a great alternative to purchasing those extremely expensive HQ6 shaver heads.  </li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate improvement, but after a few shaves it was significantly better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good daily shaves for the past month after sharpening the blades twice.</li>
            <li> this is pretty good, i was wrong.    </li>
            <li> After reading all of these reviews I decided to try simply taking out the blades and turning them by hand on a fresh piece of 220 grit sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely been saving me money in the long run :)</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it gives me a very clean shave and with money tight</li>
            <li> but after using it twice now I can say with due respect, that it does a fine job of sharpening your razor heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little skeptical on how many times i will be able to sue them before the blades become too short, but even using it ONCE was certainly wortt buying them, as a new set of heads was more than 2x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I tested it, it shaved a little better but very far from new.  </li>
            <li> Second, the price was right compared to spending 45 to 50 bucks on a new set of heads for your Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product when I was looking for new blades for my Norelco razor because I didn&#x27;t even know this existed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this new Remington gave me something to compare my sharpened blades to.  </li>
            <li> I may have to do a head-to-head comparison against a set of new blades.</li>
            <li> I swapped the used/sharpened blades for new ones, and the new ones did not seem to affect my skin like that.</li>
            <li> saved me from buying new heads.</li>
            <li> I will not have to purchase new razor heads as often as I have been.</li>
            <li> suggest you buy a new one</li>
            <li> They made my razor feel like it was brand new.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to try to sharpen my husbands razor rather than get new blades.  </li>
            <li> ;  I refused to pay for a new set of rotary blades.  </li>
            <li> Replacement blades cost almost as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li> New blades would have cost almost as much as a new shaver</li>
            <li> After i used them on my cleaned heads, the razor was \\&quot;ok\\&quot; for maybe a week although i cant say it would be on par with purchasing a new set of heads.     </li>
            <li> It began shaving like new again.</li>
            <li> For the price of replacement blades, I might as well have bought a new razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a new razor now.</li>
            <li> After looking at the cost of new heads I was considering just getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li> and  they are like new.</li>
            <li> My blades were months overdue for new ones, so I thought what the heck?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice since I&#x27;ve bought it; it sharpens those blades like new.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, hoping to not need a new set of blades for a while.</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d have to buy new one</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li> Five seconds sharpening time restored them like new.</li>
            <li> A new set of blades for my Norelco can cost upwards of $30.</li>
            <li> Each time I use this my razor shaves like it has new blades.</li>
            <li> Mine worked like new after doing this.</li>
            <li> Save your money buying new blades.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying new Heads.</li>
            <li> That was like getting two new razors.</li>
            <li> , THEN THEY ARE TOO WORN OUT TO TAKE A NEW EDGE.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as most, but once product arrived I opened the securely packaged sharpening heads and mounted them immediately into my Norleco.  </li>
            <li> i followed the directions to the letter and behold it was simple, fast and very</li>
            <li> Maintenance consisted of dusting out the heads daily, rinsing with water weekly, and spraying with head lubricant after the rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was pulling hairs and pinching to an unacceptable degree.&lt;br /&gt;The new brand-name heads arrived first</li>
            <li> some will suggest - because the first time was only 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only my first try, but it worked today.</li>
            <li> I had some difficulty reassembling the sharpener at first but, after a Five (5) second spin on the Vollco blade sharpener</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly and only ran the sharpener for 5 seconds as recommended.  </li>
            <li> I think the key is to remove the blade assembly and wash everything in hot, soapy water.</li>
            <li> It restored my razor head to the point where I actually got razor burn the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> later, when the Vollco Sharpening Heads arrived I tried them out for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But judging by the looks of them after the first use I should get several uses.</li>
            <li> Inserting these into my 20 or 30 year old shaver made it shave like new.  </li>
            <li> The sharpening heads helped since my blades are three years old but they still don&#x27;t cut like they did when they were new.</li>
            <li> And he said that while it takes him 4&#x27; to shave with new razors, it was 15&#x27; - with old and  after he sharpened &amp;#34;the saw&amp;#34;, it was 7&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money purchasing new heads for your electric razor.</li>
            <li> I bought new ones now and would probably rather recommend spending a little more and get actual new heads.</li>
            <li> I tried sharpening them 3 more times and still not very good.  </li>
            <li> I was originally shopping for blade replacements, but found this sharpener advertised and with the price at half of the new blades and favorable reviews</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned if this work with my Models shaver it did work just fine</li>
            <li> I like this idea, have used something similar, and agree it is a much better alternative than going with a new package when money is tight.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, simply pop the razor open like you are cleaning it, take the blades out of the heads, place these in where the heads should be, replace the blades and put the razor back</li>
            <li> The razor was now more dull than before.    </li>
            <li> I used it for 4 seconds on my shaver heads that are about 8 years old.</li>
            <li> I ran the old Norelco 10 seconds with the sharpening heads - as suggested by one reviewer.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well my Norelco electric shaver worked after sharpening the blades with this product.</li>
            <li> Now can continue to use his old razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sharpened two different shavers with them, and they really help.</li>
            <li> I have gotten two fixed under warranty or extended warranty.</li>
            <li> The shaver is probably 12+ years old.</li>
            <li> Today, after sharpening my old blades with the Vollco sharpening kit, I got the cleanest shave I have had in months.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item for my 20 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Be sure to match your shaver model number with the correct sharpening heads, there are at least three</li>
            <li> I did a test shave and there was a very obvious difference, and the shave was much closer than before.  </li>
            <li> Now it is about 20% as loud.  </li>
            <li> I figure to save at least $75 by getting three sharpenings or more.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the amount of stuff in there, that ,after thoroughly cleaning with tweezers and brush, I thought I would see if the shaver worked again - before sharpening.</li>
            <li> I still saved my old heads and waited for the Vollco product.&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li> I gave the old heads 5 seconds with the sharpening heads, figuring I could give them a longer spin if that wasn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised at how well these sharpening heads worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now added a 5-second spin with the sharpening heads to my weekly razor maintenance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised it worked so well.</li>
            <li> My old blades were so old &amp; worn, I thought they would have to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These cutters are 3 years old.</li>
            <li> I can tell it had an effect on the blades, but not enough to really tell any difference.  </li>
            <li> There was a distinct improvement after following the simple usage instructions.</li>
            <li> When I used it, according to the directions, it did improve blade sharpness, but they were not nearly as sharp as new ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since not every razor is assembled the same way, reasonably so, the instructions are pretty loosely stated, presuming that the user knows how to disassemble their razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think the moral of the story is:  Buy new blades (although a ripoff for the low-end shavers) or a complete new shaver.  </li>
            <li> definitely cheaper that replacing dull cutters, also fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need this product (cleverly priced just slightly below the price of new heads).</li>
            <li> skin is feeling very sensitive lately to shaving for some reason, and it could be this kit is just fine,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely easy to use and only take a few seconds.</li>
            <li> really doubt that I ran the sharpening blades too long - as I know</li>
            <li> I then ran into this little jewel by Volloco  on amazon at half the cost of new rotary blades, maybe more.</li>
            <li> (Walmart had another Norelco shaver for $24.97 - the same price as new HQ55 blades) and now I have 3 shavers - one for travel, one for home, and one for backup.</li>
            <li> Works like brand new once you swap the blade back in.</li>
            <li> Cheaper alternative at present rather than purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> I am buying new cutters next time.</li>
            <li> I was back in business  without having to go get a bank loan for new blades.</li>
            <li> After a cleaning and 4 second sharpening, my razor shaved like new again.</li>
            <li> It beats paying big $ for new blades .</li>
            <li> I ordered new blades and the difference was totally different.</li>
            <li> However, the blades were not sharpened at the same level as a brand new pair.  </li>
            <li> experience may of course be different than mine, but I could not tell the difference between the re-sharpened heads and the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t like brand new, but you could definitely feel the difference</li>
            <li> Without this, I&#x27;d have had to buy new blades last year.</li>
            <li> Somehow it manages to sharpen the existing heads well enough to improve their cuts, and on very old heads, too.</li>
            <li> Worked simply as shown online and definitely improved my blades considerably and stopped me having to dump them for new ones.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but there were enough positive reviews to put me over the top.</li>
            <li> I read many positive reviews on the Vollco Sharpening Heads prior to purchasing them, but I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li> They even have other styles that fit other brands.</li>
            <li> After I did this and used the blades, my skin developed red whelts/rashses from where the shaver passed over.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li> (I have an old Norelco 7885XL where i already replaced heads + batteries multiple times).    </li>
            <li> The blades were several years old and the shaver was from my grandpa who used the living</li>
            <li> old three blades were not sharp, put sharping heads on old three blades and keep old three blades sharp well</li>
            <li> I have bought other shavers but my old shaver, even with the dull heads, often worked better than the newer shavers, on my face.</li>
            <li> Its been too long to remember how they would compare to new blades</li>
            <li> New blades for my model is almost half the price of a new unit.</li>
            <li> After 10 seconds with the sharpening heads, my razor blades feel like new, and for less than the cost of a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> Well new blades can suck your wallet dry.</li>
            <li> This simple set of ultra-fine sandpaper sharpening heads actually do sharpen the old razor heads.</li>
            <li> I suspect you do come to the point where the material removed by the sharpening and the natural wear of the foils from use is such that further resharpening won&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I wanted not to buy a new package at 35 dollars a pop but wanted to preserve what I had and continue their usage for as long as necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts but it does appear to sharpen old heads.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful, you might miss this and the blades may not align properly with the stone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are equivalent to new heads (hard to remember back that far!), but I do get a decent, close shave now which I wasn&#x27;t getting for the last 3 years or so.</li>
            <li> My Norelco with the Advantage heads was 5-10 years old and had the original heads, so they were extremely dull, more like whacking off my beard than actually cutting it.</li>
            <li> So, the real improvement from the \\&quot;sharpening\\&quot; process is probably the removal of the gunk that can&#x27;t be reached with the little cleaning brush, or be seen externally.</li>
            <li> The new shaver shaved very close but was large, cheap feeling, uncomfortable to hold, and the back retractable trimmer was pretty lame with crappy little springs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> by replacing them and sharpening them means I can extend their life over time and worry about a new package somewhere down the line in the future.</li>
            <li> You only need to use them once to save half the price of a new set of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I run the razor across my face and it&#x27;s smooth, no multiple passes or pushing down hard.</li>
            <li> (And the bonus is that my old shaver is now sharp, so I have it as a back-up if I ever need it.)</li>
            <li> So i did another run for 10 seconds due to the fact that my heads were so old.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took no time at all to put in the sharpening heads (one review sounded like it might be hard to follow the admittedly sparse instructions, but if you know what each part is called, it&#x27;s pretty simple), and I turned the shaver on for 10 seconds ....</li>
            <li> My recommendation: If you are on a tight budget, this might buy you some time, otherwise, spend the 10-15 extra dollars and buy new heads.</li>
            <li> My heads were a few years old and it was getting brutal to get a good fast shave.</li>
            <li> Well they did, and at half the price of new blades.  </li>
            <li> The amount of sharpening is limited and not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Head sharpening helped a little but it still may be necessary to buy a new head.  </li>
            <li> My heads were pretty dull before using this.</li>
            <li> It was such a waste of money, I wish I had bought a new set of blades instead.</li>
            <li> Blades felt sharper for awhile, but didn&#x27;t last long and ended up buying a new set of blades a few weeks later</li>
            <li> As others have stated these look like they can be used multiple times - seems like I will be in business as long as the battery and motor holds out.</li>
            <li> At a fraction of the price of a razor these can be reused to sharpen your blades several times and save you a lot of money in the long run.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t appear that the sharpener heads will last long.  </li>
            <li> This is it, low cost, fast fix for dull blades.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I no longer dread spending an arm and a leg for new blades every few months.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> It took less than 5 minutes to bring my 6887XL back to sharp as new condition.  </li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I gave it a second try with the sharpener heads after a few weeks because i thought maybe the 5 seconds were not long enough to sharpen it.</li>
            <li> Why&#x27;d I wait so long to replace the blades?</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected -- it&#x27;s essentially two circles of sand paper.</li>
            <li> If you mix the blades and screens it will take a long time to re-seat the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but simply didn&#x27;t work as i expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in writing long reviews on items like this.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to shave and still it didn&#x27;t feel like I had shaved.</li>
            <li> Wow, no redness, pulling, nicking, or anything else I can speak ill of.&lt;br /&gt;These things are the real deal Holyfield!  </li>
            <li> Buy a piece of 1200 grit wet or dry sandpaper and use that for the same effect.  </li>
            <li> It cost less the half of new shaver</li>
            <li> used in three different shavers I have and it worked in all three shavers, one of them did not fit because was a different model, but I just hold the heads with my fingers and worked!&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations!</li>
            <li> Since I have 3 extra heads left over from other broken Norelco shavers used over the past many years, I decided to sharpen ALL 3 sets at once and just rotate them every few months.</li>
            <li> I think it made some difference, but not nearly as much as new heads.</li>
            <li> There may have been slight improvement, but not enough to feel \\&quot;new\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li> but it seems to me that the last time I purchased new blades they began to dull within a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The blades do not get as sharp as new ones probably because the blade material is so hard.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a little help can make a Big difference.</li>
            <li> It restored my old shaver, so I could shave a bit faster than when the blades were dull.  </li>
            <li> Now, granted, I used them when the cutters were already about 2 or 3 years old, and maybe they were too dull for these to work; but I should have notice some improvement, and can&#x27;t say I did.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this product, followed the instructions, and after less than 5 seconds of sharpening my blades were as sharp as ever.</li>
            <li> This is 3 seconds longer than the 3 to 5 seconds recommend, but felt it necessary because of how extra dull it was.</li>
            <li> I have 3 Norelco razors, 2 are at least 3yrs old.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, my Norelco is causing my skin further issues.</li>
            <li> It took only few minutes for them to resettle into the heads.</li>
            <li> Look carefully at it: There is an arrow showing that it rotates.</li>
            <li> You only need to run the blades in the sharpener for a few seconds, 3 to 5, any longer and you will reduce the life of the abrasive material in the sharpening heads.</li>
            <li> Essentially, you put the blade on the razor without the screen and let it rotate pressed against a moist (or otherwise lubricated) mirror for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> So I was careful not to lose the temper of the metal blade.  </li>
            <li> This item works as expected.</li>
            <li> Or worse, it pulls the hair under the screen (much like a crappy pair of scissors) and yanks it out of your skin.</li>
            <li> I ran the cutters over it on wet spit:)for</li>
            <li> Carefully, lower your motor assembly so that one of the drives locks into the cutter.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Vollco Sharpening Heads at the same time that I ordered a new set of heads for my Philips Norelco electric razor, because, frankly, I was skeptical that the sharpening heads could do what I</li>
            <li> Nothing like a sharp tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After disassembly, upon flicking the blades with my finger tip, they seemed quite sharp.  </li>
            <li> and they are sharp again.  </li>
            <li> the blades are sharp.  </li>
            <li> Repeat for the other cutters, reassemble and start shaving.  </li>
            <li> Do their job well, resharpened my heads to like new quality; have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> My shaver was a little over a year old when it began to be to dull to use.</li>
            <li> It does the job, I only sharpen my blades every three months or so, the little grated plastic caps haven&#x27;t worn down yet!</li>
            <li> I used to buy new heads for my razors but got tired of the expense.  </li>
            <li> Used per the vague instructions on the package but didn&#x27;t  notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Actually, I haven&#x27;t bought this product but after reading the negative reviews I thought I&#x27;d try this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the sandpaper wears down just replace it.</li>
            <li> My blades haven&#x27;t worn down</li>
            <li> Take one cutter and place it cutter side down on the sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> I hesitated to sharpen after 45 days because it still felt very sharp</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but it was half the price of replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> Why buy replacement heads at half the price of the razor if you can just resharpen them?  </li>
            <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of buying new shavers, because replacement heads are too expensive in Brazil, something like US$ 90!</li>
            <li> I also was a little skeptical, but after seeing how they work (clever design) and experiencing the before/after difference, I&#x27;m convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone</li>
            <li> Hold the motor tightly</li>
            <li> My cutting blades, on an older Norelco were getting dull and I priced the replacement parts, and I noticed this in the same category.</li>
            <li> This made little to no difference.</li>
            <li> read a review suggesting that a little bit of use is all that&#x27;s needed--somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Norelco razor for several years and the blades were getting very dull.</li>
            <li> My last set of blades got VERY dull since i didn&#x27;t replace them in 2+ years...</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that there is hardly any directions.</li>
            <li> I shave every day with a medium to heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharpen takes just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> and I would waste $17 + $5 shipping.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I installed the 3 sharpeners and ran my razor for just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just three metal discs with a small, thin piece of ceramic inside, but I assume the manufacturing numbers are kinda low.</li>
            <li> Only a week later or so the razor was back unable to do anything anymore, rather ripping out hairs instead of cutting them off.</li>
            <li> Had two Norelco shavers that needed new cutting blades and decided to try these sharpening heads.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> shavers usually last me about 2 or 3 years before a battery fails.</li>
            <li> This kit seems a bit expensive for what you get, but it worked well, and I noticed a definite improvement in performance.  </li>
            <li> Seeing that i was not able to find my correct replacement blades i decided to give Vollco Sharpening Heads a try.</li>
            <li> They stupidly paste their name right over the instructions.  </li>
            <li> I think that some of the bad reviews may be due to not seating the sharpening heads properly.  </li>
            <li> When my blades get dull</li>
            <li> Something must be wrong with the product I received or this product does not produce expected results.</li>
            <li> I then reenstalled the original parts and was shocked as to how well it renewed the cutting.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of throwing money away on replacement blades that cost a small fortune.</li>
            <li> Forget that silly half shaved feeling.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I wasted $20 on these that I could have put toward new blades.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.  </li>
            <li> The blades were very dull and almost unusable.  </li>
            <li> but the blades were very dull.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I shaved and noticed my razor blades appeared very dull.</li>
            <li> At the VERY least, brush off your blades.</li>
            <li> Build quality is poor.</li>
            <li> Here is a secret that the package does not tell you.</li>
            <li> but then it got even worse.    </li>
            <li> Just tried  the sharpening ritual on a Norelco and found the cleaning process to be the secret.  </li>
            <li> Sharpened two razors and neither improved, in fact got worse.</li>
            <li> Impossible to peel off their name without destroying the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Its so simple its stupid not to buy it for the price!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this product has not worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I haven&#x27;t tried these out yet</li>
            <li> My slightly expensive  Phillips Norelco lay dormant in my bathroom drawer for 6 months because</li>
            <li> The Norelco shaver blades are expensive and they recommend that you replace them every year.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong buying this item.</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> Was hopeful, but skeptical.  </li>
            <li> and, unfortunately, the jury is still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Instead the blades whack off the hair like a weed whacker rather than cutting like a hedge trimmer.  </li>
            <li> However, the wadded up hair inconspicuously packed between the cutting blades was like super-dense felt, obstructing \\&quot;hair flow\\&quot;, and was VERY difficult to persuade to let go.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and say goodbye to expensive replacements forever!</li>
            <li> and it got to a point where it was almost impossible to shave anymore.    </li>
            <li> that it is just bad timing.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t feel so bad.</li>
            <li> You all will not be disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It did sharpen the blades and my next shave was much better, however not as close as a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical at first, but these do work quite well. I tried some of the other &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; for sharpening the blades, but this was much easier and more effective. They&#x27;re extremely easy to use and only take a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long.  Maybe about 3 to 4 sharpenings and the surfaces are gone.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product when I was looking for new blades for my Norelco razor because I didn&#x27;t even know this existed.  i read the reviews and decided to role the dice and try it.  Up side: If it worked I saved $5 this time and $25 each time I sharepned-instead-of-buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took no time at all to put in the sharpening heads (one review sounded like it might be hard to follow the admittedly sparse instructions, but if you know what each part is called, it&#x27;s pretty simple), and I turned the shaver on for 10 seconds ....my blades were reeeeeealy dull....and BAM, it was done and the shaver shaves like the blades are new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will have paid for itself with one more use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These sharpeners worked great. Eventually you will need to buy new blades, but with this you can get more use out of your existing ones. I could feel the difference right away!</li>
            <li> My Norelco with the Advantage heads was 5-10 years old and had the original heads, so they were extremely dull, more like whacking off my beard than actually cutting it. I used the sharpener as instructed, but also putting in the spring clip to hold the heads against the sharpener surface. I decided on 5 seconds and it resulted in noticeably sharper heads than before. I don&#x27;t think they are equivalent to new heads (hard to remember back that far!), but I do get a decent, close shave now which I wasn&#x27;t getting for the last 3 years or so.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this product has not worked well for me.  It gets stocked and do not rotate.  It doe not sharpen the bladses.  No matter how I tryed. it just did not worked for me</li>
            <li> Build quality is poor. But works as advertised.   It did sharpen my year old blade and am satisfied with the shave after.     But for what the product does and based on build quality it is too pricey. it should not cost over $8.  Its a rip off and they can get away with it because they priced it lower than the blade themselves.  I am docking a star off for price.</li>
            <li> They work fine. I used it for 4 seconds on my shaver heads that are about 8 years old. Maybe older. The difference in my shave is certainly better. I used these sharpeners about 2 months ago and i can still see the shiny, newly-sharpened surfaces on my blades. I&#x27;m a little skeptical on how many times i will be able to sue them before the blades become too short, but even using it ONCE was certainly wortt buying them, as a new set of heads was more than 2x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;super-easy to use: pop off your head assembly, disassemble the whole head including blade retainer, blades, and blade covers, and give it all a good brushing/cleaning while your at it. At the VERY least, brush off your blades. Be sure to not drop your blades or damage the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, drop the sharpeners into teh top pert of the head assembly, place the blades in, put it back together and run your shaver WITHOUT pressing it to anything for \\&quot;3-5 seconds\\&quot;. Then take it apart again and put it all back together. Including the cleaning, it took me about 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit steep considering it&#x27;s just three metal discs with a small, thin piece of ceramic inside, but I assume the manufacturing numbers are kinda low. But as said, still cheaper than replacing the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these while looking for a method to sharpen heads. If you&#x27;re too cheap to buy these, many folks reported success from using the the shavers&#x27; weight and holding the bare blades against the bottom of a ceramic plate or cup and running it for a couple seconds. Ceramic cups DO work great for sharpening kitchen knives, but i was too paranoid to use it on delicate shaver blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For teh record, i used it on my Philishave using HQ5801 blades.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference in performance after using this product. Yeah, I followed the instructions provided, they were simple enough.  There may have been slight improvement, but not enough to feel \\&quot;new\\&quot; again. It was such a waste of money, I wish I had bought a new set of blades instead.</li>
            <li> I tried these on my model Norelco 6940 razor that is 3 years old with original blades.  The blades were very dull and almost unusable.  While I was waiting for the Vollco Sharpening Heads to arrive in the mail, I went out to Walmart and bought a cheap $20 Remington rotary head shaver.  The new shaver shaved very close but was large, cheap feeling, uncomfortable to hold, and the back retractable trimmer was pretty lame with crappy little springs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this new Remington gave me something to compare my sharpened blades to.  I ran the old Norelco 10 seconds with the sharpening heads - as suggested by one reviewer.  When I tested it, it shaved a little better but very far from new.  I tried sharpening them 3 more times and still not very good.  I then used my new Remington and it was far better with a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really doubt that I ran the sharpening blades too long - as I know some will suggest - because the first time was only 10 seconds.  I think the moral of the story is:  Buy new blades (although a ripoff for the low-end shavers) or a complete new shaver.  In my case, I ended up doing both (Walmart had another Norelco shaver for $24.97 - the same price as new HQ55 blades) and now I have 3 shavers - one for travel, one for home, and one for backup.</li>
            <li> I followed the simple instructions and there was a huge improvement in the performance of my year-old blades. Were they as good as new? Not sure. I may have to do a head-to-head comparison against a set of new blades.</li>
            <li> I used the kit to sharpen my Norelco Spectra&#x27;s blades. After I did this and used the blades, my skin developed red whelts/rashses from where the shaver passed over. I swapped the used/sharpened blades for new ones, and the new ones did not seem to affect my skin like that. I contacted the seller, who issued an RMA for the kit&#x27;s return. They received the kit, and processed the return promptly. Very nice service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is feeling very sensitive lately to shaving for some reason, and it could be this kit is just fine, that it is just bad timing. Either way, the seller was fantastic, so though I rate the kit 4 stars, I rate the seller 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. After a few weeks, my Norelco is causing my skin further issues. I am more convinced the kit was probably not the cause. I think I am going to use a foil shaver for a while now instead of a rotary shaver....</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but there were enough positive reviews to put me over the top. The product was simple to use and Immediately made a big difference in the sharpness of the blades. Its been too long to remember how they would compare to new blades but it seems to me that the last time I purchased new blades they began to dull within a few weeks of use. So this is actually a great deal because you can re-sharpen the blades a number of times before having to break down and get new ones.</li>
            <li> Used per the vague instructions on the package but didn&#x27;t  notice much of a difference.  I tried it again, tripling the recommended run time with a little better result but nowhere near as good as a new set of heads.</li>
            <li> This Head Sharpening kit actually works. My cutting blades, on an older Norelco were getting dull and I priced the replacement parts, and I noticed this in the same category. I ordered and got it quickly, and used it according to instructions and the cutters had a nice sharp edge , like new. It took only few minutes for them to resettle into the heads. 5 seconds, then clean and reinstall as normal. The shave was much smoother and it was very much like when the shaver was new. Another thing that works is the Norelco head cleaner spray, cleans and lubricates the heads for a nice drag free shave. Buy both, if the sharpener is compatible with your razor. if nothing else get the cleaner spray, As it is cheap and works.</li>
            <li> It work well as promised  It cost less the half of new shaver heads  and it works    good value</li>
            <li> work good. saved me from buying new heads. I will sharped heads again in 6 months and see if they still do the trick.</li>
            <li> Vollco sharpening heads do sharpen the razor heads as advertised. I will not have to purchase new razor heads as often as I have been. they do work.</li>
            <li> After one use decided to get new blades, but a new razor  costs only 5 dollars more than replacing the blades- suggest you buy a new one</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well my Norelco electric shaver worked after sharpening the blades with this product. New blades for my model is almost half the price of a new unit.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband.  He loved his old electric razor, but it didn&#x27;t cut so well anymore.  After first sharpening, he was very pleased.  Now can continue to use his old razor.  Only flaws would be:  -Wasn&#x27;t packaged as picture shows  -Didn&#x27;t come with directions  -Should come with some kind of case so it won&#x27;t get lost</li>
            <li> Perfect.  These work. They made my razor feel like it was brand new.  Yippie, a product that does what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;Takes 10 seconds to shapen the blades. I don&#x27;t know how many times this can be done but even once is cheaper than buying new blades.</li>
            <li> I throw these in my shaver once every couple months. It&#x27;s amazing how much difference it makes in how fast it cuts and how much less it pulls. Nothing like a sharp tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things have paid for themselves dozens of times over, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even been using them a full year.</li>
            <li> I remember my grandpa telling me about razor blade sharpeners back in the great depression. Well here is the 2009 equivalent ... except this one really works and really does save money. Here is a secret that the package does not tell you. When you pop off the head of the razor you will notice a springy plastic spider that holds each of the 3 rotary heads and is attached to a central post. There is a little triangular fitting on top of that post that holds the spider. Look carefully at it: There is an arrow showing that it rotates. All you need to do is rotate it about 90 degrees and the heads come out and you can swap the 3 grinding wheels in this kit for the 3 blades. Reassemble and run for about 5 seconds. Works like brand new once you swap the blade back in.</li>
            <li> Great product so far! I was tired of throwing money away on replacement blades that cost a small fortune. Recently purchased this product, followed the instructions, and after less than 5 seconds of sharpening my blades were as sharp as ever. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d take some of these reviews with a lil grain of salt. The manufacturer says not to mix the cutters with the screens..I don&#x27;t see one review mentioning that lil piece of information..buyer beware. I&#x27;m sure someone will chime in and add that its not necessary to match cutters and screens once you use this sharpener..yea right, GL</li>
            <li> I have two of the Norelco razors that I received as gifts.  They had both become dull and were not doing a good shaving job.  I took a chance and ordered the Vollco sharpening heads.  They really work and now I have two razors that both work like new.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:79f0cb0c0a5e754fe042fed5dc86c493]] I was originally shopping for blade replacements, but found this sharpener advertised and with the price at half of the new blades and favorable reviews, I was convinced this was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and was very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for certain it returned it to brand new condition, but definitely good enough to save me from buying new blades, so has already paid for itself with first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since not every razor is assembled the same way, reasonably so, the instructions are pretty loosely stated, presuming that the user knows how to disassemble their razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added a ~5min video documentation of the sharpening process for my Philips/Norelco 7110X (a very popular electric razor with the added trimmer on the back) to demoonstrate how easy and quick it is.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t think it worked the first time he tried again it&#x27;s just ok. I was  hoping it would have been more like a wet stone. I did get good fast shipping A+</li>
            <li> I was expecting 3 sharpening stones but all it is, is 3 plastic disc&#x27;s with sandpaper inside. When the sandpaper wears down just replace it.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it should not to be so good.&lt;br /&gt;But, if you follow the instructions it will works perfectly! It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of buying new shavers, because replacement heads are too expensive in Brazil, something like US$ 90! More than a new one in USA.&lt;br /&gt;I used in three different shavers I have and it worked in all three shavers, one of them did not fit because was a different model, but I just hold the heads with my fingers and worked!&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations! It works very well. My advice is: buy it!</li>
            <li> Inserting these into my 20 or 30 year old shaver made it shave like new.  Cleaner face and faster shave and smooth.  Why&#x27;d I wait so long to replace the blades?</li>
            <li> I bought this set of sharpening heads over a year ago, and I have really loved them. I&#x27;ve sharpened two different shavers with them, and they really help. The sharpening process is very simple: you just remove the shaver heads like you would to clean them and drop these sharpeners in in place of the screens; you run the shaver for 3 to 5 seconds (I&#x27;d say five or a touch more) and there you go. You reassemble your shaver and your ready to go. I&#x27;d say the end result isn&#x27;t as good as new blades, but it is very close. I&#x27;ve resharpened the blades every 4 to 6 months, and have been very happy with them. So this nice cheap little product has been a big money saver. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need to buy new blades some time in the future, but even saving one set is a money-saver, and saving more than that makes this a great buy! (And the bonus is that my old shaver is now sharp, so I have it as a back-up if I ever need it.) This product is certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 3.5.  For the money it does the job.  It restored my old shaver, so I could shave a bit faster than when the blades were dull.  The sharpener did not make my shaver work as new - new blades shave much faster and better.  Since one could re-sharpen few more times (probably), before the blades could not be sharpened any more, maybe it is a good buy, before buying a replacement head.</li>
            <li> My shaver was a little over a year old when it began to be to dull to use. I bought this and ran it for 8 seconds. This is 3 seconds longer than the 3 to 5 seconds recommend, but felt it necessary because of how extra dull it was. After sharpening it shaved close and comfortable again. It probably was not as good as it felt when brand new, BUT it was about 90% as good, or as it might have felt a month or 2 after it was brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions said sharpen every 30 to 45 days. I hesitated to sharpen after 45 days because it still felt very sharp and I was still getting a close comfortable shave! Since I have 3 extra heads left over from other broken Norelco shavers used over the past many years, I decided to sharpen ALL 3 sets at once and just rotate them every few months. I just used the first of my extra rotary blade set yesterday, and again got a great shave with that one. I would estimate that I will probably get a good shave for at least 3 or 4 months per set based on my first 1 1/2 month experience so far. I shave every day with a medium to heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These shavers usually last me about 2 or 3 years before a battery fails. I have gotten two fixed under warranty or extended warranty. This sharpener definitely works, and  is easily worth the price, especially if you end up getting another Norelco later that may also be able to use this sharpener.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try to sharpen my husbands razor rather than get new blades.  It did a good job. The only complaint is that there is hardly any directions. I had to go online to get them. But it works great. I think i used a review that was on here to get the directions.</li>
            <li> you save about $40 every time you use the sharpener. it only takes about 10 min to do (5 after you learn how). excellent product.</li>
            <li> Good idea, but hard to tell if it works. One should pay attention to the sharpening time, and keeping blades separated and in order</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it gives me a very clean shave and with money tight I wanted not to buy a new package at 35 dollars a pop but wanted to preserve what I had and continue their usage for as long as necessary. by replacing them and sharpening them means I can extend their life over time and worry about a new package somewhere down the line in the future. I like this idea, have used something similar, and agree it is a much better alternative than going with a new package when money is tight. And if I can use them with a credit from another source its better than buying them straight from the vendor.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, the recipient used the sharpening heads and evidently they accomplished the purpose intended. Cheaper alternative at present rather than purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> This sharpener appears to work pretty well. I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts but it does appear to sharpen old heads.</li>
            <li> It took less than 5 minutes to bring my 6887XL back to sharp as new condition.  It was the first time it was sharpened in well over 20 years.  I think that some of the bad reviews may be due to not seating the sharpening heads properly.  There are projections on the sharpening heads that serve to keep them from rotating when the you start the sharpening process.  Just as there are projections on the actual heads.  If you&#x27;re not careful, you might miss this and the blades may not align properly with the stone.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I was skeptical. However, given the cost of replacement heads, I decided to take the risk. This simple set of ultra-fine sandpaper sharpening heads actually do sharpen the old razor heads. There was a distinct improvement after following the simple usage instructions. A caution however, don&#x27;t expect these to sharpen forever. Being a very fine sandpaper, it will get used up pretty quickly, so don&#x27;t sharpen the heads longer than recommended by the instructions or too often. Despite this, this product does appear to work and should be cost effective compared to replacement heads. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have had this Vollco shaver sharpening heads kit for over a month but just put it to use for the first time today. The shaver blades for my ancient Norelco shaver (5601X) have been in use for over three years. The shaver is probably 12+ years old. I have bought other shavers but my old shaver, even with the dull heads, often worked better than the newer shavers, on my face. Of course, they don&#x27;t make my shaver anymore and the blades cost $65, if they can be found. Today, after sharpening my old blades with the Vollco sharpening kit, I got the cleanest shave I have had in months. It&#x27;s only my first try, but it worked today. The Cunningham review video is what helped me to choose this sharpening kit. It was pretty easy to follow as the shaver head assembly was just like mine. If it continues to work as well as today, I could up my stars one more.</li>
            <li> Do their job well, resharpened my heads to like new quality; have a tough beard. I am totally satisfied  with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used these twice, and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in shaving closeness. Now, granted, I used them when the cutters were already about 2 or 3 years old, and maybe they were too dull for these to work; but I should have notice some improvement, and can&#x27;t say I did. I am buying new cutters next time.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item for my 20 year old Norelco. Very easy to use and best of all it works! I used to replace my blades every year or 2 as I have a light beard. This is a real money saver and worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad and he loved it! He said it worked really well and his razor was like brand new!</li>
            <li> These things are great!  I bought them to sharpen the blades that came with my electric razor and I&#x27;ve never had to purchase replacement blades for it yet, even after four years.  This product really works.  Just follow the simple instructions.  Do not over sharpen.  Sharpen takes just a few seconds.  If my experience is at all the norm, you&#x27;ll be very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Yes they do work, I have a better shave thank you</li>
            <li> The product is great once I received it.  Shipping was a little slow but what can you expect from free shipping I guess.  I received it in about 2 weeks and was shipped 300 miles from my house.</li>
            <li> Head sharpening helped a little but it still may be necessary to buy a new head.  It was worth a try.</li>
            <li> These sharpeners work, and the improvement is noticeable. But they can&#x27;t really restore the heads all the way to their original condition.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I haven&#x27;t tried these out yet but, I think they will do the trick.</li>
            <li> My slightly expensive  Phillips Norelco lay dormant in my bathroom drawer for 6 months because ;  I refused to pay for a new set of rotary blades.  Replacement blades cost almost as much as a new razor. I do not mind companies making money I understand that concept . However, The razor model I owned for Ten years  before I replaced it lasted three years before replacing the blades. I then ran into this little jewel by Volloco  on amazon at half the cost of new rotary blades, maybe more. I had some difficulty reassembling the sharpener at first but, after a Five (5) second spin on the Vollco blade sharpener I was back in business  without having to go get a bank loan for new blades. God I hope these guys  are successful because they helped me by not having to pay an arm and a leg for new blades. I really get a close smooth shave with this baby. Hey,  I sharpen my knives in the kitchen as well as my Bench made pocket knife I&#x27;ve had for 20 plus years, why not my electric rotary razor blades. You all will not be disappointed with this product.  Its so simple its stupid not to buy it for the price! Kindest regards, Jim W</li>
            <li> This is a Scram, they deliver to mi a plastics lids and dont delivered a sharpening Heads. I need the return of the original product</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected -- it&#x27;s essentially two circles of sand paper. Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This kit seems a bit expensive for what you get, but it worked well, and I noticed a definite improvement in performance.  I expect that I&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of it over the coming years.  It only takes seconds for the actual sharpening.  The disassembly and reassembly are what takes a bit of time, but it&#x27;s needed anyway to do a good job of cleaning the shaver periodically.</li>
            <li> These are a 1 time use and easy to use. Blades felt sharper for awhile, but didn&#x27;t last long and ended up buying a new set of blades a few weeks later</li>
            <li> This is a product that will save you money. The Norelco shaver blades are expensive and they recommend that you replace them every year. These sharpening heads solve that problem. You only need to use them once to save half the price of a new set of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Be sure to match your shaver model number with the correct sharpening heads, there are at least three different versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Be sure to keep the blade and screen together when you remove and replace the blades after sharpening. If you mix the blades and screens it will take a long time to re-seat the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You only need to run the blades in the sharpener for a few seconds, 3 to 5, any longer and you will reduce the life of the abrasive material in the sharpening heads. I have only done one sharpening and there was no observable wear so they should last a while. There is probably a limit to how many times you can sharpen a given set of blades as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Once you have sharpened the blades it still takes 3 or 4 shaves for the blades to properly re-seat. I noticed an immediate improvement, but after a few shaves it was significantly better.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Peforms as advertised.  Just pick the right sharpener for your shaver. There&#x27;s three types of sharpener designed for different models. The models are listed on the packaging.  I&#x27;ve had good daily shaves for the past month after sharpening the blades twice. I no longer dread spending an arm and a leg for new blades every few months.  I wish I had this product years ago!</li>
            <li> Product seems to sharpen the blades, but does not seem to be highly noticeable.  I will see how future uses go, but will probably end up breaking out the bucks to get the original blades.</li>
            <li> I bought the Vollco sharpening blades for my $35 Norelco and they worked great. New blades would have cost almost as much as a new shaver so I&#x27;m money ahead already. I followed the instructions exactly and only ran the sharpener for 5 seconds as recommended.  I think the key is to remove the blade assembly and wash everything in hot, soapy water. Then be sure you match the same cutter and head when when you reassemble them. Don&#x27;t mix and match the parts and it should work fine. Worked for me.</li>
            <li> We really weren&#x27;t sure how this would work, but it does a wonderful job and is a tremendous money saver.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned if this work with my Models shaver it did work just fine I have used it 2 times without problems.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but it was half the price of replacement blades.  As it turns out, it did a very good job in just a few seconds.  My razor cuts as good as when it was new.  I recommend this item since it can be used several times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Norelco razor for several years and the blades were getting very dull. I was looking for replacement blades and found these sharpening heads. For the price, I decided to give them a try. After 10 seconds with the sharpening heads, my razor blades feel like new, and for less than the cost of a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. After a cleaning and 4 second sharpening, my razor shaved like new again. Why replace blades if they can be sharpened inexpensively?</li>
            <li> Have an electric shaver that pulls your whiskers and doesn&#x27;t get that nice clean shave. Well new blades can suck your wallet dry. This product allows you to sharpen existing blades saving you $$$. Forget that silly half shaved feeling. Definitely worked for me.</li>
            <li> I stumbled into a very inexpensive way to extend the life of my favorite old Norelco shaver.  It is the Vollco Sharpening Heads For Select Norelco Models.    I have only used it once so far but it really sharpened the heads, just like new.  I used to replace the heads once a year (or the shaver when I couldn&#x27;t find the heads at local retail outlets).  I wasn&#x27;t smart enought to look online for part!!    I plan to sharpen the heads quarterly and see how long the Vollco Sharpening Heads For Select Norelco Models is effective.    What convinced me to try them?  I saw a video review on Amazon, where a user showed how to use the product (it ran for about 5 minutes).  Until then I thought perhaps it was just a gimmick and I would waste $17 + $5 shipping.    Not so!!  The product works and the person who included the video in his remarks should now be on commission!!    This should save me anywhere from $100 to $200, depending on how many times it will sharpen the blades.  And I can continue to use my old Norelco, which I like MUCH more than the &#x27;improved&#x27; Norelco products.</li>
            <li> Purchase 2 of these, one for us and one for a friend.  Now ordering more because word has gotten around.  Sharpens fast and don&#x27;t have to buy a newer shaver.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I came along those sharpeners and went all the way to order them from the states.    They seemed to be a great alternative to purchasing those extremely expensive HQ6 shaver heads.  (I have an old Norelco 7885XL where i already replaced heads + batteries multiple times).    My last set of blades got VERY dull since i didn&#x27;t replace them in 2+ years...and it got to a point where it was almost impossible to shave anymore.    So i bought the Vollco sharpening heads, watched the video etc...seemed all straight forward to me.    After i used them on my cleaned heads, the razor was \\&quot;ok\\&quot; for maybe a week although i cant say it would be on par with purchasing a new set of heads.     Thinking this is pretty good, i was wrong.    Only a week later or so the razor was back unable to do anything anymore, rather ripping out hairs instead of cutting them off. The razor was now more dull than before.    I gave it a second try with the sharpener heads after a few weeks because i thought maybe the 5 seconds were not long enough to sharpen it. So i did another run for 10 seconds due to the fact that my heads were so old.    Anyway..it didn&#x27;t do anything anymore. If anything, those sharpening heads helped for a week \\&quot;ok\\&quot; shaving but then it got even worse.    Conclusion:    Nice idea...but simply didn&#x27;t work as i expected. Maybe my blades were just too worn/old. Don&#x27;t know. I bought new ones now and would probably rather recommend spending a little more and get actual new heads.</li>
            <li> The amount of sharpening is limited and not long lasting. The blades do not get as sharp as new ones probably because the blade material is so hard.</li>
            <li> Easy to use fast and it works! New heads cost more and give you the same shave better to save the $</li>
            <li> Just a heads up guys.  After reading all of these reviews I decided to try simply taking out the blades and turning them by hand on a fresh piece of 220 grit sandpaper.  I did this in both directions with each blade for maybe 15 rotations each way using medium-light pressure.  I then did it once more using a circular motion with the blades with very light pressure. This whole process took maybe 3 minutes. I cleaned them off and reinstalled them, and it was night and day!  I did a test shave and there was a very obvious difference, and the shave was much closer than before.  The blades were several years old and the shaver was from my grandpa who used the living you know what out of it, and never replaced the blades!  All you are buying is fancy sandpaper!!  LOL!!</li>
            <li> This got a lot of good reviews, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. My heads were pretty dull before using this. I followed the website directions, which stated to install the sharpening heads, and then turn the shaver on for about 5 seconds. This made little to no difference. I then did it again, for closer to 7 seconds. I think it made some difference, but not nearly as much as new heads. My recommendation: If you are on a tight budget, this might buy you some time, otherwise, spend the 10-15 extra dollars and buy new heads.</li>
            <li> This really works! It restored my razor head to the point where I actually got razor burn the first time I used it. You cannot go wrong buying this item.</li>
            <li> Great!  Got these for my husband and they work great!</li>
            <li> I guess it works, kinda. I have used it a couple of times, and it somewhat sharpens them, but I still think I might have been better off buying a new head. I will update on if it appears to get any better as time passes.</li>
            <li> This worked great to get my electric razor real sharp again in about 5 seconds of operation.  WOW!</li>
            <li> I read many positive reviews on the Vollco Sharpening Heads prior to purchasing them, but I was still skeptical. After deciding to take a chance, I was surprised at not only how easy they were to use on my Norelco Reflex plus (Model 6423 LC) shaver but also in the difference it made. It began shaving like new again. It has been about 8 weeks since I sharpened the blades and the shaver still works well, though probably not as well as when it was first sharpened. When needed, I will simply sharpen them again. I believe the sharpening heads are a worthwhile investment, especially when comparing their cost to the cost of new blades.</li>
            <li> This thing works great!! Every time I used my electric razor my neck was red and bumpy. For the price of replacement blades, I might as well have bought a new razor. I found these things, but my razor model wasn&#x27;t listed. I emailed the company, and the president responded. He told me which model to buy, and said just to take the blades out, set them in the sharpener, and turn it by hand for 15 seconds.   It&#x27;s like having a new razor now. I run the razor across my face and it&#x27;s smooth, no multiple passes or pushing down hard. It really made a huge difference. I don&#x27;t know how many times I can sharpen it before I finally need new blades, but these are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> nice would recommend ;;</li>
            <li> Vollco Sharpening Heads For Select Norelco Models&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, it will save you a lot of time shaving just buy being able to sharpen the blades on your electric razor. If you just try it I promise you will LOVE it!  [[ASIN:B00126ZXPI Vollco Sharpening Heads For Select Norelco Models]]  They even have other styles that fit other brands. Take a LOOK1</li>
            <li> So much better than spending $60 on replacement heads.</li>
            <li> You may not need to sharpen the blades at all!  Just tried  the sharpening ritual on a Norelco and found the cleaning process to be the secret.  After disassembly, upon flicking the blades with my finger tip, they seemed quite sharp.  However, the wadded up hair inconspicuously packed between the cutting blades was like super-dense felt, obstructing \\&quot;hair flow\\&quot;, and was VERY difficult to persuade to let go. ..it took better than 20 minutes to worry it loose (finger nail works good...maybe a toothpick)...don&#x27;t be in a hurry).  As an experiment, I didn&#x27;t bother with sharpening.  The razor is as good as new many years ago....nice and fast and decent shave. So, the real improvement from the \\&quot;sharpening\\&quot; process is probably the removal of the gunk that can&#x27;t be reached with the little cleaning brush, or be seen externally.</li>
            <li> still using it. saved a pile of money</li>
            <li> With 3 razors in need of new blades, this was certainly worth a try and we couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. The sharpening \\&quot;heads\\&quot; work as well and as quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I also was a little skeptical, but after seeing how they work (clever design) and experiencing the before/after difference, I&#x27;m convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone also mentioned that your razor may not need a blade sharpener, just a good cleaning, but routine cleaning of ANY razor is both important and assumed, and blades DO get dull with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One clue that it works: before sharpening, you could hear almost every whisker as it got chopped off.  Now it is about 20% as loud.  The shave is noticeably smoother as well.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product . It beats paying big $ for new blades . Note : this will not sharpen the ones with blue on them ( looks like the shaver co. has done something to prevent sharpening ) .</li>
            <li> I recommend it for any Phillips/Norelco rotary shaver. definitely cheaper that replacing dull cutters, also fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> Worked simply as shown online and definitely improved my blades considerably and stopped me having to dump them for new ones.</li>
            <li> What a money saver!!! I&#x27;ve been using this puppy on a set of blades I purchased about 2 years ago, and it works like a charm.  I&#x27;m super impressed that the blades come back like-new every time I use it (once every 4 months or so).  It&#x27;s definitely been saving me money in the long run :)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need this product (cleverly priced just slightly below the price of new heads). Google for \\&quot;How to sharpen a Norelco electric shaver\\&quot;, and try their simple procedure with a mirror.   Essentially, you put the blade on the razor without the screen and let it rotate pressed against a moist (or otherwise lubricated) mirror for a few seconds. The glass will sharpen the blade, and you will save yourself $30 on new heads, and $20 on the head sharpener!</li>
            <li> Instructions for use are printed on a sticker that is pasted externally on the packaging.  The vendor, Total Vac, is more interested in letting the buyer know who they are than allowing you to read the instructions.  They stupidly paste their name right over the instructions.  Impossible to peel off their name without destroying the instructions.  So: CAN&#x27;T USE THE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> good way to save money and keep your razor sharpe  you will like it I did and would reccomend it</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay, hoping to extend the life of my razor&#x27;s blades and save the expense of replacing them before absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> The sharpening heads helped since my blades are three years old but they still don&#x27;t cut like they did when they were new. Perhaps if I were using these sharpening heads at an earlier stage in the life of my blades they&#x27;d be in better shape...</li>
            <li> This is really quite amazing. I have had a Norelco 7345XL for four or five years which still runs well but the blades were very dull. After looking at the cost of new heads I was considering just getting a new shaver. Seems like I am always throwing out otherwise perfectly good stuff because I cannot get something minor fixed. Thought I would try the Vollco sharpener heads based on the positive reviews but was sceptical.  Followed the instruction video above which was simple. They worked great - shaved off a three day beard like a new razor! I recommend these without hesitation. As others have stated these look like they can be used multiple times - seems like I will be in business as long as the battery and motor holds out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a little help can make a Big difference. This is it, low cost, fast fix for dull blades.&lt;br /&gt;For those inbetween time this is a face saver.</li>
            <li> Really work very well and a lot cheaper than replacing blades.</li>
            <li> This is allowing me to use my original Norelco razor with the blade that came with it three years ago.  I only need to sharpen the blades using this once a year and the Norelco is as good as it was before.  Great product, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in writing long reviews on items like this. Does it work as advertised - YES. Is it worth the money - YES. I figure to save at least $75 by getting three sharpenings or more. I suggest that you layout the heads on the table in a triangle pattern and then place the blades in the razor in a matching sequence so you will be able to keep them paired as suggested by the manufacturer. I got a close shave after the first useage.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.  Sharpened two razors and neither improved, in fact got worse. Something must be wrong with the product I received or this product does not produce expected results.</li>
            <li> Why buy replacement heads at half the price of the razor if you can just resharpen them?  At a fraction of the price of a razor these can be reused to sharpen your blades several times and save you a lot of money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have 3 Norelco razors, 2 are at least 3yrs old. I have sharpened those 2  and  they are like new.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as most, but once product arrived I opened the securely packaged sharpening heads and mounted them immediately into my Norleco.  My blades were months overdue for new ones, so I thought what the heck?  At half the cost if it works even half as good, I am fine, right?&lt;br /&gt;Well, I followed the directions, mounted them in the shaver and sharpened for 3-5 seconds as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews said to do it longer for a better sharpening, but my experience with thin metal is you can always do it more but you can&#x27;t go back.  So I was careful not to lose the temper of the metal blade.  Needless to say, I popped the blades back in and tried shaving and presto!  Wow, no redness, pulling, nicking, or anything else I can speak ill of.&lt;br /&gt;These things are the real deal Holyfield!  Give them a try!  Follow the directions and say goodbye to expensive replacements forever!</li>
            <li> Was hopeful, but skeptical.  The results were great!  I had forgotten what a close shave could be from my electric razor.</li>
            <li> ...and, unfortunately, the jury is still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, keeping the heads and shaving cups matched, running the shaver in the sharpening cups for 10 seconds, and replacing the heads and shaving cups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it work? Kind of. The shaver doesn&#x27;t tug my beard, so I guess it is sharp(er), but a razor it ain&#x27;t. I may sharpen the blades again for a bit longer and see if it is more noticeable. If so, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li> My shaves are definitely better. Much closer shave and does not pull anymore.</li>
            <li> Sharpens amazingly well. Very easy to use and worked great. I brushed-out and blew-out the Norelco shave after every use, but the shave deteriorated after many years (I have been using this shaver for about 7 years). I looked into buy replacement heads, but decided to try the sharpening method instead.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Vollco sharpener and followed the directions on the package. After taking the shaver apart (it takes about 30 seconds), I cleaned the shaver heads. I noticed the shaver heads and holders were loaded with lint, hair and shaved hair particles. I was so surprised at the amount of stuff in there, that ,after thoroughly cleaning with tweezers and brush, I thought I would see if the shaver worked again - before sharpening. It did work, but still was not up to par. I sharpened the heads for 3 seconds per sharpening instructions then tried the shaver again. IT WORKED LIKE BRAND NEW!!!  I highly recommend this sharpener.</li>
            <li> Ripoff--didn&#x27;t make the head any better. Charges a lot of money for three pieces of sandpaper cut in circles.Make your own. Then, when it doesn&#x27;t work. you won&#x27;t feel so bad.</li>
            <li> I tried this item according to the instructions. There was No improvement with my existing blades. I ordered new blades and the difference was totally different.</li>
            <li> I found these sharpeners to work very well for my shaver. i would recommend  Thanks</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in time.  I used it and it sharpened the blades to an acceptable level.  Very easy to use.  However, the blades were not sharpened at the same level as a brand new pair.  Maybe to a level after a couple months use.  Either way, for me the blades give a clean shave and I have the advantage to keep them sharpened at this level so it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this for my  &amp;#34;Phillip Norelco 7110X,&amp;#34;  and I must say i was really impressed from the first time I&#x27;ve re-sharpened my blades to now. I&#x27;ve used it twice since I&#x27;ve bought it; it sharpens those blades like new. Blades feels like the first time I used my Norelco shaving machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this to anyone who want to save some bucks-instead of purchasing replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, hoping to not need a new set of blades for a while. What came in the package was three plastic cups which fit where the screens normally go. Glued into the bottom of each of these cups was a circle of fine sandpaper. It was evenly pressed into place. When I used it, according to the directions, it did improve blade sharpness, but they were not nearly as sharp as new ones. That&#x27;s ok, but I would have liked better. After a while, I went to sharpen the blades again. I got similar results, but when I went to remove the blades from the cups, I noticed that the sandpaper at the bottom was starting to tear in two of them. I have since bought another NEW set of blades and screens, and the difference is amazing. I will not be buying this again</li>
            <li> This item works as expected. Somehow it manages to sharpen the existing heads well enough to improve their cuts, and on very old heads, too.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Vollco Sharpening Heads at the same time that I ordered a new set of heads for my Philips Norelco electric razor, because, frankly, I was skeptical that the sharpening heads could do what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why: the razor was more than four years old and the heads had never been changed. Maintenance consisted of dusting out the heads daily, rinsing with water weekly, and spraying with head lubricant after the rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was pulling hairs and pinching to an unacceptable degree.&lt;br /&gt;The new brand-name heads arrived first and I tried them. No surprise, I was reminded of why I purchased a new shaver in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;But I still saved my old heads and waited for the Vollco product.&lt;br /&gt;Days later, when the Vollco Sharpening Heads arrived I tried them out for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I read a review suggesting that a little bit of use is all that&#x27;s needed--somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I listened to that advice and took a conservative approach. I gave the old heads 5 seconds with the sharpening heads, figuring I could give them a longer spin if that wasn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the treated shaving heads and gave the shaver a try.&lt;br /&gt;Your experience may of course be different than mine, but I could not tell the difference between the re-sharpened heads and the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I put the new heads away in a safe place and have been re-sharpening the old ones and re-using them since then. I expect they may not continue a whole lot longer to respond as well as they are now to this procedure, but who cares?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how well these sharpening heads worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now added a 5-second spin with the sharpening heads to my weekly razor maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would recommend it based on my experience.</li>
            <li> i stumbled across this item looking for replacement blades. Seeing that i was not able to find my correct replacement blades i decided to give Vollco Sharpening Heads a try. The heads are more than half the cost of new blades. i followed the directions to the letter and behold it was simple, fast and very cost effective. the shaver works like new! Best investment ever seeing i use the razor almost every day. i use my shaver with Pre-Shave Stick by Remington. the Pre-Shave Stick is a wonderful product. i never get any irritation or burns.</li>
            <li> Works well once you figure how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t appear that the sharpener heads will last long.  We will see</li>
            <li> Cheap way to keep your shave comfotable.  Grat product.  Great price.</li>
            <li> This item was touted as way to increase the life of Norelco s blades with sharpening heads for the razor.  These plastic discs contain a tiny circle of very fine sandpaper that didactically nothing to sharpen the blades.  I am very disappointed that I wasted $20 on these that I could have put toward new blades. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy a piece of 1200 grit wet or dry sandpaper and use that for the same effect.  You will have enough sandpaper on one sheet to last a lifetime</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad.  And he said that while it takes him 4&#x27; to shave with new razors, it was 15&#x27; - with old and  after he sharpened &amp;#34;the saw&amp;#34;, it was 7&#x27;.  Great improvement for the old-old dull razors.</li>
            <li> it works as advertised, have had the razor for 7 or so years, thought I&#x27;d have to buy new one but now it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li> Had two Norelco shavers that needed new cutting blades and decided to try these sharpening heads.  They worked exactly as described, sharpening both shavers and saving me $25.00 plus.  Would highly recommend this item over buying replacement blades!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and, additionally, did take care to keep each blade with it&#x27;s mating foil.  I could really tell the difference on the first sharpening, so I figure I&#x27;m even at this point.  One more use and I&#x27;m ahead.  I suspect you do come to the point where the material removed by the sharpening and the natural wear of the foils from use is such that further resharpening won&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I installed the 3 sharpeners and ran my razor for just a few seconds.  I then reenstalled the original parts and was shocked as to how well it renewed the cutting.  I am sure it helped to thoroughly clean the heads in the process.</li>
            <li> I used to buy new heads for my razors but got tired of the expense.  These are great.  When my blades get dull I use these and they are sharp again.  I have been using it 5 years and they still work great sharpening the blades.  My blades haven&#x27;t worn down and I get great clean shaves after using this.  I use it about every 6 months.  They are easy to use, simply pop the razor open like you are cleaning it, take the blades out of the heads, place these in where the heads should be, replace the blades and put the razor back together- run for 5 seconds and bingo- the blades are sharp.  Take the top off, remove the sharpeners and put the original heads back in with the original blades.  It really takes very little time and works great.</li>
            <li> This really works great. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> A very simple and effective way to sharper the blades on my Norelco.  The sharpener worked great and I can save plenty of dollars on replacement heads ($35 each time)!</li>
            <li> Followed the directions but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I really saved any money with this.  It did work, but not that great, and not like having brand new blades</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. I was surprised it worked so well. I recommend the sharpener to anyone who uses any Norelco razor heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this device a short while,but it seems to have worked ok.  I THINK THAT I MAY HAVE TOP</li>
            <li> my electric shaver was mostly sharper when i used these heads. they weren&#x27;t like brand new, but you could definitely feel the difference</li>
            <li> old three blades were not sharp, put sharping heads on old three blades and keep old three blades sharp well</li>
            <li> It does the job, I only sharpen my blades every three months or so, the little grated plastic caps haven&#x27;t worn down yet!</li>
            <li> Excellent results!  A 3 second run was all it took to restore the blades to factory sharpness.</li>
            <li> Sharpening procedure was easy &amp; fast.  My old blades were so old &amp; worn, I thought they would have to be replaced.  Five seconds sharpening time restored them like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Norelco intermittently for years, but didn&#x27;t want to purchase replacement heads.  The Vollco sharpening heads worked well.</li>
            <li> I came across this sharpener looking for a replacement battery for my es8066.. I figured I would look at replacement blades and screens at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I decided to look at the shaver&#x27;s head more closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered was the screens&#x27; posts or shafts the cutters ride on need to be cleaned as well as the recess (hole) for the shafts in the cutters&#x27; centers.. A small cheap jeweler&#x27;s screw driver set&#x27;s flat blade works good. Greasy and hairy build up keep the blades from riding against the screens. If the blades can not ride against the screen not only will they not \\&quot;shear\\&quot; the hairs like a scissor but also will not &#x27;self sharpen&#x27;. Instead the blades whack off the hair like a weed whacker rather than cutting like a hedge trimmer.  Or worse, it pulls the hair under the screen (much like a crappy pair of scissors) and yanks it out of your skin. Especially on your neck. Ow! ow!...@*&amp;^#&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this sharpener anyways because it seems a like convenient idea. In the meantime until it gets here, I have a DMT \\&quot;green\\&quot; diamond sharper [[...]] I ran the cutters over it on wet spit:)for about ten circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cutters are 3 years old. They are now like knew. When the battery and sharpeners gets here so I get up the shaver up to full speed and last longer than one shave I&#x27;ll finale hone the cutters with these sharpeners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be continued.....</li>
            <li> A new set of blades for my Norelco can cost upwards of $30. I bought this in November 2011 and have used it 3 times. Without this, I&#x27;d have had to buy new blades last year. Each time I use this my razor shaves like it has new blades. Yesterday, I shaved and noticed my razor blades appeared very dull. Took a long time to shave and still it didn&#x27;t feel like I had shaved. Last night I cleaned and re-sharpened the blades(15 minute task) and voila! Quick, comfortable close shave this morning.</li>
            <li> Just perfect. Exactly what we needed. What&#x27;s more, Amazon let us know the price had dropped by five dollars and subsequently refunded that amount to us.</li>
            <li> Actually, I haven&#x27;t bought this product but after reading the negative reviews I thought I&#x27;d try this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove the heads from your razor, keeping the cutters with their matching heads.  Clean everything (i used a toothbrush and then just blew on them).  Lay a sheet of 400 grit wetordry sandpaper (available at most auto parts and home centers) flat on a table, desk or workbench, gritty side up.  Take one cutter and place it cutter side down on the sandpaper.  Carefully, lower your motor assembly so that one of the drives locks into the cutter.  Hold the motor tightly so you don&#x27;t move it and without putting any significant pressure on the cutter, turn on the motor for about 5 seconds.  Blow off the cutter and put it with its matching head.  Repeat for the other cutters, reassemble and start shaving.  Mine worked like new after doing this.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t see me spending $25 for replacement heads of a razor that I paid $36 for. The product works. No the blades don&#x27;t feel like new, but they are definitely better. Since you only sharpen for 3-5 seconds, I anticipate this lasting for years.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive upon purchase of this item. but after using it twice now I can say with due respect, that it does a fine job of sharpening your razor heads, it is easy to use and as stated above, can be used over and over again...</li>
            <li> I can tell it had an effect on the blades, but not enough to really tell any difference.  Maybe running it longer than recommended will help, but I don&#x27;t want to chance ruining the blades..</li>
            <li> these sharpeners work great they save you lots of money in the long run they arrived on time and in good condition</li>
            <li> Save your money buying new blades. This simple device will restore your old blades good as new. Make sure your razor model is listed. Not all blades will fit.</li>
            <li> This product works very well ! The trick being not to exceed the 3 to 4 seconds to sharpen the heads . (over use will lessen the temper)  Very Cool !</li>
            <li> First of all the product got here a day early. I like prompt delivery. Second, the price was right compared to spending 45 to 50 bucks on a new set of heads for your Norelco shaver. What&#x27;s not to love there? But third and the \\&quot;wow\\&quot; part is how the blades shave after a five minute process. Like new! In fact, I think, better than new! My heads were a few years old and it was getting brutal to get a good fast shave. Plunked in these sharpeners, ran them for 7 or 8 seconds (they recommend 5 seconds), pulled them out and put the screens back in and boom! What a shave! Would recommend to anybody. (Suggestions: Clean your heads first with a good water rinse; when you take out the cutters, make sure you put them back into the screens they came out of; while the screens are out, clean them with water again and look for hair, etc. to remove; and do make sure the cutters go back into the screen they came out of.)</li>
            <li> Was looking for a cheaper way to replace blades on my Norelco Razor. This product fit the bill at 1/2 cost of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Never knew about such a product but decided to try them for the price. They work great! Do not waste your money purchasing new heads for your electric razor. After the first use, it made them new again. Do not know how many times I can continue resharping the heads I have now but saving money once surely offsets the purchase price. Thank you Vollco.</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping they would work.  Well they did, and at half the price of new blades.  Even if I only get one use out of them I will come out ahead financially. But judging by the looks of them after the first use I should get several uses.</li>
            <li> The price was right. Cheaper than buying new Heads. I got in on time. When I got home and opened it up I sharpened the two Norelco &amp;#34;Relfex Action&amp;#34; razors that I had for many many years. That was like getting two new razors.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT TO SHARPEN ONE NORELCO SHAVER, THE KIT STILL WORKS ON ANY ROTARY SHAVER THAT THE HEADS FIT PROPERLY. I AM ON MY THIRD, OR MAYBE FOURTH RAZOR, NOW. THE BLADES SHARPEN WELL 3 OR 4TIMES AT ABOUT AN 8-9 MONTH FREQUENCY, THEN THEY ARE TOO WORN OUT TO TAKE A NEW EDGE. AROUND HOLIDAYS ESPECIALLY CHRISTMAS, YOU CAN GET NEW RAZORS ON SALE VERY CHEAPLY AND REPLACEMENT BLADES USUALLY COST THE SAME OR MORE!</li>
