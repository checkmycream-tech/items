            <li>THIS tool, however is WELL worth the price!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was overjoyed by how much better my feet looked after just this first go.</li>
            <li>With one use I now have soft nice smooth feet.</li>
            <li>Light to hold and is much easier to use than most manual methods.  </li>
            <li>and now it is just a quick pass over that area to keep it smooth.</li>
            <li>but  most importantly my feet are much healthier now .definitely</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to do as much with the first use, but follow the directions they give you and with regular care, your feet will be very happy and you will feel ready to wear those cute summer sandals without worry.</li>
            <li>So when I want to get something I go to my special place.</li>
            <li>and finally I do see good  results,  </li>
            <li>I love this soooo much.</li>
            <li>I get the best results when using slow, circular motion on the problem areas.  </li>
            <li>but i was quickly contacted by the seller and issue was solved very prompt and respectful</li>
            <li>Great product and received sooner than expected!</li>
            <li>I had read all most of the comments and I was a little skeptic but surprisingly this Pedicure Foot File does work.</li>
            <li>This product is working very good thus far but have only had it for one week.  </li>
            <li>There may be a better, similar product out there, but I LOVE the technology.</li>
            <li>Now, after about 8 days, I find that my calluses do not reappear so quickly</li>
            <li>Received quickly.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>bought at Amazon the Nature Tech Pedi, in short it did a wonderful job in a short time.</li>
            <li>and I saw a really quick results comparing how my feet  looks before I use the machine .&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>and I put some of my favorite lotion on and some soft furry socks before bed, and Feet THANK ME in the morning!!</li>
            <li>It requires a pretty light touch.</li>
            <li>My feet are smooth and pretty</li>
            <li>so I can keep my feet in good condition once I get them there, which shouldn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, cracked feet or calluses then this product is all you need to get your feet feeling good again.</li>
            <li>after the first week wait a couple of days to make sure you don&#x27;t take to much skin off..</li>
            <li>Enjoying this item so far!</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>Love this thing, works well so far and smooths out your feet quickly.</li>
            <li>its okay for the price, might just be as easy to use a nail file that will do the same thing as this product.</li>
            <li>i had very cracked dry feet, but this worked great.</li>
            <li>Hard to control, does not do a very good job.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer said, do just a little at a time, though; that is what I have been doing, and it&#x27;s been great--</li>
            <li>This one I can get under them and a little between them too which is great.</li>
            <li>Nice product...could be a little more powerful</li>
            <li>you so much for the free bonus feet repair cream ,helps a lot&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could really see a huge improvement to them.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to not use too much at once.</li>
            <li>More refills are available from the same vendor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall well worth the $20.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it one of my rare 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I already purchased a second one to give to my Mother.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you&#x27;re patient, like the instructions say, this is worth the time.</li>
            <li>after reading reviews i was second guessing getting it, but honestly this works so well.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this thing works far better than using a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>and I can see I will get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>I am an elementary school librarian</li>
            <li>Not as good a quality as I expected.</li>
            <li>and I now love her silky soft feet rubbing against my legs when we sleep.</li>
            <li>Takes time, but worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and worked great on my icky feet.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is great and the shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li>My feet feel better than after a pedicure with the first use and after the second use they are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Quick, easy, soft feet in minutes.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of practice getting the right pressure and gliding movement</li>
            <li>It worked right away</li>
            <li>and i saw results right away.</li>
            <li>I cannot rate something that does not work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>but once you practice you can eventually use it with the right gentleness to allow it to spin nonstop.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to clean up so much.</li>
            <li>My feet finally feel soft and wonderful all the time - I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear open shoes and not afraid to snag</li>
            <li>This is sooo easy to use and the results were better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Another great small investment.</li>
            <li>Works GREAT for my dried - cracked work roughened feet -- used it right away - -VERY</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and comes with an extra file, which I have note used yet.</li>
            <li>So far I have used three times for me and one time for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use and worked well for me to remove my callus on my feet (men).</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I spent over an hour &amp; went through one set of batteries but didn&#x27;t end up with silky smooth feet &amp; heels, although they appeared much better after applying foot cream.  </li>
            <li>Although the first one I got was defective, they were very helpful and quick to replace it.</li>
            <li>and they reply very fast,  </li>
            <li>It feels very comfortable against my skin and you can see the results almost instantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and it smoothens out the thick skin in a gentle, fast and effective way.  </li>
            <li>Now I am not shy showing my feet in front of people.</li>
            <li>really love this product its  the second day I&#x27;m using it,&lt;br</li>
            <li>if or you most definitely.</li>
            <li>It is the first one I have tried.</li>
            <li>Something that actually works at removing calluses and makes my feet baby smooth!</li>
            <li>I like the smooth action.  </li>
            <li>Actually got better results than at manicure/pedicure locations.  </li>
            <li>I just put in the two batteries (not included) and three minutes later my feet were already looking so much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to use it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>but nothing has come close to giving me a long lasting and great solution like this foot filer.</li>
            <li>My feet feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>pretty study</li>
            <li>I just used it and it isn&#x27;t going to fix it on the first time.</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well</li>
            <li>You must follow the directions which are not complicated</li>
            <li>this does not work very well!</li>
            <li>Love the price too compared to similar products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to remove everything the first time.</li>
            <li>He helped me fix my unit and understand what exactly the problem was.</li>
            <li>Deep cracks that bleed most of the time.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more for Christmas gifts later this year!</li>
            <li>Instructions are actually pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it twice a week for the first two weeks, then backed off to once per week and even longer.</li>
            <li>but no,  unit was pretty exspensive for one use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s an extra bonus for me : )</li>
            <li>so it took me a few days to get good  </li>
            <li>Yes, it worked, but I still had to use the sanding things to smooth out the really super ruff condition left from the grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited that it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to do a little bit daily, and before you know it, your feet are as soft as ever!</li>
            <li>and the next day my feet were so smooth, like freshly shaven legs.</li>
            <li>After working on them for about 10 minutes all told (going from callous to callous and then starting all over again more times than I could keep count on) there was very noticeable progress on all of the callouses.</li>
            <li>Never realized my feet could feel so good with so little effort!</li>
            <li>Very glad I bought this little machine.</li>
            <li>I have only had this for a few days but WOW - it works great!</li>
            <li>Had for a long time use many types of paper files.  </li>
            <li>This is a great gadget for those very rough spots you have when the foot filer is not enough.</li>
            <li>Even with all the work I put the rollers through they seem to have plenty of life left in them, and cleanup was just as easy as the instructions</li>
            <li>Works good but batteries dont seem to last that long in it.</li>
            <li>You must have brand new batteries!!</li>
            <li>I found with the first use this wiped out most of the issue, but just isn&#x27;t powerful enough to get the really deep cracks.</li>
            <li>Nice little product.  </li>
            <li>You have to use good batteries and follow directions it comes with (don&#x27;t press too hard.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once and cannot believe what a huge difference it made.  </li>
            <li>Recomended highly!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really need to get pedicures</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t afford to get one as often as I&#x27;d like to so this really helping me to save quite a bit of money</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>And thanks for efficient delivery</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do anything much to sand away callouses....</li>
            <li>(so much work)</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive batteries hoping they would be more powerful but no change.</li>
            <li>Remember not to use it too much at a time.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY SMOOTHES AND REJUVENATE THE FEET..</li>
            <li>It saved me so much money on getting pedicure in a salon.</li>
            <li>Works well but wheel wears out fast</li>
            <li>It did not come with batteries, so have yours ready, because you will want to use this immediately.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>thank you soooo much.</li>
            <li>wife says it works very well</li>
            <li>At this stage, I can&#x27;t think of any negatives, as even as a man with big hands the unit is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Really expected more.</li>
            <li>My sister borrowed it and after using it was ready to get one.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to anyone  who wants a DIY and to save $$$</li>
            <li>This product worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>But it works really well.</li>
            <li>so I could really check this gadget out.</li>
            <li>they always cut my skin with a razor sometimes too much and&lt;</li>
            <li>I really like this gadget.  </li>
            <li>but this has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>Do not apply to much pressure when using.  </li>
            <li>Really, really works....</li>
            <li>and the fact I can use it in the shower is a real plus.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I really like the foot ointment too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My advice is use it very Sparingly BEFORE Showers. ...</li>
            <li>IT IS A VERY PAINFULL MISTAKE...</li>
            <li>It is very efficient.</li>
            <li>Hazardous waste suit and plastic sheeting.</li>
            <li>I only needed it on my left foot one time, but the right foot needed it used twice more.</li>
            <li>~ there&#x27;s really no work involved and you can see results after the first time!!!</li>
            <li>you wont have baby soft feet right off the bat...</li>
            <li>In fact, the only other time my feet felt so good was after a pedicure at a salon.</li>
            <li>After the first use I was very surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>Works better than all of the other scrubbers I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other ones that were much much better</li>
            <li>(Have to press hard and turn &amp;#34;battery holder&amp;#34; cover and it is not that easy to fit parts)  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised they include inside the package  a really nice travel size foot balm All natural ingredients for my feet to complete the treatment ,makes a big difference !!.</li>
            <li>its ok little under powered and runs threw the power fast</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like my feet are brand new!</li>
            <li>but I just clean my feet with the heel on the toilet seat before I take a shower</li>
            <li>Once you learn to respect how much dry skin it takes off, you will really enjoy it...</li>
            <li>Not as expensive as most, but works fantastic!</li>
            <li>A total waste of good money.</li>
            <li>I have always had big callouses on the balls of my feet/heels (former dancer), and this helped smooth them out!</li>
            <li>As you get older</li>
            <li>If you have very thick calluses, the kind I have had that grind holes in your socks, this device won&#x27;t get rid of them right away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product</li>
            <li>and I would also highly recommend NATURE TECH based on the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I hardly ever write reviews on products but this REALLY WORKS!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I love this little machine.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>Does a nice job on hard callusses.</li>
            <li>I can do it as often as I want and with my busy life and limited finances, it makes it easy for me to take care of my feet without limitation.</li>
            <li>Really like this product so far.</li>
            <li>Finally lotion is able to get to the actually heels to make them soft.</li>
            <li>Use it every few days and love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really worth the money especially  with a bonus foot balm</li>
            <li>I then switched to the standard head and worked on the whole of each foot to finish off my first use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>IT DEFINITELY work and is WORTH the money.</li>
            <li>but then it&#x27;s was really easy to maintain my feet  the second and third time</li>
            <li>No more trouble after using this product, Feet are smooth and nice after all these years.</li>
            <li>Taken a little off everyday works great</li>
            <li>I put in brand new batteries</li>
            <li>OMG my feet are new again.</li>
            <li>New batteries and won&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
            <li>I LIVE IN FLORIDA</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier - the motor doesn&#x27;t have a strong torque so don&#x27;t expect too much just a bit of patience and the stone will remove the hard skin off your feet.  </li>
            <li>Use the unit on the dry foot, follow with a quick rinse and apply foot cream.  </li>
            <li>While it does a great job in removing scales the scales will come back even worse than before.  </li>
            <li>It has performed as I expected and is doing a good job in removing the built up dead skin from my feet.  </li>
            <li>I used to wear a lot of flip flops or didn&#x27;t wear socks from high school through my early 20s, which caused my heels to become callous.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember a time when my feet have ever been this soft!</li>
            <li>My feet are soft!</li>
            <li>You will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>but I definitely did notice a difference just from my first use.</li>
            <li>or I would have sent it back after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Ordering a different brand that&#x27;s electric &amp; has a higher speed.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>First time with the courser paper, and again with the smaller grit paper.</li>
            <li>my feet are smooth in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to remove dead cells on heels and feet.</li>
            <li>Personally, I like my Ped Egg shaver and will probably go back to using that as long as I&#x27;m able to.</li>
            <li>Weak, but effective device.</li>
            <li>Kind of weak.</li>
            <li>very worth the price, which is less than paying someone to do this for me.  </li>
            <li>I wear high heels all day every day to work which causes some MAJOR callouses.  </li>
            <li>This product only works removing speckles of dead skin keeping feet smooth if used once a week for about a half an hour or more along with a manual handheld foot smoother followed by foot cream.  </li>
            <li>It works on just the dry skin and when I used it on a more sensitive part of my foot, it went down deep enough to reach the dry skin and not hurt the healthy tissue beneath.</li>
            <li>It came as promised, instruction was clear.</li>
            <li>and they were soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to go  and do professional pedicure and pay money for it.</li>
            <li>My feet are so much smoother and nicer in only two days!</li>
            <li>Makes your feet soft and tender</li>
            <li>Now, the batteries last much longer.</li>
            <li>It works but I need to use it frequently to maintain smoothness.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews on this thing.  </li>
            <li>naturally my feet take a toll.  </li>
            <li>, JUST REMEMBER NOT TO PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON ROLLER,IT IS ONLY A BATTARY POWERED MOTOR</li>
            <li>But does make feet soft....</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought this before, but better late than never.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not that type of person , I can tell you this pedicure machine definitely definitely helped me so much  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and still on the original roller.</li>
            <li>and one more thing you need to glide it gently over your dry feet areas don&#x27;t press  hard</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes my heels were very smooth and the dry skin was gone.</li>
            <li>I seriously can&#x27;t believe how much better they are.  </li>
            <li>The heads seem to last a decent amount of time, I have had it about 2 weeks now and havent had to replace 1 yet.</li>
            <li>I have a different one I have been using mainly on my husbands feet but couldn&#x27;t get under his toes with it.</li>
            <li>But that is because I have mostly walked on my right foot for the past three years (while recovering from breaking my left leg twice - each a year apart from each other).</li>
            <li>The soles and heels were much smoother and looked considerably better than they had before I started, and my horrid, rough and ugly callouses were mostly smoothed over.</li>
            <li>I had been looking and checking at our local Super center, but I could not find it or they couldn,t find it, or they were out.</li>
            <li>Oh, it works and my feet were bad and now BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li>I normally have to pumice every night, I only have to use this a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>It runs fine as long as you hold it upright or sideways, however, you point down with it to go toward your feet (for which I might add it is meant for) it quits running.  </li>
            <li>I just received this item &amp; after going thru 3 sets of new batteries can only conclude that the tool is defective.  </li>
            <li>I have very severe Eczema, and my feet get incredibly dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going very often to a nail salon for a pedicure for my dry feet  </li>
            <li>I use it for my pedicures and it really got rid of the dry skin and callouses.</li>
            <li>next morning my heels look and feel very soft.</li>
            <li>At first I used the foot file every day to wear down the decades old calluses.</li>
            <li>After carefully using it on the day I got it as to not over do it and end up with sore raw tootsies, I now use it once a week for maintenance and have never had such smooth pretty feet.</li>
            <li>Although the directions said to wash your feet first, I saw other recommendations to use this device before you showered.</li>
            <li>The larger grit paper worked faster, but left jagged rough skin, so that had to be filed off to smooth with the smaller grit</li>
            <li>This works fine on your feet if you use it at least once a week for a touch up.  </li>
            <li>I use to dig out the extra calluses with a special nail clipper leaving it very red and not pretty.</li>
            <li>I have had callouses for years and they are hard to smooth out.</li>
            <li>Perhaps adding a Low and High function to subsequent models would help.  </li>
            <li>I finally after 20years have soft feet.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has made these old dancer feet look presentable again.  </li>
            <li>br careful to not apply too much preasue</li>
            <li>Not too rough, not too gentle.</li>
            <li>It is not at all powerful or harsh, as I said, it stops spinning when it gets the slightest converse resistance.</li>
            <li>just like I&#x27;ve spent $$$ on a professional pedicure!!!</li>
            <li>The Good:  Actually removed several, aged hard calluses!  </li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and gently applied the callous remover to my heel.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and they are all the real deal.  </li>
            <li>You have to be extra careful in not applying too much pressure or it will brake which is what happened in my case.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend getting this product if you have rough feet and/or callouses.</li>
            <li>ONE* treatment to my left foot and none to my right (except a few seconds on the ball of my foot before stopping to take a picture).</li>
            <li>sooooo smooth and dry and cracked skin was no more with in just seconds</li>
            <li>Use gently and daily and it will keep the rough spots on your feet at bay!</li>
            <li>Also customer service is so pleasent to talk with, I had trouble with it at first</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot or burn your skin and it takes of the dead skin.  </li>
            <li>If you press down too much it will stop working at all.</li>
            <li>Keep the unit moving lightly over the heel and sides of foot, wherever you have hard, dry skin or calluses.  </li>

            <li> on top of it I don&#x27;t have time to go to a nail salon</li>
            <li> My beautiful wife loves it as she shows off her now lovely feet to all she encounters with her new collection of sandals</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After receiving it today, I read through the instructions (thorough and understandable), installed the batteries (easy to accomplish) and went outside to have some good lighting and to avoid having skin fly everywhere inside.</li>
            <li> Amazing, right?!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, works very well and is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I used very light easy strokes ( because that&#x27;s all you need to do).</li>
            <li> does a pretty good job</li>
            <li> Only good thing is I loved the color.</li>
            <li> I find it works best on dry skin!</li>
            <li> Also, the turning wheel is easy to clean and replace!</li>
            <li> I will continue to put aquafor on my feet every night but my feet were easily transformed with this foot file.</li>
            <li> His will take a few more treatments to remove all of the calluses but his feet look the best they have since I met him almost 16 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sooooo easy...</li>
            <li> well designed, easy to use.</li>
            <li> but honestly the PedEgg is better and fast.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and</li>
            <li> It was also easy to hold,perfect in my hand.</li>
            <li> I liked this sander so much that I bought my mom one, who I inherited the grand canyon heels from.</li>
            <li> So easy</li>
            <li> feel nice and smooth - price is right</li>
            <li> I love this product it is easy to use and it works great, it will hurt your feet if you use this for to long</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, by far the best device I have purchased for this use.  </li>
            <li> but the rep was very knowledgable and was able to solve my issue right over the phone!!!</li>
            <li> Mine did stop but worked fine after resting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press this thing down when you use it - hold it lightly on the callus for best results.</li>
            <li> I am in absolute love with this!</li>
            <li> anytime anywhere it&#x27;s really easy  and good for my feet maintenance ,it works great for especially if you have really dry cracked heels like I do,  to be honest</li>
            <li> EASY to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to clean.  </li>

            <li> There was a huge difference after one use</li>
            <li> Using this every night and a cream is making a huge difference on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but this product has produced outstanding results for my wife.  </li>
            <li> In a minute I had smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Great value with the extra roller and cleaning brush!</li>
            <li> This could be improved by adding power settings, allowing for a more powerful grind.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it became.</li>
            <li> The tool fits in my hands well, and is easy to use, and clean.</li>

            <li> This is a great addition to personal care products.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to smooth the skin on my feet once sandal season started this summer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However I do feel it&#x27;s most effective with fresh batteries, so I think it goes through them fast.</li>
            <li> and my feet feel and look smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> Filled the bathroom with foot crud dust.</li>

            <li> Not as powerful as I would like it to be, but better than doing it by hand</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Delivered early and used right away with great results.</li>
            <li> Works really well!!!</li>
            <li> My feet feel pretty!!  </li>

            <li> But, it is so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This gently removes callus and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> this little device, my feet are always smooth and looks great :)</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t kill your AA batteries and the stone lasts surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> THIS tool, however is WELL worth the price!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was overjoyed by how much better my feet looked after just this first go.</li>
            <li> With one use I now have soft nice smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Light to hold and is much easier to use than most manual methods.  </li>
            <li> and now it is just a quick pass over that area to keep it smooth.</li>
            <li> but  most importantly my feet are much healthier now .definitely</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to do as much with the first use, but follow the directions they give you and with regular care, your feet will be very happy and you will feel ready to wear those cute summer sandals without worry.</li>
            <li> So when I want to get something I go to my special place.</li>
            <li> and finally I do see good  results,  </li>
            <li> I love this soooo much.</li>
            <li> I get the best results when using slow, circular motion on the problem areas.  </li>
            <li> but i was quickly contacted by the seller and issue was solved very prompt and respectful</li>
            <li> Great product and received sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> I had read all most of the comments and I was a little skeptic but surprisingly this Pedicure Foot File does work.</li>
            <li> This product is working very good thus far but have only had it for one week.  </li>
            <li> There may be a better, similar product out there, but I LOVE the technology.</li>
            <li> Now, after about 8 days, I find that my calluses do not reappear so quickly</li>
            <li> Received quickly.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> bought at Amazon the Nature Tech Pedi, in short it did a wonderful job in a short time.</li>
            <li> and I saw a really quick results comparing how my feet  looks before I use the machine .&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> and I put some of my favorite lotion on and some soft furry socks before bed, and Feet THANK ME in the morning!!</li>
            <li> It requires a pretty light touch.</li>
            <li> My feet are smooth and pretty</li>
            <li> so I can keep my feet in good condition once I get them there, which shouldn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked feet or calluses then this product is all you need to get your feet feeling good again.</li>
            <li> after the first week wait a couple of days to make sure you don&#x27;t take to much skin off..</li>
            <li> Enjoying this item so far!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Love this thing, works well so far and smooths out your feet quickly.</li>
            <li> its okay for the price, might just be as easy to use a nail file that will do the same thing as this product.</li>
            <li> i had very cracked dry feet, but this worked great.</li>
            <li> Hard to control, does not do a very good job.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, do just a little at a time, though; that is what I have been doing, and it&#x27;s been great--</li>
            <li> This one I can get under them and a little between them too which is great.</li>
            <li> Nice product...could be a little more powerful</li>
            <li> you so much for the free bonus feet repair cream ,helps a lot&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could really see a huge improvement to them.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to not use too much at once.</li>
            <li> More refills are available from the same vendor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall well worth the $20.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one of my rare 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I already purchased a second one to give to my Mother.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re patient, like the instructions say, this is worth the time.</li>
            <li> after reading reviews i was second guessing getting it, but honestly this works so well.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this thing works far better than using a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> and I can see I will get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I am an elementary school librarian</li>
            <li> Not as good a quality as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I now love her silky soft feet rubbing against my legs when we sleep.</li>
            <li> Takes time, but worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and worked great on my icky feet.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is great and the shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li> My feet feel better than after a pedicure with the first use and after the second use they are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Quick, easy, soft feet in minutes.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of practice getting the right pressure and gliding movement</li>
            <li> It worked right away</li>
            <li> and i saw results right away.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate something that does not work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> but once you practice you can eventually use it with the right gentleness to allow it to spin nonstop.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to clean up so much.</li>
            <li> My feet finally feel soft and wonderful all the time - I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear open shoes and not afraid to snag</li>
            <li> This is sooo easy to use and the results were better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Another great small investment.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT for my dried - cracked work roughened feet -- used it right away - -VERY</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and comes with an extra file, which I have note used yet.</li>
            <li> So far I have used three times for me and one time for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use and worked well for me to remove my callus on my feet (men).</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I spent over an hour &amp; went through one set of batteries but didn&#x27;t end up with silky smooth feet &amp; heels, although they appeared much better after applying foot cream.  </li>
            <li> Although the first one I got was defective, they were very helpful and quick to replace it.</li>
            <li> and they reply very fast,  </li>
            <li> It feels very comfortable against my skin and you can see the results almost instantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and it smoothens out the thick skin in a gentle, fast and effective way.  </li>
            <li> Now I am not shy showing my feet in front of people.</li>
            <li> really love this product its  the second day I&#x27;m using it,&lt;br</li>
            <li> if or you most definitely.</li>
            <li> It is the first one I have tried.</li>
            <li> Something that actually works at removing calluses and makes my feet baby smooth!</li>
            <li> I like the smooth action.  </li>
            <li> Actually got better results than at manicure/pedicure locations.  </li>
            <li> I just put in the two batteries (not included) and three minutes later my feet were already looking so much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> but nothing has come close to giving me a long lasting and great solution like this foot filer.</li>
            <li> My feet feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> pretty study</li>
            <li> I just used it and it isn&#x27;t going to fix it on the first time.</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well</li>
            <li> You must follow the directions which are not complicated</li>
            <li> this does not work very well!</li>
            <li> Love the price too compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to remove everything the first time.</li>
            <li> He helped me fix my unit and understand what exactly the problem was.</li>
            <li> Deep cracks that bleed most of the time.</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more for Christmas gifts later this year!</li>
            <li> Instructions are actually pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it twice a week for the first two weeks, then backed off to once per week and even longer.</li>
            <li> but no,  unit was pretty exspensive for one use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s an extra bonus for me : )</li>
            <li> so it took me a few days to get good  </li>
            <li> Yes, it worked, but I still had to use the sanding things to smooth out the really super ruff condition left from the grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to do a little bit daily, and before you know it, your feet are as soft as ever!</li>
            <li> and the next day my feet were so smooth, like freshly shaven legs.</li>
            <li> After working on them for about 10 minutes all told (going from callous to callous and then starting all over again more times than I could keep count on) there was very noticeable progress on all of the callouses.</li>
            <li> Never realized my feet could feel so good with so little effort!</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought this little machine.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few days but WOW - it works great!</li>
            <li> Had for a long time use many types of paper files.  </li>
            <li> This is a great gadget for those very rough spots you have when the foot filer is not enough.</li>
            <li> Even with all the work I put the rollers through they seem to have plenty of life left in them, and cleanup was just as easy as the instructions</li>
            <li> Works good but batteries dont seem to last that long in it.</li>
            <li> You must have brand new batteries!!</li>
            <li> I found with the first use this wiped out most of the issue, but just isn&#x27;t powerful enough to get the really deep cracks.</li>
            <li> Nice little product.  </li>
            <li> You have to use good batteries and follow directions it comes with (don&#x27;t press too hard.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and cannot believe what a huge difference it made.  </li>
            <li> Recomended highly!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really need to get pedicures</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t afford to get one as often as I&#x27;d like to so this really helping me to save quite a bit of money</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> And thanks for efficient delivery</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything much to sand away callouses....</li>
            <li> (so much work)</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive batteries hoping they would be more powerful but no change.</li>

            <li> It saved me so much money on getting pedicure in a salon.</li>
            <li> Works well but wheel wears out fast</li>
            <li> It did not come with batteries, so have yours ready, because you will want to use this immediately.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> thank you soooo much.</li>
            <li> wife says it works very well</li>
            <li> At this stage, I can&#x27;t think of any negatives, as even as a man with big hands the unit is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Really expected more.</li>
            <li> My sister borrowed it and after using it was ready to get one.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to anyone  who wants a DIY and to save $$$</li>
            <li> This product worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> But it works really well.</li>
            <li> so I could really check this gadget out.</li>
            <li> they always cut my skin with a razor sometimes too much and&lt;</li>
            <li> I really like this gadget.  </li>
            <li> but this has made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Do not apply to much pressure when using.  </li>
            <li> Really, really works....</li>
            <li> and the fact I can use it in the shower is a real plus.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I really like the foot ointment too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My advice is use it very Sparingly BEFORE Showers. ...</li>
            <li> IT IS A VERY PAINFULL MISTAKE...</li>
            <li> It is very efficient.</li>
            <li> Hazardous waste suit and plastic sheeting.</li>
            <li> I only needed it on my left foot one time, but the right foot needed it used twice more.</li>
            <li> ~ there&#x27;s really no work involved and you can see results after the first time!!!</li>
            <li> you wont have baby soft feet right off the bat...</li>
            <li> In fact, the only other time my feet felt so good was after a pedicure at a salon.</li>
            <li> After the first use I was very surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> Works better than all of the other scrubbers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other ones that were much much better</li>
            <li> (Have to press hard and turn &amp;#34;battery holder&amp;#34; cover and it is not that easy to fit parts)  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised they include inside the package  a really nice travel size foot balm All natural ingredients for my feet to complete the treatment ,makes a big difference !!.</li>
            <li> its ok little under powered and runs threw the power fast</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like my feet are brand new!</li>
            <li> but I just clean my feet with the heel on the toilet seat before I take a shower</li>
            <li> Once you learn to respect how much dry skin it takes off, you will really enjoy it...</li>
            <li> Not as expensive as most, but works fantastic!</li>
            <li> A total waste of good money.</li>
            <li> I have always had big callouses on the balls of my feet/heels (former dancer), and this helped smooth them out!</li>
            <li> As you get older</li>
            <li> If you have very thick calluses, the kind I have had that grind holes in your socks, this device won&#x27;t get rid of them right away.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product</li>
            <li> and I would also highly recommend NATURE TECH based on the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews on products but this REALLY WORKS!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I love this little machine.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> Does a nice job on hard callusses.</li>
            <li> I can do it as often as I want and with my busy life and limited finances, it makes it easy for me to take care of my feet without limitation.</li>
            <li> Really like this product so far.</li>
            <li> Finally lotion is able to get to the actually heels to make them soft.</li>
            <li> Use it every few days and love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really worth the money especially  with a bonus foot balm</li>
            <li> I then switched to the standard head and worked on the whole of each foot to finish off my first use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> IT DEFINITELY work and is WORTH the money.</li>
            <li> but then it&#x27;s was really easy to maintain my feet  the second and third time</li>
            <li> No more trouble after using this product, Feet are smooth and nice after all these years.</li>
            <li> Taken a little off everyday works great</li>
            <li> I put in brand new batteries</li>
            <li> OMG my feet are new again.</li>
            <li> New batteries and won&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
            <li> I LIVE IN FLORIDA</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier - the motor doesn&#x27;t have a strong torque so don&#x27;t expect too much just a bit of patience and the stone will remove the hard skin off your feet.  </li>
            <li> Use the unit on the dry foot, follow with a quick rinse and apply foot cream.  </li>
            <li> While it does a great job in removing scales the scales will come back even worse than before.  </li>
            <li> It has performed as I expected and is doing a good job in removing the built up dead skin from my feet.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear a lot of flip flops or didn&#x27;t wear socks from high school through my early 20s, which caused my heels to become callous.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember a time when my feet have ever been this soft!</li>
            <li> My feet are soft!</li>
            <li> You will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> but I definitely did notice a difference just from my first use.</li>
            <li> or I would have sent it back after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Ordering a different brand that&#x27;s electric &amp; has a higher speed.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> First time with the courser paper, and again with the smaller grit paper.</li>
            <li> my feet are smooth in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to remove dead cells on heels and feet.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like my Ped Egg shaver and will probably go back to using that as long as I&#x27;m able to.</li>
            <li> Weak, but effective device.</li>
            <li> Kind of weak.</li>
            <li> very worth the price, which is less than paying someone to do this for me.  </li>
            <li> I wear high heels all day every day to work which causes some MAJOR callouses.  </li>
            <li> This product only works removing speckles of dead skin keeping feet smooth if used once a week for about a half an hour or more along with a manual handheld foot smoother followed by foot cream.  </li>
            <li> It works on just the dry skin and when I used it on a more sensitive part of my foot, it went down deep enough to reach the dry skin and not hurt the healthy tissue beneath.</li>
            <li> It came as promised, instruction was clear.</li>
            <li> and they were soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to go  and do professional pedicure and pay money for it.</li>
            <li> My feet are so much smoother and nicer in only two days!</li>
            <li> Makes your feet soft and tender</li>
            <li> Now, the batteries last much longer.</li>
            <li> It works but I need to use it frequently to maintain smoothness.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews on this thing.  </li>
            <li> naturally my feet take a toll.  </li>
            <li> , JUST REMEMBER NOT TO PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON ROLLER,IT IS ONLY A BATTARY POWERED MOTOR</li>
            <li> But does make feet soft....</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this before, but better late than never.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that type of person , I can tell you this pedicure machine definitely definitely helped me so much  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and still on the original roller.</li>
            <li> and one more thing you need to glide it gently over your dry feet areas don&#x27;t press  hard</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes my heels were very smooth and the dry skin was gone.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe how much better they are.  </li>
            <li> The heads seem to last a decent amount of time, I have had it about 2 weeks now and havent had to replace 1 yet.</li>
            <li> I have a different one I have been using mainly on my husbands feet but couldn&#x27;t get under his toes with it.</li>
            <li> But that is because I have mostly walked on my right foot for the past three years (while recovering from breaking my left leg twice - each a year apart from each other).</li>
            <li> The soles and heels were much smoother and looked considerably better than they had before I started, and my horrid, rough and ugly callouses were mostly smoothed over.</li>
            <li> I had been looking and checking at our local Super center, but I could not find it or they couldn,t find it, or they were out.</li>
            <li> Oh, it works and my feet were bad and now BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li> I normally have to pumice every night, I only have to use this a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> It runs fine as long as you hold it upright or sideways, however, you point down with it to go toward your feet (for which I might add it is meant for) it quits running.  </li>
            <li> I just received this item &amp; after going thru 3 sets of new batteries can only conclude that the tool is defective.  </li>
            <li> I have very severe Eczema, and my feet get incredibly dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going very often to a nail salon for a pedicure for my dry feet  </li>
            <li> I use it for my pedicures and it really got rid of the dry skin and callouses.</li>
            <li> next morning my heels look and feel very soft.</li>
            <li> At first I used the foot file every day to wear down the decades old calluses.</li>
            <li> After carefully using it on the day I got it as to not over do it and end up with sore raw tootsies, I now use it once a week for maintenance and have never had such smooth pretty feet.</li>
            <li> Although the directions said to wash your feet first, I saw other recommendations to use this device before you showered.</li>
            <li> The larger grit paper worked faster, but left jagged rough skin, so that had to be filed off to smooth with the smaller grit</li>
            <li> This works fine on your feet if you use it at least once a week for a touch up.  </li>
            <li> I use to dig out the extra calluses with a special nail clipper leaving it very red and not pretty.</li>
            <li> I have had callouses for years and they are hard to smooth out.</li>
            <li> Perhaps adding a Low and High function to subsequent models would help.  </li>
            <li> I finally after 20years have soft feet.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has made these old dancer feet look presentable again.  </li>
            <li> br careful to not apply too much preasue</li>
            <li> Not too rough, not too gentle.</li>
            <li> It is not at all powerful or harsh, as I said, it stops spinning when it gets the slightest converse resistance.</li>
            <li> just like I&#x27;ve spent $$$ on a professional pedicure!!!</li>
            <li> The Good:  Actually removed several, aged hard calluses!  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and gently applied the callous remover to my heel.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and they are all the real deal.  </li>
            <li> You have to be extra careful in not applying too much pressure or it will brake which is what happened in my case.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend getting this product if you have rough feet and/or callouses.</li>
            <li> ONE* treatment to my left foot and none to my right (except a few seconds on the ball of my foot before stopping to take a picture).</li>
            <li> sooooo smooth and dry and cracked skin was no more with in just seconds</li>
            <li> Use gently and daily and it will keep the rough spots on your feet at bay!</li>
            <li> Also customer service is so pleasent to talk with, I had trouble with it at first</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot or burn your skin and it takes of the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> If you press down too much it will stop working at all.</li>
            <li> Keep the unit moving lightly over the heel and sides of foot, wherever you have hard, dry skin or calluses.  </li>
            <li> I had a corn on the bottom of a big toe that I worked at slowly for the first couple weeks - about 4 times.</li>
            <li> I get bad callouses on my hands and this works really well smoothing them out easy to use</li>
            <li> I expect it will take having a go at it every day for perhaps up to a week before I can get the callouses completely ground down</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find out that this product really works as compared to other cheaper crap sold on t.v. commercials.</li>
            <li> Batteries do not last very long.</li>
            <li> haha please do not purchase probly too late for me to get money back but can prevent others from purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> it took me around 5 minutes to do each feet to file down all the calluses dead skin the first time</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the batteries have to be new in order for it to work properly otherwise it spins really slow.</li>
            <li> I used this foot file a little at a time and now my toes look natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having ugly feet and this with some tender loving helps.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely take all of the dead skin off like I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> i did have a minor issue with the item</li>
            <li> how long I try to use it.</li>
            <li> If it stops while you are using it for a long time, give it a rest.</li>
            <li> BTW, you may want to buy AA batteries in a bulk (from COSTCO or Walmart) to use this electric tool for a long time.</li>
            <li> But so far it has filed the dead skin from my feet without having to replace the head with refill.</li>
            <li> I barely sit down my feet</li>
            <li> Not very powerful but makes a difference if you sit there long enough.</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my dry feet, but you can wet your feet also.</li>
            <li> He has horribly calloused feet, and after using it the first time for a few minutes..he was amazed at how good his feet felt.</li>
            <li> my feet is really dry</li>
            <li> I use the electric pedicure at night before shower on dry feet  and after my shower I rub the cream on and put my socks and go to sleep&lt;</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it on dry feet, but I have used it in the shower too.</li>
            <li> removed a lot of the built up dry skin I had on my feet.  </li>
            <li> all the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I had grand canyon cracks on my heels and creepy calluses all over the bottoms of my feet that pedicures and pumice stones barely touched.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time, careful to follow the instructions and not press too hard, and I was amazed!  </li>
            <li> The motor is not strong enough to keep spinning to work properly.</li>
            <li> played soccer quite a long period of time (amateur for fun) and had hard and touch callus on both feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough even when the batteries were changed.</li>
            <li> I have extremely rough and dry skin</li>
            <li> The directions say you can use it on wet or dry skin</li>
            <li> Does not work on my feet no matter if they are dry or wet no matter</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but eats through batteries and gets slow after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> are killing me and they are very dry I am on my feet</li>
            <li> I used the regular ped egg, but it was too rough on my skin and actually cut me a few times!</li>
            <li> In the summer I wear mostly sandals and my feet get calluses really bad.</li>
            <li> sanded the bad cracked areas of my heel and left a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li> I love it, had a terrible time before, but, this really works</li>
            <li> spent about 30 minutes on my feet the day this came in</li>
            <li> I have been complaining about how rough his feet are for years.</li>
            <li> This works on rough skin on hands and elbows too.  </li>
            <li> I am using daily, to remove dead skin.  </li>
            <li> the skin was just flying off like I was taking an electric sander to a rough piece of wood.</li>
            <li> worked exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> This product does not have the power to work without stopping and getting jammed up.</li>
            <li> So either be forced to use it daily or take a medical route to solve your heel problem.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my rough feet.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last for long, so expect to use this product at least weekly.</li>
            <li> .. please remember to Only a little bit at a time!</li>
            <li> For me, it bogged down, not enough power.</li>
            <li> As soon as the weather warms my feet are in sandals, and I do NOT like to have rough feet!</li>
            <li> I tried foot soap for the calluses, and I tried 2 small paddles with the gritty stuff like sandpaper, and it smoothed my feet, but calluses still existed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a couple of times and little by little my feet are starting to look like baby&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li> I have always had rough skin on my feet and have tried every type of foot cream, pumice stone, pedi-egg things there are!</li>
            <li> This product works just the way I had hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;No regrets!</li>
            <li> After reading some comments on this and other pedicure files, I decided to order some refills</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> would suggest it to anyone over the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Also rotating pumice is sensitive, if you press down even a little hard it skipps n stops spinning.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is this product seems a little underpowered.  </li>
            <li> Motor seems a little weak but with patience and some time it does smooth the tough skin.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I bought a different more expensive pedicure that didn&#x27;t work well at all and didn&#x27;t hold charge, I had to use it plugged in which was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Depending on how bad your feet are, I promise you will see results quickly!  </li>
            <li> only negative is I thought</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and came into this product with pretty high expectations, and purchased it for my son who has very bad callouses.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had this product for less than a month, and I&#x27;ve used it for maybe 6-7 times.</li>
            <li> I just got my Pedi in the mail less than one hour ago and went immediately to use it.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it should have cost less than $19.99 though.</li>
            <li> your body become less flexible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Slightly annoying as it bogs down easily for safety reasons.</li>
            <li> Difficult to change batteries compared to normal devises.  </li>
            <li> No more spending an hour scrubbing on them with minimal results.</li>
            <li> It is a habit for those of us with these hard, calloused, dry, cracked heels to be aggressive with filing/scraping our feet.  </li>
            <li> do a little at a time</li>
            <li> it takes a little getting used to working the device</li>
            <li> It was a little concerning...</li>
            <li> You will have to work at it a little at a time, but it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to come with a protective little cover for the roller</li>
            <li> This little guy does the job.</li>
            <li> PLEASE remember just to take a little at a time. ...</li>
            <li> and i get very hard cracked heels and makes me embarassed to wear opened back shoes because im</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars had the motor been slightly stronger, in other words if you press too hard on your foot</li>
            <li> Well how in the world is it going to work in the shower, when it quits running as soon as you turn it down?!  </li>
            <li> Easily bogged down!  </li>
            <li> This is packaged very well, and is one of the least expensive electronic foot files.  </li>
            <li> I have been embarrassed by the heals of my feet for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble for years with my heals.</li>
            <li> but if you use this device everyday you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> The dead skin turned into a layer of powder on our coffee table.</li>
            <li> No power at all&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONNEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> but he has to do it everyday</li>
            <li> plus, it didn&#x27;t remove the dead skin...</li>
            <li> I expect this to take a few times.</li>
            <li> I dealt with the pain for a few months, and decided to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.  </li>
            <li> I just used it everyday, sometimes before taking a shower and then used the O&#x27;Keefe foot lotion/cream at night.  </li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin that was removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use it a few times over time to get the result I want.</li>
            <li> but mine was missing that cover.  </li>
            <li> I have used the sanding paddles sold to remove dead skin and calluses, and while they did work, they were a lot of work to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You could see (smoke) powder from the dead skin sifting up from the rotating head.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Use a little everyday and in 2-3 days you&#x27;ll see a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> Otherwise the thing will slow down.</li>
            <li> She had very thick and dry skin patches that are now gone after three uses.  </li>
            <li> I added a little lotion and voila!  </li>
            <li> This little gems will save me a ton!  </li>
            <li> operation is not strong enough, very weak</li>
            <li> My feet were not in bad shape, but this beats any other products I have used by far.</li>
            <li> I use it not just on my heels, but every where on my feet where there is thick skin and it takes just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t functioning properly.</li>
            <li> I have callouses on the small toes that seems like I have nail overgrowth</li>
            <li> No more need for pedicures unless it&#x27;s for a treat.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use scissors every month to get them off.  </li>
            <li> I heard its not healthy for your feet</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have used those things that look life a small food grater, to remove the dead skin and thick calluses.</li>
            <li> Does nit work like it states... too dull</li>
            <li> being battery powered, it does hesitates rotation in hard callused areas.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power for removing hard, built up calluses.</li>
            <li> but it is just hard skin.</li>
            <li> No need to scrub hard on the feet.</li>
            <li> Because if you press too hard, the head stops spinning.</li>
            <li> There is no need to press hard....</li>
            <li> I used this one time and the rollers were dull</li>
            <li> I had to learn the hard way....</li>
            <li> I have an issue with my feet that requires frequent sloughing of skin to avoid painful corns &amp; callouses.</li>
            <li> The spinning pad stops with the least resistance</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to over file but slowly work at the areas that are needed.</li>
            <li> I had a small service issue &amp; they went beyond my expectations for customer service!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> who&#x27;s foot maintenance is limited to washing them and cutting his toenails).</li>
            <li> Not helping seriously to remove the hard part!</li>
            <li> I had dry hard thick dead skin on my feet that was cracked and looked very ugly</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t done a pedicure in months and was a bit skeptical about buying this product especially due to the price.</li>
            <li> I had very thick, cracked heel callous.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very slow.</li>
            <li> cheep and poorly built.</li>
            <li> They were way worse than the before pic on the model.  </li>
            <li> This is a poor product.</li>
            <li> My arms would get tired from all the time it took and the work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed to show my picture of my feet, but the dramatic results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> If you have bad cracked hard feet</li>
            <li> Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> but ill give an update as soon as I do.</li>
            <li> The amopee was way to expensive</li>
            <li> I only wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture of my nasty cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> (even the expensive Lithium ones)  </li>
            <li> hubby&#x27;s feet were the worse!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying to go get a pedicure every couple weeks just to keep them from getting too bad.  </li>
            <li> Sandals seem to make my feet look worse and I am so grateful to this device for transforming my ugly dogs.  </li>
            <li> My feet heels are cracked and awful typically.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s feet are now less terrifying!</li>
            <li> afraid simeone may notice my damaged heels</li>
            <li> Works well, but it goes through batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> friend of mine recommended it to me her feet is not as bad as my feet</li>
            <li> were so bad that his socks were ruined in no time.  </li>
            <li> I had them bad, and they hurt.</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t meant for your hands, but I get calluses bad on my hands, and it works for them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are on your feet for work 12 hours a day, and working on stuff with your hands calluses get bad on your hands, and feet after a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad calluses all my life and this makes it seem like I have never had them at all.</li>
            <li> My heels were so bad it was embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> BAD:  </li>
            <li> I am 73 and my heels have always looked bad.  </li>
            <li> I bought it like 3 months ago from a department store and it was like $70 , to bad</li>
            <li> My wife suggested this for my badly callous and cracked skin on my heels.  </li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Instead of the &amp;#34;lethal weapons&amp;#34; my husband hated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have horrible callused feet!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but this product has produced outstanding results for my wife.  She had very thick and dry skin patches that are now gone after three uses.  Very effective and easy to use.  I would also recommend a good foot cream after each use.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few days but WOW - it works great! I have been embarrassed by the heals of my feet for a few years now. I don&#x27;t have time to get regular pedicures and aquafor or vasaline with socks and a pumice stone in the shower wasn&#x27;t helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent about 30 minutes on my feet the day this came in and they were soft. I will continue to put aquafor on my feet every night but my feet were easily transformed with this foot file. After my results I went to work on my husband (who&#x27;s foot maintenance is limited to washing them and cutting his toenails). I have been complaining about how rough his feet are for years. His will take a few more treatments to remove all of the calluses but his feet look the best they have since I met him almost 16 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan and I will definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT for my dried - cracked work roughened feet -- used it right away - -VERY happy with it!</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully.  Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Does nit work like it states... too dull</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and it smoothens out the thick skin in a gentle, fast and effective way.  I use it not just on my heels, but every where on my feet where there is thick skin and it takes just a few minutes.  My feet have never looked better.  Now I am not shy showing my feet in front of people.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It lacks motor power..needs more power</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to remove dead cells on heels and feet.</li>
            <li> BIG LIKE !!&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product its  the second day I&#x27;m using it,&lt;br /&gt;really really good results I don&#x27;t even have to go  and do professional pedicure and pay money for it. im glad someone invented this  products ,&lt;br /&gt;perfect for me</li>
            <li> Very nice product! Comes with extra refill and cleaning brush.  More refills are available from the same vendor.  Very effective, light, and easy to use. Recomended highly! In addition, a very good vendor! (Nature Tech).</li>
            <li> I have had trouble for years with my heals. They shredded the sheets on my bed. No more trouble after using this product, Feet are smooth and nice after all these years. I am so pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is easy to use and it works great, it will hurt your feet if you use this for to long</li>
            <li> Great product. Works better than all of the other scrubbers I have tried.  I would definitely recommend it.  The price is good and the product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Enjoying this item so far!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my rough feet.</li>
            <li> I had read all most of the comments and I was a little skeptic but surprisingly this Pedicure Foot File does work. No it will not take off the entire callous at one time but if you use this device everyday you will notice the difference. Although the directions said to wash your feet first, I saw other recommendations to use this device before you showered. I have done it both ways and I do prefer to use the device before I showered.&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t over use this device trying to take off callous do a little at a time so you will not make the bottom of your feet sore.&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is I thought or maybe I misread that this was device was electrical. Batteries power is ok but electrical power would have been better.</li>
            <li> Works really well!!! I love this product. A few months ago I bought a different more expensive pedicure that didn&#x27;t work well at all and didn&#x27;t hold charge, I had to use it plugged in which was uncomfortable. My friend had purchased this one and let me try it. I loved it. Very comfortable to hold and use. Works perfect for me. So happy I bought it. My feet have never felt better.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Would buy it multiple times for multiple people. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product - worked really well! I didn&#x27;t have any power issues. My feet are so much smoother and nicer in only two days!</li>
            <li> Works well, but goes through batteries.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, soft feet in minutes.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing ever. I finally after 20years have soft feet. I never write reviews on anything but this time i must. The pedi works so so well. I have had another brand &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; and it doesnt even come close to the naturetech pedi. Also customer service is so pleasent to talk with, I had trouble with it at first but the rep was very knowledgable and was able to solve my issue right over the phone!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, had a terrible time before, but, this really works and it&#x27;s sooooo easy...thank you!</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and works well.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome product ladies!  Not as expensive as most, but works fantastic!</li>
            <li> LIFE SAVER. I have tried pumice stones, lotions, rubs, exfoliations, heel razors, gel socks, etc. This worked SO MUCH better then all combined. In a minute I had smooth feet. Instead of the &amp;#34;lethal weapons&amp;#34; my husband hated. Finally lotion is able to get to the actually heels to make them soft.</li>
            <li> Love it !&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine recommended it to me her feet is not as bad as my feet my feet is really dry and I have cracked heels, so it took me a few days to get good  results I was patient with that and finally I do see good  results,  I  would definitely  recommend</li>
            <li> well designed, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often but however, I was impressed at how well it did! If you have bad cracked hard feet then this if or you most definitely. The dead skin turned into a layer of powder on our coffee table. It helps when after you taken a shower it&#x27;s much easier - the motor doesn&#x27;t have a strong torque so don&#x27;t expect too much just a bit of patience and the stone will remove the hard skin off your feet.  Use the cream as well that is supplied with the product it helps soften and moisturize your feet.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but eats through batteries and gets slow after a few minutes of use. If you have the time, it is a great tool for people on their feet often.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED AT A GREAT PRICE TO.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Eliminates trying to use an exfoliating pad, which requires a lot of elbow grease. NEVER hurts or goes too deep.It is the first one I have tried. There may be a better, similar product out there, but I LOVE the technology.</li>
            <li> being battery powered, it does hesitates rotation in hard callused areas. That being said it  may be a good thing so you don&#x27;t over remove build up in these areas.</li>
            <li> Finally!! Something that actually works at removing calluses and makes my feet baby smooth! Takes a bit of practice getting the right pressure and gliding movement but it works great! Plenty of power for removing hard, built up calluses. Love this product! Great value with the extra roller and cleaning brush!</li>
            <li> Love this thing, works well so far and smooths out your feet quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it, I ordered two, one of each and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything!</li>
            <li> Used it once and it never worked again!</li>
            <li> It works really good!</li>
            <li> I like the smooth action.  I use the second roller for my husband.</li>
            <li> I used this just once and I can not believe the difference our feet feel.  My husbands heals were so bad that his socks were ruined in no time.  I recommend the Nature Tech Pedi Electric Pedicure Foot File to anyone!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but honestly the PedEgg is better and fast.</li>
            <li> I really need to get pedicures every so often but I can&#x27;t afford to get one as often as I&#x27;d like to so this really helping me to save quite a bit of money and I can do it myself  anytime anywhere it&#x27;s really easy  and good for my feet maintenance ,it works great for especially if you have really dry cracked heels like I do,  to be honest it took me around 5 minutes to do each feet to file down all the calluses dead skin the first time but then it&#x27;s was really easy to maintain my feet  the second and third time , I&#x27;m really happy now because my feet are smooth and healthy&lt;br /&gt;Oh and one more thing you need to glide it gently over your dry feet areas don&#x27;t press  hard let the machine do the work,:)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for the free bonus feet repair cream ,helps a lot&lt;br /&gt; You guys rock</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Good price, works as I had hoped!</li>
            <li> Very simple and gets the job done! Very kind seller and the product is flawless! It&#x27;s best to do a little bit daily, and before you know it, your feet are as soft as ever!</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I wish I had one of these the last 20 years. Calluses are not necessary.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is everything it promises. You have to use good batteries and follow directions it comes with (don&#x27;t press too hard.) Very happy!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I dont write reviews but it is everything everyone else said about it. LCS</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The unit lacks the power to remove dense calluses.  This unit, I believe is designed for light-class of calluses.  Batteries are not provided.  The unit also drains the batteries. However, it works well on grinding feet and hand nails, excellent for diabetics.</li>
            <li> great product and very easy to use.  Actually got better results than at manicure/pedicure locations.  And thanks for efficient delivery</li>
            <li> Great product and works well.  Received this product and so happy that I purchased it, can&#x27;t imagine not having it.</li>
            <li> I had very thick, cracked heel callous. I found with the first use this wiped out most of the issue, but just isn&#x27;t powerful enough to get the really deep cracks. They seem to be improving each use, but its gonna be awhile. I knocked off a star for that. This could be improved by adding power settings, allowing for a more powerful grind. I use mine in the shower, so it is water resistant as advertised. If you use it out of the tub it shoots up gross foot-skin powder everywhere. which shows its working, but is messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall well worth the $20.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything much to sand away callouses.... not worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works as well as I thought it would.  My hand callous removers work better.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work. I put in brand new batteries and it didn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> Love it, great with no effert</li>
            <li> Use this product on my feet. Couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it became. I&#x27;m so proud of my choice and the fact that it really works</li>
            <li> its ok little under powered and runs threw the power fast</li>
            <li> Great addition to my feet care products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, light and very easy to use.  It is the best piece of equipment I&#x27;ve used on my feet.  It does what the user needs it for.  Delivery was excellent and arrived on time with good packaging.  I would definitely recommend this battery operated pedicure foot file.</li>
            <li> It works really good!!! I wish I would have bought one years ago. As another reviewer said, do just a little at a time, though; that is what I have been doing, and it&#x27;s been great--no pain from overdoing it.</li>
            <li> lasted 3 months and then quit. don&#x27;t know if it can be returned.</li>
            <li> When your bed sheets scream from your deeply cracked heals- this WORKS. 100x better than the Pediegg I&#x27;ve used for years. EASY to use, easy to clean. I&#x27;m giving it one of my rare 5 stars.</li>
            <li> its okay for the price, might just be as easy to use a nail file that will do the same thing as this product.</li>
            <li> I have very severe Eczema, and my feet get incredibly dry and cracked. I used to spend a lot of time soaking my feet and then attacking them with a pumice stone and the metal grater objects (so much work) I took a chance on this and am in love! I can&#x27;t remember a time when my feet have ever been this soft! The tool fits in my hands well, and is easy to use, and clean. Even my husband has started using it! I would absolutely recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve been waiting for. OMG my feet are new again. I&#x27;ve never had my feet this smooth. Don&#x27;t overdue it and your feet will be renewed. Use a great foot cream and you&#x27;ll be set. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product and you will to.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This item works great and is very safe on my skin.  Very glad I purchased it.  Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> love this.  easy to use, easy to clean.  very worth the price, which is less than paying someone to do this for me.  I can do it as often as I want and with my busy life and limited finances, it makes it easy for me to take care of my feet without limitation. you won&#x27;t regret your purchase.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to do as much with the first use, but follow the directions they give you and with regular care, your feet will be very happy and you will feel ready to wear those cute summer sandals without worry.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine.  Makes your feet soft and tender</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has made these old dancer feet look presentable again.  Sandals seem to make my feet look worse and I am so grateful to this device for transforming my ugly dogs.  Like everyone else says, just a very light touch is all you need.  I just put in the two batteries (not included) and three minutes later my feet were already looking so much better.  I added a little lotion and voila!  I am no longer embarrasses to show my feet.</li>
            <li> was truly needed and seems to do the job</li>
            <li> Item is great, makes a big difference in the appearance of scaly skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working on my cracked heels for years with various files and creams on the market. This is finally the one that didn&#x27;t give me a tendinitis flare up. I love it. It worked right away and I don&#x27;t have sore skin underneath. It works on just the dry skin and when I used it on a more sensitive part of my foot, it went down deep enough to reach the dry skin and not hurt the healthy tissue beneath. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Nice product...could be a little more powerful</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL.</li>
            <li> This works as described.  However, the end has to be taken off in order for the item to shut off.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my first use, but even after changing the batteries the power to it just isn&#x27;t there anymore. I wish I would have gotten a plug in one. I&#x27;ve only been able to use it a couple of times. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive batteries hoping they would be more powerful but no change. Its a great idea just needs more power.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for an excellent price.  Highly recommended product and I would also highly recommend NATURE TECH based on the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Use it every few days and love it.  Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> You can feel a difference after 1 pass! Does the job well.</li>
            <li> So far so good I like the way it leaves my feet nice and smooth. I think this will save me money on pedicures this summer!</li>
            <li> My feet are soft! Works great, doesn&#x27;t kill your AA batteries and the stone lasts surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> Not helping seriously to remove the hard part!</li>
            <li> Works so so. Doesn&#x27;t completely take all of the dead skin off like I was hoping it would. I should have bought the more expensive brand. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this product.  My feet feel better than after a pedicure with the first use and after the second use they are nice and soft.  My feet heels are cracked and awful typically.  I highly recommend this product, by far the best device I have purchased for this use.  I loved it so much that I already purchased a second one to give to my Mother.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  We love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This dosent work whatsoever. No power at all&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONNEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had this product for less than a month, and I&#x27;ve used it for maybe 6-7 times. Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t functioning properly. When I hold it upwards, it stops, and it works downwards.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have extremely rough and dry skin and I have tried all kinds of lotions, foot balms, socks - everything but nothing has come close to giving me a long lasting and great solution like this foot filer. it&#x27;s easy to use, works very well and is great for the price. Remember not to use it too much at a time. Use a little everyday and in 2-3 days you&#x27;ll see a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!  In the summer I wear mostly sandals and my feet get calluses really bad. This product removed them all. My feet feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works as said and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> did not work. will donate to Vietnam Vets/.</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re patient, like the instructions say, this is worth the time. Personally, I like my Ped Egg shaver and will probably go back to using that as long as I&#x27;m able to. It&#x27;s quicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple times now and it does a nice job keeping my feet looking summer perfect.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you have lots of time this is for you.  Stops if you put any pressurer on it, so it&#x27;s very slow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pretty study</li>
            <li> Review for hila&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I want to say Awesome company great  service and  product, it arrive in time and really well packaged , I  had some questions  and they reply very fast,  I was really surprised they include inside the package  a really nice travel size foot balm All natural ingredients for my feet to complete the treatment ,makes a big difference !!. I use the electric pedicure at night before shower on dry feet  and after my shower I rub the cream on and put my socks and go to sleep&lt;br /&gt;I think it took me like two three days to repeat this process  and now my feet looks and feels totally better now&lt;br /&gt;Thank you nature tech for your foot Reper cream gift awesome&lt;br /&gt;It is really worth the money especially  with a bonus foot balm</li>
            <li> My heals are good NOW!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PEDICURE KIT!!! My feet look and feel just like I&#x27;ve spent $$$ on a professional pedicure!!! Buy this...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> its ok for woman i tried to get the callusus off my dads feet but he has to do it everyday i need to get a better one for my dad.</li>
            <li> Product is fantastic. Very well made and I noticed a huge improvement to my hands and feet after using. I followed the instructions and only used it about 5 minutes each day and after about a week I could really see a huge improvement to them. The heads seem to last a decent amount of time, I have had it about 2 weeks now and havent had to replace 1 yet. Great for laborers who have big buildups!</li>
            <li> It does not remove almost anything</li>
            <li> cheep and poorly built.</li>
            <li> after reading reviews i was second guessing getting it, but honestly this works so well. i had very cracked dry feet, but this worked great. after about an hour for both my feet i put some foot lotion and fuzzy socks. and the next day my feet were so smooth, like freshly shaven legs. after about 4 days my feel are still smooth. for 20 dollars and an hour i feel so much better about my feet. it takes a little getting used to working the device but when you get the hang of it, its almost relaxing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this foot file! As soon as the weather warms my feet are in sandals, and I do NOT like to have rough feet! I used the regular ped egg, but it was too rough on my skin and actually cut me a few times! It was a little concerning...plus, it didn&#x27;t remove the dead skin...just seemed to work like a grater!! THIS tool, however is WELL worth the price! My heels and sides of my feet are baby smooth and look great - not scratched! I find it works best on dry skin! The directions say you can use it on wet or dry skin but I just clean my feet with the heel on the toilet seat before I take a shower and it works great. You will be pleasantly surprised! Also, the turning wheel is easy to clean and replace!</li>
            <li> Really like your product.  I have one and have bought second one for a gift.  Really good value and love the results when I use it.</li>
            <li> I just got this and of course had to immediately tear open the box. This product is great!  I just used it and it isn&#x27;t going to fix it on the first time. This is something you will have to continually use but I definitely did notice a difference just from my first use. I am in absolute love with this!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;GREAT PRODUCT&amp;#34;  SAVES ME MONEY TO WHERE I DO MY OWN PEDICURES , I NO LONGER GO TO THE SALON. I HAVE ALL THE SUPPLIES I NEED TO IT MYSELF. THIS PRODUCT WAS THE ICING ON THE CAKE.</li>
            <li> I really like this tool I get bad callouses on my hands and this works really well smoothing them out easy to use</li>
            <li> I just got my Pedi in the mail less than one hour ago and went immediately to use it.  Wow!! This is sooo easy to use and the results were better than I expected. I used it sitting on the edge of my bathtub so I don&#x27;t have to clean up so much. I used very light easy strokes ( because that&#x27;s all you need to do). It is a habit for those of us with these hard, calloused, dry, cracked heels to be aggressive with filing/scraping our feet.  DONT be aggressive with this product! It is working better and easier than you think! It only took me about 5 min to do both feet.  Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong...you wont have baby soft feet right off the bat...I expect this to take a few times. But, it is so quick and easy to use. Definitely love this product.  PS.  No problem with the noise or cleanup</li>
            <li> Not very powerful but makes a difference if you sit there long enough.</li>
            <li> This thing does not work, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> this product does work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it , but I will keep it... I think it was used üòïüòï</li>
            <li> Use gently and daily and it will keep the rough spots on your feet at bay!</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well and i saw results right away. It was also easy to hold,perfect in my hand.</li>
            <li> Gave 1 star only because there was not an option for no stars.  I just received this item &amp; after going thru 3 sets of new batteries can only conclude that the tool is defective.  I cannot rate something that does not work right out of the box.  Likewise a shame that they won&#x27;t replace with one that works, only option given was return.</li>
            <li> Used one time and motor burned up</li>
            <li> This is a great gadget for those very rough spots you have when the foot filer is not enough. You must follow the directions which are not complicated you don&#x27;t want to over file but slowly work at the areas that are needed. I have callouses on the small toes that seems like I have nail overgrowth but it is just hard skin. I used this foot file a little at a time and now my toes look natural. I use to dig out the extra calluses with a special nail clipper leaving it very red and not pretty. But this Pedicure foot file has done a great job in making the areas I need for my feet to look healthy.</li>
            <li> this does not work very well!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have horrible callused feet! This tool does the trick! It feels great for my feet to glide along the sheet and not snag!</li>
            <li> I bought nature tech pedicure kit at the store and i am really love it , it works really well I use it once every 2 weeks to maintain my  feet ,I really recommend  to moisturize your feet after each use it&lt;br /&gt;Makes a big difference this little device, my feet are always smooth and looks great :)</li>
            <li> My feet were disgusting. I used to wear a lot of flip flops or didn&#x27;t wear socks from high school through my early 20s, which caused my heels to become callous. I was so embarrassed whenever I got a pedicure or foot massage. I won&#x27;t be anymore! I read the other reviews and gently applied the callous remover to my heel. Have a rag or towel ready to collect all the falling dead skin. It took my feet 2 hours and 2 sets of batteries to remove years of neglect. I highly recommend this product! I&#x27;m so impressed by it that I&#x27;ve included a before-after pic of my right foot! I&#x27;ll be using this product often to make sure my feet never look like that again.</li>
            <li> Works great. I tried foot soap for the calluses, and I tried 2 small paddles with the gritty stuff like sandpaper, and it smoothed my feet, but calluses still existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product the calluses are a lot smaller already after about 1-2 min. I had them bad, and they hurt. I dealt with the pain for a few months, and decided to get rid of them. I know this isn&#x27;t meant for your hands, but I get calluses bad on my hands, and it works for them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are on your feet for work 12 hours a day, and working on stuff with your hands calluses get bad on your hands, and feet after a while.</li>
            <li> My feet finally feel soft and wonderful all the time - I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear open shoes and not afraid to snag nylons - goodbye cracked heels.  I&#x27;m done with pumice stones.  This works on rough skin on hands and elbows too.  Love the price too compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times and it works great - good price and nice people to work with - will get more use out of it as summer comes on and I go barefooted more - like it a lot - taylor</li>
            <li> I felt embarrassed everytime I wore sandals. I bought this product. I used a couple of times and little by little my feet are starting to look like baby&#x27;s feet.  I put lotion after and socks and go to bed and next morning my heels look and feel very soft. You got to give it time. It&#x27;s not going to remove everything the first time. With two sessions my feet look amazing comparing to what they look before.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service.</li>
            <li> Love the product, great company, excellent customer service. I had a small service issue &amp; they went beyond my expectations for customer service! I have an issue with my feet that requires frequent sloughing of skin to avoid painful corns &amp; callouses. This product works great. I normally have to pumice every night, I only have to use this a couple times a week. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> May 27: I love this I just finished using it, feet look and feel amazing. I&#x27;ve had really bad calluses all my life and this makes it seem like I have never had them at all. I would recommend soaking your feet after or shower after, just adds to the amazing-ness. Only downside...it stopped working! New batteries and won&#x27;t turn on at all. Changed the batteries twice and nothing!  kind of upset bc this was a really great product I was really looking forward to using from now on. Havent contacted anyone yet but ill give an update as soon as I do. May 29: just finished talking to a gentleman I contacted via the 1-800 number on the box, amazing customer service! He helped me fix my unit and understand what exactly the problem was. If you guys have the same issue just lift up the metal prongs within the unit where the batteries go. If it stops working, shake the unit with the batteries inside, if you hear it rattling that&#x27;s the problem. Love this product I&#x27;m so excited that it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and the next day it didn&#x27;t work again.  I tried three different sets of batteries to no avail.  I am returning it and will try something else.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find out that this product really works as compared to other cheaper crap sold on t.v. commercials. My feet are baby smooth. This unit is very light but well made and its packaged nicely for easy storage. I would have given it 5 stars had the motor been slightly stronger, in other words if you press too hard on your foot the spinner pauses briefly but it did the job for me. Good value.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT THIS HAS BEEN A BEEN A GEM FOR MY FEET..IT REALLY SMOOTHES AND REJUVENATE THE FEET..I LIVE IN FLORIDA AND I WEAR FLIP FLOP ON A DAILY BASES..SO MY HEELS TEND TO GET AL LIL MEATY THAT WHAT I CALL IT WHEN U CAN FEEL THAT EXTRA BUILD UPON FLESH..ADN THIS MACHINE TOOK CARE OF THAT ISSUE..I LOVE THAT IT CAN BE USED IN THE SHOWER ALSO...</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my mom. Now I want one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.  The motor is not strong enough to keep spinning to work properly. You are better off buying a pumice stone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m deeming this a miracle foot sander.  Seriously, I had grand canyon cracks on my heels and creepy calluses all over the bottoms of my feet that pedicures and pumice stones barely touched. I just used it everyday, sometimes before taking a shower and then used the O&#x27;Keefe foot lotion/cream at night.  I had sexy beach feet within 3 days.  I also used the purple Mr. Pumice stone in the shower after sanding my foot.  I prefer to use it on dry feet, but I have used it in the shower too. It is easy to clean and comes with an extra file, which I have note used yet. I liked this sander so much that I bought my mom one, who I inherited the grand canyon heels from.</li>
            <li> Nice little product.  Easy to use and clean.  My only minor complaint is this product seems a little underpowered.  I&#x27;m not expecting the power of a belt sander but it seems to take longer to deal with my smaller callouses then it should.  Perhaps adding a Low and High function to subsequent models would help.  Regardless, this thing works far better than using a pumice stone.  Would buy again and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I don&#x27;t like having ugly feet and this with some tender loving helps. No need to scrub hard on the feet. The Tech Pedi does it for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to personal care products.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to smooth the skin on my feet once sandal season started this summer.  I don&#x27;t have calluses or deep cracked skin on my feet or I would have sent it back after the first use.  The first time I used it, I spent over an hour &amp; went through one set of batteries but didn&#x27;t end up with silky smooth feet &amp; heels, although they appeared much better after applying foot cream.  This product only works removing speckles of dead skin keeping feet smooth if used once a week for about a half an hour or more along with a manual handheld foot smoother followed by foot cream.  Ordering a different brand that&#x27;s electric &amp; has a higher speed.</li>
            <li> Weak, but effective device. The spinning pad stops with the least resistance but once you practice you can eventually use it with the right gentleness to allow it to spin nonstop. It is not at all powerful or harsh, as I said, it stops spinning when it gets the slightest converse resistance. I feel like it should have cost less than $19.99 though.</li>
            <li> This thing really works good! If you saw my feet you would know why my enthusiasm. Deep cracks that bleed most of the time. Recommend highly!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Better than spa callous removers. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;However I do feel it&#x27;s most effective with fresh batteries, so I think it goes through them fast.</li>
            <li> This product has freed me of lots of effort. I used to have to pumice (or sand) my feet every day to keep them from being totally unsightly. At first I used the foot file every day to wear down the decades old calluses. Now, after about 8 days, I find that my calluses do not reappear so quickly and my feet feel and look smooth. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing -- when I used it everyday, I had to replace the batteries very often. Now, the batteries last much longer. I just couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin that was removed.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Makes your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> It works but I need to use it frequently to maintain smoothness.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful. If you press down too much it will stop working at all.</li>
            <li> I love this electronic foot file!! It saved me so much money on getting pedicure in a salon. So worth the money to get this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Ooooh this is a wonderful piece of equipment.  I had dry hard thick dead skin on my feet that was cracked and looked very ugly so I decided to look at for a foot file since the pedicure techicians would often cut me.  The amopee was way to expensive then I saw this product.  Trust me its the best thing that happened to my feet.  With one use I now have soft nice smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Works well but wheel wears out fast</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and looking around, I decided to purchase this pedicure file and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This gently removes callus and is very easy to use. I plan on purchasing more for Christmas gifts later this year!</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews on this thing.  It runs fine as long as you hold it upright or sideways, however, you point down with it to go toward your feet (for which I might add it is meant for) it quits running.  It says it can even be used in shower.  Well how in the world is it going to work in the shower, when it quits running as soon as you turn it down?!  I would not recommend this product to anyone else.  I am highly disappointed. Was actually looking forward to using it?????  A total waste of good money.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it says it will do! If you are getting this read the instructions and put lotion on your feet like it tells you to. You won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
            <li> It works!  I am using daily, to remove dead skin.  My feet are finally getting softer.  This is packaged very well, and is one of the least expensive electronic foot files.  It did not come with batteries, so have yours ready, because you will want to use this immediately.  Keep the unit moving lightly over the heel and sides of foot, wherever you have hard, dry skin or calluses.  Depending on how bad your feet are, I promise you will see results quickly!  Use the unit on the dry foot, follow with a quick rinse and apply foot cream.  I am very happy with this purchase, and with the sellers.</li>
            <li> I just used it for 3 minutes or so and started noticing the results. I think it&#x27;s important to not use too much at once. A bit at a time. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Filled the bathroom with foot crud dust. Needed protective gear. Hazardous waste suit and plastic sheeting. üò≥Needs some kind of safety shield over the rollers.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.  No problems.</li>
            <li> Works great! My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Pedicure foot file.  Everything the article said it would be.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it really work but I wish it was rechargeable....</li>
            <li> Works great!  I did not expect it to work as well as it does.</li>
            <li> So amazing! I have always had rough skin on my feet and have tried every type of foot cream, pumice stone, pedi-egg things there are! But this worked wonders! Just 2 treatments, and it&#x27;s like my feet are brand new! Well worth the price! This picture was taken after having done just *ONE* treatment to my left foot and none to my right (except a few seconds on the ball of my foot before stopping to take a picture). Amazing, right?!</li>
            <li> Motor seems a little weak but with patience and some time it does smooth the tough skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I have used for several days and my feet look great.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews on products but this REALLY WORKS!!!!!  I only wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture of my nasty cracked heels.  My heels were so bad it was embarrassing.  They were way worse than the before pic on the model.  I seriously can&#x27;t believe how much better they are.  There was a huge difference after one use but I&#x27;ve been using it now for about four days and the difference is incredible!  My husband can&#x27;t believe it either!  I&#x27;m using it with the Makhry  Moisturising Silicone GEL Heel Socks and the O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s cracked heel cream.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the difference!  Amazing!</li>
            <li> One of the best products that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and it works.&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this soooo much. I suffer from exzama and i get very hard cracked heels and makes me embarassed to wear opened back shoes because im afraid simeone may notice my damaged heels but when i used this product my feet became sooooo smooth and dry and cracked skin was no more with in just seconds now i have more confidance and no longer will be ashamed of my feet thank you soooo much. Also the customer service was awsome i did have a minor issue with the item but i was quickly contacted by the seller and issue was solved very prompt and respectful again thank you.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my feets life?  LOL  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  Follow Directions, and I put some of my favorite lotion on and some soft furry socks before bed, and Feet THANK ME in the morning!! :)  My feet have never been softer or looked better! :)  Nature Tech Store Very nice Folks to buy from, Answered my questions and assisted quickly when I needed!</li>
            <li> It is just as described.</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough even when the batteries were changed.</li>
            <li> wife says it works very well</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and came into this product with pretty high expectations, and purchased it for my son who has very bad callouses. His review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving it today, I read through the instructions (thorough and understandable), installed the batteries (easy to accomplish) and went outside to have some good lighting and to avoid having skin fly everywhere inside. I switched to the grinding head before starting off to work on the callouses, and goodness the skin was just flying off like I was taking an electric sander to a rough piece of wood. After working on them for about 10 minutes all told (going from callous to callous and then starting all over again more times than I could keep count on) there was very noticeable progress on all of the callouses. I then switched to the standard head and worked on the whole of each foot to finish off my first use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After heading in and washing off my feet I was overjoyed by how much better my feet looked after just this first go. The soles and heels were much smoother and looked considerably better than they had before I started, and my horrid, rough and ugly callouses were mostly smoothed over. I expect it will take having a go at it every day for perhaps up to a week before I can get the callouses completely ground down but the improvement is astounding. Even with all the work I put the rollers through they seem to have plenty of life left in them, and cleanup was just as easy as the instructions indicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend getting this product if you have rough feet and/or callouses. I fully intend to purchase replacement rollers to have on hand so I can keep my feet in good condition once I get them there, which shouldn&#x27;t take long. At this stage, I can&#x27;t think of any negatives, as even as a man with big hands the unit is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> For me, it bogged down, not enough power.</li>
            <li> this item stopped working after 2 uses. I left a message and the company called me and walked me through how to fix it. They were very very good at customer service and the product is great</li>
            <li> Hard to control, does not do a very good job.  I only have some spots on the heel of my foot, yet it could not remove it.</li>
            <li> Works great, even my husband likes using it. He has horribly calloused feet, and after using it the first time for a few minutes..he was amazed at how good his feet felt.</li>
            <li> good product for that price. Wish it said non electric</li>
            <li> Works great! My husband&#x27;s feet are now less terrifying! üòÜ</li>
            <li> Love this product!  No more need for pedicures unless it&#x27;s for a treat. Love me smooth and pretty feet!</li>
            <li> works well just as advertised - recommended!</li>
            <li> While it does a great job in removing scales the scales will come back even worse than before.  So either be forced to use it daily or take a medical route to solve your heel problem.</li>
            <li> Bought this pedi foot file it lasted for one use then wouldn&#x27;t work anymore!!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all....</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s overheating after 5 minutes. You can feel the device heating up through the calloused feet as well. Also the longer you have it on, the lesser the power since it uses battery power. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. It works great!</li>
            <li> worked exactly as expected.  sanded the bad cracked areas of my heel and left a smooth surface.  I&#x27;ll probably use it a few times over time to get the result I want.</li>
            <li> Kind of weak. Really expected more.</li>
            <li> This product works just the way I had hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;No regrets!</li>
            <li> The Good:  Actually removed several, aged hard calluses!  Light to hold and is much easier to use than most manual methods.  Comes with (2) wheels for removing calluses. Instructions are actually pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAD:  Goes thru batteries about every 3 to 5 minutes.  (even the expensive Lithium ones)  Difficult to change batteries compared to normal devises.  (Have to press hard and turn &amp;#34;battery holder&amp;#34; cover and it is not that easy to fit parts)  Seems to need more power. Easily bogged down!  Oftentimes, had to insert batteries several times to get the unit to work again.</li>
            <li> Im a barefoot girl all the time, and my feet show it!! This works amazingly well!!! My feet feel pretty!!  Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use and does the job. I received a personal e-mail from the Eric the owner of Nature Tech with tips on how to make the best use of this product. Eric is a class act who cares about his customers. I would give Eric and his product a ten star review if possible.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised! I have always had big callouses on the balls of my feet/heels (former dancer), and this helped smooth them out! Doesn&#x27;t last for long, so expect to use this product at least weekly.</li>
            <li> I have horrible calluses.  I usually have to use scissors every month to get them off.  Using this every night and a cream is making a huge difference on my feet.  IT DEFINITELY work and is WORTH the money.</li>
            <li> does a great job. br careful to not apply too much preasue</li>
            <li> This product is absolutey amazing!!! I hadn&#x27;t done a pedicure in months and was a bit skeptical about buying this product especially due to the price. My feet are now so smooth and soft...better than the pedi I get at a salon. My sister borrowed it and after using it was ready to get one. I will recommend this product to anyone  who wants a DIY and to save $$$</li>
            <li> This product worked really well for me. You just have to be kind of patient and not too aggressive with it. Because if you press too hard, the head stops spinning. It requires a pretty light touch. But it works really well.</li>
            <li> Received this produced and it does what the description says. Does a nice job on hard callusses.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this item before ordering and although some started there was not enough &#x27;power&#x27; I thought I would give it a try.  WOW! I used it the first time, careful to follow the instructions and not press too hard, and I was amazed!  There is no need to press hard....if you use it as stated in the instructions it works perfectly.  I wear high heels all day every day to work which causes some MAJOR callouses.  I got tired of paying to go get a pedicure every couple weeks just to keep them from getting too bad.  This little gems will save me a ton!  Awesome product!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product and customer service. If your product don&#x27;t work just let them know and they&#x27;ll help you. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product. I&#x27;ve only used it once and cannot believe what a huge difference it made.  Within a few minutes my heels were very smooth and the dry skin was gone. Very impressed with the outcome and I can see I will get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it goes through batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me!!</li>
            <li> Does not work on my feet no matter if they are dry or wet no matter how long I try to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It doesn&#x27;t get hot or burn your skin and it takes of the dead skin.  Never paying for a pedi again!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Had issues with it from day one. Only good thing is I loved the color.</li>
            <li> Works great!  So ease to use.</li>
            <li> operation is not strong enough, very weak</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a couple of months before I wrote a review so I could really check this gadget out. If I could give it 10 stars, I would! My feet were not in bad shape, but this beats any other products I have used by far. In fact, the only other time my feet felt so good was after a pedicure at a salon. I used it twice a week for the first two weeks, then backed off to once per week and even longer. I had a corn on the bottom of a big toe that I worked at slowly for the first couple weeks - about 4 times. I have not had the callous return there like it had been before and now it is just a quick pass over that area to keep it smooth. It has been about 3 1/2 months and I am still on the same set of AA batteries that I put in to start. Using this fantastic tool followed with a nice cream or lotion and my feet feel wonderful, look great. Don&#x27;t let this power file fool you as it can leave a tender spot if you push it against your skin. I love mine and will not be without one again.</li>
            <li> This is a poor product. The item stops turning as soon as it touches skin. Not sanitary to send it back. It is garbage. Stop selling this item. Also it only works with alkaline batteries. Rechargeble batteries will not work in this product.</li>
            <li> This was a great find for me! I am an elementary school librarian so I am on my feet all day at school...naturally my feet take a toll.  This worked wonders in a matter of minutes!!</li>
            <li> Worked well for us. Delivered early and used right away with great results.</li>
            <li> OMG the best invention ever.  I am 73 and my heels have always looked bad.  Never wore backless shoes, but do now!!! Would recommend this product for anyone with heel problem.  Husband had callous on bottom of foot, it is now gone and he is pain free</li>
            <li> OMG, this product is fabulous. I ordered, I paid for it, I waited, I got it, I used it! I will never have to look for anything again. The Nature Tech Pedi Electronic Pedicure Foot File is the best investment. Oh, it works and my feet were bad and now BEAUTIFUL. Thank you, thank you. I had been looking and checking at our local Super center, but I could not find it or they couldn,t find it, or they were out. So when I want to get something I go to my special place. Amazon.com. Of coarse they had several types and I selected this one and I am very happy. Another great small investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice and it is by far the best and easiest product I&#x27;ve ever used for my feet. So easy ~ there&#x27;s really no work involved and you can see results after the first time!!!</li>
            <li> Very simple and perfect item.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the Pedi Foot File!! She used the Pedi File as soon as she received it and after one use she is raving over how good her feet feel.  She said it feels like she just got a pedicure at a salon.  If you have dry, cracked feet or calluses then this product is all you need to get your feet feeling good again.</li>
            <li> OMG This thing is EXCELLENT IT REALLY WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works great. Although the first one I got was defective, they were very helpful and quick to replace it. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I bought it for her as part of all the Christmas presents... And even though it was the most inexpensive gift, she ended up liking this electric pedicure better than all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I bought it like 3 months ago from a department store and it was like $70 , to bad I didn&#x27;t see this brand here on amazon and for this low price I would definitely would buy like 3 or 4 of them for my daughter and friend for Christmas , but oh well can&#x27;t cry over spilled milk .really nice quality foot pedi though .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this electric pedicure. I&#x27;m going very often to a nail salon for a pedicure for my dry feet  they always cut my skin with a razor sometimes too much and&lt;br /&gt; I heard its not healthy for your feet, that is the reason I always go back for a pedicure .&lt;br /&gt; since I bought this device i realy  save a lot of money but  most importantly my feet are much healthier now .definitely one of my best purchases this year</li>
            <li> I really like this gadget.  I get the best results when using slow, circular motion on the problem areas.  Slather on some almond oil when you are done, pull on fuzzy socks and go to bed...wake up with smoother feet.  Be patient with the process, let the machine the work and you will have smooth feet in no time.</li>
            <li> My parents loved it, they say it works well. The only thing is that the batteries have to be new in order for it to work properly otherwise it spins really slow. Other than that the product is great and the shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it all the time, loves it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this callus remover. If you have very thick calluses, the kind I have had that grind holes in your socks, this device won&#x27;t get rid of them right away. You will have to work at it a little at a time, but it does make a difference. Don&#x27;t press this thing down when you use it - hold it lightly on the callus for best results. Otherwise the thing will slow down. If it stops while you are using it for a long time, give it a rest. Mine did stop but worked fine after resting. It is supposed to come with a protective little cover for the roller but mine was missing that cover.  One thing I like about this callus remover is that it will work with AA batteries that are still good but are not 100% charged anymore.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> purchsed used once didnt need much, worked great. got it out again and doesnt work, changed battiers just incase  but no,  unit was pretty exspensive for one use. husband tryed to fix but had to give. had to hear warning about buying on line..haha please do not purchase probly too late for me to get money back but can prevent others from purchasing this item. wish i didnt have to rate a one star but it did work once. DO not purchase</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have a different one I have been using mainly on my husbands feet but couldn&#x27;t get under his toes with it. This one I can get under them and a little between them too which is great. Thank you for this.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Wow my feet are smooth in less than a minute. Before yoga i just run this guy for a minute or so on my heels. My feet are smooth and pretty</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, DOES THE JOB VERY WELL, JUST REMEMBER NOT TO PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON ROLLER,IT IS ONLY A BATTARY POWERED MOTOR</li>
            <li> This product did not even last a week. You have to be extra careful in not applying too much pressure or it will brake which is what happened in my case. The bottom part where the batteries go also broke. If you are looking for a product to get the job done, i would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Does the job I want it to do.</li>
            <li> Does a heck of a good job. I have had problems for years with calluses on the bottoms of my big toes, and also calluses on my heals plus deeply cracked heals. I have used the sanding paddles sold to remove dead skin and calluses, and while they did work, they were a lot of work to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would take me almost an hour to do both heals and the bottoms of both big toes. My arms would get tired from all the time it took and the work. In addition to the sanding, you would have to do it twice. First time with the courser paper, and again with the smaller grit paper. The larger grit paper worked faster, but left jagged rough skin, so that had to be filed off to smooth with the smaller grit paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have used those things that look life a small food grater, to remove the dead skin and thick calluses. Yes, it worked, but I still had to use the sanding things to smooth out the really super ruff condition left from the grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item came last week and I have used it about three times and it only took a couple minutes each time. My feet looked so much better after each use. I only needed it on my left foot one time, but the right foot needed it used twice more. But that is because I have mostly walked on my right foot for the past three years (while recovering from breaking my left leg twice - each a year apart from each other). My feet feel so smooth, and the cracks are almost all gone. I have put some CeraVe cream on the heals and all over my feet, and it has made them even better.</li>
            <li> My NATURE TECH works GREAT. I am very pleased with the way my feet look now. Before I had been doing it by hand but this has made my life so much easier.No more spending an hour scrubbing on them with minimal results. Now it is done in just a matter of minutes. It feels very comfortable against my skin and you can see the results almost instantly. I could not ask for anymore from it. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> Saves my heels from splitting, love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product for your feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife for Mother&#x27;s Day.  We put in batteries and it worked beautifully.  Excellent purchase and very quick response by the seller.</li>
            <li> But it did not come with the promised &amp;#34; Includes 2 Mineral Pumice Stone Rollers&amp;#34; it only came with one. I&#x27;d have given them 5 stars if it would have included the 2. Everything else is perfect. I bought it as a gift for my mom for mothers day.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Slightly annoying as it bogs down easily for safety reasons.</li>
            <li> Helps save on the back pain from leaning over to do self-pedicures.</li>
            <li> Works good but batteries dont seem to last that long in it. Also rotating pumice is sensitive, if you press down even a little hard it skipps n stops spinning. But does make feet soft....</li>
            <li> does a great job on smoothing out my heels .</li>
            <li> This little guy does the job. No need to force it. Take your time with it for best results. I&#x27;m embarrassed to show my picture of my feet, but the dramatic results speak for themselves. Looks like night and day!</li>
            <li> So far I have used three times for me and one time for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use and worked well for me to remove my callus on my feet (men). I did not have issue with lack of power as I am dealing with human skin (not rust on iron).&lt;br /&gt;I played soccer quite a long period of time (amateur for fun) and had hard and touch callus on both feet.&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to remove some of it but it is just matter of time and patience, depending on the your feet condition.&lt;br /&gt;I felt much better after removing the callus. BTW, you may want to buy AA batteries in a bulk (from COSTCO or Walmart) to use this electric tool for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not electronic</li>
            <li> I used this one time and the rollers were dull</li>
            <li> Works great and perfect for sandal season.</li>
            <li> Taken a little off everyday works great</li>
            <li> Not as good a quality as I expected. I&#x27;ve used other ones that were much much better</li>
            <li> So great especially for the price! Works great and you get extra roller. I use it everyday and still on the original roller. Perfect for summer sandals!!</li>
            <li> This product is working very good thus far but have only had it for one week.  It has performed as I expected and is doing a good job in removing the built up dead skin from my feet.  Even after two uses it seems to be working well.  After reading some comments on this and other pedicure files, I decided to order some refills just so I would have them in case it did not perform well.  But so far it has filed the dead skin from my feet without having to replace the head with refill.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.  My wife suggested this for my badly callous and cracked skin on my heels.  After the first use I was very surprised at how well it worked.  You could see (smoke) powder from the dead skin sifting up from the rotating head.  After second use, I am convinced that if anyone has callous or cracked skin on their feet, this is for them.  Word of caution.  Do not apply to much pressure when using.  It can cause a burn as I found out when using on top of my foot.  The cream that comes with the unit is superb in moisturizing.  I wore a sock as stated and my feet now are smooth all over.</li>
            <li> i thought it was electric but it does the job but uses batteries a lot</li>
            <li> works well. takes the dead skin off very efficiently,</li>
            <li> ......&amp;#34;HAPPY HEALS&amp;#34;......</li>
            <li> works well, will be sending one for mom.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it for my pedicures and it really got rid of the dry skin and callouses. I have only used it on my dry feet, but you can wet your feet also. Having this will save me a lot of money on pedicures</li>
            <li> does a great job of removing callous&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Love this product!Best thing to happen to my feet</li>
            <li> I wish I took a before pic..hubby&#x27;s feet were the worse! Years of wearing construction boots &amp; never lotioning them..ugh!  Just after one application I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference! The lotion they give you works good, I also used a jojoba oil on them with socks overnight. Any oil would work. ie: baby oil, olive oil&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for sure. The price alone is equivalent to one pedicure.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t enough power to do the job it is supposed to do.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really, really works....removed a lot of the built up dry skin I had on my feet.  Felt smooth and am very pleased with this purchase.  Very easy to use and the fact I can use it in the shower is a real plus.</li>
            <li> It does do as said, but you have to be a contoruse to get all areas done. Batteries do not last very long.</li>
            <li> Great product and received sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> Works great, not expensive and unit is does the work for you just need to take a TLC with it. My beautiful wife loves it as she shows off her now lovely feet to all she encounters with her new collection of sandals and I now love her silky soft feet rubbing against my legs when we sleep.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this before, but better late than never.  It is excellent, fits in your hand perfectly, and gets rid of calluses quickly,&lt;br /&gt;and all the dry skin.  would suggest it to anyone over the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing some of the reviews here are from the company itself. I bought this product based on the reviews. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like it to be, but better than doing it by hand</li>
            <li> Great product that really works.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking at these for a while now. My mom got one and I tried hers and had to have one! Thing is, I refuse to pay $40-$50 for one of these. I bought this one when it was on the Amazon Prime Days sale. I got it for $20 and what a great buy! Its amazing. After carefully using it on the day I got it as to not over do it and end up with sore raw tootsies, I now use it once a week for maintenance and have never had such smooth pretty feet.</li>
            <li> GET THE ELECTRIC ONE NOT THE ONE RUNNING BY BATTERIES</li>
            <li> Really like this product so far. Only used it a couple times, and it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> This product does not have the power to work without stopping and getting jammed up. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> has enough power to do the job</li>
            <li> It came as promised, instruction was clear. Had for a long time use many types of paper files.  As you get older your body become less flexible.&lt;br /&gt;I bought at Amazon the Nature Tech Pedi, in short it did a wonderful job in a short time. Cleaning was also a breeze. Recommend.</li>
            <li> use it all the time ...love it</li>
            <li> Give 5 stars!  Product works great and service was great.</li>
            <li> This really works.I have had callouses for years and they are hard to smooth out. This works fine on your feet if you use it at least once a week for a touch up.  It is best to use sitting or standing in the shower so the skin dust will be in one place.  Do not do this while taking a shower.  You will get water in the battery.</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought this little machine. It&#x27;s a wonder!  My feet are looking amazing! I read the other reviews and they are all the real deal.  I really like the foot ointment too.</li>
            <li> Does not have enough power to truly make a difference. Overpriced.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Never realized my feet could feel so good with so little effort! Highly recommend! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Best unit for the price. They all do about the same thing, and this works well.</li>
            <li> works great, makes your feet nice and smooth</li>
            <li> does a pretty good job</li>
            <li> This works on smoothing out calluses but not removing them.  I don&#x27;t just use this on my feet I use it on my hands also.  I&#x27;m still very happy with this product as it is working for my needs.  I feel if you want salon results then go to the salon. I</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I would give it no stars if I could. Does not have any power and the rollers wear out with one use. I do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great for at home pedicures, easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;feet feel nice and smooth - price is right I just wish they sold more of a variety of replcement rollers only see extra course.</li>
            <li> Very good, the best üëç</li>
            <li> Does just as it promised. Not too rough, not too gentle. My feet looked and felt better after just one use. Perfect size. Good product; fair price.</li>
            <li> ***** All I can say honestly really nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a nurse working in a hospital and I walk a lot  I barely sit down my feet are killing me and they are very dry I am on my feet 9  to 10 hours a day 5 days a week and on top of it I don&#x27;t have time to go to a nail salon I&#x27;m not that type of person , I can tell you this pedicure machine definitely definitely helped me so much  and I saw a really quick results comparing how my feet  looks before I use the machine .&lt;br /&gt;I  recommended it to everyone  I work with in the hospital and they loved it, so I&#x27;m happy I help others&lt;br /&gt; also I save some money so it&#x27;s an extra bonus for me : )</li>
            <li> Amazing Product, works great. Great seller. Amazing customer service. I am impressed by the seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product. .. please remember to Only a little bit at a time! I had to learn the hard way.... Once you learn to respect how much dry skin it takes off, you will really enjoy it... I wish I would have taken a before and after pictures. . My advice is use it very Sparingly BEFORE Showers. ... in a week you should see amazing results. .. PLEASE remember just to take a little at a time. ... after the first week wait a couple of days to make sure you don&#x27;t take to much skin off.. IT IS A VERY PAINFULL MISTAKE...</li>
            <li> You must have brand new batteries!! Very powerful and worked great on my icky feet. Takes time, but worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> we both use it often(and like it too)</li>
            <li> Works great! It is very efficient.</li>
