            <li>LOL!</li>
            <li>Now, you may be wondering what makes this the best soap or why I think I can label things like that...    </li>
            <li>this soap is the best soap ever!!!  </li>
            <li>Been using for 15 years and am very happy with it, I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>It is the best soap I ever ever used for my face</li>
            <li>This bar has a very pleasant smell - in my opinion, and it makes loads of suds.  </li>
            <li>Still, very good product</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, and the vendor did a good job in getting it to me as promised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got great &#x27;slip,&#x27;</li>
            <li>It is great for hair and everything.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I was looking for a great ph balancing feminine wash---I didn&#x27;t find it in this.  </li>
            <li>What is great about it is that it isn&#x27;t soap at all.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my body when I ran out of  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, and it feels great on the body, too (</li>
            <li>It gives you a great lather and doesn&#x27;t itch afterwards.</li>
            <li>Worked great in restoring balance of things.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>I have used this on my face and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product, and I find the smell to be pleasant,</li>
            <li>This is an amazing soap!</li>
            <li>The best thing I love about this soap is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>It is great and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to alot of soaps &amp; perfumes - this is the best soap out there for anyone with allergies or whose skin dries out easily.</li>
            <li>It does smell like pinesol but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain my washclothes either, which is a good thing</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Good questions, but</li>
            <li>It has pH balancing or whatever that just leaves you feeling good.  </li>
            <li>The skin is the largest organ in the body, and surprisingly, needs to be on the acid side of the ph scale.  </li>
            <li>in a good way.</li>
            <li>&quot; I used it all over and was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It was ok but nothing great.</li>
            <li>I love this soap!  </li>
            <li>I know so many people that have purchased the soap at my recommendation, that I believe Nature&#x27;s Plus owes me some money!</li>
            <li>I love the scent &amp; the lather!</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you are looking for a new soap and want it to be awesome for getting your skin in good condition, I would give it a trial run.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever washed your vaginal area and felt a burning tingling kind of sensation...</li>
            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s magic, but it sure works great for what I need.</li>
            <li>While this soap has a very strong lemon scent it is miraculous.</li>
            <li>However, it has a very strong scent.</li>
            <li>For a happy and healthy balance of things, It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing bar.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for 2 years now and absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have turned many friends on to this soap and they all love it.</li>
            <li>Smelled great but didnt help much if youre using it for acne.</li>
            <li>:) I have told all my friends about it and they all love the soap as well.</li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect because of the ph of the bar is 6.5, and thats the same ph as our skin</li>
            <li>I really love this face soap.</li>
            <li>but I am too cheap to use it as a body soap!).</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s ph balances</li>
            <li>I had so many lines in my face after months of use.  </li>
            <li>I did see many of my blackheads dissapear since stopping use of this bar.</li>
            <li>No irritation or dryness, love the refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>My mother, sister, and I all love this soap.</li>
            <li>reason why I have used it more than once was because I wanted to give it a chance and see if changing up the rest of my routine would help.</li>
            <li>For my personal hygiene needs, it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>my day!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does cost more than an alkiline bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed my hair with it in a pinch, and I have heard from numerous women that it&#x27;s especially good for washing their \\&quot;nether-regions\\</li>
            <li>Between the prebiotic tablets, drinking lots of cranberry juice and eating lots of yogurt and this soap, I have been healthy for months.</li>
            <li>This item is much better than any soap on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>and I love most of the company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is effective and rinses away cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it anywhere else to be honest!</li>
            <li>It has a very nature-ish smell, so that&#x27;s good for people who don&#x27;t like foo-foo smells.</li>
            <li>I originally sought this cleanser because I read that products with acidic pH levels were better for women&#x27;s \\&quot;nether regions,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Natural Beauty cleansing bar is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>easy on the skin....</li>
            <li>This product worked fine for me, so I gave it two stars.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this soap, gets soggy quick so keep in soap box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to contain it in a soap dish to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li>It mentioned it was a great soap for a woman&#x27;s private parts and this couldn&#x27;t be more true.</li>
            <li>The produc has a very mild scent  but leaves you feel very fresh.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a great product, and I find the smell to be similar to strong lemon.  </li>
            <li>The Vitamin Shoppe&#x27;s sale price is fantastic, as I have paid up to $4.99 per bar in stores.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing bar keeps my face smooth and evenly tone.  </li>
            <li>For me it is important to know what I apply to my skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is really light too.</li>
            <li>pH paper is cheap, you will be amazed if you start testing things.</li>
            <li>you know how many facial products &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; your face, but then after, it&#x27;s like every trace of the good oils on your skin were just stripped away?</li>
            <li>Well, this leaves the good stuff on your face so you feel clean but soft.</li>
            <li>I love the bright color and smell (although I can see how the scent might be too much for someone sensitive).</li>
            <li>Straightforward.  </li>
            <li>Very much worth the higher price! :)  </li>
            <li>It washes clean from my skin.      </li>
            <li>My face feels clean but not destroyed -</li>
            <li>and I always feel clean but not squeaky clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>I gave this natural soap a try and just love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and used to have to special order it through my health food store.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to use this soap for the whole family</li>
            <li>I brought this cleanser because I heard that it was good for cleaning one&#x27;s nether regions because it has a low PH.</li>
            <li>Excellent soap for delicate areas.  </li>
            <li>a lot more so than most commercial soaps out there.</li>
            <li>Even when I&#x27;m using my most powerful moisturizing cream, I still get roughness in my skin from it drying out so much.</li>
            <li>It dissipates really quickly though -</li>
            <li>The bar dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li>This bar is very soothing to the skin and rinses away easily.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey because of its greatness, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great for a face soap.    </li>
            <li>Your skin and much more specifically your delicate spots require a higher PH Balance - Making it more acid - to keep things clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I started using this soap 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t bought a different kind since.</li>
            <li>FOr me it is worth the tradeoff.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh scent</li>
            <li>cost is well worth the benefits provided by this</li>
            <li>This was the first product I found that rinses clean and leaves my skin just clean and very lightly-scented, without changing the texture or making me itchy.  </li>
            <li>Natural Beauty has a light, clean, fresh fragrance and reminds me of Hawaii.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can induce sunburn, so I try to stay out of the sun right after using it or apply sun screen.</li>
            <li>My brother-in-law was so right.  </li>
            <li>Which brings to mind that it is actually hard to find in stores, and I am lucky to find one retail source within 100 miles; therefore, online orders work great.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s much closer to skin pH and should leave the skin in a much more comfortable state compared to regular soap.    </li>
            <li>It has a strong, but not heavy lemon scent.  </li>
            <li>Very lemony smell which dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of pH paper testing soaps &amp; shampoos, and most if not all are highly alkalkine, even ones that say they&#x27;re meant for sensitive skin or babies!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin and areas due to its ph balance.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I read an article about it that it is pH balance and okay to use for washing your private areas so as not to alter the pH &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I personally love it, and the cons I listed above aren&#x27;t cons to me, but may be cons for someone else</li>
            <li>In all the 11 years I have been married to him</li>
            <li>Anyway, the soap allows you to feel fresh and confident all day long.</li>
            <li>exactly as promised...</li>
            <li>truly has only two safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>we require a higher PH balance to keep our delicates and not so delicates healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that....</li>
            <li>This is an excellent sydnet to rebalance troubled skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves me skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin and hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I liked how soft this product left my hair.</li>
            <li>Your skin will never feel so soft or be so healthy as with the Natural Beauty Cleansing Bar.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to keep it in a dish that drains, so that it doesn&#x27;t sit in water or you won&#x27;t have it around for long.      </li>
            <li>I can easily replace it with Dove or something simple.</li>
            <li>Slightly \\&quot;lemony\\&quot; with undertones of warm vanilla.</li>
            <li>The soap has a strong yellow color.  </li>
            <li>even use it for shampooing my hair in the shower when I don&#x27;t have my regular shampoo and my hair comes out super shiny!</li>
            <li>I have tried this soap and it&#x27;s the best soap for cleaning your face as dryness is far far less than if you would wash your face with regular soap!</li>
            <li>but this makes my hair come out much softer and nicer.  </li>
            <li>Though, myy husband uses it for his whole body, face, and hair.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy this cleansing bar and look forward to fresher, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>One thing I really like about this bar is the smell of lemon.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m very fussy about what products I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin (test for oily skin: after you wake up or at end of day, press a piece of paper bag against the side of your nose for a minute.</li>
            <li>It has really improved my boyfriend&#x27;s arm skin too.</li>
            <li>I bought the soap hoping it would protect my skin&#x27;s acid mantle and be a rather gentle soap.</li>
            <li>I buy this for years for 4.99 I go to Amazon and get charged almost twice as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is named very correctly............</li>
            <li>It CAN BE VERY drying.</li>
            <li>This soap is more acid than it is basic, which helps protect the skin&#x27;s natural protective barrier, the &amp;#34;acid mantle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Plus, this lasts forever and it has a nice smell (but not too strong, very subtle)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, the scent is strong and a little like pine sol (with citrus), so if you&#x27;re looking for an unscented bar this one is -not- for you.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice any improvements while I used it, I have used other soaps that worked better.</li>
            <li>You must keep the soap in a dry place because it does dissolve easily.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s the only thing I use to clean my acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>first time you use this, your vaginal area feels soft and moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>When I got the soap, I read the little paper it came with that says it is safe for gently washing babies and to even use as a face wash and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But I just found out that there are other scents the company has as well such as peach that also smell great but are not as likely to melt.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to get rid of acne, it will work, but only because it is super drying.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, easily irritated and dry.</li>
            <li>This one got high reviews</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it melts kind of quickly.</li>
            <li>There is a reason you wash with a higher PH balance (do the words fresh and clean mean anything?), and that is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>It is really gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>Defnitely better to use than everyday soap.</li>
            <li>Am 55, normal soap am allergic and drys skin.</li>
            <li>I quickly place it on  a shlefin my closet near the shower and it doeslastlonger, though not as long as asoapbar.</li>
            <li>At first I used it only on my face, but use it all over when I travel, or as a treat.  </li>
            <li>whereas normal soap is alkaline and upsets the natural balance of things.  </li>
            <li>I have so many black and white heads on my cheeks forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li>so you have less harmful effects when you want a clean face.</li>
            <li>I had been using natural shampoo</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend noticed the soft texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin (I react to almost everything).</li>
            <li>I tried this soap based on research I had done online about natural soaps.  </li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>With this, my face is so luxuriously soft and normal-feeling.</li>
            <li>this non soap , soap leaves the skin feeling ultra soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any real experience that guides me here besides knowing a couple folks who have had enough school to know...</li>
            <li>no harsh after effects.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I literally just take my wet hand and rub it ONCE on the soap which gets enough soap to clean my face.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive and I have only found Juice Beauty products to be okay for the delicate skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to strong smells, I would avoid this soap and go for another one that is unscented with at least a neutral pH.</li>
            <li>and my hair loss has gone back to normal amounts.  </li>
            <li>I lather my scalp only and rinse, then do what I normal do for my hair care.</li>
            <li>The full list of ingredients is not available on the Nature&#x27;s Plus website either.</li>
            <li>That means it won&#x27;t clog your pores or dry your skin out too much.</li>
            <li>I am a 40 y.o. woman who has delt with moderate adult acne since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>has made my skin so soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li>When i used those harsh cleansers like regular soap i broke out constantly with large lumps and puss filled acne, and got dry patches and redness in the face.</li>
            <li>It was the only product that cleared up my adult acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s low PH also supports your skin&#x27;s natural defense against bacteria.</li>
            <li>( My gn recommended it for sensitive female areas as well.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive</li>
            <li>Not recommended for dry (or even normal) skin.</li>
            <li>The only other soap I use consistently is Dr. Bronners, and I switch between the two.</li>
            <li>My face is not dry and irritated anymore.    </li>
            <li>If you feel dry using this its usually right after you wash, but after a few mins it goes away completely.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin soft, but it did dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever had problems with dry or sensitive skin, I would suggest trying something else.</li>
            <li>Usually with my old alkaline soap my legs and body would be really itchy once I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have used thhis soapless beauty bar for several yers now and while it is pricey, I really like the way my skin feels when useing itONe tip isnot to leave the bar in the shower or soap dish since it keepsweaaring down when wxposed to water.</li>

            <li> What is great about it is that it isn&#x27;t soap at all.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my body when I ran out of  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, and it feels great on the body, too (</li>
            <li> It gives you a great lather and doesn&#x27;t itch afterwards.</li>
            <li> Worked great in restoring balance of things.</li>
            <li> Smells great</li>
            <li> I have used this on my face and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product, and I find the smell to be pleasant,</li>
            <li> This is an amazing soap!</li>
            <li> The best thing I love about this soap is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> It is great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to alot of soaps &amp; perfumes - this is the best soap out there for anyone with allergies or whose skin dries out easily.</li>
            <li> It does smell like pinesol but in a good way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain my washclothes either, which is a good thing</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> Good questions, but</li>
            <li> It has pH balancing or whatever that just leaves you feeling good.  </li>
            <li> The skin is the largest organ in the body, and surprisingly, needs to be on the acid side of the ph scale.  </li>
            <li> in a good way.</li>
            <li> &quot; I used it all over and was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It was ok but nothing great.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  </li>
            <li> I know so many people that have purchased the soap at my recommendation, that I believe Nature&#x27;s Plus owes me some money!</li>
            <li> I love the scent &amp; the lather!</li>
            <li> Bottom line, if you are looking for a new soap and want it to be awesome for getting your skin in good condition, I would give it a trial run.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever washed your vaginal area and felt a burning tingling kind of sensation...</li>
            <li> nice product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s magic, but it sure works great for what I need.</li>
            <li> While this soap has a very strong lemon scent it is miraculous.</li>
            <li> However, it has a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> For a happy and healthy balance of things, It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing bar.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for 2 years now and absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have turned many friends on to this soap and they all love it.</li>
            <li> Smelled great but didnt help much if youre using it for acne.</li>
            <li> :) I have told all my friends about it and they all love the soap as well.</li>
            <li> :).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect because of the ph of the bar is 6.5, and thats the same ph as our skin</li>
            <li> I really love this face soap.</li>
            <li> but I am too cheap to use it as a body soap!).</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s ph balances</li>
            <li> I had so many lines in my face after months of use.  </li>
            <li> I did see many of my blackheads dissapear since stopping use of this bar.</li>
            <li> No irritation or dryness, love the refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> My mother, sister, and I all love this soap.</li>
            <li> reason why I have used it more than once was because I wanted to give it a chance and see if changing up the rest of my routine would help.</li>
            <li> For my personal hygiene needs, it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> my day!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does cost more than an alkiline bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed my hair with it in a pinch, and I have heard from numerous women that it&#x27;s especially good for washing their \\&quot;nether-regions\\</li>
            <li> Between the prebiotic tablets, drinking lots of cranberry juice and eating lots of yogurt and this soap, I have been healthy for months.</li>
            <li> This item is much better than any soap on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> and I love most of the company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is effective and rinses away cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it anywhere else to be honest!</li>
            <li> It has a very nature-ish smell, so that&#x27;s good for people who don&#x27;t like foo-foo smells.</li>
            <li> I originally sought this cleanser because I read that products with acidic pH levels were better for women&#x27;s \\&quot;nether regions,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Natural Beauty cleansing bar is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> easy on the skin....</li>
            <li> This product worked fine for me, so I gave it two stars.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this soap, gets soggy quick so keep in soap box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to contain it in a soap dish to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li> It mentioned it was a great soap for a woman&#x27;s private parts and this couldn&#x27;t be more true.</li>
            <li> The produc has a very mild scent  but leaves you feel very fresh.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a great product, and I find the smell to be similar to strong lemon.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin Shoppe&#x27;s sale price is fantastic, as I have paid up to $4.99 per bar in stores.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing bar keeps my face smooth and evenly tone.  </li>
            <li> For me it is important to know what I apply to my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is really light too.</li>
            <li> pH paper is cheap, you will be amazed if you start testing things.</li>
            <li> you know how many facial products &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; your face, but then after, it&#x27;s like every trace of the good oils on your skin were just stripped away?</li>
            <li> Well, this leaves the good stuff on your face so you feel clean but soft.</li>
            <li> I love the bright color and smell (although I can see how the scent might be too much for someone sensitive).</li>
            <li> Straightforward.  </li>
            <li> Very much worth the higher price! :)  </li>
            <li> It washes clean from my skin.      </li>
            <li> My face feels clean but not destroyed -</li>
            <li> and I always feel clean but not squeaky clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I gave this natural soap a try and just love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and used to have to special order it through my health food store.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to use this soap for the whole family</li>
            <li> I brought this cleanser because I heard that it was good for cleaning one&#x27;s nether regions because it has a low PH.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap for delicate areas.  </li>
            <li> a lot more so than most commercial soaps out there.</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m using my most powerful moisturizing cream, I still get roughness in my skin from it drying out so much.</li>
            <li> It dissipates really quickly though -</li>
            <li> The bar dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li> This bar is very soothing to the skin and rinses away easily.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey because of its greatness, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great for a face soap.    </li>
            <li> Your skin and much more specifically your delicate spots require a higher PH Balance - Making it more acid - to keep things clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t bought a different kind since.</li>
            <li> FOr me it is worth the tradeoff.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh scent</li>
            <li> cost is well worth the benefits provided by this</li>
            <li> This was the first product I found that rinses clean and leaves my skin just clean and very lightly-scented, without changing the texture or making me itchy.  </li>
            <li> Natural Beauty has a light, clean, fresh fragrance and reminds me of Hawaii.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can induce sunburn, so I try to stay out of the sun right after using it or apply sun screen.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law was so right.  </li>
            <li> Which brings to mind that it is actually hard to find in stores, and I am lucky to find one retail source within 100 miles; therefore, online orders work great.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s much closer to skin pH and should leave the skin in a much more comfortable state compared to regular soap.    </li>
            <li> It has a strong, but not heavy lemon scent.  </li>
            <li> Very lemony smell which dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of pH paper testing soaps &amp; shampoos, and most if not all are highly alkalkine, even ones that say they&#x27;re meant for sensitive skin or babies!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin and areas due to its ph balance.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read an article about it that it is pH balance and okay to use for washing your private areas so as not to alter the pH &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I personally love it, and the cons I listed above aren&#x27;t cons to me, but may be cons for someone else</li>
            <li> In all the 11 years I have been married to him</li>
            <li> Anyway, the soap allows you to feel fresh and confident all day long.</li>
            <li> exactly as promised...</li>
            <li> truly has only two safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> we require a higher PH balance to keep our delicates and not so delicates healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that....</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sydnet to rebalance troubled skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves me skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin and hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I liked how soft this product left my hair.</li>
            <li> Your skin will never feel so soft or be so healthy as with the Natural Beauty Cleansing Bar.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to keep it in a dish that drains, so that it doesn&#x27;t sit in water or you won&#x27;t have it around for long.      </li>
            <li> I can easily replace it with Dove or something simple.</li>
            <li> Slightly \\&quot;lemony\\&quot; with undertones of warm vanilla.</li>
            <li> The soap has a strong yellow color.  </li>
            <li> even use it for shampooing my hair in the shower when I don&#x27;t have my regular shampoo and my hair comes out super shiny!</li>
            <li> I have tried this soap and it&#x27;s the best soap for cleaning your face as dryness is far far less than if you would wash your face with regular soap!</li>
            <li> but this makes my hair come out much softer and nicer.  </li>
            <li> Though, myy husband uses it for his whole body, face, and hair.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy this cleansing bar and look forward to fresher, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> One thing I really like about this bar is the smell of lemon.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m very fussy about what products I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin (test for oily skin: after you wake up or at end of day, press a piece of paper bag against the side of your nose for a minute.</li>
            <li> It has really improved my boyfriend&#x27;s arm skin too.</li>
            <li> I bought the soap hoping it would protect my skin&#x27;s acid mantle and be a rather gentle soap.</li>
            <li> I buy this for years for 4.99 I go to Amazon and get charged almost twice as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is named very correctly............</li>
            <li> It CAN BE VERY drying.</li>
            <li> This soap is more acid than it is basic, which helps protect the skin&#x27;s natural protective barrier, the &amp;#34;acid mantle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Plus, this lasts forever and it has a nice smell (but not too strong, very subtle)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, the scent is strong and a little like pine sol (with citrus), so if you&#x27;re looking for an unscented bar this one is -not- for you.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice any improvements while I used it, I have used other soaps that worked better.</li>
            <li> You must keep the soap in a dry place because it does dissolve easily.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s the only thing I use to clean my acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> first time you use this, your vaginal area feels soft and moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> When I got the soap, I read the little paper it came with that says it is safe for gently washing babies and to even use as a face wash and shampoo.  </li>
            <li> But I just found out that there are other scents the company has as well such as peach that also smell great but are not as likely to melt.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to get rid of acne, it will work, but only because it is super drying.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, easily irritated and dry.</li>
            <li> This one got high reviews</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it melts kind of quickly.</li>
            <li> There is a reason you wash with a higher PH balance (do the words fresh and clean mean anything?), and that is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> It is really gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> Defnitely better to use than everyday soap.</li>
            <li> Am 55, normal soap am allergic and drys skin.</li>
            <li> I quickly place it on  a shlefin my closet near the shower and it doeslastlonger, though not as long as asoapbar.</li>
            <li> At first I used it only on my face, but use it all over when I travel, or as a treat.  </li>
            <li> whereas normal soap is alkaline and upsets the natural balance of things.  </li>
            <li> I have so many black and white heads on my cheeks forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li> so you have less harmful effects when you want a clean face.</li>
            <li> I had been using natural shampoo</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend noticed the soft texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin (I react to almost everything).</li>
            <li> I tried this soap based on research I had done online about natural soaps.  </li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With this, my face is so luxuriously soft and normal-feeling.</li>
            <li> this non soap , soap leaves the skin feeling ultra soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any real experience that guides me here besides knowing a couple folks who have had enough school to know...</li>
            <li> no harsh after effects.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I literally just take my wet hand and rub it ONCE on the soap which gets enough soap to clean my face.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive and I have only found Juice Beauty products to be okay for the delicate skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to strong smells, I would avoid this soap and go for another one that is unscented with at least a neutral pH.</li>
            <li> and my hair loss has gone back to normal amounts.  </li>
            <li> I lather my scalp only and rinse, then do what I normal do for my hair care.</li>
            <li> The full list of ingredients is not available on the Nature&#x27;s Plus website either.</li>
            <li> That means it won&#x27;t clog your pores or dry your skin out too much.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 y.o. woman who has delt with moderate adult acne since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> has made my skin so soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li> When i used those harsh cleansers like regular soap i broke out constantly with large lumps and puss filled acne, and got dry patches and redness in the face.</li>
            <li> It was the only product that cleared up my adult acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s low PH also supports your skin&#x27;s natural defense against bacteria.</li>
            <li> ( My gn recommended it for sensitive female areas as well.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive</li>
            <li> Not recommended for dry (or even normal) skin.</li>
            <li> The only other soap I use consistently is Dr. Bronners, and I switch between the two.</li>
            <li> My face is not dry and irritated anymore.    </li>
            <li> If you feel dry using this its usually right after you wash, but after a few mins it goes away completely.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin soft, but it did dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had problems with dry or sensitive skin, I would suggest trying something else.</li>
            <li> Usually with my old alkaline soap my legs and body would be really itchy once I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have used thhis soapless beauty bar for several yers now and while it is pricey, I really like the way my skin feels when useing itONe tip isnot to leave the bar in the shower or soap dish since it keepsweaaring down when wxposed to water.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what i like about this soap, it&#x27;s far less harsh than what i usually used (clean and clear, regular hand soap, etc.).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular soap</li>
            <li> I use 2 types of moisturizers when im feeling extra dry, one is called Montana Emu Ranch Replenishing lotion and the other one is called Skin MD Natural</li>
            <li> Even so, I&#x27;d had problems with my scalp for the past couple of years, and nothing seemed to help much.  </li>
            <li> You go through an entire day without feeling dry or chaffed.</li>
            <li> , i use these before bed when i feel extra dry.</li>
            <li> I use it 6 times a week, i wet my face with only water on the off day just to give my skin a break from constant washing, because like with anything you will get dry.</li>
            <li> We have sensitive skin and this is one of the few soaps we can use without problems.</li>
            <li> Got this after a recommendation from my doctor after taking a long course of antibiotics.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other soaps.  </li>
            <li> I am 38 with Acne prone, dry, but oily skin.  </li>
            <li> This soap was recommended to me for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> and it DOES NOT last twice as long as ordinary soap.  </li>
            <li> To be clear, this isn&#x27;t a cleanser solely meant for that region, I&#x27;ve used it on my face and body too, and behind my ears, but it&#x27;s the only one I can use everywhere.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product but maily for peri care not really body care.</li>
            <li> My oil bleeds thru to the other side.)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an itchy residue like millions of other soaps.</li>
            <li> I know it is a pricier soap, but a little bit goes a very, very long way.</li>
            <li> It will dry your skin a little if you don&#x27;t have extremely oily</li>
            <li> In other words, the color of the soap is the color that washes down the drain.  </li>
            <li> This product smells like pinesol, but it works very well on troubled skin.</li>
            <li> So, rather than just use it \\&quot;down there,\\</li>
            <li> and they started to go down.</li>
            <li> (you have to rinse it down when you&#x27;re done).     </li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL products including the expensive ones only sold on t.v.</li>
            <li> and I will be using this on our little one.  </li>
            <li> but while you&#x27;re in the shower, the smell is a little industrial.</li>
            <li> It smells a little lemonesque and does the job in an uncomplicated manner.  </li>
            <li> This can be a nuisance if you don&#x27;t rinse it off the side of the tub, as it leaves the yellow color behind.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this soap a few years ago, and it changed my life.</li>
            <li> dried and irritated my skin on face and hands where i used it....</li>
            <li> There are so few soaps on the market at the correct ph~ here</li>
            <li> this is one of the few soaps you will find that does have a PH between 4.1 and 4.5.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even USE soap or any soap-like product for years, because they all made me either itchy or made my skin feel like plastic or just plain stunk.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was somewhat slow, but about average.</li>
            <li> &quot; since the PH of this soap does not disrupt the delicate bacteria/yeast balance down there.</li>
            <li> It also leaves yellow marks on fabrics and the shower soap holder that can be a little difficult to scrub away.</li>
            <li> My skin never feels dry or unpleasant like it can feel with regular soap.    </li>
            <li> Artificial fragrances bother me, but this scent does not - perhaps it&#x27;s all natural.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients or the soap itseft.</li>
            <li> Now no more..</li>
            <li> I have used this bar on and off for the past year, for a month or two at a time when I do use it.</li>
            <li> I was deathly afraid of messing around with soaps down there because I&#x27;m prone to allergic reactions, but after reading about the soap&#x27;s low ph and how it wouldn&#x27;t upset anything, I bought some.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this in any of the other reviews, but for some reason my poor husband was the one this happened to.</li>
            <li> Other products are too irritating.</li>
            <li> so I can wash my delicate hoohaa area without worrying i&#x27;ll get irritated.</li>
            <li> My only issue is the crazy lemon pine sol smell.</li>
            <li> It might be the correct pH for your skin, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it helps if it&#x27;s stripping everything</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain the bad things that regular soap contains.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I feel terrible, especially since he leaves for a 48 hour shift early tomorrow morning.</li>
            <li> This soap dried and irritated my skin really bad after few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product dried our family&#x27;s skin out really bad.</li>
            <li> Sadly I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well, he used it and instantly broke out in terrible hives on his hip, legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> However, if my skin is particularly angry, it is the Nature&#x27;s Plus that I reach for.  </li>
            <li> Cheesy - maybe,</li>
            <li> It seems impossible to find out what ingredients the soap *</li>
            <li> But this isn&#x27;t bad for face and body, although not something I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> but I went through two bars in one week :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a 40 y.o. woman who has delt with moderate adult acne since my early 20&#x27;s. I have tried SEVERAL products including the expensive ones only sold on t.v. Since I started washing my face with this cleansing bar a year ago, I have had maybe 8 pimples. It might not work this well for everyone but for five bucks why not try? &lt;3</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing bar.  I bought it because I read an article about it that it is pH balance and okay to use for washing your private areas so as not to alter the pH &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.  When I got the soap, I read the little paper it came with that says it is safe for gently washing babies and to even use as a face wash and shampoo.  We are expecting in November and I will be using this on our little one.  I have used it as a shampoo and I love it.  I had been using natural shampoo but this makes my hair come out much softer and nicer.  My face is very sensitive and I have only found Juice Beauty products to be okay for the delicate skin on my face.  Though, myy husband uses it for his whole body, face, and hair.  It is his all-in-one and saves him time in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, the scent is strong and a little like pine sol (with citrus), so if you&#x27;re looking for an unscented bar this one is -not- for you.  Artificial fragrances bother me, but this scent does not - perhaps it&#x27;s all natural.    I&#x27;ve never had problem skin but tried this \\&quot;soap\\&quot; out of curiosity.  It&#x27;s not actually a soap but a combination of allantoin and vit. E.  This combination (according to the literature) has a pH that&#x27;s much closer to skin pH and should leave the skin in a much more comfortable state compared to regular soap.    I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for 2 years now and absolutely love it - wouldn&#x27;t want to use anything else.  The cleanser is effective and rinses away cleanly.  My skin never feels dry or unpleasant like it can feel with regular soap.    It&#x27;s got great &#x27;slip,&#x27; so I use it for shaving my legs too.  (Try -that- with regular soap and you&#x27;ll probably regret it.)  The accompanying literature mentions using it as a shampoo, but I wouldn&#x27;t.    The soap has a strong yellow color.  It&#x27;s best to contain it in a soap dish to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I have used this cleansing bar for about 31 years, and started using it when I worked in a health food store in the &#x27;70s.  At first I used it only on my face, but use it all over when I travel, or as a treat.  Contrary to the package enclosure, it DOES sting the eyes (a lot) and it DOES NOT last twice as long as ordinary soap.  However, it&#x27;s a great product, and I find the smell to be similar to strong lemon.  I feel that my skin has truly benefitted from it over the years, as I am 52 and my skin looks younger.  The Vitamin Shoppe&#x27;s sale price is fantastic, as I have paid up to $4.99 per bar in stores.  Which brings to mind that it is actually hard to find in stores, and I am lucky to find one retail source within 100 miles; therefore, online orders work great.  Enjoy this cleansing bar and look forward to fresher, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> This cleansing bar keeps my face smooth and evenly tone.  I get compliments all the time when I am using this bar.  It is great for hair and everything.  The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing soap! Great for sensitive skin and areas due to its ph balance. It has a plesant lemon scent and last for a while.    The only complaint I have is that it melts kind of quickly. I leave it in the shower and it melts over time so that I would have to use chunks of it.    But I just found out that there are other scents the company has as well such as peach that also smell great but are not as likely to melt.</li>
            <li> Natural Beauty cleansing bar is absolutely the best. I am allergic to almost every soap and cleansing bar out there. Natural Beauty has a light, clean, fresh fragrance and reminds me of Hawaii. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was looking for a great ph balancing feminine wash---I didn&#x27;t find it in this.  After about a week&#x27;s use I notice irritation, burring, and over drying in my feminine area.  But this isn&#x27;t bad for face and body, although not something I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a decade and I love it. It leaves me skin feeling soft and clean. I love the bright color and smell (although I can see how the scent might be too much for someone sensitive). I recommend it to all of my friends, esp anyone with skin problems. It&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: This soap dried and irritated my skin really bad after few weeks. I&#x27;m not sure if it was an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients or the soap itseft. I liked how soft this product left my hair. Sadly I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to use this cleansing bar a week ago and I love it. It leaves my skin and hair soft and clean. Even my boyfriend noticed the soft texture of my hair. One thing I really like about this bar is the smell of lemon. It does smell like pinesol but in a good way. The only con I can find in this soap is that it doesn&#x27;t mention the ingredients. I have sensitive skin (I react to almost everything). For me it is important to know what I apply to my skin. I contacted the FDA and they told me that this product is supposed to disclosure the ingredients on the label. I already submitted a complain. Nature&#x27;s Plus start putting the ingredients list on the box.</li>
            <li> I originally sought this cleanser because I read that products with acidic pH levels were better for women&#x27;s \\&quot;nether regions,\\&quot; whereas normal soap is alkaline and upsets the natural balance of things.  So, rather than just use it \\&quot;down there,\\&quot; I used it all over and was very pleased with it.  One day I read the enclosed literature and saw that you can wash your hair with it, so I tried.  Now, I&#x27;m very fussy about what products I use on my hair.  Salon quality only for me!  Even so, I&#x27;d had problems with my scalp for the past couple of years, and nothing seemed to help much.  Until this.  Now my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch incessantly and my hair loss has gone back to normal amounts.  I&#x27;m happy with this product, and I find the smell to be pleasant, a lot more so than most commercial soaps out there.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap based on research I had done online about natural soaps.  This one got high reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  It has a strong, but not heavy lemon scent.  I can smell it in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my skin.  The best thing I love about this soap is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  It washes clean from my skin.      Some possible cons:  *It does have a very yellow rinse.  In other words, the color of the soap is the color that washes down the drain.  This can be a nuisance if you don&#x27;t rinse it off the side of the tub, as it leaves the yellow color behind.  It washes away well, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain the tub.  It doesn&#x27;t stain my washclothes either, which is a good thing and I have used a white washcloth with it.    *It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other soaps.  Make sure to keep it in a dish that drains, so that it doesn&#x27;t sit in water or you won&#x27;t have it around for long.      I personally love it, and the cons I listed above aren&#x27;t cons to me, but may be cons for someone else so thats why I listed them.  I started using this soap 3 years ago and haven&#x27;t bought a different kind since.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.  i don&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> I never review products,  but I felt like I needed to a rate this one. This product worked fine for me, so I gave it two stars. I told my husband about it because it is supposed to be for everyone. Well, he used it and instantly broke out in terrible hives on his hip, legs and armpits. He doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin. In all the 11 years I have been married to him I have never seen this happen with any product. He took another shower with different soap and a benadryl and they started to go down. Needless to say I feel terrible, especially since he leaves for a 48 hour shift early tomorrow morning. I haven&#x27;t seen this in any of the other reviews, but for some reason my poor husband was the one this happened to. I was hoping to be able to use this soap for the whole family but now I don&#x27;t dare try it on my kids.</li>
            <li> I brought this cleanser because I heard that it was good for cleaning one&#x27;s nether regions because it has a low PH. Defnitely better to use than everyday soap. It lathers nicely. It has a very nature-ish smell, so that&#x27;s good for people who don&#x27;t like foo-foo smells.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for 30 years. I have very oily skin (test for oily skin: after you wake up or at end of day, press a piece of paper bag against the side of your nose for a minute. If you see an oil spot -you got oily skin. My oil bleeds thru to the other side.) It was the only product that cleared up my adult acne. I also use it to wash my hair and scalp, which cleared up my dandruff (also a result of oily skin) but I use regular shampoo about every 5th time and conditioner is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can induce sunburn, so I try to stay out of the sun right after using it or apply sun screen. Not recommended for dry (or even normal) skin.</li>
            <li> The soap lasted me just TWO WEEKS, contrary to what was advertised. I also didn&#x27;t notice any improvements while I used it, I have used other soaps that worked better. Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time?</li>
            <li> I discovered this soap a few years ago, and it changed my life. If you have oily skin then this is the soap for you. What is great about it is that it isn&#x27;t soap at all. It doesn&#x27;t contain the bad things that regular soap contains. That means it won&#x27;t clog your pores or dry your skin out too much. It&#x27;s low PH also supports your skin&#x27;s natural defense against bacteria. But it won&#x27;t sting your eyes. I have turned many friends on to this soap and they all love it. You must keep the soap in a dry place because it does dissolve easily.</li>
            <li> Smelled great but didnt help much if youre using it for acne.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever washed your vaginal area and felt a burning tingling kind of sensation...then all day you just feel &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.....it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re stripping that layer of skin with soap. And it&#x27;s all ph related.&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use this, your vaginal area feels soft and moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. You go through an entire day without feeling dry or chaffed. This stuff WORKS!!!! I couldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even USE soap or any soap-like product for years, because they all made me either itchy or made my skin feel like plastic or just plain stunk.  This was the first product I found that rinses clean and leaves my skin just clean and very lightly-scented, without changing the texture or making me itchy.  Very much worth the higher price! :)  Also, in case it&#x27;s not mentioned anywhere else, the pH is such that you can use it on your *ahem* girl-parts without changing your chemistry and getting an infection.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  It took me a couple of days to get used to it and the yellow ring it leaves in my tub (you have to rinse it down when you&#x27;re done).     It doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular soap but I don&#x27;t mind since using it has made my skin so soft and not dry.  Usually with my old alkaline soap my legs and body would be really itchy once I got out of the shower.  Now no more..I can even skip putting lotion on sometimes if I&#x27;m in a rush.     And it&#x27;s the only thing I use to clean my acne-prone skin.  I&#x27;ve seen a difference in that too.  My face is not dry and irritated anymore.    I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair yet since I have color-treated hair so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li> I too heard about this soap while reading \\&quot;The Guide to Getting it On\\&quot;.  It mentioned it was a great soap for a woman&#x27;s private parts and this couldn&#x27;t be more true. I don&#x27;t really use it anywhere else to be honest! :) I have told all my friends about it and they all love the soap as well. I know so many people that have purchased the soap at my recommendation, that I believe Nature&#x27;s Plus owes me some money! :). Anyway, the soap allows you to feel fresh and confident all day long. You will definitely pass any guy&#x27;s \\&quot;dip and sniff\\&quot; test. LOL!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to just about everything.  This bar is very soothing to the skin and rinses away easily.  The only other soap I use consistently is Dr. Bronners, and I switch between the two. However, if my skin is particularly angry, it is the Nature&#x27;s Plus that I reach for.  I can&#x27;t get it to work as a shampoo, but instead I use it as a scalp treatment if my scalp is acting up.  I lather my scalp only and rinse, then do what I normal do for my hair care.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to alot of soaps &amp; perfumes - this is the best soap out there for anyone with allergies or whose skin dries out easily.</li>
            <li> I have tried this soap and it&#x27;s the best soap for cleaning your face as dryness is far far less than if you would wash your face with regular soap! It&#x27;s perfect because of the ph of the bar is 6.5, and thats the same ph as our skin so you have less harmful effects when you want a clean face. I use it 6 times a week, i wet my face with only water on the off day just to give my skin a break from constant washing, because like with anything you will get dry. I use 2 types of moisturizers when im feeling extra dry, one is called Montana Emu Ranch Replenishing lotion and the other one is called Skin MD Natural, i use these before bed when i feel extra dry. If you feel dry using this its usually right after you wash, but after a few mins it goes away completely. That&#x27;s what i like about this soap, it&#x27;s far less harsh than what i usually used (clean and clear, regular hand soap, etc.). When i used those harsh cleansers like regular soap i broke out constantly with large lumps and puss filled acne, and got dry patches and redness in the face. With this, my face is so luxuriously soft and normal-feeling. I no longer get that oil bed on my forehead and the breakouts are 99% non existant. If you have acne or skin problems, dryness problems, get this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used thhis soapless beauty bar for several yers now and while it is pricey, I really like the way my skin feels when useing itONe tip isnot to leave the bar in the shower or soap dish since it keepsweaaring down when wxposed to water.I quickly place it on  a shlefin my closet near the shower and it doeslastlonger, though not as long as asoapbar. FOr me it is worth the tradeoff. ( My gn recommended it for sensitive female areas as well.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap after reading a recommendation written in \\&quot;The Guide to Getting It On\\&quot;. Cheesy - maybe, but it was recommended for women&#x27;s private parts. I was deathly afraid of messing around with soaps down there because I&#x27;m prone to allergic reactions, but after reading about the soap&#x27;s low ph and how it wouldn&#x27;t upset anything, I bought some. I loved it! It has really improved my boyfriend&#x27;s arm skin too.</li>
            <li> I really love this face soap. My stepmom turned me on to it when I was a teenager (it is what she used) to battle acne...It was such a miracle worker. It is really gentle and soft. The scent is really light too. My face feels clean but not destroyed - you know how many facial products &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; your face, but then after, it&#x27;s like every trace of the good oils on your skin were just stripped away? Well, this leaves the good stuff on your face so you feel clean but soft. I know it is a pricier soap, but a little bit goes a very, very long way. I literally just take my wet hand and rub it ONCE on the soap which gets enough soap to clean my face. I have also used it on my body when I ran out of  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, and it feels great on the body, too (but I am too cheap to use it as a body soap!). I highly recommend this. I have been using this for over 20 years now.</li>
            <li> this non soap , soap leaves the skin feeling ultra soft. I love that it&#x27;s ph balances so I can wash my delicate hoohaa area without worrying i&#x27;ll get irritated. good product.</li>
            <li> exactly as promised... nice product</li>
            <li> Now, you may be wondering what makes this the best soap or why I think I can label things like that...    Good questions, but this soap is the best soap ever!!!  It has pH balancing or whatever that just leaves you feeling good.  It is a little pricey because of its greatness, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great for a face soap.    I don&#x27;t have any real experience that guides me here besides knowing a couple folks who have had enough school to know...and they like it.  Bottom line, if you are looking for a new soap and want it to be awesome for getting your skin in good condition, I would give it a trial run.</li>
            <li> Try to find the ingredient that creates lather...it&#x27;s not listed but has to be in all soaps...dried and irritated my skin on face and hands where i used it....may contain SLS....i got used to Kiss My Face Olive oil soap...truly has only two safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> I used this bar for about 1 1/2 years.  I am 38 with Acne prone, dry, but oily skin.  It does make my skin soft, but it did dry my skin out.  I had so many lines in my face after months of use.  It also didnt help AT ALL with clogged pores.  I have so many black and white heads on my cheeks forehead and chin.  I quit using it in December and began with another product. I did see many of my blackheads dissapear since stopping use of this bar.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ll use on my lady business. Other products are too irritating. Plus, this lasts forever and it has a nice smell (but not too strong, very subtle) and I always feel clean but not squeaky clean after I use it. Been using for 15 years and am very happy with it, I will continue to buy. To be clear, this isn&#x27;t a cleanser solely meant for that region, I&#x27;ve used it on my face and body too, and behind my ears, but it&#x27;s the only one I can use everywhere.</li>
            <li> While this soap has a very strong lemon scent it is miraculous. I use it solely for my face for oil control and it does wonders. It will dry your skin a little if you don&#x27;t have extremely oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest keeping it stored out of the water oath as it can deteriorate rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was somewhat slow, but about average.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and the vendor did a good job in getting it to me as promised.  Donna</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years, because it is the only PH balanced bar I can find.  It is great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, easily irritated and dry. I gave this natural soap a try and just love it! No irritation or dryness, love the refreshing smell. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> My mother, sister, and I all love this soap. We have sensitive skin and this is one of the few soaps we can use without problems.</li>
            <li> I have used this bar on and off for the past year, for a month or two at a time when I do use it. If you are trying to get rid of acne, it will work, but only because it is super drying. I bought the soap hoping it would protect my skin&#x27;s acid mantle and be a rather gentle soap. It might be the correct pH for your skin, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it helps if it&#x27;s stripping everything away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I have used it more than once was because I wanted to give it a chance and see if changing up the rest of my routine would help. Even when I&#x27;m using my most powerful moisturizing cream, I still get roughness in my skin from it drying out so much. If you&#x27;ve ever had problems with dry or sensitive skin, I would suggest trying something else.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap for delicate areas.  Balances the ph.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This soap is more acid than it is basic, which helps protect the skin&#x27;s natural protective barrier, the &amp;#34;acid mantle&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t leave an itchy residue like millions of other soaps. It gives you a great lather and doesn&#x27;t itch afterwards. Try it, you&#x27;ll see what I mean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even use it for shampooing my hair in the shower when I don&#x27;t have my regular shampoo and my hair comes out super shiny!</li>
            <li> I buy this for years for 4.99 I go to Amazon and get charged almost twice as much. I got my local health food store to order for me. It is the best soap I ever ever used for my face but no need to pay over 7 bucks for it&lt;br /&gt;Watch prices on Amazon</li>
            <li> I like that this soap is pH balanced to protect the acid mantle of the skin. However, it has a very strong scent. I&#x27;ve emailed the company before to learn if the scent is synthetic or from essential oils, but never got a response. If you are sensitive to strong smells, I would avoid this soap and go for another one that is unscented with at least a neutral pH. I&#x27;ve never found an unscented soap with an acidic pH like this... if anyone else has, please let me know!  I&#x27;ve used lots of pH paper testing soaps &amp; shampoos, and most if not all are highly alkalkine, even ones that say they&#x27;re meant for sensitive skin or babies! pH paper is cheap, you will be amazed if you start testing things.</li>
            <li> Your skin will never feel so soft or be so healthy as with the Natural Beauty Cleansing Bar.  The skin is the largest organ in the body, and surprisingly, needs to be on the acid side of the ph scale.  There are so few soaps on the market at the correct ph~ here you go!  Your skin will thank you.  This non-soap bar is incomparible!!</li>
            <li> This bar has a very pleasant smell - in my opinion, and it makes loads of suds.  For my personal hygiene needs, it works wonderfully.  I plan on keeping a bar of this around.</li>
            <li> Very lemony smell which dissipates quickly. Got this after a recommendation from my doctor after taking a long course of antibiotics. Worked great in restoring balance of things. My only issue is the crazy lemon pine sol smell. It dissipates really quickly though - but while you&#x27;re in the shower, the smell is a little industrial. It also leaves yellow marks on fabrics and the shower soap holder that can be a little difficult to scrub away. For a happy and healthy balance of things, It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
            <li> This product smells like pinesol, but it works very well on troubled skin. I don&#x27;t accept all of the distributor&#x27;s statements, but I do feel that it balances the skin&#x27;s pH. If you or someone you know has skin problems give this product a try.potential wird sehr gezielt eingesetzt und folgt sehr geschickt ausgearbeiteten Dramatikbögen. Das sind schon kleine Kunststücke, die Oldfield da präsentiert. Aber um das zu hörern, muss man eben mehr als einen Durchgang wagen.&lt;br /&gt;Im Grunde ist das nichts anderes, als früher. Nur sind die verschiedenen Mittel (Stimme, typische Oldfield-Gitarre, elektronische Effekte, Dramatik, Rhythmus und Rhythmuswechsel) jetzt wesentlich sparsamer und unspektakulärer, dafür aber auch sehr viel gezielter eingesetzt, als auf den ersten Alben.&lt;br /&gt;Das tut der Sache keinen Abbruch, wenn man sich darauf einlässt, und tatsächlich erkennt man dann irgendwann auch den alten Oldfield wieder, der eben jetzt mit anderen Mitteln arbeitet, aber im Prinzip immer noch dasselbe Konzept verfolgt, wie früher. &lt;br /&gt;Höhepunkte der ersten Cd:&lt;br /&gt;Der Opener &amp;quot;Angelique&amp;quot;, das sehr schöne &amp;quot;Blackbird&amp;quot;, der Longtrack &amp;quot;First Steps&amp;quot; - in dem Oldfield zum Finale die typische Gitarre erklingen lässt, &amp;quot;Closer&amp;quot; und &amp;quot;Our Father&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Auf der zweiten Cd geht es dann etwas schwungvoller zur Sache.&lt;br /&gt;Weitere acht Stücke erwarten das Ohr des geneigten Hörers.&lt;br /&gt;1. Quicksilver&lt;br&gt;2. Resolution&lt;br&gt;3. Slipstream&lt;br&gt;4. Surfing&lt;br&gt;5. Tears Of An Angel&lt;br&gt;6. Romance&lt;br&gt;7. Ringscape&lt;br&gt;8. Nightshade&lt;br /&gt;Und die gefällt mir jetzt noch besser als die erste.&lt;br /&gt;Ganz einfach, weil hier vieles noch mehr an den alten Oldfield erinnert. Ja, der heiß geliebte Gitarrenton ist wieder da und schon zweimal hab ich die Luftgitarre aus dem Schrank geholt und den Kopf ekstatisch in den Nacken geworfen (zugegebenermaßen ein sehr bizarres Tun in meinem fortgeschrittenen Alter!). &lt;br /&gt;;-)&lt;br /&gt;Einziges Manko: die Gitarreneinsätze sind zu kurz, könnten gut und gerne noch ein Stück ausufernder sein. &lt;br /&gt;Höhepunkte: &amp;quot;Resolution&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Slipstream&amp;quot; das geniale &amp;quot;Surfing&amp;quot;, und &amp;quot;Kingscape&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;So, jetzt hab ich mal eine Lanze für den alten Mikesch gebrochen, der meiner Meinung nach, manchmal unterschätzt wird seit er sich der Elektronik zugewandt hat.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Light and Shade&amp;quot;, auf jeden Fall, ist prima.</li>
            <li> This product dried our family&#x27;s skin out really bad. So, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I really had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> Smells great I like the fresh scent but it doesn&#x27;t lather well and it works a lil with taming my sweat attacks and odor but I went through two bars in one week :( i will purchase again but only when I have the extra money cause it is a pricey piece of soap</li>
            <li> Your skin and much more specifically your delicate spots require a higher PH Balance - Making it more acid - to keep things clean and healthy.  I saw an article once..... \\&quot;the vagina is a tomato\\&quot;.  It basically said what I just said.... we require a higher PH balance to keep our delicates and not so delicates healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that.... this is one of the few soaps you will find that does have a PH between 4.1 and 4.5.  It smells a little lemonesque and does the job in an uncomplicated manner.  Straightforward.  Simple.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and used to have to special order it through my health food store.  What a pain!  Finding it on Amazon made my day!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does cost more than an alkiline bar of soap.  There is a reason you wash with a higher PH balance (do the words fresh and clean mean anything?), and that is worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended to me for dry skin. It was ok but nothing great. I can easily replace it with Dove or something simple.</li>
            <li> It seems impossible to find out what ingredients the soap *does* contain. The full list of ingredients is not available on the Nature&#x27;s Plus website either.</li>
            <li> I love the scent &amp; the lather! Slightly \\&quot;lemony\\&quot; with undertones of warm vanilla. Like, a warmer lemon fragrance. It feels a bit \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; and milky as you lather.... in a good way. I have used this on my face and it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve washed my hair with it in a pinch, and I have heard from numerous women that it&#x27;s especially good for washing their \\&quot;nether-regions\\&quot; since the PH of this soap does not disrupt the delicate bacteria/yeast balance down there. Use this if you get recurring BV or yeast infections. The bar dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this because I kept getting yeast infections. Between the prebiotic tablets, drinking lots of cranberry juice and eating lots of yogurt and this soap, I have been healthy for months. I had also been having issues with stinky pits and was using 2 different deodorants every day. Now I wash my pits with this soap and I use 1 regular deodorant and I don&#x27;t stink at all. I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s magic, but it sure works great for what I need.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law was so right.  This item is much better than any soap on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy on the skin....no harsh after effects.&lt;br /&gt;I have made a second bulk purchase of this item.&lt;br /&gt;The cost is well worth the benefits provided by this item.&lt;br /&gt;It is named very correctly............:&amp;#34;cleansing bar.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sydnet to rebalance troubled skin. It CAN BE VERY drying. So know that, and use a toner with it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this soap, gets soggy quick so keep in soap box. Use this on face and body. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. Am 55, normal soap am allergic and drys skin. Not this. Kind of expensive so don&#x27;t buy often, splurged for me. Still, very good product and I love most of the company&#x27;s products. Have used for 25 years.</li>
            <li> The produc has a very mild scent  but leaves you feel very fresh. I would recommend this product but maily for peri care not really body care.</li>
            <li> I threw all my summers eve away I even used this for my face.</li>
