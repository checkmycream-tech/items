            <li>Stay away and do your own research on the ingredients used in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Nice design.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>a nice smell that stays for hours after the shower.</li>
            <li>My wife always liked Dove</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but it has a lot of moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li>This soap is really great and gets the job done tremendously.</li>
            <li>The smell isnt very strong</li>
            <li>I saw the Dove Men&#x27;s product at the supermarket, liked the smell, and decided to order in on Amazon (where I do most of my shopping for non-perishable groceries).  </li>
            <li>Good add on if you need to add to get free Amazon shipping.  </li>
            <li>I love bathing 3 times a day because this soap exists and I own it.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling soap and the price is right on it.  </li>
            <li>Subscribe and save for the soap is great since it is used consistently.  </li>
            <li>I will love to use this soap again n</li>
            <li>I am so glad that the industry has  discovered men have skin too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It would make it more rugged.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s now safe to unwrap a Dove soap bar:-)</li>
            <li>but this was a better value.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the bars.</li>
            <li>I thought this would have a better scent than it does.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed using Dove.  </li>
            <li>Now I am really enjoying Dove for Men.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It has those exfoliating things I love</li>
            <li>I like dove products for the gentleness/sensitivity of them but always thought that they catered more to women.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Works the same but smells great!</li>
            <li>have gotten many (many being 3, but it&#x27;s a start</li>
            <li>but there is better out</li>
            <li>We love dove bar soap and my husband loves using the dove for men now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a love love love product in our home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely more than a dollar per bar.  </li>
            <li>This Soap really smells great, I use it as well as my husband.</li>
            <li>Very nice product for a male with a good fragrance that is manly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one sure way to make sure I&#x27;m clean all the time!</li>
            <li>The soap also has a nice smell; clean, not like perfume at all.  </li>
            <li>What I have always liked about Dove body washes/soaps is that they leave my skin feeling clean and moisturized and that does not change with this soap.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Ok that&#x27;s all fine and good, but the real selling point is that the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering or cologne like.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleased to see them available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells great for men, and leaves you skin both soft and strong.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not so strong as to interfere with my deodorant and aftershave.</li>
            <li>As a bigger bonus, my girlfriend tells me I smell good, so it seems to wash off \\&quot;man funk\\&quot; effectively.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong, says he.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this product based on the overwhelmingly strong perfume scent it contains.  </li>
            <li>Great soap with a great subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Easily rubs off.&lt;br /&gt;Not like the cheap oily soaps</li>
            <li>This smells fine</li>
            <li>It tends to run out quickly as it contains a lot of moisturizing cream? :)</li>
            <li>It washes clean fairly quickly and is better than a zest -fully clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s finally the best best soup I could buy after long from dove which proved to cleans and give lasting fragrance to the body even in tropical climate I love</li>
            <li>Get it, enjoy it and subscribe to it.....</li>
            <li>My girlfriend liked the fragrance so much she went out and bought some for herself......</li>
            <li>Are they cheap here.</li>
            <li>I prefer bar soap over, body wash, I enjoy that \\&quot;Squeaky</li>
            <li>For something that cheap you would expect it to basically disintegrate after two showers.  </li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product that really is for men.</li>
            <li>B000052YLL Neutrogena Original Formula Soap Ounce]]</li>
            <li>I like the scent, how foamy it gets, and how clean I feel after using it.  </li>
            <li>Smells like a clean man should.</li>
            <li>well,smell clean like a man and does not bother the skin.</li>
            <li>I feel clean but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy the fresh clean scent I get from using Dove Men.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Too much work and too many damn products.</li>
            <li>My wife wants to have 5 more kids as a result.  </li>
            <li>I have used, I think more than one version and maybe an earlier version had fit me better.  </li>
            <li>Dove soap is the complete opposite, leaves my skin feeling great and better</li>
            <li>I work in a very non friendly skin enviroment and after using this soap for a week,my hands don&#x27;t crack and bleed anymore!</li>
            <li>soap with a mild fragrance and moisturizing</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin...</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the extra fresh variety and am very pleased by the scent and how it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li>) compliments on the smell.. and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out (good for the skin</li>
            <li>So I can easily take a shower and get ready to go about my day without having to put on lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly fragrant, it cleans very well and it leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>smell is just amazing and they will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Im a guy, and always used the regular dove just cuz i liked the fresh scent ...</li>
            <li>, it has a more masculine scent and of course says dove for men...  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily use bar soaps, but I have used Dove before (which I liked) and was intrigued by their Men+Care line.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too powerful or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>She found a more masculine version and now I use this.</li>
            <li>Best ten bucks I ever spent on soap that cleans my body and my face.</li>
            <li>Love dove products to start with have always used their soap as I have my grandma&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>While it shares the silky and creamy nature of the original Dove, the fragrance leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>A nice, subtle, fresh scent would be nice, but this soap absolutely wreaks!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, less than $10 buy you some great smelling soap that will also help your skin stay healthy and it will last you almost three months.</li>
            <li>like most DOVE soaps it works well, no heavy residue and fine for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>She cannot stop grabbing me and giving me a nice long sniff.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Axe bodywash, i loved the smell but never left my skin feeling to soft.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very very weak.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The bars seem to run out very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad someone is finally thinking of men ;)  </li>
            <li>The regular price was better than I could get locally, and if I had subscribed, it would have been even better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this soap.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>That soap cleans better with the grit they put in it and, for me, a bar seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>I first tried the Dove for Men soap about a year ago</li>
            <li>And, as mentioned before, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a pre-pubescent boy trying to get his first date.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>like dry skin is experienced by individuals in individual ways.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t make my skin baby smooth and soft</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but that&#x27;s not exactly all I look for in a soap.</li>
            <li>It would be great if they could put some tiny beads in there to wash off the rough skin.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good but is pretty much the same as regular dove.  </li>
            <li>Saw a commercial for this, tried it, and absolutely fell in love with this soap.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s sort of a positive thing to me)</li>
            <li>This is a soap and the description pretty much tells it all.</li>
            <li>A little strong but fine.</li>
            <li>Cleans with refreshing scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>liked the fact that they are worth the small price.</li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t done that yet because I don&#x27;t yet know how much soap I use in a certain period.</li>
            <li>I think they tried too hard to make a manly soap rather than a good soap that men could appreciate.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!I really like the smell</li>
            <li>much cheaper</li>
            <li>After a week of using it, my legs are much improved, and I&#x27;m using it everywhere else as well.  </li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this to all men!</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be purchasing this soap again - in bulk.</li>
            <li>The bars are very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>I used to use Ivory soap because being very hairy and well endowed,other soaps bother my skin.</li>
            <li>but she got irritated and it didn&#x27;t make me feel very manly.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It lasts a full week usually, and very often more.  </li>
            <li>You can reasonably expect to get 7-10 showers per bar</li>
            <li>forms up very well and really cleans your body</li>
            <li>I tried my gals dove and liked how it help my skin but disliked the smell.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my skin much more hydrated than other soaps I have used.</li>
            <li>As a child I had some skin rash problems and had to use the original white Dove bar soap.  </li>
            <li>That is actually what originally led me to trying this one.  </li>
            <li>This soap doesnt seem any more special or different from other soaps on the market.  </li>
            <li>My skin is certainly thanking me and now I&#x27;m spending less time in the bathroom and more time being a dude.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side as far as bars of soap go, but it leaves me smelling good, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>for me the soap is ok but it feels too much like typical soap and isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough and doesn&#x27;t have as much cool feeling as the shampoo..  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty soft</li>
            <li>Better yet, I subscribe to it and receive 8 bars every two months and not only is it much cheaper than at our local stores, but I don&#x27;t have to remind my wife to pick it up for me when I run out.</li>
            <li>smell doesn&#x27;t linger at all, so it defeats the purpose of using it in the first place, to smell fresh for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not expect to have to remember both a brand and a particular label.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>I do also use occasionally other nitch soap made for men but this is my staple because it is easy to get and affordable.</li>
            <li>Fit as expected.</li>
            <li>instead of extra fresh</li>
            <li>Able to use on days I don&#x27;t have time to moisturize skin and no worry about feeling dried out.</li>
            <li>However, the Extra Fresh Deodorant causes irritation on me.</li>
            <li>Extra fresh care.  </li>
            <li>The soap is worth the extra money - truly is.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I notice a huge difference from any other soap</li>
            <li>I noticed before too long that I didn&#x27;t have an itchy back anymore, and that my skin in general was doing better.</li>
            <li>This bar soap helps a lot with the latter issue and doesn&#x27;t invoke the first issue.</li>
            <li>Now I use basically the same exact soap</li>
            <li>It is not worth my money to buy the various formula in case another Dove/Men&#x27;s soap variant works better for me.</li>
            <li>so each bar I use seems to diminish more rapidly than other soaps I&#x27;ve used for less money, so the cost is higher.</li>
            <li>it was more extra bland.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t completely alleviate the problem, but it is a major improvement over normal bar soap.  </li>
            <li>Its tough enough to give me a good &#x27;man&#x27; cleaning, but leaves my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>I particularly like fragrance the new blue colored soap.</li>
            <li>I was using Old spice, and decided to switch.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Second point, it does wear out fast.</li>
            <li>it is rather soft.</li>
            <li>and he has finally admitted that he really likes this one.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer Dove&#x27;s liquid soap over Dove&#x27;s bar soap, but I find both very efficient.</li>
            <li>Why do I have to write something as far as a review if I am a verified customer??</li>
            <li>These last a lot longer than liquid body wash and are much easier to travel with too.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft yet does not \\&quot;burn\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Used two bars so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve not used the regular dove soap in a while, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to that closely, but it is noticeably different than cheap hotel soap or other soaps that can leave the waxy feeling on you.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive and my skin is dry when I shower.</li>
            <li>Really like this soap other than the fact the bars seem to run out so fast.  </li>
            <li>im not sure who these ppl are saying the scent is TOO strong...  </li>
            <li>A piece of this soap stayed down next to my drain for over a month being drenched by 3 or more showers a day and stayed the same size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used body washes in the past from many different brands, but I always found myself preferring bar soap instead.  </li>
            <li>so they stuck \\&quot;Men\\&quot; in the name right after \\&quot;Dove\\&quot;, changed the scent from floral and delicate to mild and non-delicate (think Irish Spring at about one quarter</li>
            <li>I use the last of it as hand soap, but I have to report that the bar will not give you more than a few weeks of daily showers.  </li>
            <li>Either of the dove men bars works better than other soaps I have tried, it leaves less of a residue.</li>
            <li>use too much on your face as it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin up and make my skin soft</li>
            <li>have tried a few different scents and highly prefer the Deep Clean that Dove makes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK tough</li>
            <li>Star &#x3D; BAD - 5 Stars &#x3D; GREAT</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning as well as keeping your skin from drying out so badly.</li>
            <li>apparently they dont know how to rinse off after a shower</li>
            <li>of the major points, I do not get much relief from dry skin with the \\&quot;Extra Fresh\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin up and even my wife started to use it!</li>
            <li>In fairness, the other product I will be using also tends to disappear fast.</li>
            <li>It does not lather up as much some other brands.</li>
            <li>To me this is the only smell of the Men+Care line that I actually like, but it&#x27;s not overpowering like Old Spice tends to be.</li>
            <li>After trying it I can say that it has a generic \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent that is subtle, which I prefer as I do not like body washes or soaps that have strong scents that compete with my cologne.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Dove inc., I figured should know something about soap that does not dry your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>enjoy the scent and lather, it does seem to dissipate a little faster than other bar soaps.</li>
            <li>I will only be using this soap as my main hygiene tool for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>Not very dry after use</li>
            <li>I got the other bar last time with the exfoliating beads or whatever, but I don&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I had developed some dry skin on my legs, and thought I should try a soap like Dove.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my nephew who has sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I used regular Gold Dial for the past almost 3 decades when I decided I needed something a little better for my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to get too much or too little.)  </li>

            <li> a nice smell that stays for hours after the shower.</li>
            <li> My wife always liked Dove</li>
            <li> The scent is nice but it has a lot of moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> This soap is really great and gets the job done tremendously.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt very strong</li>
            <li> I saw the Dove Men&#x27;s product at the supermarket, liked the smell, and decided to order in on Amazon (where I do most of my shopping for non-perishable groceries).  </li>
            <li> Good add on if you need to add to get free Amazon shipping.  </li>
            <li> I love bathing 3 times a day because this soap exists and I own it.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling soap and the price is right on it.  </li>
            <li> Subscribe and save for the soap is great since it is used consistently.  </li>
            <li> I will love to use this soap again n</li>
            <li> I am so glad that the industry has  discovered men have skin too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It would make it more rugged.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s now safe to unwrap a Dove soap bar:-)</li>
            <li> but this was a better value.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the bars.</li>
            <li> I thought this would have a better scent than it does.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed using Dove.  </li>
            <li> Now I am really enjoying Dove for Men.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It has those exfoliating things I love</li>
            <li> I like dove products for the gentleness/sensitivity of them but always thought that they catered more to women.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Works the same but smells great!</li>
            <li> have gotten many (many being 3, but it&#x27;s a start</li>
            <li> but there is better out</li>
            <li> We love dove bar soap and my husband loves using the dove for men now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a love love love product in our home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely more than a dollar per bar.  </li>
            <li> This Soap really smells great, I use it as well as my husband.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for a male with a good fragrance that is manly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one sure way to make sure I&#x27;m clean all the time!</li>
            <li> The soap also has a nice smell; clean, not like perfume at all.  </li>
            <li> What I have always liked about Dove body washes/soaps is that they leave my skin feeling clean and moisturized and that does not change with this soap.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Ok that&#x27;s all fine and good, but the real selling point is that the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering or cologne like.  </li>
            <li> so I was pleased to see them available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This soap smells great for men, and leaves you skin both soft and strong.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not so strong as to interfere with my deodorant and aftershave.</li>
            <li> As a bigger bonus, my girlfriend tells me I smell good, so it seems to wash off \\&quot;man funk\\&quot; effectively.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong, says he.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product based on the overwhelmingly strong perfume scent it contains.  </li>
            <li> Great soap with a great subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Easily rubs off.&lt;br /&gt;Not like the cheap oily soaps</li>
            <li> This smells fine</li>
            <li> It tends to run out quickly as it contains a lot of moisturizing cream? :)</li>
            <li> It washes clean fairly quickly and is better than a zest -fully clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s finally the best best soup I could buy after long from dove which proved to cleans and give lasting fragrance to the body even in tropical climate I love</li>
            <li> Get it, enjoy it and subscribe to it.....</li>
            <li> My girlfriend liked the fragrance so much she went out and bought some for herself......</li>
            <li> Are they cheap here.</li>
            <li> I prefer bar soap over, body wash, I enjoy that \\&quot;Squeaky</li>
            <li> For something that cheap you would expect it to basically disintegrate after two showers.  </li>
            <li> Overall an excellent product that really is for men.</li>
            <li> B000052YLL Neutrogena Original Formula Soap Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I like the scent, how foamy it gets, and how clean I feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a clean man should.</li>
            <li> well,smell clean like a man and does not bother the skin.</li>
            <li> I feel clean but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy the fresh clean scent I get from using Dove Men.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Too much work and too many damn products.</li>
            <li> My wife wants to have 5 more kids as a result.  </li>
            <li> I have used, I think more than one version and maybe an earlier version had fit me better.  </li>
            <li> Dove soap is the complete opposite, leaves my skin feeling great and better</li>
            <li> I work in a very non friendly skin enviroment and after using this soap for a week,my hands don&#x27;t crack and bleed anymore!</li>
            <li> soap with a mild fragrance and moisturizing</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin...</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the extra fresh variety and am very pleased by the scent and how it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> ) compliments on the smell.. and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out (good for the skin</li>
            <li> So I can easily take a shower and get ready to go about my day without having to put on lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly fragrant, it cleans very well and it leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> smell is just amazing and they will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Im a guy, and always used the regular dove just cuz i liked the fresh scent ...</li>
            <li> , it has a more masculine scent and of course says dove for men...  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily use bar soaps, but I have used Dove before (which I liked) and was intrigued by their Men+Care line.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too powerful or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> She found a more masculine version and now I use this.</li>
            <li> Best ten bucks I ever spent on soap that cleans my body and my face.</li>
            <li> Love dove products to start with have always used their soap as I have my grandma&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> While it shares the silky and creamy nature of the original Dove, the fragrance leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> A nice, subtle, fresh scent would be nice, but this soap absolutely wreaks!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, less than $10 buy you some great smelling soap that will also help your skin stay healthy and it will last you almost three months.</li>
            <li> like most DOVE soaps it works well, no heavy residue and fine for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> She cannot stop grabbing me and giving me a nice long sniff.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Axe bodywash, i loved the smell but never left my skin feeling to soft.  </li>
            <li> the scent is very very weak.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The bars seem to run out very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone is finally thinking of men ;)  </li>
            <li> The regular price was better than I could get locally, and if I had subscribed, it would have been even better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this soap.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> That soap cleans better with the grit they put in it and, for me, a bar seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Dove for Men soap about a year ago</li>
            <li> And, as mentioned before, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a pre-pubescent boy trying to get his first date.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> like dry skin is experienced by individuals in individual ways.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t make my skin baby smooth and soft</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but that&#x27;s not exactly all I look for in a soap.</li>
            <li> It would be great if they could put some tiny beads in there to wash off the rough skin.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good but is pretty much the same as regular dove.  </li>
            <li> Saw a commercial for this, tried it, and absolutely fell in love with this soap.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s sort of a positive thing to me)</li>
            <li> This is a soap and the description pretty much tells it all.</li>
            <li> A little strong but fine.</li>
            <li> Cleans with refreshing scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> liked the fact that they are worth the small price.</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t done that yet because I don&#x27;t yet know how much soap I use in a certain period.</li>
            <li> I think they tried too hard to make a manly soap rather than a good soap that men could appreciate.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!I really like the smell</li>
            <li> much cheaper</li>
            <li> After a week of using it, my legs are much improved, and I&#x27;m using it everywhere else as well.  </li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this to all men!</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be purchasing this soap again - in bulk.</li>
            <li> The bars are very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I used to use Ivory soap because being very hairy and well endowed,other soaps bother my skin.</li>
            <li> but she got irritated and it didn&#x27;t make me feel very manly.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> It lasts a full week usually, and very often more.  </li>
            <li> You can reasonably expect to get 7-10 showers per bar</li>
            <li> forms up very well and really cleans your body</li>
            <li> I tried my gals dove and liked how it help my skin but disliked the smell.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my skin much more hydrated than other soaps I have used.</li>
            <li> As a child I had some skin rash problems and had to use the original white Dove bar soap.  </li>
            <li> That is actually what originally led me to trying this one.  </li>
            <li> This soap doesnt seem any more special or different from other soaps on the market.  </li>
            <li> My skin is certainly thanking me and now I&#x27;m spending less time in the bathroom and more time being a dude.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side as far as bars of soap go, but it leaves me smelling good, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> for me the soap is ok but it feels too much like typical soap and isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough and doesn&#x27;t have as much cool feeling as the shampoo..  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty soft</li>
            <li> Better yet, I subscribe to it and receive 8 bars every two months and not only is it much cheaper than at our local stores, but I don&#x27;t have to remind my wife to pick it up for me when I run out.</li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t linger at all, so it defeats the purpose of using it in the first place, to smell fresh for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not expect to have to remember both a brand and a particular label.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I do also use occasionally other nitch soap made for men but this is my staple because it is easy to get and affordable.</li>
            <li> Fit as expected.</li>
            <li> instead of extra fresh</li>
            <li> Able to use on days I don&#x27;t have time to moisturize skin and no worry about feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> However, the Extra Fresh Deodorant causes irritation on me.</li>
            <li> Extra fresh care.  </li>
            <li> The soap is worth the extra money - truly is.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I notice a huge difference from any other soap</li>
            <li> I noticed before too long that I didn&#x27;t have an itchy back anymore, and that my skin in general was doing better.</li>
            <li> This bar soap helps a lot with the latter issue and doesn&#x27;t invoke the first issue.</li>
            <li> Now I use basically the same exact soap</li>
            <li> It is not worth my money to buy the various formula in case another Dove/Men&#x27;s soap variant works better for me.</li>
            <li> so each bar I use seems to diminish more rapidly than other soaps I&#x27;ve used for less money, so the cost is higher.</li>
            <li> it was more extra bland.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t completely alleviate the problem, but it is a major improvement over normal bar soap.  </li>
            <li> Its tough enough to give me a good &#x27;man&#x27; cleaning, but leaves my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I particularly like fragrance the new blue colored soap.</li>
            <li> I was using Old spice, and decided to switch.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Second point, it does wear out fast.</li>
            <li> it is rather soft.</li>
            <li> and he has finally admitted that he really likes this one.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer Dove&#x27;s liquid soap over Dove&#x27;s bar soap, but I find both very efficient.</li>
            <li> Why do I have to write something as far as a review if I am a verified customer??</li>
            <li> These last a lot longer than liquid body wash and are much easier to travel with too.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft yet does not \\&quot;burn\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Used two bars so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve not used the regular dove soap in a while, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to that closely, but it is noticeably different than cheap hotel soap or other soaps that can leave the waxy feeling on you.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive and my skin is dry when I shower.</li>
            <li> Really like this soap other than the fact the bars seem to run out so fast.  </li>
            <li> im not sure who these ppl are saying the scent is TOO strong...  </li>
            <li> A piece of this soap stayed down next to my drain for over a month being drenched by 3 or more showers a day and stayed the same size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used body washes in the past from many different brands, but I always found myself preferring bar soap instead.  </li>
            <li> so they stuck \\&quot;Men\\&quot; in the name right after \\&quot;Dove\\&quot;, changed the scent from floral and delicate to mild and non-delicate (think Irish Spring at about one quarter</li>
            <li> I use the last of it as hand soap, but I have to report that the bar will not give you more than a few weeks of daily showers.  </li>
            <li> Either of the dove men bars works better than other soaps I have tried, it leaves less of a residue.</li>
            <li> use too much on your face as it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin up and make my skin soft</li>
            <li> have tried a few different scents and highly prefer the Deep Clean that Dove makes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK tough</li>
            <li> Star &#x3D; BAD - 5 Stars &#x3D; GREAT</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning as well as keeping your skin from drying out so badly.</li>
            <li> apparently they dont know how to rinse off after a shower</li>
            <li> of the major points, I do not get much relief from dry skin with the \\&quot;Extra Fresh\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin up and even my wife started to use it!</li>
            <li> In fairness, the other product I will be using also tends to disappear fast.</li>
            <li> It does not lather up as much some other brands.</li>
            <li> To me this is the only smell of the Men+Care line that I actually like, but it&#x27;s not overpowering like Old Spice tends to be.</li>
            <li> After trying it I can say that it has a generic \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent that is subtle, which I prefer as I do not like body washes or soaps that have strong scents that compete with my cologne.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Dove inc., I figured should know something about soap that does not dry your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> enjoy the scent and lather, it does seem to dissipate a little faster than other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> I will only be using this soap as my main hygiene tool for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Not very dry after use</li>
            <li> I got the other bar last time with the exfoliating beads or whatever, but I don&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I had developed some dry skin on my legs, and thought I should try a soap like Dove.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my nephew who has sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used regular Gold Dial for the past almost 3 decades when I decided I needed something a little better for my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get too much or too little.)  </li>
            <li> Dry skin is my only reason for trying this soap and the only reason I will leave off using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get a regular soap for my very selective other half</li>
            <li> but it makes me at least feel like I&#x27;m using men&#x27;s products ;)</li>
            <li> I used to get very itchy, no more.  </li>
            <li> Especially helpful in the winter months when my skin gets extremely dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;After using it for several days now, there is no lingering scent, so I must add two stars, as the product doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like others do.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to dry out like face, big toe, etc.)</li>
            <li> I just have developed dryer skin in the last few years.</li>
            <li> the bars last a long time and the freshness sticks with you all day long!</li>
            <li> I might go back to the other one next time</li>
            <li> I like Dove soaps; they do not dry out my skin like other men&#x27;s soaps.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel insecure about using smooth silky soap.</li>
            <li> Dove body care for men is what I have been looking for a long time.  </li>
            <li> minor point is that the Dove people had to come out with a line of these soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently Dove woke up to the fact that half of its potential market includes the smellier, hairier male audience...</li>
            <li> Left my skin very rough and smelling of toxic chemical scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I do have to say this is not as bad as Dove soap (it&#x27;s definitely in the #2) category, the smell is clean / not offensive enough enough that I&#x27;ve bought this brand</li>
            <li> My skin is inclined to be dry anyway, and is really dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> The soap will get you clean,and won&#x27;t leave your skin dry and itchy afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1- Soap that dries your skin but lasts FOREVER&lt;br /&gt;2- Soap that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, but lasts four showers</li>
            <li> Dove has always been my go-to during the winter time because my skin gets extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I have overly dry skin having to use lotion sometimes hourly (California)</li>
            <li> This soap does that, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like other soaps do.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap both green and red for around a year now</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much you can say about soap.</li>
            <li> fatanstic scent and not so heavy at same time</li>
            <li> and I have no real complaints about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, now, and not only do I like it ....</li>
            <li> It even makes my thick body hair soft.</li>
            <li> It is too strong, not flowery but unpleasantly soapy.</li>
            <li> These products are not easy to find in local retail shops</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks, my skin was noticeably less dry than before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use any other soap.</li>
            <li> Like any other soap.</li>

            <li> the air here is very dry year round.  </li>
            <li> this variety seems to be priced lower on average than the others.</li>
            <li> I used to get some sort of dry skin rash on my shins, no more.  </li>
            <li> No more dry tight skin feeling</li>
            <li> It feels a little chalky and less soapy.</li>
            <li> /smell a few times.</li>
            <li> My husband is a mechanic and this is one of the few soaps out there that gets the grease and grime off of him.</li>
            <li> After that, I tried quite a few brands again.  </li>
            <li> and i was using Safeguard anti-bacterial soap, but am now concerned that it contained triclocarban, which is slowly being taken out of products due to safety concerns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, just way too much of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt;.&gt;</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really not much more to say than that.</li>
            <li> Like hard lard.  </li>
            <li> I never liked the feminine angle to the product which has been sold for years as a face soap for the ladies.  </li>
            <li> This is a common marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have used that doesn&#x27;t leave an awkward feeling soap residue.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smells okay, but not that magnificent.  smell doesn&#x27;t linger at all, so it defeats the purpose of using it in the first place, to smell fresh for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t use too much on your face as it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I was using Old spice, and decided to switch. This has been the best decision I have made, the soap keeps my skin smooth and moist. Best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> This Dove Men+Care Soap is really excellent. I will love to use this soap again n again, again I have ordered this soap.</li>
            <li> My son loves this soap.I am so glad that the industry has  discovered men have skin too.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to get them started is to give it as a gift. Now every year at Christmas he looks forward to his box \\&quot;O\\&quot; soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone is finally thinking of men ;)  I have used this soap both green and red for around a year now and like it. I do also use occasionally other nitch soap made for men but this is my staple because it is easy to get and affordable. I use the Subscribe so it just sends me 8 bars every 3 months so it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. I don&#x27;t know if I notice a huge difference from any other soap but it makes me at least feel like I&#x27;m using men&#x27;s products ;)</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem much different then their regular versions of soaps.  Smells pretty good but is pretty much the same as regular dove.  It would be great if they could put some tiny beads in there to wash off the rough skin. It would make it more rugged.</li>
            <li> Another New England winter and me contending with horrible dry skin.I ended up resorting to hydrating body wash.It did the trick but I had to use one of those shower tool things...and had to use another product to wash my face.Too much work and too many damn products.I found a package of this in the local pharmacy and decided to give it a shot.This stuff is great!I really like the smell and it&#x27;s not so strong as to interfere with my deodorant and aftershave.The clincher though is that I can just use it on both my body AND face,just as it advertises.My skin is certainly thanking me and now I&#x27;m spending less time in the bathroom and more time being a dude.</li>
            <li> I used to use Axe bodywash, i loved the smell but never left my skin feeling to soft.  I work in a paper mill (tho as an accountant) the air here is very dry year round.  I tried my gals dove and liked how it help my skin but disliked the smell.  This soap smells great for men, and leaves you skin both soft and strong.  It also doubles as a facewash, saving both time and $$$</li>
            <li> Product is comparable to using paint stripper to your skin. Left my skin very rough and smelling of toxic chemical scent. Stay away and do your own research on the ingredients used in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toxic chemicals found in the product:&lt;br /&gt;American Contact Dermatitis Society named  cocamidopropyl betaine Allergen of the Year in 2004.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  As a bonus, my bathroom no longer smells like potpourri wrapped in a doily.  As a bigger bonus, my girlfriend tells me I smell good, so it seems to wash off \\&quot;man funk\\&quot; effectively.</li>
            <li> My skin is inclined to be dry anyway, and is really dry in the winter. I noticed this soap a while back in a local retail store, and thought that I&#x27;d give it try. I noticed before too long that I didn&#x27;t have an itchy back anymore, and that my skin in general was doing better. The soap also has a nice smell; clean, not like perfume at all.  The regular price was better than I could get locally, and if I had subscribed, it would have been even better. (I haven&#x27;t done that yet because I don&#x27;t yet know how much soap I use in a certain period. I never kept track. I didn&#x27;t want to get too much or too little.)  This is good stuff, and I will buy again, recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> This soap is really great and gets the job done tremendously. The soap will get you clean,and won&#x27;t leave your skin dry and itchy afterwards. I will only be using this soap as my main hygiene tool for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Soap marketers have a problem, and Dove especially has a problem with advertising that has traditionally targeted female users. So guys may not think a Dove offering is for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently Dove woke up to the fact that half of its potential market includes the smellier, hairier male audience...so they stuck \\&quot;Men\\&quot; in the name right after \\&quot;Dove\\&quot;, changed the scent from floral and delicate to mild and non-delicate (think Irish Spring at about one quarter strength).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice soap with a mild fragrance and moisturizing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid fellas: it&#x27;s now safe to unwrap a Dove soap bar:-)</li>
            <li> Im a guy, and always used the regular dove just cuz i liked the fresh scent ... I think this is great, it has a more masculine scent and of course says dove for men...  im not sure who these ppl are saying the scent is TOO strong...  apparently they dont know how to rinse off after a shower</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily use bar soaps, but I have used Dove before (which I liked) and was intrigued by their Men+Care line. After trying it I can say that it has a generic \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent that is subtle, which I prefer as I do not like body washes or soaps that have strong scents that compete with my cologne. What I have always liked about Dove body washes/soaps is that they leave my skin feeling clean and moisturized and that does not change with this soap. So all-in-all, I will turn to this soap should I have a need for a soap bar.</li>
            <li> enjoy the scent and lather, it does seem to dissipate a little faster than other bar soaps. this variety seems to be priced lower on average than the others. like most DOVE soaps it works well, no heavy residue and fine for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Dove body care for men is what I have been looking for a long time.  I truly enjoy the fresh clean scent I get from using Dove Men.&lt;br /&gt;It may not be everyone&#x27;s choice, as for me it is.  No going back for me to the hum drum stuff.</li>
            <li> Not very dry after use</li>
            <li> Yes - I feel cleaner and manlier using this soap.  My wife wants to have 5 more kids as a result.  She cannot stop grabbing me and giving me a nice long sniff.  Get it, enjoy it and subscribe to it.....much cheaper and you will preserve your manhood.  Go on, be a man.</li>
            <li> I put this on subscribe and save because I think it&#x27;s a great price and my husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job well, easily washes off without residue, smells great, and says on the box its for men so I don&#x27;t feel insecure about using smooth silky soap. &gt;.&gt;</li>
            <li> I had developed some dry skin on my legs, and thought I should try a soap like Dove.  I never liked the feminine angle to the product which has been sold for years as a face soap for the ladies.  I saw the Dove Men&#x27;s product at the supermarket, liked the smell, and decided to order in on Amazon (where I do most of my shopping for non-perishable groceries).  After a week of using it, my legs are much improved, and I&#x27;m using it everywhere else as well.  I like the scent, how foamy it gets, and how clean I feel after using it.  Overall an excellent product that really is for men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that when buying soap  you get either:&lt;br /&gt;1- Soap that dries your skin but lasts FOREVER&lt;br /&gt;2- Soap that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, but lasts four showers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do have to say this is not as bad as Dove soap (it&#x27;s definitely in the #2) category, the smell is clean / not offensive enough enough that I&#x27;ve bought this brand/smell a few times. To me this is the only smell of the Men+Care line that I actually like, but it&#x27;s not overpowering like Old Spice tends to be. My only wish is that it would last just a bit longer in regards to the life of the bar.</li>
            <li> I used regular Gold Dial for the past almost 3 decades when I decided I needed something a little better for my skin. Saw a commercial for this, tried it, and absolutely fell in love with this soap. It&#x27;s not overly fragrant, it cleans very well and it leaves your skin feeling smooth. After a couple weeks, my skin was noticeably less dry than before. However, I can&#x27;t seem to find it on store shelves anymore. But I highly recommend this to all men!</li>
            <li> I use this soap in the shower and the smell is nice.It does not dry out your skin.My two teenage boys also like it.Good price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This soap is great!!! My girlfriend liked the fragrance so much she went out and bought some for herself......I would definitely recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here.  The soap works.  It smells like men&#x27;s soap should.  The price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not used the regular dove soap in a while, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to that closely, but it is noticeably different than cheap hotel soap or other soaps that can leave the waxy feeling on you.</li>
            <li> I wanted the liquid but this was a better value. I am enjoying the bars. Great product and price.</li>
            <li> I thought this would have a better scent than it does.  instead of extra fresh it was more extra bland.</li>
            <li> I almost feel sorry for the Dove soap people. For decades Dove soap has been exclusively marketed to women. \\&quot;1/4 cleansing cream\\&quot; is not the ad line to attract manly men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin is an unpleasant fact for some of us. Men included. In my case there may be an allergy adding to my symptoms, but no real medical issue. I doubt that what I have adds up to contact dermatitis. I just have developed dryer skin in the last few years. I had been shopping though the various soaps for perhaps 10 years and stumbled on Dove for Men. Dove inc., I figured should know something about soap that does not dry your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Count me among those who do not like the scent. It is too strong, not flowery but unpleasantly soapy. I might not have noticed but noticing was a hint that I was not happy. Second point, it does wear out fast. I use the last of it as hand soap, but I have to report that the bar will not give you more than a few weeks of daily showers.  In fairness, the other product I will be using also tends to disappear fast. This may be a weakness of skin moisturizing soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last of the major points, I do not get much relief from dry skin with the \\&quot;Extra Fresh\\&quot; version. Dry skin is my only reason for trying this soap and the only reason I will leave off using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My minor point is that the Dove people had to come out with a line of these soaps. \\&quot;Deep Clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;Aqua Impact\\&quot; What do these terms mean? I have used, I think more than one version and maybe an earlier version had fit me better.  I did not expect to have to remember both a brand and a particular label. It is not worth my money to buy the various formula in case another Dove/Men&#x27;s soap variant works better for me. This is a common marketing gimmick. I am looking for soap, not gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap like dry skin is experienced by individuals in individual ways. The majority vote here is pro Dove for Men. I cannot report that it works for me.</li>
            <li> Nice design.&lt;br /&gt;This men&#x27;s soap does not have scent,&lt;br /&gt;or the scent is very very weak.&lt;br /&gt;But it is rather soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get a regular soap for my very selective other half and he has finally admitted that he really likes this one. The scent is not too strong, says he. Score.</li>
            <li> This is a soap and the description pretty much tells it all. Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin... and obviously it cleans as soap should.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Wife likes the smell. Win-win.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive and my skin is dry when I shower. This bar soap helps a lot with the latter issue and doesn&#x27;t invoke the first issue. Overall, I love this soap. No reason to stop using it!</li>
            <li> Like it.  The scent isn&#x27;t too powerful or overpowering.  It&#x27;s great on the skin.  I use it on my face and didn&#x27;t have any issues with dryness of flaking.  Awesome product.  Excellent quality as always from Dove.</li>
            <li> This is great soap.  Dove has always been my go-to during the winter time because my skin gets extremely dry.  This doesn&#x27;t completely alleviate the problem, but it is a major improvement over normal bar soap.  The scent is also really good.  I will absolutely be purchasing this soap again - in bulk.</li>
            <li> Dove is well know for producing a quality soap but this is not one of them. While it shares the silky and creamy nature of the original Dove, the fragrance leaves much to be desired. I think they tried too hard to make a manly soap rather than a good soap that men could appreciate. I will use these bars in since I have them but i will not buy anymore.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed using Dove.  Now I am really enjoying Dove for Men.  I actually prefer Dove&#x27;s liquid soap over Dove&#x27;s bar soap, but I find both very efficient.</li>
            <li> Cleans with refreshing scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Able to use on days I don&#x27;t have time to moisturize skin and no worry about feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> Too waxy for me.  A piece of this soap stayed down next to my drain for over a month being drenched by 3 or more showers a day and stayed the same size.  Smell is nothing.  Like hard lard.  My favorite is [[ASIN:B000052YLL Neutrogena Original Formula Soap Ounce]] but it is pricey.</li>
            <li> 3 stars....Why do I have to write something as far as a review if I am a verified customer??? 1 Star &#x3D; BAD - 5 Stars &#x3D; GREAT</li>
            <li> It works fine and smells great but it&#x27;s pretty soft so each bar I use seems to diminish more rapidly than other soaps I&#x27;ve used for less money, so the cost is higher.</li>
            <li> What gives Dove?  Really like this soap other than the fact the bars seem to run out so fast.  These were $8.xx with SS, and overnight the prices doubles?  Looks like I&#x27;ll be taking my business else where.</li>
            <li> Smells like a clean man should. Not too drying.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap on the market right now. This leaves my skin much more hydrated than other soaps I have used. Especially helpful in the winter months when my skin gets extremely dry. The scent is very nice and not overpowering. I would highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use any other soap. I keep on purchasing a lot of it when it goes on sale and it&#x27;s great. Does not dry my skin up and even my wife started to use it!</li>
            <li> Great product for men! good smell, but not overpowering. the bars last a long time and the freshness sticks with you all day long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap. and it smells nice. there&#x27;s really not much more to say than that. my wife will use it, but i think she&#x27;d prefer something that smelled differently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this soap. It does not lather up as much some other brands. It smells nice, but that&#x27;s not exactly all I look for in a soap. Manly yes, but I need lather too.</li>
            <li> I like Dove soaps; they do not dry out my skin like other men&#x27;s soaps.  These products are not easy to find in local retail shops so I was pleased to see them available on Amazon.  I particularly like fragrance the new blue colored soap.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service!!!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I&#x27;ve been a heavy user of Dove&#x27;s Exfoliating soap much to the amusement of my friends for using a \\&quot;beauty bar.\\&quot; This soap is perfect. It has those exfoliating things I love and it smells manly - not overpowering but a nice smell that stays for hours after the shower. I have overly dry skin having to use lotion sometimes hourly (California) and this soap definitely helps. Combined with the insane Amazon.com price, this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great smelling soap and the price is right on it.  Used to use Gillette and then found this and I will never go back to Gillette.Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this soap it smells great and is not oily. Great price , great soap. Dove makes some great products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Dove made a body bar for men, and happened to see it in the grocery one day.  This is a great alternative to those deodorant soaps.  Cleans well.  Leaves no soapy residue.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent. It smells great and makes my skin very smooth. It tends to run out quickly as it contains a lot of moisturizing cream? :)</li>
            <li> i loved the smell and feel of the shampoo in this brand and scent so i tried this soap.. for me the soap is ok but it feels too much like typical soap and isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough and doesn&#x27;t have as much cool feeling as the shampoo..  i probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again..  shampoo is great though.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality soap. Its tough enough to give me a good &#x27;man&#x27; cleaning, but leaves my skin hydrated. No more dry tight skin feeling</li>
            <li> Great soap with a great subtle scent. This is the only soap I have used that doesn&#x27;t leave an awkward feeling soap residue. These last a lot longer than liquid body wash and are much easier to travel with too.</li>
            <li> i am always told i smell good evenn though i dont wear cologne. this soap is awesome. it moisturizes, smells really good. i used to use body wash, but this is now a permanent replacement. i can never find 8 bars in store so i count on amazon for that.</li>
            <li> Who said Dove was just for women.&lt;br /&gt;These Bars are great.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just amazing and they will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that they are worth the small price.</li>
            <li> I like dove products for the gentleness/sensitivity of them but always thought that they catered more to women. When this came out I said, finally a manly product. I like the smell. A little strong but fine. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like other soaps do.</li>
            <li> Good add on if you need to add to get free Amazon shipping.  Good cost and quality as well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much you can say about soap. It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side as far as bars of soap go, but it leaves me smelling good, so I&#x27;m happy. 5 stars</li>
            <li> The smell is great.  The bars are very moisturizing.  It washes clean fairly quickly and is better than a zest -fully clean!</li>
            <li> Bar Soap is soap. It cleans. It is good. Like any other soap. Its mens soap. What is the difference between mens and other soap. I do not know. Are they cheap here. I do not know.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product based on the overwhelmingly strong perfume scent it contains.  A nice, subtle, fresh scent would be nice, but this soap absolutely wreaks!  It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, just way too much of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;After using it for several days now, there is no lingering scent, so I must add two stars, as the product doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like others do.  With that objection removed, I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I never realized that this product even existed until recently.My wife always liked Dove and i was using Safeguard anti-bacterial soap, but am now concerned that it contained triclocarban, which is slowly being taken out of products due to safety concerns.When i spotted Dove for men here on Amazon i figured i&#x27;d give it a try.I bought the extra fresh variety and am very pleased by the scent and how it felt on my skin.Cannot beat the subscribe and save price on this item....</li>
            <li> Very nice product for a male with a good fragrance that is manly.  Easy to hold and use.  The soap does a great job in the shower at the sink.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nephew who has sensitive, dry skin. He LOVES it! It&#x27;s the only soap that he is now using. Before it was, Dove body wash, but now he will only use this soap. He says it leaves his skin hydrated and does not smell &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;. I buy it regularly for him and send it to him in his care packages.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap.  I used to get very itchy, no more.  I used to get some sort of dry skin rash on my shins, no more.  Wonderful.  I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> DoveMen+Care soap is very good product. However, the Extra Fresh Deodorant causes irritation on me.</li>
            <li> I work in a very non friendly skin enviroment and after using this soap for a week,my hands don&#x27;t crack and bleed anymore!</li>
            <li> Great soap; Great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes use on face; works great.&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feeling. Easily rubs off.&lt;br /&gt;Not like the cheap oily soaps</li>
            <li> The scent is nice but it has a lot of moisturizer in it. The bars seem to run out very fast.</li>
            <li> This is the soap I like to use.  My wife laughs at me because I am a sucker for the &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; tag on it.  But its good soap, smells good and cleans me.  And I like ordering my daily supplies from Amazon in bulk to save.</li>
            <li> Extra fresh care.  The soap is worth the extra money - truly is.  Makes sense to buy the larger package as well.  Thank God Amazon is selling it because it is cheaper than the Grocery store.</li>
            <li> I used to use Ivory soap because being very hairy and well endowed,other soaps bother my skin.I discovered this product actually at Target and this is one of the best man products. The soap laters well,smell clean like a man and does not bother the skin.It makes my skin feel soft yet does not \\&quot;burn\\&quot; the penis like other soap do.It even makes my thick body hair soft. A great buy.Check all my Dove Men product reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK tough I like the feel of the glycerine ones best.  It feels a little chalky and less soapy.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my skin moisturizer an have been using my wife&#x27;s Dove. She found a more masculine version and now I use this. Works the same but smells great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s finally the best best soup I could buy after long from dove which proved to cleans and give lasting fragrance to the body even in tropical climate I love and I keep using..</li>
            <li> I always used my girlfriends dove soap but she got irritated and it didn&#x27;t make me feel very manly. Now I use basically the same exact soap but it says &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; on it and smells manlier. It&#x27;s great soap.</li>
            <li> This smells great! have gotten many (many being 3, but it&#x27;s a start haha) compliments on the smell.. and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out (good for the skin you don&#x27;t want to dry out like face, big toe, etc.)</li>
            <li> I prefer bar soap over, body wash, I enjoy that \\&quot;Squeaky Clean\\&quot; feeling that it gives you. This soap does that, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. So I can easily take a shower and get ready to go about my day without having to put on lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and the product works great.  I got the other bar last time with the exfoliating beads or whatever, but I don&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  I might go back to the other one next time but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as this one.  Either of the dove men bars works better than other soaps I have tried, it leaves less of a residue.</li>
            <li> This body soap is a mans best friend.  It smells delightful and makes you wand to scrub your body more than if you were covered in katchup and dog poo. I love bathing 3 times a day because this soap exists and I own it.  Simply by shopping and having Prime I saved..!</li>
            <li> fatanstic scent and not so heavy at same time, I keep on purchasing a lot of it when it goes on sale and it&#x27;s great. Does not dry my skin up and make my skin soft</li>
            <li> This smells fine and I have no real complaints about it but there is better out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few different scents and highly prefer the Deep Clean that Dove makes. That soap cleans better with the grit they put in it and, for me, a bar seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> This soap doesnt seem any more special or different from other soaps on the market.  The smell isnt very strong (that&#x27;s sort of a positive thing to me) but otherwise it&#x27;s just soap.  I feel clean but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Used two bars so far. 8 of them will last you for months considering non wasteful use. Best ten bucks I ever spent on soap that cleans my body and my face.</li>
            <li> We love dove bar soap and my husband loves using the dove for men now.  Nice clean scent, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Dove for Men soap about a year ago and I&#x27;m sold!  It does a great job cleaning as well as keeping your skin from drying out so badly.</li>
            <li> My husband is a mechanic and this is one of the few soaps out there that gets the grease and grime off of him. Bonus that it smells great and is good for his skin. It&#x27;s a love love love product in our home.</li>
            <li> Subscribe and save for the soap is great since it is used consistently.  It saves a lot of hassle of grabbing from the store.</li>
            <li> This is the best bar soap for my money.  I&#x27;ve used body washes in the past from many different brands, but I always found myself preferring bar soap instead.  After that, I tried quite a few brands again.  This is my favorite for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s a moisturizer as well.  As a child I had some skin rash problems and had to use the original white Dove bar soap.  That is actually what originally led me to trying this one.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t make my skin baby smooth and soft (I wouldn&#x27;t want it to anyway), but it does help prevent cracking on my hands, knuckles, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells good.  My girlfriend loves it and says it smells &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  Ok that&#x27;s all fine and good, but the real selling point is that the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering or cologne like.  And, as mentioned before, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a pre-pubescent boy trying to get his first date.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s barely more than a dollar per bar.  For something that cheap you would expect it to basically disintegrate after two showers.  Not so with this soap.  It lasts a full week usually, and very often more.  You can reasonably expect to get 7-10 showers per bar AT LEAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, less than $10 buy you some great smelling soap that will also help your skin stay healthy and it will last you almost three months.</li>
            <li> Love dove products to start with have always used their soap as I have my grandma&#x27;s sensitive skin. She was the one that turned my on to it and now my husband uses this products. Smell is awesome very clean and refreshing on him and in the bathroom when he is done. Wonderful prices online at amazon too. Definite buy for price and product.</li>
            <li> great smell! forms up very well and really cleans your body well i would tell anyone to buy it and try a bar</li>
            <li> This Soap really smells great, I use it as well as my husband. lol</li>
            <li> Fit as expected. Excellent quality</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale and it was great. Makes me smell wonderful and all the women flock to me at the bar. Was a great price too.</li>
            <li> Smells like rotten wood</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Men&#x27;s Body Wash since college because I didn&#x27;t like the soap residue that bar soap typically left on my skin.  Dove soap is the complete opposite, leaves my skin feeling great and better yet my wife loves the smell.  Better yet, I subscribe to it and receive 8 bars every two months and not only is it much cheaper than at our local stores, but I don&#x27;t have to remind my wife to pick it up for me when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, now, and not only do I like it .... but my wife loves the smell of it! It&#x27;s one sure way to make sure I&#x27;m clean all the time!</li>
