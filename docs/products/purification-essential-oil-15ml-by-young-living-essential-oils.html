            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very assertive and not something I would ever choose as a perfume, for instance.</li>
            <li>and much much</li>
            <li>really didnt know what happened to me.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It takes away the itch better than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the smell of citronella, it is very heavy and overwhelming - don&#x27;t buy this!  </li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to bee stings</li>
            <li>this company sells high end/quality oils.  </li>
            <li>There are other brands of oil on Amazon that are the exact same blend, but I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>It also gives you a much better feeling than using the harsh chemicals in the air or on the body.</li>
            <li>and I am still coming up with new uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become my new cleanser for the boys cuts and scrapes.  </li>
            <li>He said I should of gone in to the hospital because they are more deadly then the adult jelly fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Purification blend has a sharp, clean scent headed up by citronella and lemongrass.</li>
            <li>This product will last a long time since it&#x27;s so concentrated and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I had an old diffuser I had to soak in alcohol for a couple of days to get the old oils out.  </li>
            <li>So I pulled a five year old bottle of purification off my shelf and thought, why not?    </li>
            <li>It cleaned my diffuser completely leaving no signs of residue.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy Young Living oils because of the price..</li>
            <li>You can put it directly on skin, breath it in, or diffuse it.</li>
            <li>It works to keep bugs away, when mixed with a carrier like almond or sunflower or any oil, really.</li>
            <li>I do not suggest diffusing this in the busy parts of you home.</li>
            <li>On my last day I was on the beach -- I wanted to spend as much time as I could just floating and swimming on the water.</li>
            <li>I place a small portion of a paper towel on the return vent for the air conditioner and add 2 drops and when the a/c comes on it the whole house smells fresh.</li>
            <li>highly recommend all younglivingoils essential oils..</li>
            <li>mom started putting some purification oil on it and in about 4 days my hand was back to its normal size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like citronella in a major way</li>
            <li>I like the scent and effectiveness against molds and bacteria of Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil, but can not tolerate the scent of Purification Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>The seal was broken, so I can&#x27;t be sure of</li>
            <li>Have used it a few times with positive results.  </li>

            <li> It works to keep bugs away, when mixed with a carrier like almond or sunflower or any oil, really.</li>
            <li> I do not suggest diffusing this in the busy parts of you home.</li>
            <li> On my last day I was on the beach -- I wanted to spend as much time as I could just floating and swimming on the water.</li>
            <li> I place a small portion of a paper towel on the return vent for the air conditioner and add 2 drops and when the a/c comes on it the whole house smells fresh.</li>
            <li> highly recommend all younglivingoils essential oils..</li>
            <li> mom started putting some purification oil on it and in about 4 days my hand was back to its normal size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like citronella in a major way</li>
            <li> I like the scent and effectiveness against molds and bacteria of Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil, but can not tolerate the scent of Purification Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken, so I can&#x27;t be sure of</li>
            <li> Have used it a few times with positive results.  </li>
            <li> When I vacuum with it, the actual scent lasts for a couple hours, but the effect lasts for a couple days.     </li>
            <li> Used on a horse that shakes her head due to allergies and has completely fixed the problem organically.  </li>
            <li> You really have to use very little oil</li>
            <li> I have used essential oils for years now and prefer several other companies to yl, for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to describe but very lifting.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for a long time.</li>
            <li> The other oil I bought from this place was obviously tampered with so I am leary of this bottle as well.</li>
            <li> I believe there are other brands cheaper that are equal to YL.</li>
            <li> a few drops mixed into baking soda and sprinkled onto my carpets before I vacuum.</li>
            <li> I adopted a kitten and the &amp;#34;birth mother&#x27; was using it as flea repellant while the kitties were too small and too young for Rx flea &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It makes both of them loose the &amp;#34;dirty dog&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Still there was gummy residue in a teeny tiny little tube where nothing was going to get it out.  </li>
            <li> Young Living oils are so pure and so well extracted; they&#x27;re night and day difference from other less expensive products.</li>
            <li> Dab a few drops on a cotton ball, and place in the ear for nearly instant relief.</li>
            <li> I think it has low odor, no perfume or heavy scent.</li>
            <li> but it works for other things as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would work applied topically</li>

            <li> i probably would have scars all over my neck due to</li>
            <li> I was dizzy and pretty weird</li>
            <li> the list is endless.</li>
            <li> So not worth the risk for buying this brand.</li>
            <li> had to down lemon ammonia  </li>
            <li> It works and is healthier for them than the stuff you buy that you put down their spines.  .</li>
            <li> I use a couple of splashes of this in a spray bottle of water and spray my dog down with it in-between baths.</li>
            <li> I also spray the dog bed down until its saturated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been running purification in it now for a few days.  </li>
            <li> No muddy or heavy odor.  </li>
            <li> I burned myself on the weedeater - I put a few drops on before bed</li>
            <li> Made some chapstick with just beeswax, olive oil and a few drops of this.  </li>
            <li> But if you so not enjoy the smell of citronella or lemon them</li>
            <li> I work in a manufacturing facility where raw meat scraps routinely make it into our dumpster.  </li>
            <li> I am very surprized that this product was bad.</li>
            <li> I usually do Apis Homeopathic pills</li>
            <li> Arrived with the seal broken and appears thin.</li>
            <li> An hour later the bad smell was gone!</li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s really weird is when I have it turned on when I&#x27;m sitting at my desk,</li>
            <li> It smells terrible when you put it in an essential oil atomizer.</li>
            <li> It made me kinda weird and spacey.</li>
            <li> I get cold sores</li>
            <li> Mix and use all the time for my dog, rugs, shoes, anything dirty.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of bad orders as well.</li>
            <li> Must be a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I rushed in to the house to get the stinger out but it swelled up so bad that i had to do something else.</li>
            <li> my hand swelled up so bad</li>
            <li> relief.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed..</li>

            <li> Purification stinks so damn bad!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I thought this product might work well as an insect repellent or to minimize the sting of spider or mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but if you use it to fill a room, it is awful.</li>
            <li> Unlucky for me, my office window faces that dumpster and in the summer, it&#x27;s truly awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this Purification oil for so many things. putting some drops on your air conditioning filters is great! gets rid of smells and also keeps the air fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Arrived with the seal broken and appears thin. But not clouded or colored. The other oil I bought from this place was obviously tampered with so I am leary of this bottle as well.</li>
            <li> I love Young Living products but I don&#x27;t love the fragrance of Purification</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell, but love the benefits of this magic in a bottle. I use it for ear infections. Dab a few drops on a cotton ball, and place in the ear for nearly instant relief.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It says for cuts and insect bites and purify the air but it works for other things as well.  It is a must for your Essential Oil collection.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly a was packed well. This oil actually removes odors when diffused. I will continue to use it .The seller wad great when I needed to change my shipping address at the ladt minute.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product but I will get back to reviewing it in a couple of months.  So far so good.  No problems with the seller.</li>
            <li> It works great. I used it for stinky room odor. It eliminated it. Very easy 10 drips of oil to 8oz of water. It even works on vomit odor.</li>
            <li> I had an old diffuser I had to soak in alcohol for a couple of days to get the old oils out.  Then I ran it for a day with the alcohol in it.  Still there was gummy residue in a teeny tiny little tube where nothing was going to get it out.  So I pulled a five year old bottle of purification off my shelf and thought, why not?    I&#x27;ve been running purification in it now for a few days.  It cleaned my diffuser completely leaving no signs of residue.    But what&#x27;s really weird is when I have it turned on when I&#x27;m sitting at my desk, after about an hour or two I am so relaxed and calm I get sleepy and want to take a nap.    Not sure what the exact intended use of this is, but it&#x27;s great for getting me completely clam--which is a feat in and of itself.    Can&#x27;t wait to use the Peace and Calming oil in it.  Someone may have to scrape me off the floor  or I may just ascend.</li>
            <li> This product will not disappoint.  No muddy or heavy odor.  Clean and bright. Wonderful for your home.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible when you put it in an essential oil atomizer. I&#x27;m not sure if it would work applied topically but if you use it to fill a room, it is awful. I adopted a kitten and the &amp;#34;birth mother&#x27; was using it as flea repellant while the kitties were too small and too young for Rx flea &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34;. My vet just rolled his eyes when I mentioned it. I thought this product might work well as an insect repellent or to minimize the sting of spider or mosquito bites. I will update my review if this proves to be true.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I difuse it I&#x27;m my home, and nothing smells better. I also used this for acne and it really works.</li>
            <li> Purification Essential Oil is not a winner for me. I like the scent and effectiveness against molds and bacteria of Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil, but can not tolerate the scent of Purification Essential Oil. I have tried this product in my house and disposed of it after one use. I find the aroma overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  I cannot believe all the stuff I put purification oil on! Absolutely love it and it smells terrific!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy Young Living oils because of the price..I believe there are other brands cheaper that are equal to YL. This is one I do buy because I love the fragrance..it smell so clean. I place a small portion of a paper towel on the return vent for the air conditioner and add 2 drops and when the a/c comes on it the whole house smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years.  It works to clean the air, eliminate odors, and help maintain a healthy respiratory environment.  I will definitely purchase more!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for many reasons, good for infections, colds, insect bites, for dogs too. It gets rid of bad orders as well. It has cleansing properties.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as part of a sampler pack, together with thieves and rc.  Theives smells great, rc is ok, not what i expected.  Purification stinks so damn bad!!!!!  It smells like citronella in a major way and I&#x27;m giving mine away.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell of citronella, it is very heavy and overwhelming - don&#x27;t buy this!  It&#x27;s also weird to me that so many yo products have myrtle and lemon in them - I feel like its a filler.  The purification smells chemical like to me.  I have used essential oils for years now and prefer several other companies to yl, for several reasons.  This is a big stinky no go for me!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend turned me on to this stuff!  Any skin irratations - the other day I burned myself on the weedeater - I put a few drops on before bed and when I woke up it was almost gone!  Any rash, scabs, etc.  itchy skin - this stuff works!  I will always keep a bottle in my cabinet!</li>
            <li> Was hesitant at first to purchase over Citrus Fresh, but I was rather surprised to enjoy the scent of purifcation..&lt;br /&gt;Smells refreshing. Haven&#x27;t purchased citrus fresh so cannot compare, but love purification.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and in good condition, I use it for making the house smell fresher, especially after cooking.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this oil also works as a mosquito repellant, will try making some in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I put this on a cotton ball and place it in different places in my office, everyone that comes in comments on how wonderful it smells. Where is it coming from? I put some on a cotton ball and put it in the microwave that had a burnt popcorn smell inside.  An hour later the bad smell was gone! Great stuff</li>
            <li> Great product.  Use for so many purposes.  Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> The real deal. My bottle is the most recent one carried and shipped by YL. HIGHLY recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative on getting rid of the stinky dog smell from my dogs. This was excellent!!! I even mixed a batch to give it a try. Delivered fast. Product is great. Will be back to get more for sure.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for a stuffy nose. Its also very good to protection from bugs. Especially bed bugs which I found out while I was traveling</li>
            <li> Love the smell. You can put it directly on skin, breath it in, or diffuse it. I&#x27;ve used it for bug bites, stinky feet, and relaxation</li>
            <li> I am very surprized that this product was bad. I purchased 5 previously and they were great. Must be a bad batch. But beware, the company ships it and forget its. So not worth the risk for buying this brand.</li>
            <li> I work in a manufacturing facility where raw meat scraps routinely make it into our dumpster.  Unlucky for me, my office window faces that dumpster and in the summer, it&#x27;s truly awful.  I purchased this and use it in my electric diffuser.  It smells like lemon grass and citrus and helps to actually remove the garbage/meat smell from my office.  It&#x27;s not like an air freshener that just covers the scent, either.  My coworkers say that my office is one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t reek in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s VERY strong, so unless you have a very large room, be sure to use it sparingly!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this oil very much and it should last me quite a while. I am definitely excited to use it out while I am camping since it has a citronella note.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for 15 years and I am still coming up with new uses. Last week, I added it to a smelly load of laundry that was going to be thrown in the trash. Guess what! It not only took the odor from the clothes, it took the stink out of the washer, as well! Eventually. I used 5 drops per 5 gal bucket added to the wash cycle. It works to keep bugs away, when mixed with a carrier like almond or sunflower or any oil, really. It works great with rosemary and cedar, too. I keep a roller tube on hand with purification and vitamin e oil for bug bites. It takes away the itch better than other products I&#x27;ve used. Every collection needs this blend!</li>
            <li> Fabulous for everything from insect repellant (if you think ahead) to soothing bug bites (if you don&#x27;t think ahead) to clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> I really like this smell. It is hard to describe but very lifting. I feel good in it and most folks comment on how good I smell. It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm a room. It isn&#x27;t strong and dissipates softly.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Made some chapstick with just beeswax, olive oil and a few drops of this.  Love it</li>
            <li> I am reviewing product, not seller. The product has been amazing for air purification and scent neutralizer when diffused. If you have teenage boys you will want this product to diffuse in their bedrooms! Nothing else kicked the odor, but Purification did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for itchy, bothersome bug bites and stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the scent. It reminds me of clean! But if you so not enjoy the smell of citronella or lemon them I do not suggest diffusing this in the busy parts of you home.</li>
            <li> Purification blend has a sharp, clean scent headed up by citronella and lemongrass. It&#x27;s very assertive and not something I would ever choose as a perfume, for instance. But it is perfect for its intended use: \\&quot;Purification.\\&quot;     I use it as a carpet refresher: a few drops mixed into baking soda and sprinkled onto my carpets before I vacuum. The whole house smells so wonderful afterwards; I actually look forward to vacuuming now!    When I vacuum with it, the actual scent lasts for a couple hours, but the effect lasts for a couple days.     If you&#x27;re like me and think \\&quot;Citronella &#x3D; mosquito candle scent (yuck)\\&quot;, do give this oil a chance anyway. Young Living oils are so pure and so well extracted; they&#x27;re night and day difference from other less expensive products.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken, so I can&#x27;t be sure of it&#x27;s purity.  Perhaps someone else returned this.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I never believed in essential oils until this product!!! It&#x27;s wonderful! I get cold sores about four times a year mostly when the seasons change. I put this on the moment it starts to tingle and I never even get a blister! I also use it if I have a rather large zit! This dries it right out!</li>
            <li> Used on a horse that shakes her head due to allergies and has completely fixed the problem organically.  Plus it smells great, sometimes I use it too!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily on my face and it is healing my acne scars, controlling my oil and keeping the acne at bay.  I dilute it with Argon oil and combine it with Lavender, Geranium and Patchouli therapeutic grade essential oils.  This product is superior in quality and is working wonders on my face.</li>
            <li> I love it in my laundry</li>
            <li> This summer I was in Hawaii enjoying vacation. On my last day I was on the beach -- I wanted to spend as much time as I could just floating and swimming on the water. Well, I got that and much much more.&lt;br /&gt;I got jelly fish stings all over my neck and arms.&lt;br /&gt;I really didnt know what happened to me. It made me kinda weird and spacey. Once i got back to Colorado I went to my Chiro and told him I didnt know what bit me on my neck. My neck had bright bright bright red all over it and looked like someone splashed fire on me.&lt;br /&gt;He said I was stung by baby jelly fish. He said I should of gone in to the hospital because they are more deadly then the adult jelly fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my mom uses this younglivingoils  and she gave me some purfication oil. I put it on my neck to relieve the itchingness and burning sensations for over a month. If it wasnt for the oil i probably would have scars all over my neck due to this bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when I was outside in July, I was sittin reading the paper and a bee came up and stung me on my left pinkie twice. I didnt aggravate the bee at all. I rushed in to the house to get the stinger out but it swelled up so bad that i had to do something else. I am highly allergic to bee stings and I dont do the epi pen. I usually do Apis Homeopathic pills but at this time I couldnt find my pills.&lt;br /&gt;I had to down lemon ammonia  all over my hand and the  pain was unbearable-- my hand swelled up so bad it looked like 4 hands in my one hand. The venom was in my hand wrist and fingers goin up to my shoulder. I was dizzy and pretty weird also.&lt;br /&gt;My mom started putting some purification oil on it and in about 4 days my hand was back to its normal size.&lt;br /&gt;If it wasnt for the quick reaction to ammonia and purification oil i probably would have scars all over my neck and also on my pinkie. I have no scars whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend all younglivingoils essential oils..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the peppermint, lavendar , lemon, valor, citrus blend, thieves, thieves mouthwash,  peace n calming oils&lt;br /&gt;I use these because they work and instant relief.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed..alor, citrus blend, thieves, thieves mouthwash,  peace n calming oils&lt;br /&gt;I use these because they work and instant relief.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed..</li>
            <li> There are other brands of oil on Amazon that are the exact same blend, but I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used alot of essential oils....this company sells high end/quality oils.  This maybe pricey for some....but well worth it!!!  I use this stuff in all kinds of applications, cleaning the washing machine, on dryer sheets, make a room spray, in the humdifier....the list is endless. I do buy oils from other companies....but Young Living Purification Oil is the best.  You really have to use very little oil and I use about 2 bottles per year. You should be able to look up the ingredients to get an idea of what this smells like.  I think it has low odor, no perfume or heavy scent.</li>
            <li> Mix and use all the time for my dog, rugs, shoes, anything dirty.</li>
            <li> Very strong.  Good for edema.</li>
            <li> I love young living.  I have been looking to purchase this and I love it.  Great for cuts and bugs</li>
            <li> Great product! Works very well. I used it to get rid of dog smells on beds and carpets. I will reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite blends from Young Living. I use it all the time in my diffuser and I made my own spray air freshener with this blend. It has a fresh, clean, and pleasant scent. This is my healthy solution to commercial air fresheners which are toxic.</li>
            <li> Tis stuff really works! Top notch product that does what they say it will do. This has become one of my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; on Han at all times.</li>
            <li> young living is a great company. My house smelled beautiful for Christmas and had many compliments. Thank you for such a terrific product.</li>
            <li> With the amount of hot yoga and running I do - my laundry smells amazing with just a few drops every time.  This is awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this on my dogs to repel fleas and flies.  It works and is healthier for them than the stuff you buy that you put down their spines.  .</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I use it on my dogs. I mix it in distilled water and spray them during the summer. I also use it in a diffuser in my home. And I always recommend when buying young living oils to do your research for best pricing and free shipping if you can find it. This seller was great!</li>
            <li> Have used it a few times with positive results.  It&#x27;s become my new cleanser for the boys cuts and scrapes.  We&#x27;ve also diffused it for room purification.  It does have a pleasant scent.  It also gives you a much better feeling than using the harsh chemicals in the air or on the body.</li>
            <li> Great for stinky dogs!</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for a long time. It has a nice smell to it and antibacterial properties. I boil it on teh stove to add moisture to teh air when the furnace runs alot.</li>
            <li> I use a couple of splashes of this in a spray bottle of water and spray my dog down with it in-between baths. I also spray the dog bed down until its saturated.  It makes both of them loose the &amp;#34;dirty dog&amp;#34; smell for a good few days.  Its great, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  This product will last a long time since it&#x27;s so concentrated and well worth the money!</li>
