            <li>Great for my acne prone teen &amp; preteen boys.</li>
            <li>bought this face cream after trying a free sample sent with another diva stuff product as always.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>The tingly feel and peppermint scent are just added bonuses for me - it does not cause irritation and leaves my face feeling and smelling clean &amp; cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a moisturizer or even a special face</li>
            <li>I cant say enough good things about this stuff.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a super moisturizing acne face cream</li>
            <li>However, what this does do is balance my skin, exactly as the name indicates!</li>
            <li>This product greatly reduced the redness from rosacea over a few days.  </li>
            <li>but when you do its worth it (:</li>
            <li>I love knowing that her products are hand made and contain natural healing ingredients.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and feels fresh and moist.  </li>
            <li>Very buttery and rich but not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another bottle right now</li>
            <li>The face wash is treating and preventing my acne and the face cream provides exactly the right amount of moisture to keep me from drying out or getting too oily.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have got to say that this is my third day of using this</li>
            <li>This was my first time getting any Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li>If you have a similar skin type to mine then I would recommend you start with those products instead :-)</li>
            <li>If price is not an issue, I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my sensitive skin and my new favorite facial lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product was working to dry out my acne</li>
            <li>It felt the same (perhaps a tiny bit more moist) as it did that morning!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how amazing it is, better than any expensive one I have ever purchased and doesn&#x27;t have any of the chemicals or junk.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisture cream and use it at night, after putting on the Acne Scar Reducing Cream.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and this really controls my oil for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This works and is gentle, too.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It has also been working for several months which is nice, most products only seem to help for a few days.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Now for those (like me) who have super dry skins, combine this cream with a non-pore clogging moisture cream (water based) to not be too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I felt my face at the end of the day!</li>
            <li>Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!.</li>
            <li>and you will go through this tiny bottle fast!  </li>
            <li>, my face felt soft and my cystic acne shrunk a bit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck.</li>
            <li>I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my skin is too sensitive for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a direct decrease in my acne</li>
            <li>I love all these products and can finally end my search for something to help clear my skin without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I like the cream ok, but it comes in a small bottle with a smaller opening at the top and it is virtually impossible to get the cream out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>it made my face tingle like crazy then the softness AMAZING that was enough to keep using it for me</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin is plagued with adult cystic acne and rosacea, and the wrong moisturizer can make my skin go from calm to freak out in a matter of hours.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My only complaint is that I go through the bottle pretty quickly (two pumps morning &amp; night) and after shipping the product is quite expensive for how much you get.</li>
            <li> I switched to using it only at night and would wake up with dry skin around my acne problem areas.</li>
            <li> I find it very difficult to get the moisturizer out of the tiny opening and wish it was a pump system or had a wider opening to have better access to the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if my acne is any less, but definitely not worse.  </li>
            <li> but I do believe the oil reduction is contributing to an overall less &amp;#34;acne prone&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Stumbled upon the listing by accident and decided to give it a try with not much hope.</li>
            <li> but the harsh products have left your skin peeling and flaking?  </li>
            <li> I also place a few drops of frankincense oil when i need an extra boost for a blemish.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and HATE putting any kind of lotion on my skin</li>
            <li> but when I do get a breakout it usually takes about a week for it to clear; using salicylic acid or harsh chemicals to treat it.</li>
            <li> I currently have acne on my forehead and cheeks and they are drying out, slowly</li>
            <li> There is a little dipper in the lid but each time you dip only a tiny amount comes back out, so I find the product very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> let it soak in for few minutes while i do my eye makeup and then put on my foundation.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; your skin --- you know, how usually the blemishes are still there</li>
            <li> Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
            <li> is the bottle i thought was broken concidering</li>
            <li> and this has decreased the oiliness.  </li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy or shiny looking and it helps keep away that awful acne!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for my acne prone teen &amp; preteen boys. They don&#x27;t like the Diva name to be at all visible though.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing.  My sensitive skin is plagued with adult cystic acne and rosacea, and the wrong moisturizer can make my skin go from calm to freak out in a matter of hours.  I got a sample of this product when I ordered Diva Stuff face wash.  I used the sample one night and the next morning, my face felt soft and my cystic acne shrunk a bit.  This product greatly reduced the redness from rosacea over a few days.  Great stuff for my skin!!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels great!!! Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I like the cream ok, but it comes in a small bottle with a smaller opening at the top and it is virtually impossible to get the cream out of the bottle.  There is a little dipper in the lid but each time you dip only a tiny amount comes back out, so I find the product very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have got to say that this is my third day of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my skin is acne prone. not severe but enough to be considered problematic. I have tried every store bought anti acne kits since i was 15 (I am 24 now) and I finally wondered if my skin cannot handle chemicals. This cream feels amazing and smells amazing. It tingles as if you put mint on your face and it&#x27;s working. I currently have acne on my forehead and cheeks and they are drying out, slowly but surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a super moisturizing acne face cream this is not it. This is a balancing cream so if you are oily to combination cream this is perfect, as it is supposed to balance the oil production that cause acne. Now for those (like me) who have super dry skins, combine this cream with a non-pore clogging moisture cream (water based) to not be too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will patiently wait for my purging stage to be over and see the full result of this feel-good cream.</li>
            <li> Kills the acne bacteria, keep the face moisture, clean and soft, perfect for under makeup, I recommend this product 100%</li>
            <li> This was my first time getting any Diva Stuff. Been using this for about a week now and it feels amazing. I have acne prone skin and HATE putting any kind of lotion on my skin but this is an exception. I&#x27;ve also been using it immediately after using my dermaroller and it instantly cools and soothes my irritated skin. I&#x27;m buying another bottle right now so I won&#x27;t have to be without it when I run out. Definitely hooked.</li>
            <li> bought this face cream after trying a free sample sent with another diva stuff product as always. it made my face tingle like crazy then the softness AMAZING that was enough to keep using it for me but then i noticed my face getting clearer. pores smaller, and skin tone smoothen out the only dislike is the bottle i thought was broken concidering it was just a short stem on the inside of the lid and the cream takes some pounding on the hand to get it out. but when you do its worth it (:</li>
            <li> I call this my \\&quot;awesome sauce\\&quot;!! I use it everyday after I wash my face. It hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy or shiny looking and it helps keep away that awful acne!! If you are a woman who washes her face daily and you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer to soothe and help repair your skin then this is for YOU!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all of their products. I am 29 and have had acne during and after my pregnancy. This stuff works great! I use the charcoal facial cleanser and have their spot treatments as well. I have bought these as gifts and will keep buying!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisture cream and use it at night, after putting on the Acne Scar Reducing Cream.  My skin is clearing up in amazing way using these products.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for with this cream is the bottle.  I find it very difficult to get the moisturizer out of the tiny opening and wish it was a pump system or had a wider opening to have better access to the moisturizer.  I like the minty smell too.</li>
            <li> SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck. YAY! I&#x27;ve never had severe acne but when I do get a breakout it usually takes about a week for it to clear; using salicylic acid or harsh chemicals to treat it. I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days of use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is possibly the most amazing scent I have ever experienced with skin care products. It opens up your senses the minute you apply it to your skin. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and is very easy to apply. No clumping, funky residue, or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it did not provide enough moisture for my skin type. I tried using it day/night after cleansing and noticed drier skin almost immediately. I switched to using it only at night and would wake up with dry skin around my acne problem areas. I&#x27;m sure this product was working to dry out my acne but my skin is too sensitive for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have switched to the &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Sea Salt Face Wash&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Hibiscus Lift Face Cream&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m getting the results I was hoping for! The face wash is treating and preventing my acne and the face cream provides exactly the right amount of moisture to keep me from drying out or getting too oily. If you have a similar skin type to mine then I would recommend you start with those products instead :-)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,. has a great clean and fresh mint smell to it, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought a skin care kit off of Diva stuff&#x27;s website and she sent me this moisturizer. It&#x27;s the best! I have very oily skin and this really controls my oil for the whole day. I was so surprised when I felt my face at the end of the day! It felt the same (perhaps a tiny bit more moist) as it did that morning! I&#x27;ve never had a moisturizer or even a special face mattifier work this well! A+++++!!</li>
            <li> I got this along with the diva mask, sulfur face wash, and the 3 spot treatments.  I love all these products and can finally end my search for something to help clear my skin without harsh chemicals.  This cream smells and feels wonderful to put on.  Very buttery and rich but not greasy at all.  It soaks right in and feels fresh and moist.  I love knowing that her products are hand made and contain natural healing ingredients.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing. Stumbled upon the listing by accident and decided to give it a try with not much hope. I&#x27;m not looking for something to control acne, since I already have my prescription cocktail for that and I wouldn&#x27;t expect acne control from a moisturizer. However, what this does do is balance my skin, exactly as the name indicates! I have oily/combination skin and this does the perfect job of moisturizing without adding oiliness. It absorbs great and seems to &amp;#34;normalize&amp;#34; my skin! The tingly feel and peppermint scent are just added bonuses for me - it does not cause irritation and leaves my face feeling and smelling clean &amp; cool. I haven&#x27;t noticed a direct decrease in my acne but I do believe the oil reduction is contributing to an overall less &amp;#34;acne prone&amp;#34; environment for my face. My only complaint is that I go through the bottle pretty quickly (two pumps morning &amp; night) and after shipping the product is quite expensive for how much you get. If price is not an issue, I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I own a skincare spa. Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!. I sell it at my spa.  It is the best product out there for SAFELY moisturizing acne-prone skin.  It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; your skin --- you know, how usually the blemishes are still there but the harsh products have left your skin peeling and flaking?  This works and is gentle, too.  Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products are safe but dang it they just don&#x27;t work.  It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> Works great ðŸ˜‰ this product has helped with my acne a lot along with using the charcoal face wash and blemish bomb</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love Diva stuff products. Ant the customer service superb. .I would reccomend these products to every one. I&#x27;m a customer. For life! !!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this has decreased the oiliness.  It has also been working for several months which is nice, most products only seem to help for a few days.  My skin is not at a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; oil level, but I doubt that is possible.  This has been a big help.</li>
            <li> Luv this stuff, smells so minty, clean on yoyr face, luv thr company too how they give u samples to try, great business incentive!!!</li>
            <li> It is okay. Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell and feel, however, not enough in the bottle and you will go through this tiny bottle fast!  They definitely need to make a larger size.  Not sure if my acne is any less, but definitely not worse.  I love the way it feels on my sensitive skin and my new favorite facial lotion.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this moisturizer.  I cannot believe how amazing it is, better than any expensive one I have ever purchased and doesn&#x27;t have any of the chemicals or junk.  I love all the products I have tried from Diva Stuff and I am amazed at how well this products works under make up too.  I use estee lauder double wear and i put one squirt on in the morning, let it soak in for few minutes while i do my eye makeup and then put on my foundation.  it is not oily, it does not make my foundation sink into lines or wear off.  I cant say enough good things about this stuff.  I also place a few drops of frankincense oil when i need an extra boost for a blemish.  I have not had any problems with the pump as others have described.</li>
