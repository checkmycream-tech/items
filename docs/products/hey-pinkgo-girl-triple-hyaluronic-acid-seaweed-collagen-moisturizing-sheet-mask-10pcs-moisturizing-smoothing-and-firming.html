            <li>Another favorite Hey!</li>
            <li>It smells yummy and the packaging is too cute!</li>
            <li>I also love the smell and excess essence!  </li>
            <li>It is one great product rarely available in the States.</li>
            <li>I would have never stumbled upon this product on my own.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the result from both products and cannot wait to try more sheet mask from them.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and comes with lots of moisture.</li>

            <li>love it~</li>
            <li>Among tons of Asian sheet masks I tried, this one works the best to moisturize and repair my skin, helped me get through the winter.</li>
            <li>and my skin is plump and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fun and easy to use it, and my skin feels revitalized!!</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels and looks after applying this mask--so hydrated, smooth and plumped up.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely amazing and very hydrating!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these masks.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t feel like it hydrated my skin much, if at all, which kind of defeated the purpose.</li>
            <li>Pinkgo Girl works just as good and is far cheaper.</li>
            <li>My face feels very juicy and smooth with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>These things are so amazing, they make my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I loved it because I got so much extra serum to apply all around my neck.</li>
            <li>These facial masks are always good to replenish moisture.</li>
            <li>They feel amazing on the skin :) when you put them on it stays on the skin and doesnt fall off like some other masks ive tried.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that how smooth and moist my face feels after first time applying it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the light hydration this mask provides works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Since the winter got colder and dryer recently, my skin was so dehydrated and kind of itchy.</li>
            <li>I felt the change right after using it.</li>
            <li>This box of sheet masks just arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>But after I leaned the right way I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li>Pinkgo Girl provides the same or even better quality.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitely suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid and collagen in the mask are really doing their jobs!</li>
            <li>and i do feel like my skin at first</li>
            <li>It makes me want to try some more that could actually help my dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what happened to me when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I do not think I would repurchase in regards to looking for something to actually truly benefit my skin, but for I do enjoy these for the fun of sheet masks and for the relaxation factor.</li>
            <li>All the good stuffs are absorbed into my skin instead of by thick cloth like some masks I bought before.</li>
            <li>The sheet mask fits perfectly and doesn’t feel awkward when wearing it.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the fact that there was plenty of product in the packet.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I defiantly say that anyone that wants some help fixing their skin should buy these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Now I can get the same smooth and moisturized face with a fraction of price.</li>
            <li>I like it so much......</li>
            <li>The sheet is very thin and comfortable, very easy for the serum to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>It actually helped to calm the oily parts.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by the girl that does my eyebrows, they wanted me to get a facial at their shop for $55, instead I came to Amazon and ordered this, and it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste that precious juice!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>My face turns super dry and itchy in winter.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>so I purchased this for my dry, irritated skin so it would calm down and hopefully become more hydrated to avoid further inflammation.</li>
            <li>(the other being Black Rose Collagen).</li>
            <li>There is so much in this product, that I have enough to do my neck, chest, arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and this does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Even those areas like chin and upper nose bridge and sides of the nose, it covered them very well.</li>
            <li>just left it feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>By the way, because the mask is thin, it’s better to put the backing with cloth on the face together then remove the backing.  </li>
            <li>I’ve always been a little hesitant when trying new things, but my face had been extremely dry and regardless of how much moisturizer I used</li>
            <li>I live in San Diego and always worry about my face due to the dryness, but this mask save a lot of work for me and keep my skin soft and tender all day long.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and need to be careful about the skincare products I use.</li>

            <li> If it is extra dry, this Triple HA is my go-to.</li>
            <li> I swear by Hyaluronic Acid because it has helped with my problematic skin (oiliness, some dry pathces and moderate acne).</li>
            <li> I think this would not quite be hydrating enough for folks with dry skin though.</li>
            <li> The masks are very very thin, cotton material that can easily rip on a fingernail.</li>
            <li> The dry flaky parts of my skin are gone.</li>
            <li> And what money well spent comparing to other similar products.</li>
            <li> and it DEFINITELY calmed my skin down.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin-- oily in t-tone but dry in other areas.</li>
            <li> , it was a little bit harder to handle because it kept moving, especially on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Because they are so thin they absorb really well into the skin.</li>
            <li> and I can walk around doing other things.</li>
            <li> I always had difficulty finding time to lie down for 10-15 minutes while I have this on my face, but this product is so convenient because it just sticks to my face</li>
            <li> I had never heard of the brand previously</li>
            <li> I recently have been having crazy breakouts and my skin has been red and inflamed</li>
            <li> This mask was referred to me by a friend and turned out to be a hidden gem!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to leave it on longer than twenty minutes like I do, then you&#x27;ll need to keep the mask moist or else it will become extremely hard, and you&#x27;ll have little pieces of mask stuck all over your face.</li>
            <li> After trying out the papain brightening and exfoliating sheet mask, I saw this product online and bought it to test on my skin that is mostly dry during this cold season.  </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that the moisture might make my oily t-zone worse</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> If you separate the backing from the mask before putting them on your face, the cloth may get tangled and become difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> My face needed it badly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I really enjoy these masks. My skin feels so refreshed and rejuvenated after using the mask. I use it in the mornings before I put on my make up and it gives me a smoother look throughout my day.</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin and need to be careful about the skincare products I use. I’ve always been a little hesitant when trying new things, but my face had been extremely dry and regardless of how much moisturizer I used, I couldn’t retain the necessary moisture in my face. This mask was referred to me by a friend and turned out to be a hidden gem! I would have never stumbled upon this product on my own. The sheet mask fits perfectly and doesn’t feel awkward when wearing it. I also appreciated the fact that there was plenty of product in the packet. My skin didn’t breakout or get red after using the mask- just left it feeling soft and moisturized. I would most definitely suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> They feel amazing on the skin :) when you put them on it stays on the skin and doesnt fall off like some other masks ive tried. I definitley reccomend and will repurchase. The masks arrived on time and intact.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me! Keep my face moistured. I live in San Diego and always worry about my face due to the dryness, but this mask save a lot of work for me and keep my skin soft and tender all day long. love it~</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this mask by my coworker when I worked in Asia last year, and it has become part of my skincare regimen ever since. My face turns super dry and itchy in winter. Among tons of Asian sheet masks I tried, this one works the best to moisturize and repair my skin, helped me get through the winter. The sheet is very thin and comfortable, very easy for the serum to be absorbed. The hyaluronic acid and collagen in the mask are really doing their jobs! I was amazed that how smooth and moist my face feels after first time applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t purchased this on Amazon yet because I brought five packs back from Taiwan. I&#x27;ll definitely come to Amazon when they run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never run into a mask that keeps giving.  There is so much in this product, that I have enough to do my neck, chest, arms and legs.  Wow!  This was recommended to me by the girl that does my eyebrows, they wanted me to get a facial at their shop for $55, instead I came to Amazon and ordered this, and it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing and very hydrating! I always save all the extra serum in the pouch to use it as a moisturizer. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this does not bother me at all. The moisturizing actually relieves my skin allergy symptoms.  You definitely notice a difference when you take it off. If you&#x27;re going to leave it on longer than twenty minutes like I do, then you&#x27;ll need to keep the mask moist or else it will become extremely hard, and you&#x27;ll have little pieces of mask stuck all over your face. I am definitely going to buy these all the time.</li>
            <li> This product really works. It is very easy to use and comes with lots of moisture. I have combination skin-- oily in t-tone but dry in other areas. I felt the change right after using it. The dry flaky parts of my skin are gone. My face feels very juicy and smooth with a healthy glow. I was worried that the moisture might make my oily t-zone worse but it didn&#x27;t. It actually helped to calm the oily parts. I&#x27;m very happy to come across this brand and this mask. It definitely will be part of my beauty regime!</li>
            <li> This box of sheet masks just arrived right on time. My face needed it badly. Since the winter got colder and dryer recently, my skin was so dehydrated and kind of itchy. So once I received this product, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on. The sheet mask fitted my face shape perfectly. Even those areas like chin and upper nose bridge and sides of the nose, it covered them very well. There was load of serum in the pocket with the sheet mask. I loved it because I got so much extra serum to apply all around my neck. After using it, my face is moisturized and hydrated, rashes is almost gone. I will definitely keep using it. It is one great product rarely available in the States. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The mask PERFECTLY FITS the face. I love how my skin feels and looks after applying this mask--so hydrated, smooth and plumped up. There are lots of serum in the package so I use the extra on my neck, arms and legs. All in all I&#x27;m very satisfied with this mask. Will definitely recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> did not see a bit of a change. Not happy.</li>
            <li> These things are so amazing, they make my skin feel so soft and smooth. I defiantly say that anyone that wants some help fixing their skin should buy these.</li>
            <li> These facial masks are always good to replenish moisture. I always had difficulty finding time to lie down for 10-15 minutes while I have this on my face, but this product is so convenient because it just sticks to my face and I can walk around doing other things. It didn&#x27;t fall even when I was bending forward.&lt;br /&gt;My friend gave me the yellow one to use and that one actually had straps to go around your ears and neck. It was made of lace, too! I&#x27;ll get that one next time.&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Always squeeze out the juice and put it all over your body. Don&#x27;t waste that precious juice!&lt;br /&gt;2. The directions and ingredients are written in English, on the outer plastic packaging. Everything is written in Chinese inside, so save that English label.</li>
            <li> I love this mask!!! It&#x27;s really fun and easy to use it, and my skin feels revitalized!!</li>
            <li> I recently have been having crazy breakouts and my skin has been red and inflamed so I purchased this for my dry, irritated skin so it would calm down and hopefully become more hydrated to avoid further inflammation. It&#x27;s full of serum which is awesome, its fun to wear and i do feel like my skin at first did absorb a lot of it and it DEFINITELY calmed my skin down. But I don&#x27;t feel like it hydrated my skin much, if at all, which kind of defeated the purpose. It makes me want to try some more that could actually help my dehydrated skin. I do not think I would repurchase in regards to looking for something to actually truly benefit my skin, but for I do enjoy these for the fun of sheet masks and for the relaxation factor.</li>
            <li> Another favorite Hey! Pinkgo Girl mask of mine (the other being Black Rose Collagen). I alternative between the two masks, depending on how my face is feeling. If it is extra dry, this Triple HA is my go-to. I swear by Hyaluronic Acid because it has helped with my problematic skin (oiliness, some dry pathces and moderate acne). This mask has not made me breakout. It smells yummy and the packaging is too cute! I know, &#x27;why the four stars then?&#x27; Well, I have been using facial masks for a while and compared to the others, it was a little bit harder to handle because it kept moving, especially on my upper lip. But Hey! Pinkgo Girl works just as good and is far cheaper. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love how thin it is! All the good stuffs are absorbed into my skin instead of by thick cloth like some masks I bought before. I used to purchase $8 to $15 for one piece in beauty store. Now I can get the same smooth and moisturized face with a fraction of price. I also love the smell and excess essence!  By the way, because the mask is thin, it’s better to put the backing with cloth on the face together then remove the backing.  If you separate the backing from the mask before putting them on your face, the cloth may get tangled and become difficult to apply. That&#x27;s what happened to me when I first used it. But after I leaned the right way I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li> I like it so much...... and I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> These masks are awesome! I had never heard of the brand previously but I saw the good reviews and decided to buy. The masks are very very thin, cotton material that can easily rip on a fingernail. Because they are so thin they absorb really well into the skin. I use the essence left in the pack for days afterward and my skin is plump and more hydrated. My skin is oily/combo/acne-prone so the light hydration this mask provides works really well for me. I think this would not quite be hydrating enough for folks with dry skin though.</li>
