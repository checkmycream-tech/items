            <li> Smells like old grandma, I was really sad when I got this. I&#x27;d rather fart in a jar and smell that for 5 hours than spray this onto my body again. I wanted to give it away to somebody but I don&#x27;t hate anyone right now so I guess I&#x27;ll be forced to keep this in my house... for now.</li>
            <li> This is another one I tried.  Disappointed with to.  Fragrance must of set around to long.  It smell good for a little bit.  An than nothing.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume the last few years. Love the scent and its not overpowering like others can be.</li>

            <li> Was given this fragrance for a gift last year, and I really liked it, even the lotion--it&#x27;s really nice.  This is in a generous size, and I was running out of my gift bottle, so I was happy to order it.</li>

            <li> I really love this Faith Hill  because it is not real strong and this is the only place that I can get the 1.7oz bottle</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Faith Hill spray eau de toilette and have fallen in love with it. It&#x27;s a gentle scent, ladylike and pleasant to be around.

            <li> I am always on the lookout for deals on Faith Hill perfume. My wife absolutely loves the stuff.  The prices vary widely, so you just have to watch and be patient.</li>
            <li> I have the other two perfumes by Faith Hill and love both of the scents.  However, this just isn&#x27;t my thing.  Perfume is a very personal thing, so this definitely isn&#x27;t a knock on it.  I will say that with the first spray it does smell very strong.</li>
            <li> Old smell I can&#x27;t even put my finger on what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like..loved True and said hey let me try dis this..bad choice..this was da first of like 5 more bad blind buys..it should have been my warning but I kept tryin..lol</li>

            <li> Fast shipping Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She only uses this and one other all the time. Service was great. Only problem is the order was for 1.7 oz. but when package arrived it was only 1.0 oz. Customer service made it right with no problem. I would buy from them again next time.</li>
            <li> when we received the two boxes of perfume looks like they where opened, boxes dirty, no protected covering, they look like store samples. First impression very BAD</li>
            <li> Three words...she loves it! Fast shipping, well packaged and one heck of a great scent.</li>
