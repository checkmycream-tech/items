            <li>Over all the skirt is made nicely &amp; has not shruk or faded after many washing.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, fabric is soft and doesn&#x27;t wrinkle (</li>
            <li>But it looks cute if you&#x27;re shorter.</li>
            <li>It looks cute.</li>
            <li>Comfy, the top band does tend to fold over inside of the fabric, but it&#x27;s not noticeable to anyone</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not terrible).  </li>
            <li>Got more than what I paid for.</li>
            <li>any top will do:)</li>
            <li>The fabric is okay for an 11 dollar skirt.</li>
            <li>but i dont mind i love</li>
            <li>The material is also very rich in quality.</li>
            <li>Good size, I&#x27;m pretty petite and its size is pretty good on me</li>
            <li>, I was surprised to find a very good quality skirt that fit well.</li>
            <li>The skirt is super cute.</li>
            <li>, i look fabulous in it.&lt;br /&gt;Woot.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>if you fit my description i suggest you get a medium, if you dont want to look to provocative.</li>
            <li>It looks like it wont even fit a doll.</li>
            <li>but it is still good quality, and it fits good for people size small to medium</li>
            <li>My new favorite skirt!  </li>
            <li>so it is pretty sure,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything I expect (: super cute super cheap and arrived super fast!</li>
            <li>still a good investment especially if you plan to wear tights with it.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t ever think that it would be super nice especially because it is so cheap</li>
            <li>very firm material, good price. arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>Fit very well!</li>
            <li>I wear a size 3 in jeans and it fit perfect with a little extra room!</li>
            <li>The size fit me very well.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very picky about her cloths and how they fit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
            <li>It is a nice skirt but the one size fits most is not accurate when it comes to length.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super cute, but super short on me</li>
            <li>but this skirt was very tight  and gave me a it f a muffin top and is very light , besides that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a cute skirt, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li>I would never imagine wearing it without some pretty opaque tights (unless it&#x27;s night, I guess).  </li>
            <li>the skirt on the model must be a different skirt because you get one that looks more like the one on the hanger.</li>
            <li>it looks really cute but is super short and cant be worn as a high waist skirt unless you want to show your butt to the world..</li>
            <li>product the elastic is what I really disliked about this product, but I&#x27;m sure for those who are smaller than me and not as curvy  that it&#x27;d be a better fit.</li>
            <li>And the stitching was better than expected.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect anything below the knee haha;</li>
            <li>feel very disppointed.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>omggg im gonna style them soo much</li>
            <li>It really compliments my curves.</li>
            <li>the top band is tight, but not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>but other than being very short it is still really cute!</li>
            <li>Make sure to measure your waist and compare it to the measurements listed in the item description because it only comes in one size but will fit a wide range of people due to the VERY STRETCHY elastic in the waistband.</li>
            <li>But know its not a perfectly clean smooth fabric.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a present for my sister whos 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; but she&#x27;s really skinny.</li>
            <li>The skirt is cute but it just runs very tight and is a tad too short for my liking.</li>
            <li>material is pretty good, it&#x27;s thick, not too thick though.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</li>
            <li>Because I have to wear it so high (around my belly button), It just barely covers my entire butt--</li>
            <li>(so if you were much taller I&#x27;d be careful choosing a size).</li>
            <li>It drapes very well, the material is pretty thick, and the elastic holds up.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wide elastic waistband likes to fold over on itself</li>
            <li> but ones I recieved it in the mail which didnt take long at all</li>
            <li> It fits me well, not as long as depicted in the picture, but being skinny and having long legs, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to.  </li>
            <li> Smaller then expected</li>
            <li> The fabric has a dotted style on it, which I actually don&#x27;t mind it goes well with a lot of sheer and tight tops.</li>
            <li> It is a little short in the back</li>
            <li> But there is something to be said about things that are made in other locations and things that are made in the same locations with intent to send it to America.</li>
            <li> waist is 22 inches, barely, but is elastic, really firm elastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so when I try pulling the skirt down it rises back</li>
            <li> My daughter is only 5&#x27;1&#x27; and has a small frame &amp; this skirt was really short.</li>
            <li> Too thin and not worth to cost so much</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little short and tight.</li>
            <li> and it was still kinda small and short.</li>
            <li> so I was suprised I had such a hard time.</li>
            <li> I really like the skirt for the price, the material is a little weird</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just the slightest bit too tight in the elastic waist band, and I sometimes feel squished in.</li>
            <li> My waist is around 27 inches, and it&#x27;s stretchy, but a little tight.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it, had to give it to my 12 yo little cousin.</li>
            <li> so I have to adjust it every few minutes.</li>
            <li> I guess the only problem is that I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and not as thin as I&#x27;d like to be</li>
            <li> A little small but otherwise alright</li>
            <li> and it was very tight on my waist.</li>
            <li> I usually wear a size 4</li>
            <li> I was plannin on wearing it casually but its to short since it is meant to be along the waist.  </li>
            <li> sorry but the material to this skirt was not what i expected.</li>
            <li> but I mean it is a skater skirt</li>
            <li> but the skirt is seriously just plain ugly.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting out the elastic that&#x27;s around the waist.</li>
            <li> and its very weird material.</li>
            <li> Disappointed at the size:(</li>

            <li> The skirt is cute but it just runs very tight and is a tad too short for my liking.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, fabric is soft and doesn&#x27;t wrinkle (surprising considering it had to. Ship from China!) And the stitching was better than expected. It is very short but since I got it to go with leggings and boots it doesn&#x27;t matter. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wide elastic waistband likes to fold over on itself so I have to adjust it every few minutes. It fits great. I wear a size 4 in jeans for reference. Make sure to measure your waist and compare it to the measurements listed in the item description because it only comes in one size but will fit a wide range of people due to the VERY STRETCHY elastic in the waistband. All in all I&#x27;m very happy and surprisingly impressed... it&#x27;s well worth the price and then some!</li>
            <li> A little small but otherwise alright</li>
            <li> The skirt is nice.It&#x27;s a durable fabric, and fits my tiny waist perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Also, i look fabulous in it.&lt;br /&gt;Woot.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my sister whos 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; but she&#x27;s really skinny. It fits her but it&#x27;s way too short. You would have to wear tights or leggings under it if you don&#x27;t want your butt popping out. But it looks cute if you&#x27;re shorter.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this skirt to be as good as quality as it appeared online but ones I recieved it in the mail which didnt take long at all, I was surprised to find a very good quality skirt that fit well. I will definitely buy again from this brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and of good quality. The size fit me very well. (By the way, I wear size 2-4). It looks cute.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a very nice product.  It fits me well, not as long as depicted in the picture, but being skinny and having long legs, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to.  the top band is tight, but not uncomfortable.  Comfy, the top band does tend to fold over inside of the fabric, but it&#x27;s not noticeable to anyone but you (and even to you it&#x27;s not terrible).  My new favorite skirt!  Got more than what I paid for.</li>
            <li> The skirt is super cute. The picture does not do it justice at all by no means. The material is also very rich in quality. It is a little short in the back but I mean it is a skater skirt so don&#x27;t expect anything below the knee haha; Overall great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expect (: super cute super cheap and arrived super fast! I guess the only problem is that I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and not as thin as I&#x27;d like to be so it&#x27;s a little short and tight.</li>
            <li> I usually wear a size 4 but this skirt was very tight  and gave me a it f a muffin top and is very light , besides that and the fact he waist band bunches up I love it! very cute and is a great piece for dressing up outfits.</li>
            <li> i love it! i always wear it! perfect fit on me! and not that short! matches everything i want to match with! any top will do:)</li>
            <li> Too thin and not worth to cost so much money！&lt;br /&gt;I feel very disppointed.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend to buy this skirt.</li>
            <li> Fit very well! I wear a size 3 in jeans and it fit perfect with a little extra room! defiently reccoment getting !</li>
            <li> so it is pretty sure, if you fit my description i suggest you get a medium, if you dont want to look to provocative. But if thats what youre going for then its a great skirt. I was plannin on wearing it casually but its to short since it is meant to be along the waist.  I would wear it to a club or something. very firm material, good price. arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a cute skirt, isn&#x27;t it? But there is something to be said about things that are made in other locations and things that are made in the same locations with intent to send it to America. I am 5&#x27;6 125 lbs and it was very tight on my waist. I&#x27;m slim so I was suprised I had such a hard time. I ended up cutting out the elastic that&#x27;s around the waist. It&#x27;s still tight. Disappointed at the size:(</li>
            <li> i did not like the skirt. it is definantly not what i was expecting. It looks like it wont even fit a doll. and its very weird material.</li>
            <li> It drapes very well, the material is pretty thick, and the elastic holds up.  My waist is around 27 inches, and it&#x27;s stretchy, but a little tight.  Because I have to wear it so high (around my belly button), It just barely covers my entire butt--I would never imagine wearing it without some pretty opaque tights (unless it&#x27;s night, I guess).  I am 5&#x27;4 and around 140lbs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 5 feet tall and I wear a size zero. It fits perfectly. The fabric is okay for an 11 dollar skirt. The stitching is good.This will not fit tall people though, but the elastic band is very stretchy. Seller was great.</li>
            <li> omggg im gonna style them soo much they are amazingggg beautiful just my size but im 5&#x27;&#x27;7 so its kinda short but i dont mind i love ittt</li>
            <li> My daughter is very picky about her cloths and how they fit. She liked this skirt. no problems with delivery and quality was good. will order again if needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this skirt and it was as described, short. The description says it should be 13.8 inches, mine is 13 inches from the bottom of the elastic to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;No tags were attached.&lt;br /&gt;The waist is 22 inches, barely, but is elastic, really firm elastic.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&#x27;&#x27; and 127 pounds, it&#x27;s super cute, but super short on me (so I wear bike tights under it), and it squeezes my waist (which I expected).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit curvy so when I try pulling the skirt down it rises back up.&lt;br /&gt;The material is pretty good, it&#x27;s thick, not too thick though.&lt;br /&gt;7/10 product the elastic is what I really disliked about this product, but I&#x27;m sure for those who are smaller than me and not as curvy  that it&#x27;d be a better fit.</li>
            <li> I adore this skirt. It really compliments my curves. I have to wear it with leggings exclusively, because its a bit short. It&#x27;s also just the slightest bit too tight in the elastic waist band, and I sometimes feel squished in. My waist is about a 28. I can&#x27;t remember if this was a one size fits all skirt. If I purchased the small/medium, I would certainly go back for a larger size.</li>
            <li> 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; 115 lbs and it was still kinda small and short. I wear these with tights or leggings.</li>
            <li> sorry but the material to this skirt was not what i expected. yeah i didn&#x27;t ever think that it would be super nice especially because it is so cheap but the skirt is seriously just plain ugly.</li>
            <li> the skirt on the model must be a different skirt because you get one that looks more like the one on the hanger. its alot shorter than i thought it be and you can&#x27;t wear it to your waist like a regular skater skirt because its so short.  the materials nice but thats about it for the skirt</li>
            <li> It is a nice skirt but the one size fits most is not accurate when it comes to length. My daughter is only 5&#x27;1&#x27; and has a small frame &amp; this skirt was really short. she had to wear bike shorts under it in order to wear it to school. Over all the skirt is made nicely &amp; has not shruk or faded after many washing.</li>
            <li> skirt is well made with a good fabric but rather short for me (i am 5&#x27;4). still a good investment especially if you plan to wear tights with it.</li>
            <li> Good size, I&#x27;m pretty petite and its size is pretty good on me (so if you were much taller I&#x27;d be careful choosing a size). The fabric has a dotted style on it, which I actually don&#x27;t mind it goes well with a lot of sheer and tight tops. But know its not a perfectly clean smooth fabric. Otherwise its great!</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected</li>
            <li> I really like the skirt for the price, the material is a little weird but it is still good quality, and it fits good for people size small to medium</li>
            <li> Asian sizes are very smaller and are not described in the way we can understand. Don&#x27;t like it, had to give it to my 12 yo little cousin.</li>
            <li> very good product it looks really cute but is super short and cant be worn as a high waist skirt unless you want to show your butt to the world.. but other than being very short it is still really cute!</li>
