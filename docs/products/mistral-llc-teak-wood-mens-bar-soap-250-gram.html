            <li>Great seller,no problems.</li>
            <li>Great soap.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the Sandalwood Bamboo scent over this Teak Wood one, but they&#x27;re both great.</li>
            <li>smell so great.</li>
            <li>Its got a very nice &#x27;wood&#x27; smell to it, but doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a lumberjack after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lathers great and has an amazing scent that fills the bathroom after my shower.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and the soap leaves my skin feeling great.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for someone and it was so good</li>
            <li>These smelled so good that at the party the recipient of these soaps passed them around throughout the party for people to smell.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good bargain and a way to guiltlessly indulge yourself.  </li>
            <li>I smell good.</li>
            <li>But until I used this man soap she&#x27;s never equated me with good odors.</li>
            <li>This is a good soap for cleaning and some moisturizing, but the scented qualities are overrated.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the Sandalwood, in my opinion, smell-wise</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still really good soap.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing on this bar of soap.</li>
            <li>The teak wood scent is fantastic and its great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice soap.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully scented, masculine, and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are soap aficionados and this brand is by far the best we have tried.  </li>
            <li>Great fresh scent</li>
            <li>In my experience all Mistral soaps are made of quality, are not perfumy and provide a good clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel extremely clean and leaves me smelling really good.</li>
            <li>and I only wish they made it in diffusers- that would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Like most, I enjoy nice things.</li>
            <li>I have bought all of their scents and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this bar for about 2 weeks, and love it.</li>
            <li>I notice the smell fades on me within an hour or so (though seems to linger on my hands--probably because they get the most contact with the soap).</li>
            <li>Love the smell and lather of this soap.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li>Would buy more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this brand before in the Sandalwood scent and didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of my husband when he uses this soap.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a healthy aroma and no residue</li>
            <li>The Teak Wood is my favorite, beating out Cedarwood.  </li>
            <li>The Teak Wood is much more fragrant.  </li>
            <li>All the girls that I have been with have truly enjoyed the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>This bar of soap has surpassed all others earning a top spot in my shower.</li>
            <li>I guarantee he will love it....unless he&#x27;s not manly....</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Still doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin as long as would be desired, but an awesome soap by Mistral yet again.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best overall of the Mistral Men&#x27;s soaps available.</li>
            <li>If you want dollar store soap, you wont get anything near as great as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more cologne scented, but this is a good masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>This soap is very masculine and smells so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light woody smell.</li>
            <li>entire bath area smells like this great fragrance.</li>
            <li>i can tell its a quality product just by using it, but that is confirmed by reading the ingredients</li>
            <li>My daughter and daughters in law will surely thank me;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fond of sweet, flowery, &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; scents and this has hit the mark.  </li>
            <li>If, on the other hand, you want to feel &amp; smell great every time you shower, then this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li>I think this is also my new favorite fragrance among the Men&#x27;s Mistral soaps.  </li>
            <li>When you figure how much better and longer lasting Mistral is its more of a bargain than I first thought.</li>
            <li>I would say these bars are worth their price just in longevity alone.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, this is worth trying once</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>I have still been using it trying to get my moneys worth and wittle</li>
            <li>I only gave it four stars because even though it smells nice and lasts a couple of weeks in the shower</li>
            <li>It works very well, smells nice while you use it, and does not have a strong fragrance when you&#x27;re finish, but a nice very subtle scent that leaves no residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>It smells almost like Burberry london, I thought the scent was a bit too powerful at first</li>
            <li>Item as described and fast shipping - recommended!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty hefty bar of soap which will probably last me many weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Id say one bar will last me the better part of 2 months or so.</li>
            <li>The first bar I used was the Teak Wood.  </li>
            <li>Iam sure I wont go back.</li>
            <li>This is the first ever bar of soap that is based with a grape seed oil/extract.</li>
            <li>Great value for the bar size and long lasting</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a great smelling soap and a long lasting one as well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still pretty pricy for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was excellent and due to the high quality it lasted much longer than other bars of comparable size.</li>
            <li>The scent actually lasts for quite some time after the shower, very masculine but very smooth as well.</li>
            <li>This bar is still going strong after a month of daily use.  </li>
            <li>Makes my showers smell terrific, but doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent on me.</li>
            <li>Great smelling soap that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like a lot of other brands.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is because the bar is tripled milled, making the soap very dense.  </li>
            <li>Teak Wood is a close call, I really like the scent but wish it was stronger like the Mistral Sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>It was strange at first as it almost slimy, slimier than any other soap I have used, but it rinses very cleanly and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Its also a pretty large bar, I was surprised at the size and girth.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so much better after a shower than any of the other soaps I have used.</li>
            <li>soap bar is huge and lasts a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every day and am now nearing the end of my second month with more soap still left.  </li>
            <li>decent price.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I could barely smell it at all, even when held up to my nose.  </li>
            <li>And, as mentioned by others, it lasts much longer than you&#x27;d think; it&#x27;s a better value than you might expect, but let&#x27;s still be clear that it is more expensive than standard, non-luxury bars.</li>
            <li>My first foray into luxury soaps, and it has definitely set the &#x27;bar&#x27;.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, so I don&#x27;t know if it will completely replace the Musgo, but the bar itself is quite formidable, and significantly larger than most other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my favorite, Dark Amber is a close second.</li>
            <li>Its a decent sized bar, apparently it smells like Teak Wood which I know nothing about.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting, leaves skin feeling clean and not dried out, and all their fragrances are heavenly.  </li>
            <li>The lather is rich, its vegetable based and doesn&#x27;t really dry my skin the way a bar of Irish Springs or Old Spice would.</li>
            <li>The bar really is a lot bigger than you expect, so you do get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>The engraved label on the soap lasted nearly a month before it wore off.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this was an old bar that had been sitting around at Amazon for some time?  </li>
            <li>In my experience, having naturally oily skin, this works very well for much longer than other &#x27;grocery store&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li>Black Amber actually smells pretty nice, but in my opinion the scent isnt really that hard to tell apart from the generic soap you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars, but my only complaint is that I wish it were packaged better.</li>
            <li>Other than the expensive price, this was a great product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this purchase and the price isn&#x27;t so bad either.</li>
            <li>A bar usually lasts me 3-4 months showering 1-2 times per day, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I typically use Musgo Real, and figured I would give this soap a try.  </li>

            <li> The lather is rich, its vegetable based and doesn&#x27;t really dry my skin the way a bar of Irish Springs or Old Spice would.</li>
            <li> The bar really is a lot bigger than you expect, so you do get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> The engraved label on the soap lasted nearly a month before it wore off.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this was an old bar that had been sitting around at Amazon for some time?  </li>
            <li> In my experience, having naturally oily skin, this works very well for much longer than other &#x27;grocery store&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li> Black Amber actually smells pretty nice, but in my opinion the scent isnt really that hard to tell apart from the generic soap you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but my only complaint is that I wish it were packaged better.</li>
            <li> Other than the expensive price, this was a great product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this purchase and the price isn&#x27;t so bad either.</li>
            <li> A bar usually lasts me 3-4 months showering 1-2 times per day, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I typically use Musgo Real, and figured I would give this soap a try.  </li>
            <li> there you go, in my opinion this soap is good enough not to throw away but not awesome enough for me to use everyday or even on consecutive days.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s quick to tell me when I smell bad and that I better roll down the window</li>
            <li> and I have been buying it consistently for at least the last year.</li>
            <li> although it does not last, unlike the soap that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Remove the bubble wrap, and you will find the bar wrapped in clear cellophane with the black label wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li> The bar&#x27;s physical dimensions are roughly 4\\&quot;x2.5\\&quot;1.5\\&quot;</li>
            <li> how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to last longer being a triple milled soap and over $10 a bar.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase as long as they don&#x27;t change their formula!</li>
            <li> I will definitely try other soaps by Mistral including buying one this again.</li>
            <li> I definitely have to try the other minstrel soaps.</li>
            <li> Other soaps I have used in the past tend to be still damp and not very firm the next day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- smell is masculine but not overwhelming</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the black amber scent next</li>
            <li> After washing and putting the soap on a dish to air out it has always been dry and firm the next day.  </li>
            <li> Black Amber wasn&#x27;t so bad in this regard but when I tried Exotic Vetiver I almost wanted to put it back in the box and just order another bar of the Teak Wood.</li>
            <li> Its a bit on the expensive side but to me its worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the distinctive scent of this soap bar, and it doesn&#x27;t melt away while sitting in the wet shower environment.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying again, and trying a few other scents as well</li>
            <li> The problem I have with the other Mistral Mens soaps is that they are a bit too spicy and old-fashioned which gives them a bit of an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I buy other mistral soaps too and have been working my way through their selection discovering my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the price though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the Black Amber at this point and find that the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- a little pricey for soap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> no more of this .</li>
            <li> In 2 weeks of use, the bar has hardly diminished at all.</li>
            <li> These soap bars are very expensive, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be making this a regular purchase.</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is as described a teak woodsy scent with bergamot and patchouli as subtle notes.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of using soaps like Dial</li>
            <li> Teak Wood just has something about it, it smells expensive and luxurious.   </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a woman who loves this!  I&#x27;m not fond of sweet, flowery, &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; scents and this has hit the mark.  I use it every day and am now nearing the end of my second month with more soap still left.  It has a wonderful scent and I only wish they made it in diffusers- that would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Like most, I enjoy nice things. This is a nice soap. I wait tables for a living. It works very well, smells nice while you use it, and does not have a strong fragrance when you&#x27;re finish, but a nice very subtle scent that leaves no residue on your skin. In my experience, having naturally oily skin, this works very well for much longer than other &#x27;grocery store&#x27; brands. My first foray into luxury soaps, and it has definitely set the &#x27;bar&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Big ole bar of soap AND smells FAN-TAS-TIC!</li>
            <li> Item as described and fast shipping - recommended!</li>
            <li> Lathers great and has an amazing scent that fills the bathroom after my shower.  The scent lingers on my skin for a while afterwards.  This is a pretty hefty bar of soap which will probably last me many weeks of use.  Overall, I am happy with this purchase and the price isn&#x27;t so bad either.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great lather. The bar really is a lot bigger than you expect, so you do get a lot of bang for your buck. I have bought all of their scents and this is my favorite. The Teak Wood scent is a close second.</li>
            <li> I love this bar of soap. It smells almost like Burberry london, I thought the scent was a bit too powerful at first but it is actually perfect. Its also a pretty large bar, I was surprised at the size and girth. I think this is the best overall of the Mistral Men&#x27;s soaps available. The scent actually lasts for quite some time after the shower, very masculine but very smooth as well. Ive gotten lots of compliments about it. The problem I have with the other Mistral Mens soaps is that they are a bit too spicy and old-fashioned which gives them a bit of an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; smell. Black Amber wasn&#x27;t so bad in this regard but when I tried Exotic Vetiver I almost wanted to put it back in the box and just order another bar of the Teak Wood. Black Amber actually smells pretty nice, but in my opinion the scent isnt really that hard to tell apart from the generic soap you can buy at the store. Teak Wood just has something about it, it smells expensive and luxurious.   As for how it treats my skin, I have no complaints. The lather is rich, its vegetable based and doesn&#x27;t really dry my skin the way a bar of Irish Springs or Old Spice would. Id say one bar will last me the better part of 2 months or so. All in all this has been a very good product and I have been buying it consistently for at least the last year. Its a bit on the expensive side but to me its worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are soap aficionados and this brand is by far the best we have tried.  It is long lasting, leaves skin feeling clean and not dried out, and all their fragrances are heavenly.  Will continue to purchase as long as they don&#x27;t change their formula!</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is as described a teak woodsy scent with bergamot and patchouli as subtle notes.  The individual bar was bubbled wrapped, with a white ID tag on the back.  Remove the bubble wrap, and you will find the bar wrapped in clear cellophane with the black label wrapped around it.  The bar&#x27;s physical dimensions are roughly 4\\&quot;x2.5\\&quot;1.5\\&quot; so this will be a big bar in your hands.  Some people may also like the fact the soap also has on the label \\&quot;Not tested on animals\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* 9/7/2013 -- This bar is still going strong after a month of daily use.  After washing and putting the soap on a dish to air out it has always been dry and firm the next day.  Other soaps I have used in the past tend to be still damp and not very firm the next day.  I believe this is because the bar is tripled milled, making the soap very dense.  The engraved label on the soap lasted nearly a month before it wore off.  The scent has started to weaken some after a month, but it is still noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* 12/31/2013 --  The first bar I used was the Teak Wood.  That bar as reviewed above lasted just about two months.  I used another bar from the gift pact, the Sandalwood Bamboo and that bar lasted almost three months.  So all and all I would say these bars are worth their price just in longevity alone.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The scent is amazing and the soap leaves my skin feeling great.  No dryness with this soap and the bar seems to last longer than the soap I used to use (dove).</li>
            <li> These soap bars are very expensive, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be making this a regular purchase. I&#x27;ve been using this bar for about 2 weeks, and love it. It smells awesome, and leaves my bathroom smelling great after a shower. I notice the smell fades on me within an hour or so (though seems to linger on my hands--probably because they get the most contact with the soap). It&#x27;s a light woody smell. In 2 weeks of use, the bar has hardly diminished at all. The lettering stamped into the face of the soap hasn&#x27;t dissipated. I fully expect to get a lot of use out of this bar. I did get a soap rack to store this bar, so that it dries between use, extending it&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift to a dad, brother, husband, etc. I bought it for myself, but may put it on future wish lists.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using soaps like Dial so thought I would splurge and try Mistral.After using it for a couple of months Iam sure I wont go back.When you figure how much better and longer lasting Mistral is its more of a bargain than I first thought.It makes me feel so much better after a shower than any of the other soaps I have used.</li>
            <li> Great seller,no problems.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing on this bar of soap. Its earthy and woodsy and mellow, yet it&#x27;s scent helps  your senses awaken in the shower. This is the first ever bar of soap that is based with a grape seed oil/extract. It was strange at first as it almost slimy, slimier than any other soap I have used, but it rinses very cleanly and I enjoy using it. I will definitely be buying again, and trying a few other scents as well</li>
            <li> Love the smell and lather of this soap.  I will definitely try other soaps by Mistral including buying one this again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap. Would buy more but my wife insists on couponing to get me soap.</li>
            <li> This is the scent for me.  I&#x27;ve tried this brand before in the Sandalwood scent and didn&#x27;t love it.  Tried the Teak and it smells wonderful.  Great soap.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of my husband when he uses this soap.  I gave him a bar last year as a gift, and he recently used it up, so. . .I bought him another one and one for all the men in my life!  My daughter and daughters in law will surely thank me;-)</li>
            <li> This soap is very masculine and smells so good. I would have given it 5 stars, but my only complaint is that I wish it were packaged better. Other than that I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Other than the expensive price, this was a great product. The fragrance was excellent and due to the high quality it lasted much longer than other bars of comparable size. When I can afford another $10 bar or soap I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> If you want a budget soap bar, look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you want to feel &amp; smell great every time you shower, then this is the soap for you. And, as mentioned by others, it lasts much longer than you&#x27;d think; it&#x27;s a better value than you might expect, but let&#x27;s still be clear that it is more expensive than standard, non-luxury bars. If nothing else, this is worth trying once and seeing what you think. I do prefer the Sandalwood Bamboo scent over this Teak Wood one, but they&#x27;re both great.</li>
            <li> Mistral soaps are the best I have used.  Great value for the bar size and long lasting aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My entire bath area smells like this great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and it was so good I went out and bought one in every scent for myself. I don&#x27;t bathe with them, I stick them in my drawers with my clothing and my clothes smell so great. These smelled so good that at the party the recipient of these soaps passed them around throughout the party for people to smell.</li>
            <li> In my experience all Mistral soaps are made of quality, are not perfumy and provide a good clean feeling.  What separates a four star vote and a five star vote in my case is the scent and how long it lasts.  Teak Wood is a close call, I really like the scent but wish it was stronger like the Mistral Sandalwood.  I still think it performs well and will buy it again when I want to rotate different Mistral scents.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Not worth the price though. Lasted about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> A repurchase of a gift I received. Wonderful soap for guys.</li>
            <li> no more of this . Two baths smell gone</li>
            <li> This is a massive bar that will last about a month with daily use. It leaves a healthy aroma and no residue</li>
            <li> I have used the Mistral Cedarwood Marine, the Sandalwood Bamboo, and now the Teak Wood.  The Teak Wood is my favorite, beating out Cedarwood.  The Teak Wood is much more fragrant.  It seems to be more cologne scented, but this is a good masculine scent.  Still doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin as long as would be desired, but an awesome soap by Mistral yet again.</li>
            <li> Great fresh scent although it does not last, unlike the soap that lasts a long time.  I think it is a good bargain and a way to guiltlessly indulge yourself.  I will reorder.</li>
            <li> This is a great bar and the smell is wonderful, fills the bathroom with the scent. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully scented, masculine, and leaves my skin feeling good. I&#x27;ve tried several scents and this is probably my favorite, Dark Amber is a close second. A bar usually lasts me 3-4 months showering 1-2 times per day, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My wife has told me twice that I smell good. She&#x27;s never done that before. She&#x27;s quick to tell me when I smell bad and that I better roll down the window or she&#x27;s jumping out of the car. But until I used this man soap she&#x27;s never equated me with good odors.</li>
            <li> This soap smells awesome!  The teak wood scent is fantastic and its great on my skin.  Con is that it lasted only 14 days.  I expected it to last longer being a triple milled soap and over $10 a bar.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to get in the shower every days!!</li>
            <li> Makes me feel extremely clean and leaves me smelling really good. All the girls that I have been with have truly enjoyed the smell of this soap. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great smelling soap and a long lasting one as well. Worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> A French soap for a manly Man? Indeed.  It&#x27;s a big bar of soap.  It lathers really well.  It has a manly teakwood smell (but not overpowering).  This bar of soap has surpassed all others earning a top spot in my shower.</li>
            <li> decent price. it did ship on time so no problems there. I buy other mistral soaps too and have been working my way through their selection discovering my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of them. Its a decent sized bar, apparently it smells like Teak Wood which I know nothing about. I have discovered that i personally am not a fan of teak wood. nothing wrong with it -just not my favorite. I have still been using it trying to get my moneys worth and wittle it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go, in my opinion this soap is good enough not to throw away but not awesome enough for me to use everyday or even on consecutive days.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap for cleaning and some moisturizing, but the scented qualities are overrated.  After the first use, I could barely smell it at all, even when held up to my nose.  Perhaps this was an old bar that had been sitting around at Amazon for some time?  I&#x27;ve also tried the Black Amber at this point and find that the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Sandalwood, in my opinion, smell-wise but it&#x27;s still really good soap.  It&#x27;s a big honking bar too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap, it smells wonderful on him. I&#x27;ll purchase this type again.</li>
            <li> I think this is also my new favorite fragrance among the Men&#x27;s Mistral soaps.  Makes my showers smell terrific, but doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent on me.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell but once I rinse my hands it&#x27;s almost entirely gone. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it lingered a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I typically use Musgo Real, and figured I would give this soap a try.  Its got a very nice &#x27;wood&#x27; smell to it, but doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a lumberjack after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quite possibly one of the nicer soaps I have ever used.  A bit pricey, so I don&#x27;t know if it will completely replace the Musgo, but the bar itself is quite formidable, and significantly larger than most other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I definitely have to try the other minstrel soaps.</li>
            <li> I like the distinctive scent of this soap bar, and it doesn&#x27;t melt away while sitting in the wet shower environment.  I&#x27;d give it 5-stars if the price was lower...I may order again if I see it on buy-one-get-another at 50% off, etc.</li>
            <li> Great smelling soap that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like a lot of other brands.  The bar tends to last awhile as well. I only gave it four stars because even though it smells nice and lasts a couple of weeks in the shower, it&#x27;s still pretty pricy for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Really great soap! Can&#x27;t wait to try the black amber scent next&lt;br /&gt;- soap bar is huge and lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;- smell is masculine but not overwhelming ( my gf just loves it)&lt;br /&gt;- i can tell its a quality product just by using it, but that is confirmed by reading the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- a little pricey for soap, but you get what you pay for. If you want dollar store soap, you wont get anything near as great as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for a gift for your husband or boyfriend.  I guarantee he will love it....unless he&#x27;s not manly....</li>
