            <li>You have to apply 2x a day which most is only 1x day.  </li>
            <li>Fast &amp; product works!</li>
            <li>Several unbiased sites list Protege EmbelLash as a top choice</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this to review and have to say I would definitely buy this product again for sure.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was luckily offered this product for the purposes of honest and unbiased testing and reviewing - and it has proven to be a huge game changer.</li>
            <li>This product has more staying power than the last lash serum I used and the price is just as much.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product consistently for about 2 and a half weeks now and have noticed my lashes are thicker and are curling on their own at the tips.  </li>

            <li>Easy to use and apply (very similar to</li>
            <li>My eyes are super sensitive after putting it on</li>
            <li>In vested in Smart Brow which shows off  your eyebrows if you have them.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made my lashes huge, but they are a big longer.</li>
            <li>and you really couldn&#x27;t see them without a ton of mascara.</li>
            <li>Since using EmbelLash her lashes are fuller and thicker and very noticeable even without mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not seeing much results at all</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if this product worked.</li>
            <li>; Thanks a lot Protege&#x27;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who has over-plucked their eye brows!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY HURT MY EYES, I COUNLDN&#x27;T USE AS DIRECTED,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked into eyelash extensions, eyelash weaving and false eyelashes but after research, none of those looked like great options to me</li>
            <li>yes it did what it said it would, but  i have had much better results with other products.</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical of this product, but am happy to report that I can tell a difference in the fullness of my lashes after using it.</li>
            <li>This is a must-have product if you have super short and/or straight eyelashes like I do.</li>
            <li>More natural appearance than fake eyelashes and looks absolutely amazing with mascara&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is absolutely true if you use the product as instructed (twice a day every day) after about 3 weeks I visually saw results..</li>
            <li>(Talika) and will probably go back to that one simply because I like the mascara type applicator better and this product has the eyeliner type applicator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve considered temporary eyelash extensions and even Latisse, but the high price tags for these items always turned me off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had High expectations for this one as well.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Eyelash Growth.</li>
            <li>so many eye lash grow products &amp; I tried this after when I finished what I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;First, I asked them if it&#x27;s normal to have little stinging/ burning sensation after you put on.</li>
            <li>After she stopped her lids returned to their normal tone and all irritation disappeared.</li>
            <li>They had, in fact sent me an email with detailed instructions which had gone to one of my other email tabs.  </li>
            <li>Even at the huge &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34;, this product is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay more for a product with integrity than save a few bucks!</li>
            <li>After menopause, over the past few years, I have experienced a lot of hair thinning on my brows and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>it made my lashes thinker and  only a little bit longer it took a full 6 weeks to really see much difference.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a little over 3 weeks now; the first 1 1/2 weeks did not yield significant results, but since then, there have been definite improvements to the length of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair with very light and thin eyelashes and have used this product daily now for over 60 days.</li>
            <li>Made from all natural ingredients, EmbelLash does not contain Parabens, Sulfates or Phthalates.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for 6 weeks (it only lasted that much).</li>
            <li>No irritation despite my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Naturally you have all the inhibitions of trying products on to yourself.</li>
            <li>so I started looking for something with natural ingredience that could give me fuller eyelashes and brows.  </li>
            <li>I tend to be sensitive to products</li>
            <li>4 stars are from the experience I&#x27;ve had with this company so far.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is blonde and fair complected and her lashes were blonde and thin</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone my age who wants their lashes/brows back!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using it on my eyebrows and they are starting to fill in slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>The directions are vary clear daily for about 6 weeks to see results,  guess what it does  give you results</li>
            <li>I have been using Embellash for 6 weeks and my lashes and brows that were missing are growing back very rapidly, and my existing lashes are much longer.  </li>
            <li>My lower lashes were barely visible and now I see them.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients or not, Embellash simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>In contrast, the cheaper drugstore product &amp;#34;Rimmel London Lash Accelerator,&amp;#34; sold in CVS&#x27;s makeup section, produced markedly thicker, noticeable lashes in only two months of regular use.  </li>
            <li>It feels same as similar growth serums,  spicy and stingy in the eye -  which it&#x27;s supposed to be,  just got to be careful when applying to not get it in the eye and if you do,  first try lightly closing it,  if that makes it worse just wash it off.</li>
            <li>my once beautiful, long, thick lashes and brows are really starting to thin out.  </li>
            <li>The service rep was very knowledgable and ended her conversation to say if for any reason I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with the results all I needed to do is contact them for a complete refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell how much I&#x27;ve used so far</li>

            <li> No irritation despite my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Naturally you have all the inhibitions of trying products on to yourself.</li>
            <li> so I started looking for something with natural ingredience that could give me fuller eyelashes and brows.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be sensitive to products</li>
            <li> 4 stars are from the experience I&#x27;ve had with this company so far.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is blonde and fair complected and her lashes were blonde and thin</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone my age who wants their lashes/brows back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it on my eyebrows and they are starting to fill in slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> The directions are vary clear daily for about 6 weeks to see results,  guess what it does  give you results</li>
            <li> I have been using Embellash for 6 weeks and my lashes and brows that were missing are growing back very rapidly, and my existing lashes are much longer.  </li>
            <li> My lower lashes were barely visible and now I see them.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients or not, Embellash simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> In contrast, the cheaper drugstore product &amp;#34;Rimmel London Lash Accelerator,&amp;#34; sold in CVS&#x27;s makeup section, produced markedly thicker, noticeable lashes in only two months of regular use.  </li>
            <li> It feels same as similar growth serums,  spicy and stingy in the eye -  which it&#x27;s supposed to be,  just got to be careful when applying to not get it in the eye and if you do,  first try lightly closing it,  if that makes it worse just wash it off.</li>
            <li> my once beautiful, long, thick lashes and brows are really starting to thin out.  </li>
            <li> The service rep was very knowledgable and ended her conversation to say if for any reason I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with the results all I needed to do is contact them for a complete refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell how much I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li> but I havent been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> The first one left a dark area on my lash line after just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> After getting individual lash extensions for the past 2 years, it was time to go back to my natural lashes, which had become short and stubby.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but it takes a long time.</li>
            <li> The wand is decently long too like a mascara wand.  </li>
            <li> The tube lasts a long time, even using it on my eyelashes and brows.</li>
            <li> With mascara on, my lashes are almost as long as with the falsies.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a very very mild stinging sensation on a few occasions -not unlike the feelings of tired eye...</li>
            <li> I have since discontinued this product as well as all of the other Protege products I have tried and will continue to use my DHC Eyelash Tonic only.</li>
            <li> No irratation, and applied twice daily am &amp; pm with her other Protege products.  </li>
            <li> Crusty when dry.</li>
            <li> just a week later I&#x27;m already quarter of a bottle down.  </li>
            <li> I applied this product twice a day for four weeks, than cut it down to only using it once at night.</li>
            <li> But i was disappointed and left wanting more.</li>
            <li> I see little improvement and plan on making my 2nd order just to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> Have now used for one month with absolutely no improvement</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago, and kept forgetting to use it not really thinking it would work like it does.  </li>
            <li> not anything alarming</li>
            <li> However it does has have a yellow tint with small granules in the product, undesirable for applying makeup after it.</li>
            <li> (I only use a small amount, as directed, though).  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Embellash, as I was recommended it by a friend who said that unlike other lash enhancers, your lashes with this one stay forever (even after you quit using the product).  </li>
            <li> more than 4 weeks ..not  difference ....:(</li>
            <li> I have never used any other product</li>
            <li> I have used other lash enhancers and never had this problem.</li>
            <li> I went on line and found a tutorial and some other information then gave them a call.  </li>
            <li> My only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the last shipment the tube was broken.  </li>
            <li> but I feel that there has been a lightning of my complexion, my dark spots have gotten lighter.</li>
            <li> This serum is not an overnight miracle worker, so results will definitely take at least a couple of weeks&lt;</li>
            <li> I have slight irritation from time to time</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d guess about half the tube.  </li>
            <li> and I do think my lashes are a little longer and fuller.  </li>
            <li> It was just in a very small 1/2 inch square by approx 3in long box.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell the difference on my eye lash growth, disappointing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time and money.</li>
            <li> I am 55 blonde hair thin eyebrows, so thin only get them shaped and waxed every 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It had a strange odor that isn&#x27;t offensive but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> After a month and half this product has done nothing!  </li>
            <li> Which sucks,  my other one lasted 4 months.  </li>
            <li> I think it may be due to thick texture of this brand.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to see the results but you won&#x27;t be disappointed and worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I was at first disappointed that absolutely no detailed instructions came with it.  </li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Small bottle, so although this eyelash growth serum does in fact work, you might not see maximum results by the time your bottle runs out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand in the past</li>
            <li> but at least I can use it.  </li>
            <li> I used this product regularly for six months, and saw absolutely no change or improvement whatsoever, plus it caused an irritated, itchy feeling at the base of the eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The product size is very small and</li>
            <li> but when I apply this product to my eyelids it seriously burns as if there was something spicy on it.</li>
            <li> This is unfortunate, because $30 is not cheap.</li>
            <li> Waste of money indeed!!!</li>
            <li> Did not find it irritating like some reviews described; however did not work for me.</li>
            <li> To apply you just swipe it across the base of your upper eyelashes like you</li>
            <li> and she unfortunately had a negative reaction.</li>
            <li> This product clumped and flaked on the lashes and lids, which became worse when applying any of my primers, BB creams, and CC creams</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a dramatic change, but I was expecting something.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> but my eyes are never irritated or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is really bad and burns my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> oh so expensive!!  </li>
            <li> Brush into the base of eyebrows too if they are over plucked or just sparse.  </li>
            <li> Burns your eyes something awful.</li>
            <li> Desperate!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time and money. Have now used for one month with absolutely no improvement</li>
            <li> Yes ladies, my eyelashes are longer and stronger after 5 weeks of use at nightime religiously.  However it does has have a yellow tint with small granules in the product, undesirable for applying makeup after it. (If need be). Crusty when dry.</li>
            <li> So Cool that this works.  BUT You have to use it.  The directions are vary clear daily for about 6 weeks to see results,  guess what it does  give you results I have been a faithful user for about 5/6 weeks and can notice a change in my eyebrows for sure.  I am 55 blonde hair thin eyebrows, so thin only get them shaped and waxed every 2 months.  In vested in Smart Brow which shows off  your eyebrows if you have them.  Otherwise it looks like paint on your brows.  I use a primer on my face and eyes, and brows, before applying my brow color.  And I now have growth to color big difference.  I bought this months ago, and kept forgetting to use it not really thinking it would work like it does.  This is a great CO.  There eye cream is great to.  I only use 1 times daily let dry before i hit the pillow,  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many Products and I can say none have worked as good as protege and the price is cheap .</li>
            <li> I have been using Embellash for a few months now and my daughter really wanted to try it so I got this for her. She has been using it for about a month now and she is very pleased with the results so far. My daughter is blonde and fair complected and her lashes were blonde and thin and you really couldn&#x27;t see them without a ton of mascara. Since using EmbelLash her lashes are fuller and thicker and very noticeable even without mascara.&lt;br /&gt;She is just as pleased if not more pleased with the results than I am! She has already said she expects EmbelLash in her stocking every Christmas! I will not have to worry about what to get her on special occasions anymore! EmbelLash has become a permanent part of our daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest ad unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell the difference on my eye lash growth, disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times and I LOVE it.  I have used Latisse in the past, but oh so expensive!!  My only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the last shipment the tube was broken.  It wasn&#x27;t the way Amazon packaged it but looked like a manufacturing error.  The replacement isn&#x27;t quite right either but at least I can use it.  I am diligent to apply 2 times a day which is what is recommended.  I have had NO eye irritation at all.  Overall, a great product for the price!!  Will continue to purchase and use</li>
            <li> I guess like some reviewers have noted, it either works or doesn&#x27;t. Did not find it irritating like some reviews described; however did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Burns your eyes something awful.</li>
            <li> I have been using it only for a short time now and i can already see some kind of difference. I see my lashes growing and they never grow. Im just so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Not giving up hope just yet. I see little improvement and plan on making my 2nd order just to give it a chance. Desperate!!!</li>
            <li> Burns the eyes if you get ANY in them.  Not seeing much results at all</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but it takes a long time. I&#x27;ve been putting it on every night for 3 months, and there is a bit of improvement. When you first start using it, it BURNS. Even after 3 months of using it, it still burns sometimes. It hasn&#x27;t made my lashes huge, but they are a big longer. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my bottom lashes too but those haven&#x27;t gotten any longer. Overall it&#x27;s a good product if you keep to it for a while and have patience.</li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s so many eye lash grow products &amp; I tried this after when I finished what I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;First, I asked them if it&#x27;s normal to have little stinging/ burning sensation after you put on. I never got answers back.&lt;br /&gt;I continue use for last 3wks But no improve nor lash grew as they say</li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancer works great!  It is easy to apply, and I have never had a problem with clumping or any disturbance to my mascara. (I only use a small amount, as directed, though).  I am 62 and my once beautiful, long, thick lashes and brows are really starting to thin out.  I decided to try Embellash, as I was recommended it by a friend who said that unlike other lash enhancers, your lashes with this one stay forever (even after you quit using the product).  I am so glad that I followed her recommendations.  I have been using Embellash for 6 weeks and my lashes and brows that were missing are growing back very rapidly, and my existing lashes are much longer.  I only wish that I would have taken before and after pictures as instructed.  I feel so confident now, and beautiful, thanks to EmbelLASH.  I definitely recommend this to anyone my age who wants their lashes/brows back!</li>
            <li> been using this product .for more than 4 weeks ..not  difference ....:(</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are rather sparse. In addition, I also seem to lose a lot of them when removing my mascara. I was pretty skeptical of this product, but am happy to report that I can tell a difference in the fullness of my lashes after using it. I will continue to use this to maintain the increased growth. Sample provided to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> EmbelLASH Lash and Brow Enhancer by Protege Beauty is so easy to use.  The brush applicator wand comes in the cap.  The wand is decently long too like a mascara wand.  So it is easy to hold.  To apply you just swipe it across the base of your upper eyelashes like you are apply eyeliner along the lashline.  So easy.  Brush into the base of eyebrows too if they are over plucked or just sparse.  Made from all natural ingredients, EmbelLash does not contain Parabens, Sulfates or Phthalates.  It should be another couple more weeks before I start receiving results, but I feel like my lashes already look fuller.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results.  This tube has enough product to last 8 weeks. I received this product to try out in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely true if you use the product as instructed (twice a day every day) after about 3 weeks I visually saw results.. Thicker eyelashes! I have never used any other product and I don&#x27;t think I have to.. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It feels same as similar growth serums,  spicy and stingy in the eye -  which it&#x27;s supposed to be,  just got to be careful when applying to not get it in the eye and if you do,  first try lightly closing it,  if that makes it worse just wash it off. The product size is very small and just a week later I&#x27;m already quarter of a bottle down.  Which sucks,  my other one lasted 4 months.  I think it may be due to thick texture of this brand.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this product. I had been wearing lash extensions for 3 years and 3,800.00 later. OUCH! I decided to divorce that situation. So I have been using Embel for 31/2 weeks and YES I see results! My lower lashes were barely visible and now I see them. I have been applying it to my brows and they are darker and filling in nicely. I still have the extensions on so I cannot see my upper lashes (which are probably very,very short) at this time. I would give it 5 stars but I havent been using it long enough. I have slight irritation from time to time but I also have that with makeup remover. I will continue to use and recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try to regrow over-plucked eyebrows. I saw hair regrowth in a couple if weeks. It had a strange odor that isn&#x27;t offensive but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work for me.  I used it religiously as directed for 6 weeks on eyelashes and brows, just did not see any hair growth.</li>
            <li> Your product says about six weeks before you see results, I haven’t taken any pictures but I feel that there has been a lightning of my complexion, my dark spots have gotten lighter.</li>
            <li> I order the Eyelash growth I got this product instead. I am very dissapointed</li>
            <li> EmbellLASH did not work for me. After using the entire tube I did not notice any difference from before I started. So, for me, this product is only a 1 star.  The company, Protege, should get 5 stars!  They contacted me to follow my progress in using the product and when it didn&#x27;t work for me issued a refund promptly.</li>
            <li> This product did NOTHING to my eyelashes and eyebrows. I used it twice a day for 6 weeks (it only lasted that much). I am very dissatisfied, never buying this again! Waste of money indeed!!!</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product if you have super short and/or straight eyelashes like I do. I&#x27;ve considered temporary eyelash extensions and even Latisse, but the high price tags for these items always turned me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was luckily offered this product for the purposes of honest and unbiased testing and reviewing - and it has proven to be a huge game changer. I have used this product for a little over 3 weeks now; the first 1 1/2 weeks did not yield significant results, but since then, there have been definite improvements to the length of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Much more affordable than Latisse and extensions&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use and apply (very similar to eyeliner)&lt;br /&gt;- Improves the length and fullness of lashes within a couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;- More natural appearance than fake eyelashes and looks absolutely amazing with mascara&lt;br /&gt;- No irritation despite my highly sensitive skin. I once got some into my eyes, but it did not hurt even though I wear contacts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This serum is not an overnight miracle worker, so results will definitely take at least a couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;- Small bottle, so although this eyelash growth serum does in fact work, you might not see maximum results by the time your bottle runs out</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this product worked. I didn&#x27;t use it as recommended- I think it was 2x a day. When I used it, It seeped into my eyes after a couple minutes. It burns which&lt;br /&gt;Made my eyes water which made it seep into eyes even more to make my eyes water more and so on. I have used other lash enhancers and never had this problem. I haven&#x27;t used this in a couple of weeks and probably will not use it again.</li>
            <li> I have used other lash growth products and have loved the results! I had High expectations for this one as well.  But i was disappointed and left wanting more. YES  it made my lashes thinker and  only a little bit longer it took a full 6 weeks to really see much difference.  You have to apply 2x a day which most is only 1x day.  It irritated my eyelids a bit and  would build up on my lashes so i had to  wash my eyes before makeup was applied or else it would look like  i had sleepers in my eye. yes it did what it said it would, but  i have had much better results with other products.</li>
            <li> This Eyelash Growth is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;This has made my lashes fuller and longer and also helped fill in some thinner spots on my brows. It does take a while to see the results but you won&#x27;t be disappointed and worth the wait.The tube lasts a long time, even using it on my eyelashes and brows. I have had no reactions at all. I will be hanging on to this product for a long time and very happy. I would highly recommend this Eyelash Growth.This was based with my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; product works! Have used it since 11/17/14 TRULY Amazing! My Brow tail ends disappeared from a low thyroid issue . I got meds in Oct. but brows weren&#x27;t growing back. So I bought this on Amazon . I&#x27;ve rubbed In to my Brows , 2x a day. MY BROW TAILS GREW BACK ! NOW they R thickening!. EVEN GREW in spots , 20 yrs ago were over plucked. No BS... This WORKS!</li>
            <li> As a woman going thru menopause, add thinning eyelashes to the list of crappy stuff you have to go thru.  This has made a huge difference.  My eyes are super sensitive after putting it on I feel a tingle but my eyes are never irritated or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she unfortunately had a negative reaction. She tried the product for 5 days and noticed it burned upon application on her lids (she did not get any in her actual eyes). It ended up making her lower lids constantly red and irritated, so she had to stop using it. After she stopped her lids returned to their normal tone and all irritation disappeared. She must have been allergic to one, or a number, of the ingredients. This is unfortunate, because $30 is not cheap. Glad it worked for others though.</li>
            <li> After a month and half this product has done nothing!  No increase in length.  Even at the huge &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34;, this product is not worth the money.  I will see now if the &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; is legit - as I am seeking to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it two stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it faithfully but I think my lashes are healthier.</li>
            <li> after using it for about 3 weeks, my lashes are growing longer and thicker. I&#x27;m also using it on my eyebrows and they are starting to fill in slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give zero stars on this product after I had to triple check my &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; pics. My BEFORE lashes look longer and thicker than the AFTER pictures I took! I applied this product twice a day for four weeks, than cut it down to only using it once at night. This product clumped and flaked on the lashes and lids, which became worse when applying any of my primers, BB creams, and CC creams - this product does NOT work well with make-up at all. I have since discontinued this product as well as all of the other Protege products I have tried and will continue to use my DHC Eyelash Tonic only.</li>
            <li> Love it seen resolves in 4days</li>
            <li> Naturally you have all the inhibitions of trying products on to yourself. But you will not know anything unless you try.&lt;br /&gt;I am very very glad and wonderful that I DID TRIED THIS PROTEGE&#x27; EmbelLASH!&lt;br /&gt;It works to wonder!!! It made my eyelashes grow thicker, fuller and most of all longer! I noticed some of my co workers are staring at my eyes that they never did before. It feels like they are wanting to ask how and why. But once they ask, I would be proud to say &amp;#34;Protege&#x27; EmbelLASH is the ONLY answer!&amp;#34; Thanks a lot Protege&#x27; EmbelLASH for a 10× confidence!!!</li>
            <li> This is really bad and burns my eyes.  Does nothing for my eyelashes. Use rapid lash instead. I threw this in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as instructed for over a month. Nothing... I wasn&#x27;t expecting a dramatic change, but I was expecting something. I followed the directions from day one and have come to the conclusion that this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Oh well, on to the next product. I know there is one out there that works, but it&#x27;s not this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I do think my lashes are a little longer and fuller.  I can see them more w/out mascara now.  It&#x27;s hard to tell how much I&#x27;ve used so far but I&#x27;d guess about half the tube.  I&#x27;ve used another brand in the past (Talika) and will probably go back to that one simply because I like the mascara type applicator better and this product has the eyeliner type applicator.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Eyelashes are growing very quickly!</li>
            <li> having very short Asian eyelashes i have always wanted something that will make my lashes appear fuller and longer.  I have been using this product consistently for about 2 and a half weeks now and have noticed my lashes are thicker and are curling on their own at the tips.  I&#x27;m satisfied and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> After menopause, over the past few years, I have experienced a lot of hair thinning on my brows and eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve looked into eyelash extensions, eyelash weaving and false eyelashes but after research, none of those looked like great options to me so I started looking for something with natural ingredience that could give me fuller eyelashes and brows.  Several unbiased sites list Protege EmbelLash as a top choice so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be editing this review after the five weeks it says it takes for it to work along with before and after eye shots.  When I received the product  I was at first disappointed that absolutely no detailed instructions came with it.  It was just in a very small 1/2 inch square by approx 3in long box.  I went on line and found a tutorial and some other information then gave them a call.  They had, in fact sent me an email with detailed instructions which had gone to one of my other email tabs.  The service rep was very knowledgable and ended her conversation to say if for any reason I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with the results all I needed to do is contact them for a complete refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be editing this review to share my experience once five weeks has passed ( the timeframe they recommend).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience to date:  I&#x27;ve applied it for five days now.  I tend to be sensitive to products so I was concerned about a reaction but haven&#x27;t had any yet...yeah!  I have noticed a very very mild stinging sensation on a few occasions -not unlike the feelings of tired eye...not anything alarming and it doesn&#x27;t last.  I do hope the product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 4 stars are from the experience I&#x27;ve had with this company so far.  Their customer service so far has been outstanding!</li>
            <li> This product has performed as advertised for me. After getting individual lash extensions for the past 2 years, it was time to go back to my natural lashes, which had become short and stubby. They stubbornly refused to grow back. I&#x27;m sure part of that was perception after having the glorious  lashes for so long.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second brand I tried and the one I will be using from now on. The first one left a dark area on my lash line after just a few days of use. This one does not, and it works much better. My lashes are thicker, stronger, and longer. I am very pleased with the product and have already bought a refill. With mascara on, my lashes are almost as long as with the falsies. That DID take about 6 weeks to happen, so be patient and apply it religiously morning and night.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who absolutly loves it and now her friends want some also.  Protege really has some great products that really work.  They are for my daughters, and that is what matters most to me.  Even though they are adults now they are always my babies.  No irratation, and applied twice daily am &amp; pm with her other Protege products.  This is my own honest &amp; unbiased review of this great Product.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my sixth week using the product . I applied it twice a day every day and have yet to see a difference . Disappointed</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this to review and have to say I would definitely buy this product again for sure.    I have light blonde hair with very light and thin eyelashes and have used this product daily now for over 60 days. My lashes are so much more healthy, longer and thicker!! It&#x27;s so much easier to make my eyelashes look great when applying mascara and I have no issues anymore of eyelashes falling out when I remove my makeup or anything.  I absolutely love this product and would highly recommend it. I have used eyelash growth products in the past and this product is the best for a great price. Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This product has more staying power than the last lash serum I used and the price is just as much. I also noticed a difference within 3 days of administering the product to my eyebrows, but my eyelashes took about a week. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has over-plucked their eye brows! Note to Emblash: Please do not ever change your formula to &amp;#34;cut corners&amp;#34; like some beauty products sellers have done. I would rather pay more for a product with integrity than save a few bucks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but when I apply this product to my eyelids it seriously burns as if there was something spicy on it.</li>
            <li> The product itself seems good however the bottle it was in broke cuz the wand got glued to the vial by the product and it dried out very rapidly after that. Was a bummer...</li>
            <li> IT REALLY HURT MY EYES, I COUNLDN&#x27;T USE AS DIRECTED, BECUASE IT IRRITATED MY EYES SO I REGRET  I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  I used this product regularly for six months, and saw absolutely no change or improvement whatsoever, plus it caused an irritated, itchy feeling at the base of the eyelashes.  In contrast, the cheaper drugstore product &amp;#34;Rimmel London Lash Accelerator,&amp;#34; sold in CVS&#x27;s makeup section, produced markedly thicker, noticeable lashes in only two months of regular use.  Natural ingredients or not, Embellash simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
