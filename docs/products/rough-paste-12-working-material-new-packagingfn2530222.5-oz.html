            <li>This paste really holds my hair great, I have spiked hair and it does the job.</li>
            <li>I love that it provides all-day hold while remaining a bit malleable, so you can make adjustments over the course of the day.  </li>

            <li>It gives your hair a lot of volume and a more defined look.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;can&#x27;t get a better product or better price&lt;</li>
            <li>Makes hair have more body and 100% control.</li>
            <li>I will do business with them again, for sure.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a pleasant smell, but it makes your hair very manageable with the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>I got a headful of adorably messed-up wavy curls, just the right amount of separation, and a nice, satiny shine.  </li>
            <li>Rough It Putty which is awesome</li>
            <li>Redken Rough Paste is perfect to style my pixie haircut.  </li>
            <li>If I put in hair while wet and use just a pea-size amount it works the best for me.</li>
            <li>good stuff- holds really well-</li>
            <li>Redken Rough Paste 12 is the BEST product that I have found for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Buying on line makes it easy when you can&#x27;t find it elsewhere else.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply too, after a while you don&#x27;t like spending alot of time doing your hair you know?</li>

            <li>This makes it quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely fight away the humidity of southern states, but does its best.</li>
            <li>delivered fast, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say there would be much \\&quot;hold\\&quot; to this, but for me, that would require way too much product of any kind.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>great for getting the style without all the gel-related mess.</li>
            <li>Texture is nice, but you can find a better product for less money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but in my opinion it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>Surf Head, Garnier, Ion, Style Sexy Head, Sexy Hair, Eufora, Loreal, Redkin wax and my Redkin Rough Paste.  </li>
            <li>I can rake my fingers in the top of my hair a couple of times to get the less than perfect lay down</li>
            <li>My hairstylist recommended it and she was right.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I am a male with short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>good matte feel unlike typical hair products.</li>
            <li>First, I didn&#x27;t buy this product through Amazon, but through a salon for my first try.  </li>
            <li>and it has a very feminine smell that lasts ALL DAY!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!</li>
            <li>This stuff really lets your shape your hair and isnt too oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definately purchase more when this is empty.  </li>
            <li>Expected better</li>
            <li>Sometimes you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>And it works very well</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast, too.</li>
            <li>The paste doesn&#x27;t hold up very well.</li>
            <li>Great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>this redken hair paste works really well.</li>
            <li>More importantly,  it doesn&#x27;t give your hard the crunchy feel or wet/greasy look that most other products do.  </li>
            <li>No greasy look, keeps a really nice hold without being stiff.  </li>
            <li>I love this rough paste!  </li>
            <li>I have bought some old product from certain sellers.  </li>
            <li>In my cabinet right now I have 10 different texturizing waxes and pastes.</li>
            <li>I rub a small amount on my hands and distribute mainly on the top and sides of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I see something new and want to try it out</li>
            <li>Amazing product and you only need a tiny amount to rough up your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how-to vids, the best one being this: [...]  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I use it exclusively now, though I&#x27;ve used other products like Woody&#x27;s Big Stick and Woody&#x27;s Pomade (both really good products as well, though a bit gummy and greasy in comparison to Rough Paste).</li>
            <li>Leaves no heavy residue on your hair</li>
            <li>I have short choppy platinum hair that I love to spike up and give that piecy look.</li>
            <li>It is true that for the average guy&#x27;s hairstyle (not Duck Dynasty)</li>
            <li>My husband uses this rough paste on his hair &amp; it works really well for him!</li>
            <li>THe product was delivered quickly, but the paste was a bit too dried out.</li>
            <li>It adds separation and texture, as well as mild hold, but it&#x27;s not sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>Have used other products but none work as great as this...great for thin bodiless hair!</li>
            <li>but at the same time not heavy.</li>
            <li>My hair is short and thin, so I decided to try this product to bring more volume to my hair.</li>

            <li> but at the same time not heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair is short and thin, so I decided to try this product to bring more volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t that different at all from a fiber product -- the only real difference I notice is that the method of dispensing Redken Rough Paste is easier and a lot less messy than something in a tub.</li>
            <li> A bad product will be hard coming out of the top that won&#x27;t smear easily in your hands.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, so I don&#x27;t use very much.</li>
            <li> It was clearly a \\&quot;very old\\&quot; inventory, and after a few uses, I had to throw this out since it was too dry.   </li>
            <li> Most products either gum my hair up so it can&#x27;t move, or freeze it solid so as to protect me from falling space debris, but the Redken Rough Paste does nothing of the sort (sorry helmet head lovers).  </li>
            <li> and my hair is flat</li>
            <li> Gels and other stuff just weighed my hair down, but this really gives me the funky look</li>
            <li> I can fix it and primp it all day with minimal loss of control and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin when I sweat like some lesser products</li>
            <li> I have tried others since then, but I keep coming back to Rough Paste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rough Paste 12 for several years now.</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve bought over and over is the Rough Paste.  </li>
            <li> I continue to order this when I&#x27;m out even though a bottle lasts a really long time; no need to look elsewhere for me.  </li>
            <li> Is definately air sensitive, as when not used daily gets hard and you have to waste a bit to get to the soft product.  </li>
            <li> Applied to totally dry hair that had Redken Ringlet run through it while damp, just this morning.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s this rough paste.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product because Redken discontinued Rough Clay and this is what they recommend as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> arrived as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> I simply blow dry my hair and use a small amount (about the size of a dime) rub it in my hands and work it in my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have used when my hair was short, and use on my medium lenghth hair to give it texture and the messy look!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I will use a wax and the Redkin for an extreme piecy</li>
            <li> you really only need a small; dime length to style.  </li>
            <li> What I do is dry my hair and then take a little</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so you have to experiment a little.  </li>
            <li> If you feel your hair has lost a little volume during the day, just fluff it up</li>
            <li> I was really afraid of this product at first, as it comes out of the pump looking like spackle from a tube of toothpaste, and I am a stickler for not wanting my hair to feel sticky or crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how this could even come close to a replacement for Rough Clay (20).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very thick and dense hair with big booming curls (kept at bay by keeping my hair shorter than an inch and a half).  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I should put a little &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; of wrap over end when not using the paste.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little oily</li>
            <li> It also provides the benefits of hair gel without the wet look and hard sensation.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my hair look oily and limp.</li>
            <li> usually use Garnier Fructis Survivor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this past for years and will never change.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed given the high price.</li>
            <li> This probably would work for women, but it sucks to me.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for at least four years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as some pastes on the market and is easier to work into your hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a very dull chemical-like smell to me.</li>
            <li> A secret I&#x27;ll share is sometimes if I&#x27;ve taken a nap</li>
            <li> ..worthless since they changed the ingredients-absolutely worthless,and the price  should be less than free,did i mention worthless?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uncomfortable and sometimes I don&#x27;t know what to do...</li>
            <li> Expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with Redken for one, discontinuing Rough Clay; and two, for even thinking this could be a replacement for it.  </li>
            <li> To me the smell of Rough Paste is just horrific, though.</li>
            <li> I was a bit unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible product!    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I realize that grooming products are a very personal and subjective topic, so I&#x27;ll keep this as factual as I can...I&#x27;ve got very thick and dense hair with big booming curls (kept at bay by keeping my hair shorter than an inch and a half).  Most products either gum my hair up so it can&#x27;t move, or freeze it solid so as to protect me from falling space debris, but the Redken Rough Paste does nothing of the sort (sorry helmet head lovers).  It provides control for my ferociously curly hair without gumming and hardening.  I can fix it and primp it all day with minimal loss of control and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin when I sweat like some lesser products tend to do.  It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but in my opinion it&#x27;s well worth it if you have hair with a mind of its own.  I use it exclusively now, though I&#x27;ve used other products like Woody&#x27;s Big Stick and Woody&#x27;s Pomade (both really good products as well, though a bit gummy and greasy in comparison to Rough Paste).</li>
            <li> This stuff really lets your shape your hair and isnt too oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Excellent and as promised.</li>
            <li> great hair hold without making it look like I am guy with a bunch of hair gel in my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t completely fight away the humidity of southern states, but does its best.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, arrived fast and perfect. would buy from seller again</li>
            <li> I love this rough paste!  A friend referred me to this product.  I&#x27;ll definately purchase more when this is empty.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Is definately air sensitive, as when not used daily gets hard and you have to waste a bit to get to the soft product.  Perhaps I should put a little &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; of wrap over end when not using the paste.  It is not in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Love that it came so quickly and great price.  It exceded my expectations.  I will order again, just as soon as it runs out!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a luddite when it comes to hair products, but I have used this for years and still love it. It gives my sort-of wavy hair some &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; that helps separate and define curls. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was a bit unhappy with this purchase. THe product was delivered quickly, but the paste was a bit too dried out. It was clearly a \\&quot;very old\\&quot; inventory, and after a few uses, I had to throw this out since it was too dry.   Expected better</li>
            <li> This paste really holds my hair great, I have spiked hair and it does the job. Buying on line makes it easy when you can&#x27;t find it elsewhere else.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on me which is why I bought it.  Either I am not using it properly, or it is not the same product she used, but I don&#x27;t like it.  My hair feels sticky and Does not hold its shape from morning until night.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to this product several years ago by a friend who&#x27;s a hair stylist.  I have tried others since then, but I keep coming back to Rough Paste.  I love that it provides all-day hold while remaining a bit malleable, so you can make adjustments over the course of the day.  More importantly,  it doesn&#x27;t give your hard the crunchy feel or wet/greasy look that most other products do.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, but I have never found another styling product that comes close.  Sometimes you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and you only need a tiny amount to rough up your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Garnier Fructis Survivor Rough It Putty which is awesome but this kills it</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I needed a water-based pomade to mix in a DIY beach waves spray. It worked well in the recipe I was using, and the beach waves came out great!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by the quick delivery and the product. The product comes in the silver bottle and is just as is should be. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Hair paste is where its at. Makes your hair stay without looking greezy</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on my thin hair. Nice aroma too.</li>
            <li> I love it! My hair is short and thin, so I decided to try this product to bring more volume to my hair. And it works very well, I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> People ask me what I use to make my hair stay in place and it&#x27;s this rough paste.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> women come up to me on the street and want to touch my hair. it&#x27;s uncomfortable and sometimes I don&#x27;t know what to do...but this paste takes my hair and turns it up to eleven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years..it&#x27;s an awesome tool for creating that certain look for your hair!</li>
            <li> This product is great for my fine short hair. I simply blow dry my hair and use a small amount (about the size of a dime) rub it in my hands and work it in my hair with my fingers. I can rake my fingers in the top of my hair a couple of times to get the less than perfect lay down look. I then use a hair pick to finish my style and spray with my hair spray for a look that last all day. This product gives my hair a real nice shine too that I love. A secret I&#x27;ll share is sometimes if I&#x27;ve taken a nap and my hair is flat I can dampen my fingers and rake them thru my hair and it will bring my style back. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found this product.</li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t buy this product through Amazon, but through a salon for my first try.  Second - OMG!  It may be the best thing I&#x27;ve ever discovered for styling my fine, soft, wavy, chin-length layered bob with bangs (think haircut of Martha Plimpton on Raising Hope),  I was really afraid of this product at first, as it comes out of the pump looking like spackle from a tube of toothpaste, and I am a stickler for not wanting my hair to feel sticky or crunchy.  I scoured the web for reviews (Amazon reviewers, thank you) how-to vids, the best one being this: [...]  Finally I took a deep breath and jumped in.  Applied to totally dry hair that had Redken Ringlet run through it while damp, just this morning.  WOW!  I got a headful of adorably messed-up wavy curls, just the right amount of separation, and a nice, satiny shine.  Yes, my hair feels like there is some product in it, but the feel is not yucky.  I can&#x27;t say there would be much \\&quot;hold\\&quot; to this, but for me, that would require way too much product of any kind.  I am loving this!  So glad I tried it!!!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for years. This is very good value for the price. Shipping is fast, too. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  I have used when my hair was short, and use on my medium lenghth hair to give it texture and the messy look!  Also helps with any flyaway hair you may have.  I rub a small amount on my hands and distribute mainly on the top and sides of my hair.  Also great for the guys!</li>
            <li> delivered fast, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because Redken discontinued Rough Clay and this is what they recommend as a replacement.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure how this could even come close to a replacement for Rough Clay (20).  It has almost no hold and it has a very feminine smell that lasts ALL DAY!  UGH!!!  How it rates as a 12 baffles me.  Very disappointed with Redken for one, discontinuing Rough Clay; and two, for even thinking this could be a replacement for it.  I called Redken to get my money back.  Horrible, horrible product!    To be fair, I am a male with short, fine hair.  This probably would work for women, but it sucks to me.</li>
            <li> Love the product. But took forever to get the product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for over 10 years and love it. Great product. Nothing else compares to it. I hope Redken keeps making it. I would be lost</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!! Leaves no heavy residue on your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this past for years and will never change.  A little bit goes a long way, so you have to experiment a little.  It gives your hair a lot of volume and a more defined look.  It&#x27;s not as thick as some pastes on the market and is easier to work into your hair.  If you feel your hair has lost a little volume during the day, just fluff it up and you are good to go. I have really thick hair, so I don&#x27;t use very much.</li>
            <li> great for getting the style without all the gel-related mess. good matte feel unlike typical hair products. use sparingly though. a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The paste doesn&#x27;t hold up very well. Texture is nice, but you can find a better product for less money.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to hair wax. It also provides the benefits of hair gel without the wet look and hard sensation.</li>
            <li> have used this for years&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t get a better product or better price&lt;br /&gt;holds spikes well with no gooey look if you warm it on your finger tips before applying</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t that different at all from a fiber product -- the only real difference I notice is that the method of dispensing Redken Rough Paste is easier and a lot less messy than something in a tub. To me the smell of Rough Paste is just horrific, though. It has a very dull chemical-like smell to me. I&#x27;m disappointed given the high price.</li>
            <li> ..worthless since they changed the ingredients-absolutely worthless,and the price  should be less than free,did i mention worthless?</li>
            <li> This is the best hair paste product that I have ever used--and I have used plenty. Not only does it have a pleasant smell, but it makes your hair very manageable with the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> arrived as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> good stuff- holds really well- xtra strong</li>
            <li> Great for short hair styles</li>
            <li> Redken Rough Paste is perfect to style my pixie haircut.  It adds separation and texture, as well as mild hold, but it&#x27;s not sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> I wanted the &amp;#34;dry/light&amp;#34; look and this thing is awesome. Not sticky while applying and smells awesome. All my barbers tell me i have thick(healthy) hair and this thing holds it all day. Easy to apply too, after a while you don&#x27;t like spending alot of time doing your hair you know? This makes it quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Have used other products but none work as great as this...great for thin bodiless hair! Makes hair have more body and 100% control.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my curls in place and feel like it does a great job adding texture to my curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rough Paste 12 for several years now. I knew the product was going to be great, but I am writing to thank the vendor; the product was exactly as described, the price was good, and they promptly mailed my package to me. Great service, thank you very much! I will do business with them again, for sure.</li>
            <li> Solid product,but it&#x27;s a little oily</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and am happy with it.  I would order this again.  It is a good product.</li>
            <li> good product and a better price than I can find locally.  Great hold but at the same time not heavy.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time and items were packed well.  I would order again from this business.  No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair.  Great hair product.  Have been using it for at least four years.  Great for thin hair.  Recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  Does a great job of adding texture to your hair without being greasy or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Its the best hair texturizer I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> Redken Rough Paste 12 is the BEST product that I have found for my fine hair.  I can get it to spike, fringe and do what it&#x27;s suppose to do with a dab of RP12 and my fingers!  Gels and other stuff just weighed my hair down, but this really gives me the funky look I like!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every morning.  What I do is dry my hair and then take a little but of this stuff and rub it through my hair.  It allows me to have the loft without being greasy.  My hairstylist recommended it and she was right.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what it does. Seems to make my hair look oily and limp. If I put in hair while wet and use just a pea-size amount it works the best for me.</li>
            <li> this redken hair paste works really well. I have a short pixie style hair cut and it worked beautifully. wasn&#x27;t sticky at all, and it smells really good!</li>
            <li> I have short choppy platinum hair that I love to spike up and give that piecy look. When I say I&#x27;ve tried evey texture paste, wax, pomade, mousse...I am not kidding. In my cabinet right now I have 10 different texturizing waxes and pastes. Surf Head, Garnier, Ion, Style Sexy Head, Sexy Hair, Eufora, Loreal, Redkin wax and my Redkin Rough Paste.  The only product I&#x27;ve bought over and over is the Rough Paste.  I see something new and want to try it out and they never work as good as the Redkin. It&#x27;s not sticky or tacky and it gives me the texture I&#x27;m looking for.  Sometimes I will use a wax and the Redkin for an extreme piecy look.&lt;br /&gt; I have bought some old product from certain sellers.  A good product will be nice and moist.  When you get it you have to push up from the bottom to get it started, you&#x27;ll notice an oil meant to keep it moist. A bad product will be hard coming out of the top that won&#x27;t smear easily in your hands. If you get one of those then return it if you can.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this rough paste on his hair &amp; it works really well for him!</li>
            <li> Hairstylist used this on me years ago and I haven&#x27;t looked back since.  No greasy look, keeps a really nice hold without being stiff.  I continue to order this when I&#x27;m out even though a bottle lasts a really long time; no need to look elsewhere for me.  It is true that for the average guy&#x27;s hairstyle (not Duck Dynasty) you really only need a small; dime length to style.  My son&#x27;s are now using this as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair product.  Great for styling fine hair.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years!</li>
