            <li>so evening skin care is hit or miss for me (which I know is the best time</li>
            <li>Although it contains vitamin E and a converted caster oil, you would never know that these are in the serum; they&#x27;re excellent antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>What seems to work best is my Tretinoin cream, so I am hoping this will help, too.</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>

            <li>My fiance says my skin looks good though.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good retinol serum for a while.  </li>
            <li>Good Product, but not for those individuals who are suffering from acne.</li>
            <li>Choose a good eye cream for these areas instead</li>
            <li>Seems to fill in the lines under eyes and on forehead fairly well</li>
            <li>The price is good.</li>
            <li>I can already tell my skin looks better,  better sheen very nice product excellent at night before bed.</li>
            <li>It has an easy to blend consistency &amp; pleasant fragrance!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my skin!  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but none that I liked.  </li>
            <li>This is better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used its magic in a bottle !</li>
            <li>I am so far very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>However, Prodermis Retinol is, by far, the best retinol I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>The use of the product,needs more time,if an honest review is to be given.</li>
            <li>Nice product and very fast shipment!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use which is very important with my hectic schedule &amp; it has a great price/guarantee that I really appreciate!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely,  L.G.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the gel product I was using and enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Delivery was timely and I am satisfied with experience.</li>
            <li>ok?</li>
            <li>My face has never looked any better.  </li>
            <li>I will re-order for sure.</li>
            <li>However I sis order a proglide slide board I use all the time I love and a Nokia  phone cover I love</li>
            <li>I love this product definately recommend it :-)</li>
            <li>Been using this serum for a couple of days and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughter who has had better luck with it.</li>
            <li>I love the way that the Retinol Serum makes my skin feel and also the way that it looks.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this serum.  </li>
            <li>So I wasn&#x27;t sure about this stuff</li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon sells this.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; have been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 and looking good;-)</li>
            <li>I REALLY  found a good one.  </li>
            <li>It comes out of the bottle easily and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The serum is easy to use .</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs easily and has seemingly smoothed my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a difference in fine lines after about a week.</li>
            <li>Everything went fine</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived with a huge spill inside the box, although the box was sealed.</li>
            <li>Clogs pores, smells with cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>5 minutes, then put a light moisturizer on my face.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more right now.</li>
            <li>one thing for sure is there is some problem with the container, I order the first bottle, it was well seal</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve generally avoid the Sun like the plague, since I&#x27;m so fair, I still had some darkening (like the pregnancy mask that you get).  </li>
            <li>Overall, i would say this is a good product for its price.</li>
            <li>I offered to try this product again but decided to go with the full refund.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it for the full effect.</li>
            <li>So far when I HAVE used the retinol, I have liked the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>To help with cell regeneration, I choose to use a good facial cleanser with a buff puff every night.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to make my 60&#x27;s something face much softer and more refreshed looking.  </li>
            <li>This is not something that can be rated in one week or two,but after a month,that gives you the true response from the quality of the product .</li>
            <li>I received the Serum so quickly and I tried it right away!  </li>
            <li>Your product arrived quickly and I am hoping&lt;br /&gt;to leave for Hollywood just as soon as it starts working</li>
            <li>I like that this one is like a gel and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I use the stronger retinol to control breakouts, to minimize my impending crows feet,  to minimize that &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;, and to encourage quick cell turnover.  </li>
            <li>I like the product, however, when I did receive it, it was very hot.</li>
            <li>However, if you are a teenager or adult who has acne do not use this product, as it will give you more acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>This allows me more control over what I put on my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked a chance to properly assess it</li>
            <li>The bottle that is contained with the product was good as well, unlike what the other reviews said.</li>
            <li>So far I do like the product but need to give it more time to see real results.  </li>
            <li>have fair skin with normal to dry moisture levels.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried to use this, I got a pea-sized amount, and the the pump stopped working.</li>
            <li>I only just began using the product and do need a few more weeks to see if it makes a difference, but it does feel good on the skin and the product arrived I a timely fashion</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks on my face consistently.  </li>
            <li>saw a difference in my skin the first week I used prodermis.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My skin is looking more and more even everyday!</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is smoother with less fine lines and more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love it and am ordering a second bottle.</li>
            <li>I am 37 and have been staring a the same enlarged pores for too many years.</li>
            <li>62 yr old skin!!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product and supplier.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed trying this fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the Prodermis under my eyes or on my eyelids; it&#x27;s entirely too strong to use in these areas.  </li>
            <li>According to the bottle, the product should be kept at a certain temperature.</li>
            <li>and I feel this serum does not have a very high percentage of Retinol.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>Prodermis Retinol Serum IS much stronger than any retinol I&#x27;ve used, and I don&#x27;t foresee trying to find anything stronger.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin when using this product, I thought it would get rid of my blemishes.</li>
            <li>It seems to really help the &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a minimization of the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyebrows with the use of the other retinols; the Prodermis has done a much better job at this; although I don&#x27;t use it around my eyes, I do use it away from my eyes, on the crows feet.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth, is a little smelly, gives your face a healthy glow, and will definitely reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was because I have older thinner skin.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>The issue has not been completely resolved, but the results so far have been better than with other products.</li>
            <li>The product its self is fine, especially when I get it at a very low price.  </li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference in my skin with use of every other day</li>
            <li>This is a new product I will always use.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Botox and this gives a similar look to the skin after a short time use.</li>
            <li>but this is a wow product!</li>
            <li>Have been using this product on my hands for a few weeks and started seeing positive results quite quickly.</li>
            <li>The second bottle has the same problem but just not spill out as much as the first one.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to tell major differences, but my skin feels very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>and when I remove the plastic seal , take out the bottle from the paper box, there are many serum inside the box (white/clear dry out)  and the outside of the bottle(wet sticky clear color) , so I return it and get the second bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe my wrinkles were to far gone.</li>
            <li>Soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive</li>
            <li>(did I just say that out loud...)</li>
            <li>(Prodermis contains 1.3-Butylene Glycol; this IS NOT glycolic acid, but a naturally occurring alcohol).  </li>
            <li>I usually apply my moisturizer right before going to bed, so I haven&#x27;t applied the retinol 30 minutes before very often.  </li>
            <li>My skin is really starting to look brighter and my skin feels soft!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare to other retinol serums since this is the first one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different.</li>
            <li>I ordered a different prodermis  early on and that along with  along with this  didn&#x27;t work all products shown on an episode of Dr oz get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li>I sent a review earlier, but I will reiterate--&lt;br /&gt;Packaging substandard - product packed in large box with other items and TWO puff</li>
            <li>The Prodermis has lightened this substantially; however I don&#x27;t know how much lightening you would see from really dark spots.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to see if there is a long term difference,but it seems to calm my skin down after wearing it at night.</li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;m giving this little tutorial, is because many (if not most) of the &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; retinol serums, also contain AHA; therefore they aren&#x27;t stronger at all.  </li>
            <li>Had trouble at first remembering to use it, but once I started remembering it daily, I noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Bottle is very small and not sure if I liked this product.</li>
            <li>One single small pump, gives you enough to spread over your entire face, which means it will last a LONG time, making it very economical.  </li>
            <li>Prodermis retinol is a clear serum, that is not greasy; it soaks immediately into the skin, leaving absolutely no residue.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, if you are a teenager or adult who has acne do not use this product, as it will give you more acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> This allows me more control over what I put on my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Would have liked a chance to properly assess it</li>
            <li> The bottle that is contained with the product was good as well, unlike what the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> So far I do like the product but need to give it more time to see real results.  </li>
            <li> have fair skin with normal to dry moisture levels.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use this, I got a pea-sized amount, and the the pump stopped working.</li>
            <li> I only just began using the product and do need a few more weeks to see if it makes a difference, but it does feel good on the skin and the product arrived I a timely fashion</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks on my face consistently.  </li>
            <li> saw a difference in my skin the first week I used prodermis.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin is looking more and more even everyday!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is smoother with less fine lines and more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love it and am ordering a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I am 37 and have been staring a the same enlarged pores for too many years.</li>
            <li> 62 yr old skin!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and supplier.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed trying this fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the Prodermis under my eyes or on my eyelids; it&#x27;s entirely too strong to use in these areas.  </li>
            <li> According to the bottle, the product should be kept at a certain temperature.</li>
            <li> and I feel this serum does not have a very high percentage of Retinol.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> Prodermis Retinol Serum IS much stronger than any retinol I&#x27;ve used, and I don&#x27;t foresee trying to find anything stronger.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin when using this product, I thought it would get rid of my blemishes.</li>
            <li> It seems to really help the &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a minimization of the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyebrows with the use of the other retinols; the Prodermis has done a much better job at this; although I don&#x27;t use it around my eyes, I do use it away from my eyes, on the crows feet.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth, is a little smelly, gives your face a healthy glow, and will definitely reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was because I have older thinner skin.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The issue has not been completely resolved, but the results so far have been better than with other products.</li>
            <li> The product its self is fine, especially when I get it at a very low price.  </li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in my skin with use of every other day</li>
            <li> This is a new product I will always use.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Botox and this gives a similar look to the skin after a short time use.</li>
            <li> but this is a wow product!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product on my hands for a few weeks and started seeing positive results quite quickly.</li>
            <li> The second bottle has the same problem but just not spill out as much as the first one.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to tell major differences, but my skin feels very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> and when I remove the plastic seal , take out the bottle from the paper box, there are many serum inside the box (white/clear dry out)  and the outside of the bottle(wet sticky clear color) , so I return it and get the second bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe my wrinkles were to far gone.</li>
            <li> Soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive</li>
            <li> (did I just say that out loud...)</li>
            <li> (Prodermis contains 1.3-Butylene Glycol; this IS NOT glycolic acid, but a naturally occurring alcohol).  </li>
            <li> I usually apply my moisturizer right before going to bed, so I haven&#x27;t applied the retinol 30 minutes before very often.  </li>
            <li> My skin is really starting to look brighter and my skin feels soft!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare to other retinol serums since this is the first one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different.</li>
            <li> I ordered a different prodermis  early on and that along with  along with this  didn&#x27;t work all products shown on an episode of Dr oz get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I sent a review earlier, but I will reiterate--&lt;br /&gt;Packaging substandard - product packed in large box with other items and TWO puff</li>
            <li> The Prodermis has lightened this substantially; however I don&#x27;t know how much lightening you would see from really dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to see if there is a long term difference,but it seems to calm my skin down after wearing it at night.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this little tutorial, is because many (if not most) of the &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; retinol serums, also contain AHA; therefore they aren&#x27;t stronger at all.  </li>
            <li> Had trouble at first remembering to use it, but once I started remembering it daily, I noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Bottle is very small and not sure if I liked this product.</li>
            <li> One single small pump, gives you enough to spread over your entire face, which means it will last a LONG time, making it very economical.  </li>
            <li> Prodermis retinol is a clear serum, that is not greasy; it soaks immediately into the skin, leaving absolutely no residue.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the retinol very much yet as it said on the box &amp;#34;to ensure optimal results, wait at least 30 minutes before applying any corrective or moistuizing products the same evening as applying retinol serum&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to know if it is really necessary to wait this long.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use it long enough to write a thorough review.  </li>
            <li> It takes only a very small amount to cover my face which makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li> Since manufacturaling place is not listed, there are all reasons to belive it is cheaply produced in China and the content is highly questionable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for that long</li>
            <li> so I am encouraged by long term usage and results.</li>
            <li> I did not have that experience with any other product used prior to this one.</li>
            <li> CLODDED PORES AND DRY SKIN..</li>
            <li> in plain brown box too big for product; it obviously rattled around and leaked all over.&lt;br /&gt;Product NOT in manufacturers packaging--</li>
            <li> But I am seeing my facial wrinkles appear to be less pronounced, will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> The description on the bottle and the box does not mention the percentage of retinol or other essential active ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not much change yet Be using for about a week.</li>
            <li> The smell is minimal.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots have almost disappeared in a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> But when I open the package, the small box of the product was wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I wish it could be used on other saggy skin places lkie my underarms.  </li>
            <li> They DO back up their guarantee that if you are NOT satisfied they WILL refund your money.</li>
            <li> I have tried other serums.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because of the warning to discontinue if any redness occurred and to start just using every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally aware of odor</li>
            <li> If you want to use AHA or GA, use the retinol at night and the other in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other retinol products to address a clogged pore issue.  </li>
            <li> Some of the dark spots from blackheads are going away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I was supposed to use it to see differences.</li>
            <li> I notice a slight difference,  but nothing drastic.</li>
            <li> Skin is brighter and wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as a miracle creamor serum, so don&#x27;t fall for ridiculous claims.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the serum leaked our the package got wet somewhere.</li>
            <li> Under my eyes are a little brighter but not seeing a change in my &amp;#34;concentration&amp;#34; wrinkle between my eyebrows yet.</li>
            <li> will NOT use an unprotected product; therefore I WASTED my money on an inferior misrepresentation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting it out of the bottle</li>
            <li> My face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; has some redness and uneven skin tone from all those years of tanning with baby oil...</li>
            <li> but you really&lt;br /&gt;seem to be anxious for a response</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I was not satisfied with this product, I was contacted via email and offered a 100% refund, which I accepted.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what effect the heat has had on the product.</li>
            <li> I prefer a retinol in the form of a serum, rather than a cream; serums usually don&#x27;t contain a lot of moisturizers or oils, while creams do.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gone, although I can see a small amount in my 15x mirror.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and I will never be without it!</li>
            <li> However, I did not have any negative effects from this and like the way if feels.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any negative affects so unless something drastic happens I will re-purchase it.</li>
            <li> Had a fear of the retinol because of a bad reaction to a DIFFERENT product in the past...</li>
            <li> I looked inside the bottle, and the pump stick is broken.</li>
            <li> This came with a broken applicator.</li>
            <li> so I am not happy.</li>
            <li> My skin was broken out; it was healed within 2 days of using the Prodermis.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> The reviews are definetely fake.</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product does work however, the thing i dislike about the product is the fact the expiration date was crossed off. This makes me doubt about the expiration date of the product. The bottle that is contained with the product was good as well, unlike what the other reviews said. Overall, i would say this is a good product for its price.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> My face seems softer after using this product for several months.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to see if there is a long term difference,but it seems to calm my skin down after wearing it at night.</li>
            <li> I sent a review earlier, but I will reiterate--&lt;br /&gt;Packaging substandard - product packed in large box with other items and TWO puff paks.&lt;br /&gt;Product in plain brown box too big for product; it obviously rattled around and leaked all over.&lt;br /&gt;Product NOT in manufacturers packaging--NO padding NO product information NO factory seal.&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT use an unprotected product; therefore I WASTED my money on an inferior misrepresentation.&lt;br /&gt;I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Only had product for a couple of weeks and applied it a toatl of 4 times. But I am seeing my facial wrinkles appear to be less pronounced, will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> This is a product that gives instant results.  I don&#x27;t have to use it for a month.  Just a couple of drops for your face each morning is is enough.  I wish it could be used on other saggy skin places lkie my underarms.  I&#x27;m ordering more right now.</li>
            <li> ...since I have only been using your product once a week for a couple of weeks but you really&lt;br /&gt;seem to be anxious for a response so here it is.  Your product arrived quickly and I am hoping&lt;br /&gt;to leave for Hollywood just as soon as it starts working it&#x27;s magic.  Sincerely,  L.G.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use this, I got a pea-sized amount, and the the pump stopped working. I looked inside the bottle, and the pump stick is broken. Have not tried to use this since. How do I return it? Sorry.</li>
            <li> I only just began using the product and do need a few more weeks to see if it makes a difference, but it does feel good on the skin and the product arrived I a timely fashion and I was notified immediately when shipped.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the gel product I was using and enjoyed. This came with a broken applicator. I have trouble getting it out of the bottle so I am not happy. I found that the product I had used and wanted to reorder is out of stock.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! It has an easy to blend consistency &amp; pleasant fragrance! It&#x27;s easy to use which is very important with my hectic schedule &amp; it has a great price/guarantee that I really appreciate!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after only one application and continue to use it several times each week. I appreciate the glass packaging vs. plastic.</li>
            <li> It does not even require a numer 1 star.  I do not know what else to say.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my wrinkles were to far gone.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. Some of the dark spots from blackheads are going away. It makes my skin look great. Soft and dewy. It has a beautiful scent to it. It does not have a medicine like smell. I&#x27;ve order the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Have only used this product for about 3 weeks. Have not noticed any changes with the wrinkles on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was not satisfied with this product, I was contacted via email and offered a 100% refund, which I accepted.  I offered to try this product again but decided to go with the full refund.  They DO back up their guarantee that if you are NOT satisfied they WILL refund your money. Great Customer Service.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so revitalized with this product.  I love the feel of my skin!  I would purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Love it !! Makes a huge difference in my skin with use of every other day and I have sensitive 62 yr old skin!!!!</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. My package came soaked. The paper from the box was stuck to the bottle. Not sure if the serum leaked our the package got wet somewhere.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smoother. Under my eyes are a little brighter but not seeing a change in my &amp;#34;concentration&amp;#34; wrinkle between my eyebrows yet.</li>
            <li> I got this to try before my wedding. I notice a slight difference,  but nothing drastic. My fiance says my skin looks good though.  I&#x27;ll keep using it for the full effect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the retinol very much yet as it said on the box &amp;#34;to ensure optimal results, wait at least 30 minutes before applying any corrective or moistuizing products the same evening as applying retinol serum&amp;#34;  I usually apply my moisturizer right before going to bed, so I haven&#x27;t applied the retinol 30 minutes before very often.  I&#x27;d like to know if it is really necessary to wait this long.  So far when I HAVE used the retinol, I have liked the way it makes my skin feel and I have a refreshed look in the morning.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product last  week. I can already tell my skin looks better,  better sheen very nice product excellent at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Saw item on TV and Facebbok thought I would try it Retinol Serum. Not much change yet Be using for about a week.</li>
            <li> Bottle is very small and not sure if I liked this product. I choose not to buy again. I will stick with retinol beads. Thanks anyway !</li>
            <li> Clogs pores, smells with cheap perfume. The bottle arrived with a huge spill inside the box, although the box was sealed. The description on the bottle and the box does not mention the percentage of retinol or other essential active ingredients. Since manufacturaling place is not listed, there are all reasons to belive it is cheaply produced in China and the content is highly questionable.The reviews are definetely fake. It is going where it belongs: trash.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product on my hands for a few weeks and started seeing positive results quite quickly. The skin at the treated areas appears tighter and smoother. I did not have that experience with any other product used prior to this one.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good retinol serum for a while.  I tried a variety of retinol serum but none that I liked.  When I tried PRoDermis retinol Serum I REALLY  found a good one.  This is a new product I will always use.</li>
            <li> I like the product, however, when I did receive it, it was very hot. According to the bottle, the product should be kept at a certain temperature. I am not sure what effect the heat has had on the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other serums. I like that this one is like a gel and it absorbs quickly. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks but my skin does seem to be softer. I will probably purchase again after I have used this bottle.</li>
            <li> I am so far very happy with the product. I have not used it long enough to tell major differences, but my skin feels very soft and comfortable. I was concerned because of the warning to discontinue if any redness occurred and to start just using every other day. However, I did not have any negative effects from this and like the way if feels. It takes only a very small amount to cover my face which makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li> Good Product, but not for those individuals who are suffering from acne. This product goes on smooth, is a little smelly, gives your face a healthy glow, and will definitely reduce wrinkles. However, if you are a teenager or adult who has acne do not use this product, as it will give you more acne breakouts. Once your acne clears, I would definitely purchase this product and use it religiously.</li>
            <li> wonderful product giving beautiful results. Skin is brighter and wrinkles less noticeable. Dark spots have almost disappeared in a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> I Love This Product!!!  I have had it a week, and already I can See the difference!  The customer service is excellent.  Its everything they said it was and More!!!  I have already told all of my friends about this product.  I Love It!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does not irrate my skin at all. My skin is really starting to look brighter and my skin feels soft!</li>
            <li> Very good product started using it and started seeing some results after a couple of weeks.  Delivery was timely and I am satisfied with experience.</li>
            <li> I started using Retinol Serum two months ago and the results are instant.  Tightens the skin and gives a smoother appearance.  I am a huge fan of Botox and this gives a similar look to the skin after a short time use.</li>
            <li> The product its self is fine, especially when I get it at a very low price.  But when I open the package, the small box of the product was wet and sticky.  I don&#x27;t know how much serum has leaked and waste.....</li>
            <li> I chose to get this retinol serum because I read that retinol is one of three skin care regimens proven to work at reducing wrinkles and improving skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks on my face consistently.  Although I&#x27;m not meticulous about it.  I always use it in the morning and sometimes in the evening. I don&#x27;t wear makeup often since I work at home so evening skin care is hit or miss for me (which I know is the best time, I get it, that ok? I just don&#x27;t do it)&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin with normal to dry moisture levels.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no adverse effects - no reddening of the skin or sore spots. I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in fine lines.  I&#x27;m not generally aware of odor so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  It comes out of the bottle easily and is easy to apply.  I can&#x27;t compare to other retinol serums since this is the first one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I only use this product for 3 times at night and didn&#x27;t see much big difference yet so I cannot rate it but one thing for sure is there is some problem with the container, I order the first bottle, it was well seal and when I remove the plastic seal , take out the bottle from the paper box, there are many serum inside the box (white/clear dry out)  and the outside of the bottle(wet sticky clear color) , so I return it and get the second bottle. The second bottle has the same problem but just not spill out as much as the first one. I don&#x27;t want to return, return and return so I decided to keep it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ver used Retinol Serum by Prodermis for about 6 weeks now.  I wanted to use it long enough to write a thorough review.  I&#x27;ve had oily skin all of my life, and now that I&#x27;m heading toward my mid-50&#x27;s (did I just say that out loud...), I have combination skin that is still prone to breakouts.  I&#x27;ve been using retinol serums every night for 4+ years now.  I have experience with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Neutrogena Deep Wrinkle Serum&lt;br /&gt;2. Roc Retinol&lt;br /&gt;3. Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Serum&lt;br /&gt;4. L&#x27;Oreal Retinol&lt;br /&gt;5. Olay Regenerist Retinol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles; I do have the beginning of crows feet as well as an  &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyebrows.  I use the stronger retinol to control breakouts, to minimize my impending crows feet,  to minimize that &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;, and to encourage quick cell turnover.  I prefer to buy skin care items that are use specific, rather than items that are combined; ie. I want a retinol that is not mixed with a moisturizer.  This allows me more control over what I put on my extremely sensitive skin.  I wanted a retinol serum that was stronger than anything on the list. I prefer a retinol in the form of a serum, rather than a cream; serums usually don&#x27;t contain a lot of moisturizers or oils, while creams do.  Inevitably, a combination skincare item will make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a degree in medical biochemistry; I want to warn everyone NOT to buy a retinol mixed with alphahydroxy acid (AHA), or glycolic  acid (a type of AHA); the addition of these ingredients will INTERFERE with retinol! (Prodermis contains 1.3-Butylene Glycol; this IS NOT glycolic acid, but a naturally occurring alcohol).  If you want to use AHA or GA, use the retinol at night and the other in the morning.  Find and read the list of ingredients of EVERYTHING YOU USE!  The reason I&#x27;m giving this little tutorial, is because many (if not most) of the &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; retinol serums, also contain AHA; therefore they aren&#x27;t stronger at all.  Prodermis Retinol Serum IS much stronger than any retinol I&#x27;ve used, and I don&#x27;t foresee trying to find anything stronger.  Although it contains vitamin E and a converted caster oil, you would never know that these are in the serum; they&#x27;re excellent antioxidants.  Now that the chemistry lesson is over (and your eyeballs are rolling back into your head)...Prodermis retinol is a clear serum, that is not greasy; it soaks immediately into the skin, leaving absolutely no residue.  The smell is minimal.  One single small pump, gives you enough to spread over your entire face, which means it will last a LONG time, making it very economical.  Since it does not contain moisturizers, you will want to use a moisturizer.  I wait ~ 5 minutes, then put a light moisturizer on my face.  I don&#x27;t use the Prodermis under my eyes or on my eyelids; it&#x27;s entirely too strong to use in these areas.  Choose a good eye cream for these areas instead (I recommend .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a difference in my skin the first week I used prodermis.  My skin was broken out; it was healed within 2 days of using the Prodermis.  I&#x27;ve seen a minimization of the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyebrows with the use of the other retinols; the Prodermis has done a much better job at this; although I don&#x27;t use it around my eyes, I do use it away from my eyes, on the crows feet. They&#x27;re gone, although I can see a small amount in my 15x mirror.  My makeup doesn&#x27;t go into creases anymore.  To help with cell regeneration, I choose to use a good facial cleanser with a buff puff every night.  After cleaning my face in the shower, I use the Prodermis, followed by a moisturizer.  My face has never looked any better.  Although I&#x27;ve generally avoid the Sun like the plague, since I&#x27;m so fair, I still had some darkening (like the pregnancy mask that you get).  The Prodermis has lightened this substantially; however I don&#x27;t know how much lightening you would see from really dark spots.  There is no such thing as a miracle creamor serum, so don&#x27;t fall for ridiculous claims.  However, Prodermis Retinol is, by far, the best retinol I&#x27;ve ever used and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea. What seems to work best is my Tretinoin cream, so I am hoping this will help, too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for that long but it seems to make my 60&#x27;s something face much softer and more refreshed looking.  I appreciate the opportunity to try this product for an affordable price.  I will re-order for sure.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even order this it was sent in error I ordered a different prodermis  early on and that along with  along with this  didn&#x27;t work all products shown on an episode of Dr oz get rid of cellulite. However I sis order a proglide slide board I use all the time I love and a Nokia  phone cover I love so I&#x27;m not someone who just orders and returns it&#x27;s just the cellulite products don&#x27;t work..  Thank u.</li>
            <li> Just started using this for literally 2 days and my face feels soooo much younger already !!! Feels rejuvinated and is definately glowing ! I love this product definately recommend it :-)</li>
            <li> Been using this serum for a couple of days and am pleased with it. Seems to fill in the lines under eyes and on forehead fairly well so I am encouraged by long term usage and results.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this serum. However I have used retinol before and I feel this serum does not have a very high percentage of Retinol. I am continuing to use it and will post if I change my mind.</li>
            <li> Sorry,this product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> The serum is easy to use . Hopefully I will look 10 years younger soon</li>
            <li> Nice product and very fast shipment!!</li>
            <li> CLODDED PORES AND DRY SKIN.. CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE  AMAZON WOULD  BACK THIS.-------SHAME</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 2 weeks and I can already see a difference. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received the Serum so quickly and I tried it right away!  Just love the way my skin feels, and I&#x27;m beginning to see a difference in the way it looks, too!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was because I have older thinner skin.  Whatever the cause I tried it for a week and found it not to work for me.  I gave it to my daughter who has had better luck with it.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in fine lines after about a week.</li>
            <li> Everything went fine and I like the serum</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs easily and has seemingly smoothed my wrinkles.  Love it and recommend it! I plan on never running out of it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin when using this product, I thought it would get rid of my blemishes. I used it every night. I&#x27;m not sure how long I was supposed to use it to see differences.</li>
            <li> I love the way that the Retinol Serum makes my skin feel and also the way that it looks. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this serum.  It seems to really help the &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34; areas!  I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried other retinol products to address a clogged pore issue.  The issue has not been completely resolved, but the results so far have been better than with other products.</li>
            <li> Ok. So I wasn&#x27;t sure about this stuff but I am now! This is better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used its magic in a bottle ! My face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; has some redness and uneven skin tone from all those years of tanning with baby oil... I&#x27;ve been using this for only two weeks and WHAT! My skin is looking more and more even everyday! No joke! I love it! I&#x27;m 47 and looking good;-) I use it everyday and I will never be without it! Love it! Ps I never write reviews but this is a wow product!</li>
            <li> So far I do like the product but need to give it more time to see real results.  However, there was a &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; bonus listed on the box with a web address for 50% off discount code for the next order.  I have tried this multiple times there is no code.  This is very disappointing.  If you are not going to honor this you should not put this on the box!</li>
            <li> The use of the product,needs more time,if an honest review is to be given. This is not something that can be rated in one week or two,but after a month,that gives you the true response from the quality of the product . At this point no noticeable,dramatic,effects,but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent product and supplier.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed trying this fabulous product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have noticed my skin is smoother with less fine lines and more even skin tone. The price is good. I am on my second jar and will continue to use this nightly. I am glad Amazon sells this.</li>
            <li> It works! I&#x27;ve tried alot of products, and I&#x27;m really happy with the results of this one. I plan on re-ordered when I run out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Had trouble at first remembering to use it, but once I started remembering it daily, I noticed a big difference in my skin. I love it and am ordering a second bottle. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love it! Cleared up my cystic acne along my jawline almost immediately and I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer on top of it. Will def buy again!</li>
            <li> This product truly delivers! I am 37 and have been staring a the same enlarged pores for too many years. Had a fear of the retinol because of a bad reaction to a DIFFERENT product in the past...well, the pores have visibly shrunken quite a bit and I have shown no sensitivity at all, I really LOVE THIS STUFF!!! Thank you for making something that DOES WHAT YOU HOPE FOR!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for less than two weeks. Would have liked a chance to properly assess it but I keep getting these emails to review the product. I haven&#x27;t had any negative affects so unless something drastic happens I will re-purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; have been using it for over a year.</li>
