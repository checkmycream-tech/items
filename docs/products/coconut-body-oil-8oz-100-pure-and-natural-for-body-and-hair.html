            <li>Maybe it works well on ppl with normal skin</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>No dry flaky looking hands now.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The oil is ok but if you think you&#x27;re getting 100% coconut oil think again the label says its a blend of coconut and sunflower oil. That&#x27;s fine but that&#x27;s not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything for my extremely dry skin. Maybe it works well on ppl with normal skin</li>
            <li> I/3 of the bottle spilled in the zip lock bag it was in and leaked into the box and so every thing was oily. But it is still coconut oil and it has  great smell and is great for your skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pure fractionated coconut oil for body use and as a personal lubricant (I have some at home that is in a more solid state, not too good for the bedside). I assumed this product was 100% pure oil, as indicated by the product desription. It is NOT. It has added oils that I do NOT want in my private areas. I was very disappointed. It smells nice and works well as a lotion, but not for cooking or lubricant. I was pretty disappointed (not to mention my husband&#x27;s disappointment). BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I use coconut every day leave my skin feeling great . If you have dry feet this oil it great for it</li>
            <li> Very good quality and delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Smells great and awesome massage oil.</li>
            <li> Great stuff not that greasy</li>
            <li> Before purchasing the Coconut Oil I tried the Avocado Oil (same brand) and loved it but that one doesn&#x27;t have any scent and I like scented oils -  this one has a sweet pleasant scent - not real strong - but nice. I really love the pump and one bottle used daily lasts several months. A great buy!</li>
            <li> Used it with doterra oil blend and it&#x27;s perfect. The pump dispenser is very convenient. Great quality I will order more.</li>
            <li> it is ok.  A little thick for my preference.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as it was described. My first experience using Coconut Oil as a skin moisturizer. I LOVE IT. I use it right after I step out of the shower. I feel a difference in the texture of my skin after using it. And I will most definitely buy this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for moisturizing and it works well. The pump jar is so convenient to put at the sink and use it after washing my hands. My hands had become very dry and this has worked. No dry flaky looking hands now. And it obsorbs well.</li>
            <li> Switched to this product from baby oil for my dry skin. Goes on easily and works all day to keep my skin from drying out  during this cold New England winter.</li>
            <li> Feels so nice, not a bad scent.  Goes a long way!  Convenient pump to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I find this oil to be light and easily absorbed in my hair and scalp.</li>
