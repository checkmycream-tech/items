            <li>Overall, a great price for the brushes I use and pretty good quality!!</li>
            <li>I do find these face brushes are more suited for cream products as they pick up powders very, very lightly.</li>
            <li>I also liked the reviews before purchasing they helped tremendously!</li>
            <li>The angled large one is great for blending under the eye up through the corner of the eye.  </li>

            <li>All the brushes are very good quality with really soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out.</li>

            <li>then elf but quality is sooooo much better not as good as sigma but pretty close but for the price difference forget sigma!</li>
            <li>They are very good quality for such an amazing deal.</li>

            <li>I just received it and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packed more with bristles.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this purchase, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SIMPLY OK.</li>
            <li>I USE THEM MOSTLY FOR POWDER AND BLUSH.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>, admittedly they do have a chemical smell upon opening the package, but I feel confident that will dissipate.</li>
            <li>so glad I didn&#x27;t spend hundreds at sephora</li>
            <li>I also will say if you&#x27;re looking for dupes of high quality brushes - these are it! !!!!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>

            <li>Yes they came with a funny smell but nothing a good wash can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>I can see someof these easily becoming primary brushes!</li>
            <li>they get loose from the top, but work great!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>

            <li>Arrived quickly and are amazing quality.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that foundation spreads and covers better using these brushes and they are easy to wash.</li>
            <li>Love them, they are so soft, and work great.</li>
            <li>I always love brushes that are soft and have great application.</li>
            <li>Good quality brushes, I love them so much I&#x27;m ordering another set now.</li>
            <li>nice soft brushes good value for money</li>
            <li>I was using the bare minerals full flawless face brush and let me just say that a 30 dollar brush is LITERALLY no comparison to these.  </li>
            <li>Very soft great brushes</li>
            <li>The synthetic bristles make them very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, the packeging is great, and it arrived in week.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes they clean well and make my make process very smooth</li>
            <li>Package arrived in time time, excellent quality just plain AMAZING</li>
            <li>As others have described, there was a strong smell to them at first, but after a good washing the smell was gone.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so soft and blend out foundation so beautifully and so easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Better than I expected ~ very nice brushes!</li>
            <li>Other then that im happy!:)</li>
            <li>They blend beautifully; you barely have to move the brush to blend your products; densely packed bristles make for an AH MAZE ING brush!</li>
            <li>They are very good quality; soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Wow, smelly like others have reviewed but work great for foundation, concealer, and contouring.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the most important</li>
            <li>A great variety for a complete look.</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on smoothly and evenly, which I love.</li>
            <li>These are great brushes, and I recommend these to anyone who wants great brushes at a low price!</li>
            <li>They are soft and work great.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see them as great brushes just because they&#x27;re soft.</li>
            <li>I love it though it was cheap and</li>
            <li>They work well for the price and have a really great professional look to them.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure they will apply nice since they have the makings to do so, but if I notice that&#x27;s not the case</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend this product for purchase because you can just go to target and purchase their brand make up brushes which are cheap and are way better in quality.</li>
            <li>Great value, no shedding, soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great quality so far.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and so great.</li>
            <li>They apply the makeup as expected and I like the foundation brushes the best.</li>
            <li>Great deal for the money-nice, versatile, soft brushes.</li>
            <li>They are also great for blending, everything from foundation to eye shadow looks naturally blended.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, very happy that I purchase these brushes can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li>and they are all great quality, soft and no fall out.</li>
            <li>Packaged really cheaply, or I would buy 10 more sets as gifts.</li>
            <li>So smooth and nice they work well so far and became a really good quality</li>
            <li>Good quality brushes and my order was fast.</li>
            <li>One would really get a good deal with this set.</li>
            <li>I actually loved them so much</li>
            <li>I really needed a good kabuki brush for applying mineral makeup</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good blending/foundation brush forever; I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much for just ONE brush, so I came across this set.</li>
            <li>They came in really fast, and they&#x27;re really good for the price.</li>
            <li>I loved them so much, got some for my sister to try.</li>

            <li>The brushes are also easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Other then that these brushes are great for the price!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think twice, just get them:) they are soo worth it!</li>
            <li>other than that they&#x27;re wonderful</li>
            <li>and they do not leave streaks which I am very happy of compared to other</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re such good quality for your money!</li>
            <li>But for 3 years and such a good price - I can&#x27;t be upset!</li>
            <li>They blend super easy and are easy to handle!</li>
            <li>Ok I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these brushes.</li>
            <li>Sure makes putting on contouring makeup more fun.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to get a set for easy access</li>
            <li>Application is easy.</li>
            <li>Great quality for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>They make my make up glide on easily and don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;streaks&amp;#34;-Blending</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for some great, cheap brushes!</li>
            <li>I still prefer my Sedona Lace Midnight Brush set over these since they do not &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; as easily.</li>
            <li>I received my item very quick and works well.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use</li>
            <li>They are made of synthetic hair, really easy to clean,and will recommend them to family and friends</li>
            <li>Easy to use with makeup</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t rival my MAC brushes but they easily rival my Sephora ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good, decent brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes do have a strong smell</li>
            <li>Had a strong smell when i opened pack of brushes when they arrived.</li>
            <li>I agree that the strong smell took awhile to dissipate after opening the package.</li>
            <li>and before I even opened the plastic it smelled so strong of paint.  </li>
            <li>These brushes do have a strong scent to them.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t any strong smell.</li>
            <li>If you want reasonably decent brushes for a fair price, you have found them.</li>
            <li>So far so good,  I love them and each one applies just as well as my mac and sonia kashuk ones.</li>
            <li>they did have a strong smell</li>
            <li>but it smelt really strong in an alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>The smell was soo strong that it smelled up my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>But strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>The smell IS strong but it goes away.</li>
            <li>Smelled strongly of the plastic they came wrapped in.</li>
            <li>Strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li>Out of the box the brushes all had a strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>Strong smell when opening.</li>
            <li>The brushes do have a strong smell to them.</li>
            <li>The handles feel good made of wood and high quality.</li>
            <li>Brush set was of high quality and good value.</li>
            <li>they are ok brush, noting special,</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly，I am very pleased &amp; highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The hair on the brushes are nice &amp; dense &amp; blends pretty.</li>
            <li>they are extremely soft and nice on the face!</li>
            <li>They came early which i realled liked!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the flat top or tapered kabuki, but they are still great brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own any of the more exprensive brushes these are supposed to be similar to or &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; for so I can&#x27;t compare, but I can say these are an excellent buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Item shipped very quickly and packaging was a huge plus.</li>
            <li>but now they are fine.</li>
            <li>One fell apart when I opened the bag, but I just glued it together and its held up just fine.</li>
            <li>Air them out (the bag smells) and they were fine.</li>
            <li>Super soft, professional looking, great variety, amazing value!</li>
            <li>Packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>I took mine out of the wrappers and let them air out &amp; they were absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>and they are fine</li>
            <li>were fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes did come with a chemical smell, but after being washed they were fine.</li>
            <li>They use less product, lays your liquid foundation flawlessly onto your face.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and durable brushes!</li>
            <li>arrived suprisingly quick!</li>
            <li>With this collection of brushes I have everything including a flat top brush for buffing which works perfect for minerals as well as a few rounded brushes which also work great.</li>
            <li>the brushes a very soft and good quality</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great and super soft brushes</li>
            <li>Super soft, great blending.</li>
            <li>I love them soooo much!!</li>
            <li>THE SMALLER ONES ARE TOO LARGE TO USE FOR SHADING BUT PERFECT FOR BLENDING.</li>
            <li>These are the best make up brushs hands down!</li>
            <li>I have a huge collection of brushes</li>
            <li>Smooth application, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I bought them because they were cheap</li>
            <li>but I glued it back together and still work great</li>
            <li>I own the Sedona lace brushes, they are very pricey .I</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews a lot of people said they are cheaply made .</li>
            <li>like I wanted it to, was too light.</li>
            <li>These are so cheap just take a chance</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re like me, this deal won me over because I read a review that said it came in a package, I uploaded a picture of it, it&#x27;s a cheap bag.</li>
            <li>With the free Amazon shipping it came in 1 day 😳</li>
            <li>It blends and applys on so smooth.</li>
            <li>Before, I only used MAC brushes but these work great for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Great brushes the only downfall is the smell</li>
            <li>I really was hoping these would be amazing.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to buy them because the mixed reviews, but I am happy I did.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy them though.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean no shedding.</li>
            <li>Great buy especially for the price !!!</li>
            <li>(I did swipe them on my hands and tug on the hairs lightly to test them).</li>
            <li>Cheap material</li>
            <li>I think it might come from the handles, I&#x27;m hoping the bristles aren&#x27;t just cheaply coated.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brushes is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The brushes put the makeup on smoothly without getting blotchy.</li>
            <li>I own brushes from ELF, Real Techniques, Walmart &amp; CVS Brands.</li>
            <li>They work fabulously for every day makeup application.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a fantastic quality for the price</li>
            <li>But, I decided to move on because it was a cheap buy.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well made, durable, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are really easy to clean and grip.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I bought a set for my sister.</li>
            <li>personally feel that if you are in want of brushes for whatever reason, these would be a great buy.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great brushed for the price</li>
            <li>but they are such great quality.</li>
            <li>The quality was great especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Great brushes for a low price.</li>
            <li>So happy definitely I would buy again!!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>overall its really great</li>
            <li>The brushes you use are just as important as the make up</li>
            <li>They are so soft, holds makeup well and blends really good.</li>
            <li>I had thrown out my old blush brush that I had for years, which I loved how it applied my blush.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve worked good for me so far.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, work well, good value, would buy again.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>they all are soft and made with a good material.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty...and so far they are of good quality</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely soft, and are good quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty good quality, they are sift and blend makeup very well!</li>
            <li>They have good density and are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Soft, durable and good looking as well.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>They are all good quality and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Good so far.</li>
            <li>They are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and so beautiful, it is a shame to use them to apply makeup really!  </li>
            <li>will continue to use these brushes until I find a new set more suitable to my needs.</li>
            <li>They are SUPER soft, maybe the softest brushes I own!</li>
            <li>Best brushes I was really surprised to be honest due to the pricing of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve been applying my liquid foundations with the flat top brush, and the blending and coverage it leaves is amazing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them to everyone and will be ordering more for gifts!</li>
            <li>Again I can&#x27;t be overly critical for such a great price for a set of 8 great brushes, when most higher end brushes start off around $10-$15 per brush.</li>
            <li>However, natural bristle brushes are better in general and if you buy ones of excellent quality, they will last for decades (if you take good care of them).  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li>Super soft came in a cheap looking bag but brushes were in near perfect condition except for one or two hairs sticking out of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Even though they are synthetic and not goat hair brushes still nice quality for a decent price.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush gives amazing, consistent coverage and the other brushes are a joy to use.</li>
            <li>love my new make up brushes ordering more.</li>
            <li>Amazing, soft... buy these brushes!!</li>
            <li>Super great buy and definitely recommend!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have paid this amount for a single brush so to get all of these different high quality brushes is truly a great value and superb buy!</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft which I love!</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are very soft and I was extremely impressed initially, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>They have a good performance in general.</li>
            <li>Other than that they work almost as good as my Sigma brushes for 1/8 of the price!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li>you are looking for a set that is not expensive and do the job, this is ok.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I compared them to my tarte kabuki brush and my bare minerals brushes and they&#x27;re just as good.</li>
            <li>Def worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Worth the price paid!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes so much!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the smell of paint, but I am pretty sure once they have been shampooed and cleaned the smell will go away.</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I literally was able to use an eighth of what I usually put into my bare minerals lid (and I don&#x27;t put a lot) and got a beautiful superior coverage.  </li>
            <li>I showed this brush to my MUA cousin, and she said it was very good quality and very comparable to the Sigmax essential brush kit for $150!</li>
            <li>very good, live up to sigma brush quality - I use the smaller tapered &amp; round brushes for concealer and they work awesome</li>
            <li>super cheap as well</li>
            <li>I think they re a really good deal for such a cheap cost</li>

            <li>They are sooooooooo super soft and the price just makes these 10x better!</li>
            <li>A little rough packaging, just use a plastic bag sealed, hope that after the packaging more perfect; the use of items for a while, carding can also, more comfortable.</li>

            <li>My make up really does go on so much better using these.</li>
            <li>Overall the brushes are really good quality.</li>

            <li>Nice and soft no fallout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very well pleased with my order, got her in record time.</li>
            <li>I did not expect such good quality for the price.</li>

            <li>Not a bad thing</li>
            <li>Not a bad price</li>
            <li>BUT THEY ARE NOT BAD EITHER.</li>
            <li>flat brush is the best I have ever used, with soft bristles that don&#x27;t hurt your skin, very dense to not just soak up and slosh foundation around but great for pressing the product in to give that air brushed look to the the skin,.</li>
            <li>These are really nice brushes that are super soft and don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>REALLY NICE SET, SUPER SOFT AND MAKE UP GLIDES ON</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved these brushes and the fact that they got to my house less than a week made it even better.</li>
            <li>Super soft and glides nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li>The are very dense which it good for foundation and still very soft.</li>
            <li>They smelled really strongly of chemicals when I first opened them.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 days before the smell went away, but other than that they work great</li>
            <li>I love my new makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>They are not quite dense enough for applying powder over foundation but still better than most brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anybody that wants nice makeup brushes but doesn&#x27;t want to spend much.</li>
            <li>Excellent brushes at such a low price.</li>
            <li>Work very well and easy to clean,</li>
            <li>They arrived super quick, too.</li>
            <li>I was initially super geeked when I got these....</li>
            <li>I am proud to apply my very expensive makeup with these beautiful brushes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just a quick case to put them in, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>However, I am super demanding when it comes to my brushes, I want to have no trace of a brush on my skin when I apply foundation.</li>
            <li>I received the brushes quickly.</li>
            <li>It went away with a quick wash and rinse with soap.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be a good buy for how much I paid.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and handle really well.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the quality, they are very dense, the only thing I noticed was a painty smell to them</li>
            <li>Okay, so first things first.</li>
            <li>These could have easily been priced on the high end and would have been justified.  </li>
            <li>Love my brushes they&#x27;re so soft and gentle!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and I love them.</li>
            <li>They perform just as well as high end brushes, but for a much better price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li>The flat head large brush is great for applying foundation in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>these brushes are awesome!!they are very inexpensive and very soft and gentle on my skin by far best dupe I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li>Forever, MAC and Smashbox brushes as my primary set and have started using these first.</li>
            <li>Very dense and soft, and make up application is a lot more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I love the flat top foundation brush...</li>
            <li>Cheap product, brushes have been shedding since first day of use.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>These brushes are very nice for starting a bigger and better makeup collection.</li>
            <li>When I first received them I was super excited, as soon as I opened them they had a funky smell</li>
            <li>Pretty great for the money spent.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are great for packing on shadow, but their sizes and shapes are rather odd, imo,</li>
            <li>But it is a very noticeable and strong smell.</li>
            <li>For anyone starting a collection, this would be a good first purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have several high end brushes, but these are the best by far.</li>
            <li>Love them, very soft and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>there very soft on my skin.i just wish a couple of the brushes were better for applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Just received my brushes in the mail today and let me just say I absolutely LOVE them so far!</li>
            <li>Every brush does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to!</li>

            <li>Overall , i&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>Perhaps these brushes will get a 5 star rating after I put them to the test, but as a first impression 4 stars it is!</li>
            <li>theyre super soft :)</li>
            <li>To get rid of the chemical-ish smell (and to clean my brushes every day), I wash them with hot water and Softsoap milk and honey liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and are super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect them to last for ever but great bargain for the price so far!</li>
            <li>I love these, I use them everyday and ordering more!</li>
            <li>The day after, when the brushes have finally dried, I was impressed at how soft the bristles were still!</li>
            <li>All the little brushes are great for the eyes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, good quality, good price, the bristles are super soft, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They feel strong and rich and soft.</li>
            <li>And they are very dense, so they don&#x27;t feel like a cheap makeup</li>
            <li>I get such amazing pay off when I use this with my revlon color stay foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for a few months and they started out working great.</li>
            <li>Great set and price, I use this set everyday</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing for only.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too firm and they have a great shape.</li>
            <li>Everyone has their own personal preference</li>
            <li>They are so nice besides the fact that I got 2 of the same brushes and not receive a tappered brush</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes are really nice, but almost a Dupe of a Dupe.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>These are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>they are soft and apply my makeup smoothly!</li>

            <li>I really love this brushes they were more than what I expected.</li>
            <li>Soft, well-made, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re okay as far as picking up foundation</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Not bleach, but definitely some kind of a cleaning agent.</li>
            <li>They are completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Soft; easy to clean</li>
            <li>Soft brushes but make sure you wash your brushes because the brushes intially smell like paint.</li>
            <li>The only t liked to hing</li>
            <li>They are much better than my old brushes from estee lauder.</li>

            <li>good product came faster than expected</li>
            <li>They are so soft, but yet firm; which is perfect for blending and applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I guess it is not a big deal, but it would be nice to know.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use them right away but now these are one of the most important parts of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Not too soft or stiff, perfect for packing on color in the correct areas...</li>
            <li>They are very soft and very full ... worth the money i purchased them for .</li>
            <li>Brushes had a slight scent of alcohol when first received, but are great for the price paid.</li>
            <li>Brushes are super soft and nice only thing is the strong smell</li>
            <li>With bristles ranging from stiff to softer.&lt;br /&gt;Application is great</li>
            <li>The bristles are not easily removed, which makes me happy.</li>
            <li>but it dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>These came super fast!</li>
            <li>This goes away pretty quickly once they have been exposed to air for a bit.</li>
            <li>Great quality for the price - smells a little funny at first but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived super quick, These brushes are super dense snd extremely soft!!</li>
            <li>They are soft and feel so nice on the skin.and I highly recommend this makeup brush set.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and would definitely purchase this as a gift for a good friend.</li>
            <li>they do the job right.</li>
            <li>The price was right, so I bought these.</li>
            <li>the smell went right away...</li>
            <li>So I just washed them and it came right out.</li>
            <li>and one of my brushes right out of the box fell apart, but I just glued that would superglue</li>
            <li>smelled right out the bag.</li>
            <li>They came right on time according to the estimated date.</li>
            <li>I looked and looked for just the right brushes and found these.  </li>
            <li>just right and trust me</li>
            <li>These brushes were a great price and are pretty firm.</li>
            <li>Just clean them before using if thats a real concern.</li>
            <li>Super soft, Packed tightly enough for good product pickup and blending.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pretty sure my sisters like them.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that when you first get them they kind of smell funky , but that smell does go away.</li>
            <li>Brushes arrived super fast and the package is so professional and cute.</li>
            <li>Brushes are really nice and dense but bristles are reallyy flimsy and they smell like sharpies when you first open the package.</li>
            <li>The several different kinds of brushes are very useful in applying makeup and they are easy to clean for the most part.</li>
            <li>The only down point, they didn&#x27;t come with information on best uses.  </li>
            <li>Very large brushes&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Especially because I am pregnant, maybe my nose is more sensitve, but it is unbearable to me.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sturdy and very full and soft.</li>
            <li>I have may high end brushes and these ones are pretty good for the price if you do not want to spend big money for some brand ones.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and I love the flat top brush for my foundation.</li>
            <li>high end brushes are ridiculously priced so this is a wonderful compromise</li>
            <li>I have the bare minerals brush that goes with their serum foundation, it cost about $28, there is a brush in here that does a job that is 5x better than that brush</li>
            <li>Great brushes worth the money and feel a lot more expensive.......</li>
            <li>these are nice looking set but not really soft and after the use</li>
            <li>Just go it , Not bad at all ,They are SUPER soft and pretty !</li>
            <li>Very soft and super durable!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t clean super easily and they smell weird out of the package but overall they great!</li>
            <li>I can truly relate them to the sigma brushes but a better price and a little bit better quality.</li>
            <li>They did smell funny right out of the packaging</li>
            <li>These brushes came super fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>They make blending so easily and the hairs are so soft.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these brushes well worth the money I have purchased four different brush sets and none</li>
            <li>Buy these brushes, They are as good as Trish and way less money.</li>
            <li>Delivered super fast.</li>
            <li>Received the items super fast which is a plus.</li>
            <li>She will be surprised when she gets them because the quality of these brushes easily beats what I paid for them.)</li>
            <li>So I haven&#x27;t used these brushes yet but overall, I think these brushes are a good bargain because they are dense and soft.</li>
            <li>They ship super fast and come just like it says</li>
            <li>Received them in the mail super fast....</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised that the brushes were such good quality.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and blend so easily.</li>
            <li>They are soft, high quality and clean easily.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these they are very soft on the face and don&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>they are OK, but I will still go with an other brand looking for better quality, not professional a better ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic, very soft.</li>
            <li>super super soft!</li>
            <li>I use the large flat top for powder foundation, the rounded flat top for liquid foundation blending, the angled flat brush for blush and bronzer, and surprisingly the oval pointed brush for patting in and setting my under-eye concealer.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was expecting more since there were so many great reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li>They are also very pretty in person and work very well for applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>it has the perfect length for my face and is stiff enough to blend your product well.</li>
            <li>sometimes they loose hairs , but they are nice.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very high Quality for the price!</li>
            <li>Love the smaller brushes for eyeshadow and for blending out my contouring and highlighting on my face (especially the nose) and the larger brushes are great for buffing out foundation, applying blush, and setting foundation with a powder.</li>
            <li>Received them very fast.</li>
            <li>I like this set very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It came with a cute pink eco friendly bag.</li>
            <li>These brushes are extremely cute, quality is better then I expected, and the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>I apply foundation to my face with one of them, that&#x27;s a good technique to hide skin imperfections or those little scars that remain after acne with the years.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and came fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>they appeared to be high quality full brushes.  </li>
            <li>they have funky strong smell when you open them, but it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Any time I use a new one I clean it with soap and water and then use them.</li>
            <li>I Simply can not believe the quality of these brushes for only $ 10, they loved, are the perfect blend brush and sufficiently rigid to apply hard and soft powder.</li>
            <li>I read most of the recent reviews as well.</li>
            <li>Really like these!</li>
            <li>I decided I would give these a try first</li>
            <li>Had three of the same face brushes, I wanted more of a variety.  </li>
            <li>They did have a funny smell to them when I first got them</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>First time purchasing a brush set.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>First time using them and they blended my make up so well.  </li>
            <li>These brushes and they came so fast in the mail!</li>
            <li>they do have a funny smell  at first</li>
            <li>These most likely came from CHINA.</li>
            <li>Better quality than some in the same price range.</li>
            <li>I love these brushed</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t smell funny</li>
            <li>its smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these makeup brushes!!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase on Amazon</li>
            <li>To many of the same brushes</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>and they arrived pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but mine are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described and affordable.</li>
            <li>I did have to use a hot glue gun to keep the metal piece on the handle.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>and I love them, I will definitely be ordering these again when the time comes!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re exactly what you expect for when hoping all comes out well.</li>
            <li>But after washing them and caring for them BEFORE using them, they really were worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li>However, a couple of months later, they are just okay.  </li>
            <li>Alternatively you may just rinse them or wash them before using the first time.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush-set.</li>
            <li>when I first got them they smell like paint?</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>definitely getting more</li>
            <li>This is my first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did have a chemical smell at first but don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>When I first got them they smelled at first</li>
            <li>The first day I had them the handle broke off of one.</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>First things first: I am going to agree with the first impression SMELL,(they smell like ...</li>
            <li>If I continue liking them I&#x27;ll sure give them the extra stars(:</li>
            <li>These are better than beginner brushes for the price, actually.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON &amp; BESTOPE!</li>
            <li>I like the brushes, but wish that there were more smaller eye make up ones.</li>
            <li>Using it to apply makeup was also great and the quality compares just as good if not better to my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>MAGNIFICIENT definitely buying more for my mother and mother in law.</li>
            <li>First day I received and used them two of them broke ..</li>
            <li>Cheaply made in my opinion but the brushes are soft</li>
            <li>The big angled brush has to be my favorite brush in the set.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bestope!</li>
            <li>The quality is way better than the regular brushes I buy over the counter.</li>
            <li>After the first use the brushes fall apart.</li>
            <li>The brushes work pretty well.</li>
            <li>this might actually be my first product review for anything.</li>
            <li>I bought these as back up brushes but they are now my primary brushes that I use every day!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more, especially after reading reviews others</li>
            <li>They do smell like permanent markers though when I first opened them, so I recommend washing them before using.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brushes were good but the application of products especially the contour brush is too thick that the color would not go nicely to your face.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend investing on really good quality brushes for everyday usage.</li>
            <li>My new brushed are amazing</li>
            <li>They are super soft!!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and incredibly useful.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the brushes are quite good, I haven&#x27;t had too much &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; and they seem to blend makeup really well.</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ve only tried the foundation brushes and I love them!</li>
            <li>These brushes are great they are very universal and can be used from anything from applying blush to a cream concealer to a concealer pencil,  to loose mineral powder,  contouring and highlighting,  </li>
            <li>great make up brushes, very soft, yet stiff too</li>
            <li>Someone said they&#x27;re just like the sigma brushes, I uploaded a picture of my sigma brush with the flat top brush that it comes with.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting these brushes from reading the previous reviews but as soon as I got my brushes and began to play them with them one broke off, after a day two more broke off.</li>
            <li>&amp; I was super excited to open up my package!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars overall based on the price and what seems to be good quality of the actual brush material.</li>
            <li>I just cannot get over the superior quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The brushes are not the high/top quality I was expecting after reading prior reviews prior to purchase but they are good.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and have the right amount of density to pick up product and distribute it very well.</li>
            <li>I mean, they are from China and no one really likes the US, lol.</li>
            <li>Super soft, I use them almost every day!</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes !</li>
            <li>These are super soft!</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that mine smelled strong of chemicals when I first got them.</li>
            <li>Strong paint smell at first, but that doesn&#x27;t take away from the actual quality.</li>
            <li>and they had a really chemically smell when i first received them.</li>
            <li>the brushes are still left on my face but great gift for young girls starting out ..</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t give the full richness as the natural but then again price is a concern.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Full and soft.</li>
            <li>my new favorite brushes they are super soft don&#x27;t shed top quality only gave four stars because they are a bit bigger</li>
            <li>I had previously bought a set of brushes but they were cheaply made and fell apart easily.</li>
            <li>I mainly got it for the stippling brush, because I prefer using that for my foundation, but I&#x27;ve actually fallen in love with using the angled brush for my blush.</li>
            <li>but hey, they are brand new and freshly manufactured.</li>
            <li>Initially I was very happy and thought I had gotten a good deal, but when I washed them I realized that due to the cheap design any soap you use to wash them is literally IMPOSSIBLE to wash out.</li>
            <li>no shedding and super soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are super soft and well built.</li>
            <li>super soft and no lose hairs.</li>
            <li>And the brushes are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>I compared these to the ones I own from sephora and bare minerals and the performance and texture are the same.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft</li>
            <li>but I will say they are super soft and I have not seen any shedding yet</li>
            <li>Super soft and the bristles didnt come out after i cleaned them and used them</li>
            <li>All the bristles stay intact and are super soft on my face.</li>
            <li>they are super soft.</li>
            <li>So soft,  and came quickly.</li>
            <li>Super soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>Brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and I have no problem at all with them picking up the product.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints as they&#x27;re super soft and dont shead.</li>
            <li>but now they&#x27;re just coming apart from the metal part, like the glue wasn&#x27;t strong enough or</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I looked at were $30-50 for a single brush.</li>
            <li>I use these every single day :)</li>
            <li>But as soon as I picked up the package I could smell it through the large bubble wrap interior manila envelope.</li>
            <li>I ordered this set mainly for the flat top kabuki and pointed foundation brushes.</li>
            <li>so strong that you can smell them when you walk into the room!! :/</li>
            <li>/&gt;They do have a very distinct paint smell when you first open up the package.</li>
            <li>Also, I did notice a pretty harsh chemical smell when I opened them, but they aired out fairly well.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own makeup every day for the past 10 years and these brushes have improved my skills and application right away.  </li>
            <li>I used them mostly for loose powder mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>However, two of the brush heads were detached from the handles and three more wee loose.</li>
            <li>The bristles are shedding, and the silver part of the brush is loose on most of them.  </li>
            <li>I was really just in the market for a nice that allowed me to use less makeup to get that coverage</li>
            <li>They are very soft, thick, and does a great job apply make up.  </li>
            <li>Have had no issues, almost a year later all the brushes are intact and work just fine.</li>
            <li>Initially they had a smell, but once I cleaned them they were fine.</li>
            <li>in all a pretty decent brush and value.</li>
            <li>feel apart after only two weeks..was able to super glue them back.</li>
            <li>very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The description makes it sound as though there is an eyeliner brush (there is not), and all of the ones that could even possibly be used for the eyes are quite large.</li>
            <li>The handles are a little big and clunky but this is really a great set for the price.</li>
            <li>They are very soft!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so amazing for the price, iv had lots of expensive brushes in my life and these are quite comparable to many of them.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I have paid lots more for just one brush, so I was skeptical about how these were going to work -</li>
            <li>the Round Foundation Brushes I uses with my BareMinerals foundation and its amazing because it buffs the powder on my face without it looking cakey.</li>
            <li>Great brushes I use them everyday only wish they came in a case</li>
            <li>The silver metal on the brushes is solid, and not thin and cheap looking which is what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li>the hairs are coming out on some of them but arrived fast</li>
            <li>Thank you sooo much for fast shipment</li>
            <li>but i really do care.  </li>
            <li>These brushes added really chunky....not to much shedding.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well for my normal every day use.</li>
            <li>The hairs do not shed and it is very comfy to use.</li>
            <li>they look cheaply made some were glued on kinda of crooked</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Application was smooth and extremely similar to my Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>These are really sturdy brushes.</li>
            <li>These really are quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like them</li>

            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>They are very well made.</li>
            <li>I really like that the brushes and metal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>They are dense and shaped really well.</li>
            <li>Works well, arrived fast and organized.</li>
            <li>They work very wel</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, these brushes shed too much &amp; most of them</li>
            <li>So much more than I expected for the cost.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Applied make-up very well..</li>
            <li>it is very well made.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really bother me at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was okay not what I expected</li>
            <li>I was amazed on how fast I received my order.  </li>
            <li>Im a beginner and don&#x27;t want to spend to much</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the eye brushes too much yet though.</li>
            <li>Makes blending much easier.</li>
            <li>Brushes don&#x27;t really hold the minerals as they should.</li>
            <li>Compares them to Sigma brushes that cost 10 times as much.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use them that much.</li>
            <li>So much so that my friends when they saw them almost didn&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>Some the heads fell out and like the foundation brush leaves lots of streaks and doesn&#x27;t pick up the makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>it came fast</li>
            <li>I really like to brushes and the variety that you get.</li>
            <li>I had been using the ELF powder brush and Real Techniques Expert Face Brush for my foundation before I got these.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>They hold make up very well as well.</li>
            <li>then that they blend really well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I think they perform very well</li>
            <li>I like them and was delivered fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, it is a must have!</li>
            <li>it will go away but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>I use the four smaller brushes for my eye makeup application and the fluffier ones are fantastic for blending the eyeshadow edges.  </li>
            <li>The construction of the brushes is better than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>Now I can save so much on my makeup.  </li>
            <li>but I washed mine with gentle soap before using and it went away.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;d way to much hair did not apply my foundation</li>
            <li>Brush quality was even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>They came much faster than I thought.</li>
            <li>But I washed them really well before using, and the smell went away.  </li>
            <li>These brushed arrived in a cute sliding zip bag, and then packaged in a clear cello envelope.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, but make sure to wash them before using them, they did have a chemical smell but a simple wash made the smell disappear.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, and they are super high quality.</li>
            <li>Seriously NO SHEADING, NO CLUMPY MAKEUP, AND GREAT FOR WET AND DRY PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>After 3 years one of the brushed is starting to shed (the flat top one which is the one I use the most).</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised when I stuck one of them in my NARS blushes and it picked it right up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice flat kabuki... similar to the SIGMA F80.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your brushes before you use them because like all new brushes there will be fallout and the smell isn&#x27;t the best but not that bad!</li>
            <li>If you are strapped for cash and need a starter kit of complexion brushes that you do not expect to be for consistent daily use, then these might work better for you, but for the price you should definitely look into Morphe, BH Cosmetics, Real Techniques, even the ELF pro brushes before considering these.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and pretty dense.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, love them.</li>
            <li>Other that that the brushes were okay.</li>
            <li>First off, wow!  </li>
            <li>Brissles are extremely durable and they are dry nice and quickly after machine washing.</li>
            <li>and I clean all my brushes regularly</li>
            <li>The brushes as so soft and easy to use and they are extra gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I will use my Elf Daily Spray to rid off the scent and clean them as well.</li>
            <li>Nice set for the price but who knows how long they will last.</li>
            <li>The Bristles: amazing and soft nice and thick, minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>This make-up brush set are of high quality and really well made.</li>
            <li>right, in the photo) and a normal one (direct middle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that they have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other inexpensive brushes before (free ones with purchase) and those have shed in the first use.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes have held up better which I can only assume is because I just don&#x27;t use them very often.</li>
            <li>They smelled normal to me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, these feel and work really well for the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and blend very well!</li>
            <li>When I used used them for the first time they were so soft.</li>
            <li>The quality of the bristles are good; however, the wooden handle on one of the bigger brushes already came off after several uses.  </li>
            <li>Pretty nice brushes, but they smell a little strange when you first receive them.</li>
            <li>I will say they do smell kind of like paint when you first open them (just the black part of the barrel)</li>
            <li>and I mean none have been as good as these they&#x27;re soft to the skin but work well !</li>
            <li>Honestly they&#x27;re so soft, smell a little package</li>
            <li>They are easily my new go to brushes!</li>
            <li>Amazing product, and came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>I even love the matte black handles.</li>
            <li>SO IN LOVE I HAVE THROWN AWAY HALF OF MY BRUSHES FOR THIS SET</li>
            <li>These brushes came SO quickly with standard delivery I had to check my receipt!</li>
            <li>They worked better than some of my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It does have a smell when you first open the package, but that goes away with the first cleaning.</li>
            <li>They apply makeup decently, but I would recommend​ washing them before use.</li>
            <li>I usually use elf brushes which are pretty inexpensiv, but these are even better.  </li>
            <li>They all ship in individual wrapping and they ship quickly.</li>
            <li>I found that they made my makeup stay on longer and appear more vivid than my other brushes.</li>
            <li>For the price I guess they are decent, though.</li>
            <li>can get better quality brush sets at your local pharmacy, Target, or Walmart for around the same price point.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are of decent quality and work well with creams or powder.</li>
            <li>The round top is comparable to the Real Techniques buffing brush.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous not knowing how they would work or the feel of the brush, but the brushes are very soft and work well.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft and handle is very strudy</li>
            <li>very soft, works very well</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft!</li>
            <li>just because they&#x27;re soft doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re good brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li>I actually feel cheated when it comes to the other brushes I own.</li>
            <li>Seems like I have to pump a little bit more liquid foundation for coverage.</li>
            <li>I think they might be a little better</li>
            <li>Love the little ones as well.</li>
            <li>This is a great set for someone who is just starting to take makeup a little more seriously.</li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviewers in regards to a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Their handles are hard ,nice weight.</li>
            <li>Great brush set for the price but the brush roll gets very dirty easily if you don&#x27;t keep up with the cleaning of the brushes.</li>
            <li>So soft and gently on the skin..</li>
            <li>Got these for my 13 year old daughter and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too soft, they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>They are very dense and apply makeup well, but you aren&#x27;t buying professional grade brushes.</li>
            <li>really anything you need to complete your look.</li>
            <li>soft, and apply makeup very evenly.</li>
            <li>Very dense but also soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very dense and soft.</li>
            <li>so soft and blend really well ..</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and and the brush itself is very dense.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes, fast delivery</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and very durable.</li>
            <li>The pink small bag them come in is great for traveling as well.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very dense and soft with no fallout.</li>
            <li>The brushes are just as they are described &amp; they are amazingly soft, &amp; the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I think they are as soft and work as well as my Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>They are very silky soft.</li>
            <li>So i was thrilled to find such quality at such low pricing!</li>
            <li>but the hairs ripped out and now everywhere after normal use.</li>
            <li>still soft and nice quality but overall not really comparable to the sigma brushes</li>
            <li>I liked the brushes just sucks</li>
            <li>Example: eye shadow applier brush is fatter than normal.</li>
            <li>The only brushes that are good in this set are the small brushes used for eye shadows/concealers.</li>
            <li>Love these, use everyday.</li>
            <li>To be synthetic, they feel pretty soft, like natural.  </li>
            <li>once you first get them, but barely at all.</li>
            <li>shipping was pretty alright fast enough.</li>
            <li>I have no complaint on the quality of the bristles; however.  </li>
            <li>me start by saying I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.  </li>
            <li>Since you are supposed to wash your brushes before first use this shouldn&#x27;t be a real problem to anyone because the smell goes away instantly.</li>
            <li>I spent $300 on Sigma brushes and these are just as soft and nice, I will definitely be telling everyone about these!</li>
            <li>I am getting married next month and wanted to buy new brushes without spending so much on them.</li>
            <li>They also go right back to normal after washing.</li>
            <li>There is a strong smell, but if you wash your brushes properly it&#x27;s not noticeable (and really, who would put something out of a factory directly onto their face/body whether it&#x27;s makeup brushes or a new t-shirt, gross).</li>
            <li>I constantly read about brushes with a smell, I always thought people were exagerating and too sensitive, no these brushes come with like a super glue scent.</li>
            <li>They arrived on time and they are super soft and standard sizes.</li>
            <li>But very soft and not harsh on face!!</li>
            <li>Only problem is, now that I&#x27;ve been using them, my most used brushes are coming loose from the handle at the metal part.</li>
            <li>but that can easily be washed out (: soo as far as that I&#x27;m going to judge them by function within this week &amp; other than that I give them a 3 for now because they&#x27;re sensitively soft and not tough on my hands</li>
            <li>The only brush I don&#x27;t really ever use is the large tapered brush.</li>
            <li>of the eye brushes are stiffer than what I&#x27;d like, but they aren&#x27;t sharp or pokey at all like with cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I feel like they are not quite on par with Real Techniques brushes but better than your average generic drugstore brushes.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a new one, so as I was looking around on Amazon</li>
            <li>It just smells like brand new, just manufactured smell...</li>
            <li>IlAs a makeup artist I like to try new things to see if they work.  </li>
            <li>with  my new  brushes.</li>
            <li>let me know they were new and had never been used.</li>
            <li>Their is no hair loss on the brush and it smells like a new car</li>
            <li>I am new to using brushes to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>They do absorb a lot of product which is fine and the little brushes, that are a bit more wispy, shed just a little.</li>
            <li>I did have one that came off of its black handle... but an easy fix .</li>
            <li>The only thing I will say about them is they are  a slightly bit more flexible then the real techs brushes.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and steady, it doesn&#x27;t fall.</li>
            <li>Its firm yet soft, work just as well as the name brand, love this product.</li>
            <li>They are smaller and more dense than I expected.</li>
            <li>The bag did smell like paint when I opened it, which I found really odd because it was STRONG so the brushes got the scent too.</li>
            <li>Love the little tote bag they come with!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure I could use one as a blush brush since the one I had bought a little while back was a bit too soft.</li>
            <li>But already after about 2.5 months of use the ferrule is barely hanging onto the handle on 3 of the large brushes.</li>
            <li>those brushes are very soft when you apply to you face.</li>
            <li>Very soft and versatile.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>they were very soft.</li>
            <li>The brush feels very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft on your skin and apply my makeup evenly.</li>
            <li>theyre very soft but they don&#x27;t seem to sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>I like it ,its very  soft</li>
            <li>Bristles themselves were very soft, and picked up pigment</li>
            <li>In all no brushes were damaged and all very soft</li>
            <li>The brushes are sturdy and very soft.</li>
            <li>Very very soft bristles...</li>
            <li>These feel soooo soft and high quality.</li>
            <li>Their very soft like velvet.</li>
            <li>The bristles are all VERY soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft, haven&#x27;t got a chance to use them yet but will update when I have.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very nice and soft but it did come with a weird smell</li>
            <li>No initial shedding with the first application.</li>
            <li>The only problem with these is the first brush in the picture (tapered brush)</li>
            <li>When they arrived I was so pleasantly surprised, however!</li>
            <li>Have to hot glue the wood and the silver part back</li>
            <li>so I had to glue them back on but the quality of the fibers are pretty unreal for the price.  </li>
            <li>in that they don&#x27;t have specific uses (e.g., crease) but are pretty interchangeable.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and work so well!</li>
            <li>But other than that, I love these and definitely would recommend to others /</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to air the brushes out when you first open them for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I did notice some of the brush hairs falling out when I first got them in one of the larger brushes...but it hasn&#x27;t happened since.</li>
            <li>The only off putting thing I have noted is that they feel greasy at first.</li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Soft against your face!</li>
            <li>I bought ones before that look exactly like this but have the name brand and oddly enough</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t buy amazon brushes because more than once they have fallen apart on me immediately.</li>
            <li>Soft and no fall out !</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the handles; the handles are short and very thick--however these brushes are worth the price and they won&#x27;t disappoint you.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of makeup products and I almost like these more than the other larger brushes that came with my costal scents 22 piece brush set.</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li>So soft and dense!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t lose makeup in the brushes and they are soft to the touch!</li>
            <li>so I trust them on my face &amp; they look professional plus the size options are a must have !</li>
            <li>3 of the 4 face brushes in this kit are pretty similar and I use them interchangeably for liquid and powder foundation.</li>
            <li>so soft could not belive the quality!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft !</li>
            <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t shed like a lot of other cheap brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are dense, soft, and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li>I compared the round top kabuki to my real techniques buffing brush and as you can see they are practically the same.</li>
            <li>I do recommend washing them before you use them the first time just to get any leftover chemical residue left on the bristles.</li>
            <li>these are so soft!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and durable!</li>

            <li>These brushes really surprised me !</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>As soft as my Mac brushes!</li>
            <li>One brush handle is a little wiggly, but I can fix that easily.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect blending brush and are stiff enough to apply hard and soft powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist &amp; needed a new set to travel with.</li>
            <li>These are typical cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li>These, not only seem sturdy but they&#x27;re REALLY soft and don&#x27;t shed much!</li>
            <li>They are very soft and have held up so far with NO shedding.</li>
            <li>They are soft, lightweight, and look very professional.</li>
            <li>The flat kabuki brush is hands down my new favorite liquid foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I fixed it with a super glue, but then the other ones are starting to wiggle and are becoming loose as well.  </li>
            <li>There is a smell but only when you first open the package and not so much on the brush themselves</li>
            <li>Only real difference is that there&#x27;s no brand name stamp on the handle which I can live without.</li>
            <li>I live that the tips are white so you can really see how dirty/clean they are .</li>
            <li>They are okay, they&#x27;re all very stiff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any shedding, very soft and dense brushed.</li>
            <li>But other than that they are super soft and dense .</li>
            <li>But on the other hand, these brushes are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>They arrived in an &amp;#34;antimicrobial&amp;#34; zip pouch where each brush was individually encased in very cheap, loud, stiff plastic sleeves.</li>
            <li>Soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>but they are not as soft as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>They distribute product evenly and are really soft.</li>
            <li>the brushers are really soft and they did not have a scent.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft, but they are not dense at all.</li>
            <li>All the brushes are soft without a doubt but they&#x27;re not dense.</li>
            <li>and I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much money for brushes especially after reading the reviews for these.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft</li>

            <li>Talked about how soft they were and how even and blended her makeup went on, I must say that I do see a difference so because I can see the difference I&#x27;ll give them 4 stars</li>
            <li>My MAC blush brush completely fell apart on me</li>

            <li>They are soft and densely packed.</li>
            <li>They did have a funky smell to them when I first opened them, but I washed them and the smell was long gone.</li>
            <li>the hairs on these brushes are baby soft.</li>

            <li>I really like the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>these makeup brushes are amazing!The brushes are so soft and</li>
            <li>Love them but shipping was late</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>They are all extremely soft</li>
            <li>I contemplated over whether I sho buy them because come one that price is crazy good, but I went for it and my brushes arrived 2 days later in a cute pink bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft bristles but need to label them.</li>
            <li>no fall out so far</li>
            <li>They are so incredibly soft</li>
            <li>Extremely soft tips.</li>
            <li>Plus they came in early.</li>
            <li>They are soft &amp; dense, as they should be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are definintely soft to the touch and for the price that I paid</li>
            <li>I am honestly pleasantly surprised with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Brushes are definitely useable and worth purchasing if you want a simple set of brushes to start off with.</li>
            <li>though, these are good quality brushes with out the expensive price.</li>
            <li>good substitute for expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>They are my first real set of makeup brushes and they have not let me down yet.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use my brushes, after the second use, the handle of one of them fell off the brush, then the next day I had another brush happen the same thing...</li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a few more eye makeup brushes and a flat kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>No&lt;br /&gt;Issues and still going strong after 2 months of heavy usage!</li>
            <li>Love how soft they are, they do have a weird smell at first though.</li>
            <li>For instance, a the smaller brushes in the black set are more dense/stiff than the white set.  </li>
            <li>Overall they are decent brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are not great quality and have a very strong chemical odor.  </li>
            <li>They are high end brushes at low cost.</li>
            <li>They arrived earlier than I thought, they are truly high quality</li>
            <li>I would disagree in saying they&#x27;re the same quality as high end brushes but</li>
            <li>It came is an adorable little pink zipper bag and another clear bag.</li>
            <li>Usually I use cheap dollar store brushes and a sponge for my foundation</li>
            <li>My only issue is I think there are a few of the exact same brush, and I didnt need so many, but not really something to complain about.</li>
            <li>The stick and brushes are fatter than normal or like regular brushes.</li>
            <li>FINALLY I found one that seems so similar for more than half the price!.</li>
            <li>And the flat top big brush does a little as well.</li>
            <li>The only downside about the smaller brushes is that they are about 25% too large for eye makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I have not cleaned the bristles yet, but so far they are not loose.</li>
            <li>Not a single hair has come out and they are compact and soft.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t have much give, extremely soft fibers that aren&#x27;t rough at all.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is the overwhelming paint smell which I hope goes away soon.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is the handles aren&#x27;t very sturdy -- the stippling brush is already starting to dislodge some.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes skeptical that they would be similar to or as good of quality as the Sigma synthetic kabuki brush set.</li>
            <li>They had a very slight smell but not bad</li>
            <li>Although I have never purchased any high end makeup brushes since I can not bring myself to spending that much money on a brush when I am a single mom and brushes are not a high priority on my list, I was still skeptical about purchasing these without being able to see them first.</li>
            <li>very soft ,  the only thing is that you have to buy a container or a bag to keep them, because they come in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love these little brushes.</li>
            <li>My sister has tons of them and they are so similar and so soft on the face!</li>
            <li>I do own a few small Kabuki&#x27;s but did not have a complete set.</li>
            <li>I have MAC and other high end brushes that are very procy but last quite a while.</li>
            <li>I ordered another brand of flat kabuki brush that was the same price as this whole set.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the bristles felt very soft and the build was decent for the price range (BUT bear in mind that I did get a damaged set</li>
            <li>The pink bag the brushes came in smelled like someone had washed it in pure rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Meh, if you aren&#x27;t looking to have high quality brushes and aren&#x27;t looking for them to stay glued together for long - go for these.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and comparable to other high end brushes.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical based on the price and mixed reviews, but am so happy I took a chance.  </li>
            <li>These are as soft as my Sephora, Mac, and Urban Decay brushes.</li>
            <li>but I would definitely recommend to all..very soft.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and are dense enough to do what they need to do.</li>
            <li>They are soft but not dense enough for my liking.</li>
            <li>They held their fluff much longer than the others.</li>
            <li>The brushes are moderately dense and have a soft texture, but I feel they do not transfer my powders well.</li>
            <li>One of the bigger brushes fell apart with the bristles being detached to the handle completely.</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals as my makeup.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are as nice as my expensive Mac brushes.</li>
            <li>And the price is just crazy for how good these are.</li>
            <li>I own sigma brushes don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li>Today was the first time using the eyeshadow brushes and Iove these very firm and dense as well as soft!!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that one of them is a little loose where the metal attaches to the handle, it still works great.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft, comparable to other high end make up brushes I paid a lot for.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they smell strongly of chemicals or paint, but that&#x27;ll probably fade</li>
            <li>When I first got these, they had a slight smell but after washing them, the smell went away.</li>
            <li>first I thought the buffing brush was angled, turns out there&#x27;s both a slightly angled one (</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft but I have a feeling the only useful ones will be the small face brushes that I will use for my eye shadow</li>
            <li>These brushes are just as good as any expensive ones I&#x27;ve bought!  </li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and minimal shedding so far.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is the strong smell coming off them, however it doesn&#x27;t deter me from using  them daily.</li>
            <li>I washed them before I used them the first time because they smelled a little bit of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Another thing I noticed was that the density of the white brushes is higher than the black brushes.  </li>
            <li>Like some others mentioned there is a slight paint-like smell when you first open them.</li>
            <li>There is a slight smell to when you first open the package, but nothing that a wash can&#x27;t get rid off.</li>
            <li>Two of the brushes broke after the first few days</li>
            <li>After about a month of pretty consistent use, I noticed the brushes started to shed so heavily that I had to throw a few away.</li>
            <li>Soft, barely any loose bristles if any, and they grab the makeup.</li>
            <li>other than that they are decent brushes</li>
            <li>Soft and durable, when I receive the brushes their was a clear hard substance on the brushes but just washing them off fixed that.</li>

            <li> All the brushes are very good quality with really soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out.</li>

            <li> Arrived quickly and are amazing quality.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that foundation spreads and covers better using these brushes and they are easy to wash.</li>
            <li> Love them, they are so soft, and work great.</li>
            <li> I always love brushes that are soft and have great application.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, I love them so much I&#x27;m ordering another set now.</li>
            <li> nice soft brushes good value for money</li>
            <li> I was using the bare minerals full flawless face brush and let me just say that a 30 dollar brush is LITERALLY no comparison to these.  </li>
            <li> Very soft great brushes</li>
            <li> The synthetic bristles make them very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, the packeging is great, and it arrived in week.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they clean well and make my make process very smooth</li>
            <li> Package arrived in time time, excellent quality just plain AMAZING</li>
            <li> As others have described, there was a strong smell to them at first, but after a good washing the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so soft and blend out foundation so beautifully and so easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected ~ very nice brushes!</li>
            <li> Other then that im happy!:)</li>
            <li> They blend beautifully; you barely have to move the brush to blend your products; densely packed bristles make for an AH MAZE ING brush!</li>
            <li> They are very good quality; soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Wow, smelly like others have reviewed but work great for foundation, concealer, and contouring.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the most important</li>
            <li> A great variety for a complete look.</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on smoothly and evenly, which I love.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, and I recommend these to anyone who wants great brushes at a low price!</li>
            <li> They are soft and work great.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see them as great brushes just because they&#x27;re soft.</li>
            <li> I love it though it was cheap and</li>
            <li> They work well for the price and have a really great professional look to them.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure they will apply nice since they have the makings to do so, but if I notice that&#x27;s not the case</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this product for purchase because you can just go to target and purchase their brand make up brushes which are cheap and are way better in quality.</li>
            <li> Great value, no shedding, soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality so far.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and so great.</li>
            <li> They apply the makeup as expected and I like the foundation brushes the best.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money-nice, versatile, soft brushes.</li>
            <li> They are also great for blending, everything from foundation to eye shadow looks naturally blended.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, very happy that I purchase these brushes can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> and they are all great quality, soft and no fall out.</li>
            <li> Packaged really cheaply, or I would buy 10 more sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> So smooth and nice they work well so far and became a really good quality</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes and my order was fast.</li>
            <li> One would really get a good deal with this set.</li>
            <li> I actually loved them so much</li>
            <li> I really needed a good kabuki brush for applying mineral makeup</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good blending/foundation brush forever; I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much for just ONE brush, so I came across this set.</li>
            <li> They came in really fast, and they&#x27;re really good for the price.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t think twice, just get them:) they are soo worth it!</li>
            <li> other than that they&#x27;re wonderful</li>
            <li> and they do not leave streaks which I am very happy of compared to other</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re such good quality for your money!</li>
            <li> But for 3 years and such a good price - I can&#x27;t be upset!</li>
            <li> They blend super easy and are easy to handle!</li>
            <li> Ok I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these brushes.</li>
            <li> Sure makes putting on contouring makeup more fun.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use</li>

            <li> Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for some great, cheap brushes!</li>
            <li> I still prefer my Sedona Lace Midnight Brush set over these since they do not &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; as easily.</li>
            <li> I received my item very quick and works well.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use</li>
            <li> They are made of synthetic hair, really easy to clean,and will recommend them to family and friends</li>
            <li> Easy to use with makeup</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t rival my MAC brushes but they easily rival my Sephora ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good, decent brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes do have a strong smell</li>
            <li> Had a strong smell when i opened pack of brushes when they arrived.</li>
            <li> I agree that the strong smell took awhile to dissipate after opening the package.</li>
            <li> and before I even opened the plastic it smelled so strong of paint.  </li>
            <li> These brushes do have a strong scent to them.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t any strong smell.</li>
            <li> If you want reasonably decent brushes for a fair price, you have found them.</li>
            <li> So far so good,  I love them and each one applies just as well as my mac and sonia kashuk ones.</li>
            <li> they did have a strong smell</li>
            <li> but it smelt really strong in an alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> The smell was soo strong that it smelled up my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> But strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> The smell IS strong but it goes away.</li>
            <li> Smelled strongly of the plastic they came wrapped in.</li>
            <li> Strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> Out of the box the brushes all had a strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> Strong smell when opening.</li>
            <li> The brushes do have a strong smell to them.</li>
            <li> The handles feel good made of wood and high quality.</li>
            <li> Brush set was of high quality and good value.</li>
            <li> they are ok brush, noting special,</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly，I am very pleased &amp; highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The hair on the brushes are nice &amp; dense &amp; blends pretty.</li>
            <li> they are extremely soft and nice on the face!</li>
            <li> They came early which i realled liked!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the flat top or tapered kabuki, but they are still great brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own any of the more exprensive brushes these are supposed to be similar to or &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; for so I can&#x27;t compare, but I can say these are an excellent buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Item shipped very quickly and packaging was a huge plus.</li>
            <li> but now they are fine.</li>
            <li> One fell apart when I opened the bag, but I just glued it together and its held up just fine.</li>
            <li> Air them out (the bag smells) and they were fine.</li>
            <li> Super soft, professional looking, great variety, amazing value!</li>
            <li> Packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> I took mine out of the wrappers and let them air out &amp; they were absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> and they are fine</li>
            <li> were fine.</li>
            <li> The brushes did come with a chemical smell, but after being washed they were fine.</li>
            <li> They use less product, lays your liquid foundation flawlessly onto your face.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and durable brushes!</li>
            <li> arrived suprisingly quick!</li>
            <li> With this collection of brushes I have everything including a flat top brush for buffing which works perfect for minerals as well as a few rounded brushes which also work great.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re great and super soft brushes</li>

            <li> I love them soooo much!!</li>
            <li> THE SMALLER ONES ARE TOO LARGE TO USE FOR SHADING BUT PERFECT FOR BLENDING.</li>
            <li> These are the best make up brushs hands down!</li>
            <li> I have a huge collection of brushes</li>
            <li> Smooth application, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought them because they were cheap</li>
            <li> but I glued it back together and still work great</li>
            <li> I own the Sedona lace brushes, they are very pricey .I</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews a lot of people said they are cheaply made .</li>
            <li> like I wanted it to, was too light.</li>
            <li> These are so cheap just take a chance</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re like me, this deal won me over because I read a review that said it came in a package, I uploaded a picture of it, it&#x27;s a cheap bag.</li>
            <li> With the free Amazon shipping it came in 1 day 😳</li>
            <li> It blends and applys on so smooth.</li>
            <li> Before, I only used MAC brushes but these work great for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Great brushes the only downfall is the smell</li>
            <li> I really was hoping these would be amazing.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to buy them because the mixed reviews, but I am happy I did.</li>

            <li> Cheap material</li>
            <li> I think it might come from the handles, I&#x27;m hoping the bristles aren&#x27;t just cheaply coated.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The brushes put the makeup on smoothly without getting blotchy.</li>
            <li> I own brushes from ELF, Real Techniques, Walmart &amp; CVS Brands.</li>
            <li> They work fabulously for every day makeup application.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a fantastic quality for the price</li>
            <li> But, I decided to move on because it was a cheap buy.  </li>

            <li> but so far so good</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Soft, durable and good looking as well.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> They are all good quality and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Good so far.</li>
            <li> They are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and so beautiful, it is a shame to use them to apply makeup really!  </li>
            <li> will continue to use these brushes until I find a new set more suitable to my needs.</li>
            <li> They are SUPER soft, maybe the softest brushes I own!</li>
            <li> Best brushes I was really surprised to be honest due to the pricing of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve been applying my liquid foundations with the flat top brush, and the blending and coverage it leaves is amazing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them to everyone and will be ordering more for gifts!</li>
            <li> Again I can&#x27;t be overly critical for such a great price for a set of 8 great brushes, when most higher end brushes start off around $10-$15 per brush.</li>
            <li> However, natural bristle brushes are better in general and if you buy ones of excellent quality, they will last for decades (if you take good care of them).  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Super soft came in a cheap looking bag but brushes were in near perfect condition except for one or two hairs sticking out of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Even though they are synthetic and not goat hair brushes still nice quality for a decent price.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush gives amazing, consistent coverage and the other brushes are a joy to use.</li>
            <li> love my new make up brushes ordering more.</li>
            <li> Amazing, soft... buy these brushes!!</li>
            <li> Super great buy and definitely recommend!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have paid this amount for a single brush so to get all of these different high quality brushes is truly a great value and superb buy!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft which I love!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are very soft and I was extremely impressed initially, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They have a good performance in general.</li>
            <li> Other than that they work almost as good as my Sigma brushes for 1/8 of the price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li> you are looking for a set that is not expensive and do the job, this is ok.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I compared them to my tarte kabuki brush and my bare minerals brushes and they&#x27;re just as good.</li>
            <li> Def worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Worth the price paid!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the smell of paint, but I am pretty sure once they have been shampooed and cleaned the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I literally was able to use an eighth of what I usually put into my bare minerals lid (and I don&#x27;t put a lot) and got a beautiful superior coverage.  </li>
            <li> I showed this brush to my MUA cousin, and she said it was very good quality and very comparable to the Sigmax essential brush kit for $150!</li>
            <li> very good, live up to sigma brush quality - I use the smaller tapered &amp; round brushes for concealer and they work awesome</li>
            <li> super cheap as well</li>
            <li> I think they re a really good deal for such a cheap cost</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what would happen when the time comes to clean the brush,,,,,,You</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional deal and the brushes are super soft without any fall out.  </li>
            <li> For the price these work very well..  Almost as good as Mac Brushes.. Highly recommend.!</li>
            <li> They are very soft yet nice and dense.</li>
            <li> Work really well, and are easy to clean!</li>
            <li> but wow i love them!</li>
            <li> Usually, I&#x27;m not a fan of synthetic brushes but this is a nice set for the price.  </li>
            <li> There is a strong paint odor right out of the package from the plastic</li>
            <li> I own the F80 by Sigma, and the flat top brush by BESTOPE is not as dense as the Sigma one.</li>
            <li> And Arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone who wants high quality brushes for a good deal.</li>
            <li> They are very soft to the skin &amp; very easy to clean .I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them, they&#x27;re so soft and blend eye shadows well, great price too.</li>
            <li> They are sooooooooo super soft and the price just makes these 10x better!</li>
            <li> A little rough packaging, just use a plastic bag sealed, hope that after the packaging more perfect; the use of items for a while, carding can also, more comfortable.</li>
            <li> These brushes really feel pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Soft, dense, efficient, amazing.</li>
            <li> These were my absolute favorite brushes until they were cleaned.</li>
            <li> I have a FULL REVIEW on my blog where I go in depth on everything about these brushes.</li>

            <li> I love them so much.</li>
            <li> I like them more than my real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> My make up really does go on so much better using these.</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes are really good quality.</li>
            <li> The stipple brush is good for applying foundation if you want sheer coverage.  </li>
            <li> Nice and soft no fallout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very well pleased with my order, got her in record time.</li>
            <li> I did not expect such good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> No bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing</li>
            <li> Not a bad price</li>
            <li> BUT THEY ARE NOT BAD EITHER.</li>
            <li> flat brush is the best I have ever used, with soft bristles that don&#x27;t hurt your skin, very dense to not just soak up and slosh foundation around but great for pressing the product in to give that air brushed look to the the skin,.</li>
            <li> These are really nice brushes that are super soft and don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li> REALLY NICE SET, SUPER SOFT AND MAKE UP GLIDES ON</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved these brushes and the fact that they got to my house less than a week made it even better.</li>
            <li> Super soft and glides nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li> The are very dense which it good for foundation and still very soft.</li>
            <li> They smelled really strongly of chemicals when I first opened them.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 days before the smell went away, but other than that they work great</li>
            <li> I love my new makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> They are not quite dense enough for applying powder over foundation but still better than most brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anybody that wants nice makeup brushes but doesn&#x27;t want to spend much.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Work very well and easy to clean,</li>
            <li> They arrived super quick, too.</li>
            <li> I was initially super geeked when I got these....</li>
            <li> I am proud to apply my very expensive makeup with these beautiful brushes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a quick case to put them in, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> However, I am super demanding when it comes to my brushes, I want to have no trace of a brush on my skin when I apply foundation.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes quickly.</li>
            <li> It went away with a quick wash and rinse with soap.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be a good buy for how much I paid.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and handle really well.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the quality, they are very dense, the only thing I noticed was a painty smell to them</li>
            <li> Okay, so first things first.</li>
            <li> These could have easily been priced on the high end and would have been justified.  </li>
            <li> Love my brushes they&#x27;re so soft and gentle!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them and I love them.</li>
            <li> They perform just as well as high end brushes, but for a much better price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> The flat head large brush is great for applying foundation in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> these brushes are awesome!!they are very inexpensive and very soft and gentle on my skin by far best dupe I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> Forever, MAC and Smashbox brushes as my primary set and have started using these first.</li>
            <li> Very dense and soft, and make up application is a lot more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I love the flat top foundation brush...</li>
            <li> Cheap product, brushes have been shedding since first day of use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and easy to use!  </li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice for starting a bigger and better makeup collection.</li>
            <li> When I first received them I was super excited, as soon as I opened them they had a funky smell</li>
            <li> Pretty great for the money spent.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are great for packing on shadow, but their sizes and shapes are rather odd, imo,</li>
            <li> But it is a very noticeable and strong smell.</li>
            <li> For anyone starting a collection, this would be a good first purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have several high end brushes, but these are the best by far.</li>
            <li> Love them, very soft and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> there very soft on my skin.i just wish a couple of the brushes were better for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes in the mail today and let me just say I absolutely LOVE them so far!</li>
            <li> Every brush does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to!</li>

            <li> I love the brushes, really soft!</li>
            <li> Overall , i&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Perhaps these brushes will get a 5 star rating after I put them to the test, but as a first impression 4 stars it is!</li>
            <li> theyre super soft :)</li>
            <li> To get rid of the chemical-ish smell (and to clean my brushes every day), I wash them with hot water and Softsoap milk and honey liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and are super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect them to last for ever but great bargain for the price so far!</li>
            <li> I love these, I use them everyday and ordering more!</li>
            <li> The day after, when the brushes have finally dried, I was impressed at how soft the bristles were still!</li>
            <li> All the little brushes are great for the eyes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, good quality, good price, the bristles are super soft, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> They feel strong and rich and soft.</li>
            <li> And they are very dense, so they don&#x27;t feel like a cheap makeup</li>
            <li> I get such amazing pay off when I use this with my revlon color stay foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few months and they started out working great.</li>
            <li> Great set and price, I use this set everyday</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing for only.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too firm and they have a great shape.</li>
            <li> Everyone has their own personal preference</li>
            <li> They are so nice besides the fact that I got 2 of the same brushes and not receive a tappered brush</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes are really nice, but almost a Dupe of a Dupe.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> These are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> they are soft and apply my makeup smoothly!</li>

            <li> Not bleach, but definitely some kind of a cleaning agent.</li>
            <li> They are completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Soft; easy to clean</li>
            <li> Soft brushes but make sure you wash your brushes because the brushes intially smell like paint.</li>

            <li> They are much better than my old brushes from estee lauder.</li>

            <li> good product came faster than expected</li>
            <li> They are so soft, but yet firm; which is perfect for blending and applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I guess it is not a big deal, but it would be nice to know.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use them right away but now these are one of the most important parts of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Not too soft or stiff, perfect for packing on color in the correct areas...</li>
            <li> They are very soft and very full ... worth the money i purchased them for .</li>
            <li> Brushes had a slight scent of alcohol when first received, but are great for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft and nice only thing is the strong smell</li>
            <li> With bristles ranging from stiff to softer.&lt;br /&gt;Application is great</li>
            <li> The bristles are not easily removed, which makes me happy.</li>
            <li> but it dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> These came super fast!</li>
            <li> This goes away pretty quickly once they have been exposed to air for a bit.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price - smells a little funny at first but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived super quick, These brushes are super dense snd extremely soft!!</li>
            <li> They are soft and feel so nice on the skin.and I highly recommend this makeup brush set.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and would definitely purchase this as a gift for a good friend.</li>
            <li> they do the job right.</li>
            <li> The price was right, so I bought these.</li>
            <li> the smell went right away...</li>
            <li> So I just washed them and it came right out.</li>
            <li> and one of my brushes right out of the box fell apart, but I just glued that would superglue</li>
            <li> smelled right out the bag.</li>
            <li> They came right on time according to the estimated date.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for just the right brushes and found these.  </li>
            <li> just right and trust me</li>
            <li> These brushes were a great price and are pretty firm.</li>
            <li> Just clean them before using if thats a real concern.</li>
            <li> Super soft, Packed tightly enough for good product pickup and blending.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty sure my sisters like them.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that when you first get them they kind of smell funky , but that smell does go away.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived super fast and the package is so professional and cute.</li>
            <li> Brushes are really nice and dense but bristles are reallyy flimsy and they smell like sharpies when you first open the package.</li>
            <li> The several different kinds of brushes are very useful in applying makeup and they are easy to clean for the most part.</li>
            <li> The only down point, they didn&#x27;t come with information on best uses.  </li>
            <li> Very large brushes&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Especially because I am pregnant, maybe my nose is more sensitve, but it is unbearable to me.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy and very full and soft.</li>
            <li> I have may high end brushes and these ones are pretty good for the price if you do not want to spend big money for some brand ones.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and I love the flat top brush for my foundation.</li>
            <li> high end brushes are ridiculously priced so this is a wonderful compromise</li>
            <li> I have the bare minerals brush that goes with their serum foundation, it cost about $28, there is a brush in here that does a job that is 5x better than that brush</li>
            <li> Great brushes worth the money and feel a lot more expensive.......</li>
            <li> these are nice looking set but not really soft and after the use</li>
            <li> Just go it , Not bad at all ,They are SUPER soft and pretty !</li>
            <li> Very soft and super durable!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t clean super easily and they smell weird out of the package but overall they great!</li>
            <li> I can truly relate them to the sigma brushes but a better price and a little bit better quality.</li>
            <li> They did smell funny right out of the packaging</li>
            <li> These brushes came super fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> They make blending so easily and the hairs are so soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes well worth the money I have purchased four different brush sets and none</li>
            <li> Buy these brushes, They are as good as Trish and way less money.</li>
            <li> Delivered super fast.</li>
            <li> Received the items super fast which is a plus.</li>
            <li> She will be surprised when she gets them because the quality of these brushes easily beats what I paid for them.)</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t used these brushes yet but overall, I think these brushes are a good bargain because they are dense and soft.</li>
            <li> They ship super fast and come just like it says</li>
            <li> Received them in the mail super fast....</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that the brushes were such good quality.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and blend so easily.</li>
            <li> They are soft, high quality and clean easily.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these they are very soft on the face and don&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> they are OK, but I will still go with an other brand looking for better quality, not professional a better ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality is fantastic, very soft.</li>
            <li> super super soft!</li>
            <li> I use the large flat top for powder foundation, the rounded flat top for liquid foundation blending, the angled flat brush for blush and bronzer, and surprisingly the oval pointed brush for patting in and setting my under-eye concealer.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was expecting more since there were so many great reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are also very pretty in person and work very well for applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> it has the perfect length for my face and is stiff enough to blend your product well.</li>
            <li> sometimes they loose hairs , but they are nice.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very high Quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Love the smaller brushes for eyeshadow and for blending out my contouring and highlighting on my face (especially the nose) and the larger brushes are great for buffing out foundation, applying blush, and setting foundation with a powder.</li>
            <li> Received them very fast.</li>
            <li> I like this set very much.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It came with a cute pink eco friendly bag.</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely cute, quality is better then I expected, and the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> I apply foundation to my face with one of them, that&#x27;s a good technique to hide skin imperfections or those little scars that remain after acne with the years.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and came fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> they appeared to be high quality full brushes.  </li>
            <li> they have funky strong smell when you open them, but it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Any time I use a new one I clean it with soap and water and then use them.</li>
            <li> I Simply can not believe the quality of these brushes for only $ 10, they loved, are the perfect blend brush and sufficiently rigid to apply hard and soft powder.</li>
            <li> I read most of the recent reviews as well.</li>
            <li> Really like these!</li>
            <li> I decided I would give these a try first</li>
            <li> Had three of the same face brushes, I wanted more of a variety.  </li>
            <li> They did have a funny smell to them when I first got them</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing a brush set.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> First time using them and they blended my make up so well.  </li>
            <li> These brushes and they came so fast in the mail!</li>
            <li> they do have a funny smell  at first</li>
            <li> These most likely came from CHINA.</li>
            <li> Better quality than some in the same price range.</li>
            <li> I love these brushed</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell funny</li>
            <li> its smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these makeup brushes!!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase on Amazon</li>
            <li> To many of the same brushes</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> and they arrived pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but mine are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described and affordable.</li>
            <li> I did have to use a hot glue gun to keep the metal piece on the handle.</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> and I love them, I will definitely be ordering these again when the time comes!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re exactly what you expect for when hoping all comes out well.</li>
            <li> But after washing them and caring for them BEFORE using them, they really were worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li> However, a couple of months later, they are just okay.  </li>
            <li> Alternatively you may just rinse them or wash them before using the first time.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush-set.</li>
            <li> when I first got them they smell like paint?</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> definitely getting more</li>
            <li> This is my first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did have a chemical smell at first but don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> When I first got them they smelled at first</li>
            <li> The first day I had them the handle broke off of one.</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> First things first: I am going to agree with the first impression SMELL,(they smell like ...</li>
            <li> If I continue liking them I&#x27;ll sure give them the extra stars(:</li>
            <li> These are better than beginner brushes for the price, actually.</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON &amp; BESTOPE!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, but wish that there were more smaller eye make up ones.</li>
            <li> Using it to apply makeup was also great and the quality compares just as good if not better to my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> MAGNIFICIENT definitely buying more for my mother and mother in law.</li>
            <li> First day I received and used them two of them broke ..</li>
            <li> Cheaply made in my opinion but the brushes are soft</li>
            <li> The big angled brush has to be my favorite brush in the set.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bestope!</li>
            <li> The quality is way better than the regular brushes I buy over the counter.</li>
            <li> After the first use the brushes fall apart.</li>
            <li> The brushes work pretty well.</li>
            <li> this might actually be my first product review for anything.</li>
            <li> I bought these as back up brushes but they are now my primary brushes that I use every day!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more, especially after reading reviews others</li>
            <li> They do smell like permanent markers though when I first opened them, so I recommend washing them before using.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes were good but the application of products especially the contour brush is too thick that the color would not go nicely to your face.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend investing on really good quality brushes for everyday usage.</li>
            <li> My new brushed are amazing</li>
            <li> They are super soft!!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft and incredibly useful.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the brushes are quite good, I haven&#x27;t had too much &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; and they seem to blend makeup really well.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve only tried the foundation brushes and I love them!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great they are very universal and can be used from anything from applying blush to a cream concealer to a concealer pencil,  to loose mineral powder,  contouring and highlighting,  </li>
            <li> great make up brushes, very soft, yet stiff too</li>
            <li> Someone said they&#x27;re just like the sigma brushes, I uploaded a picture of my sigma brush with the flat top brush that it comes with.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting these brushes from reading the previous reviews but as soon as I got my brushes and began to play them with them one broke off, after a day two more broke off.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was super excited to open up my package!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars overall based on the price and what seems to be good quality of the actual brush material.</li>
            <li> I just cannot get over the superior quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not the high/top quality I was expecting after reading prior reviews prior to purchase but they are good.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and have the right amount of density to pick up product and distribute it very well.</li>
            <li> I mean, they are from China and no one really likes the US, lol.</li>
            <li> Super soft, I use them almost every day!</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes !</li>
            <li> These are super soft!</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that mine smelled strong of chemicals when I first got them.</li>
            <li> Strong paint smell at first, but that doesn&#x27;t take away from the actual quality.</li>
            <li> and they had a really chemically smell when i first received them.</li>
            <li> the brushes are still left on my face but great gift for young girls starting out ..</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t give the full richness as the natural but then again price is a concern.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Full and soft.</li>
            <li> my new favorite brushes they are super soft don&#x27;t shed top quality only gave four stars because they are a bit bigger</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a set of brushes but they were cheaply made and fell apart easily.</li>
            <li> I mainly got it for the stippling brush, because I prefer using that for my foundation, but I&#x27;ve actually fallen in love with using the angled brush for my blush.</li>
            <li> but hey, they are brand new and freshly manufactured.</li>
            <li> Initially I was very happy and thought I had gotten a good deal, but when I washed them I realized that due to the cheap design any soap you use to wash them is literally IMPOSSIBLE to wash out.</li>
            <li> no shedding and super soft.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft and well built.</li>
            <li> super soft and no lose hairs.</li>
            <li> And the brushes are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> I compared these to the ones I own from sephora and bare minerals and the performance and texture are the same.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft</li>
            <li> but I will say they are super soft and I have not seen any shedding yet</li>
            <li> Super soft and the bristles didnt come out after i cleaned them and used them</li>
            <li> All the bristles stay intact and are super soft on my face.</li>
            <li> they are super soft.</li>
            <li> So soft,  and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Super soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and I have no problem at all with them picking up the product.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints as they&#x27;re super soft and dont shead.</li>
            <li> but now they&#x27;re just coming apart from the metal part, like the glue wasn&#x27;t strong enough or</li>
            <li> Most of the ones I looked at were $30-50 for a single brush.</li>
            <li> I use these every single day :)</li>
            <li> But as soon as I picked up the package I could smell it through the large bubble wrap interior manila envelope.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set mainly for the flat top kabuki and pointed foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> so strong that you can smell them when you walk into the room!! :/</li>
            <li> /&gt;They do have a very distinct paint smell when you first open up the package.</li>
            <li> Also, I did notice a pretty harsh chemical smell when I opened them, but they aired out fairly well.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own makeup every day for the past 10 years and these brushes have improved my skills and application right away.  </li>
            <li> I used them mostly for loose powder mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> However, two of the brush heads were detached from the handles and three more wee loose.</li>
            <li> The bristles are shedding, and the silver part of the brush is loose on most of them.  </li>
            <li> I was really just in the market for a nice that allowed me to use less makeup to get that coverage</li>
            <li> They are very soft, thick, and does a great job apply make up.  </li>
            <li> Have had no issues, almost a year later all the brushes are intact and work just fine.</li>
            <li> Initially they had a smell, but once I cleaned them they were fine.</li>
            <li> in all a pretty decent brush and value.</li>
            <li> feel apart after only two weeks..was able to super glue them back.</li>
            <li> very high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The description makes it sound as though there is an eyeliner brush (there is not), and all of the ones that could even possibly be used for the eyes are quite large.</li>
            <li> The handles are a little big and clunky but this is really a great set for the price.</li>
            <li> They are very soft!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so amazing for the price, iv had lots of expensive brushes in my life and these are quite comparable to many of them.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I have paid lots more for just one brush, so I was skeptical about how these were going to work -</li>
            <li> the Round Foundation Brushes I uses with my BareMinerals foundation and its amazing because it buffs the powder on my face without it looking cakey.</li>
            <li> Great brushes I use them everyday only wish they came in a case</li>
            <li> The silver metal on the brushes is solid, and not thin and cheap looking which is what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li> the hairs are coming out on some of them but arrived fast</li>
            <li> Thank you sooo much for fast shipment</li>
            <li> but i really do care.  </li>
            <li> These brushes added really chunky....not to much shedding.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well for my normal every day use.</li>
            <li> The hairs do not shed and it is very comfy to use.</li>
            <li> they look cheaply made some were glued on kinda of crooked</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Application was smooth and extremely similar to my Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> These are really sturdy brushes.</li>
            <li> These really are quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like them</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They blend everything very well</li>
            <li> They arrived fast.</li>

            <li> They are very durable.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> They are very well made.</li>
            <li> I really like that the brushes and metal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> They are dense and shaped really well.</li>
            <li> Works well, arrived fast and organized.</li>
            <li> They work very wel</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, these brushes shed too much &amp; most of them</li>
            <li> So much more than I expected for the cost.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Applied make-up very well..</li>
            <li> it is very well made.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was okay not what I expected</li>
            <li> I was amazed on how fast I received my order.  </li>
            <li> Im a beginner and don&#x27;t want to spend to much</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the eye brushes too much yet though.</li>
            <li> Makes blending much easier.</li>
            <li> Brushes don&#x27;t really hold the minerals as they should.</li>
            <li> Compares them to Sigma brushes that cost 10 times as much.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use them that much.</li>
            <li> So much so that my friends when they saw them almost didn&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> Some the heads fell out and like the foundation brush leaves lots of streaks and doesn&#x27;t pick up the makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> it came fast</li>
            <li> I really like to brushes and the variety that you get.</li>
            <li> I had been using the ELF powder brush and Real Techniques Expert Face Brush for my foundation before I got these.</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> They hold make up very well as well.</li>
            <li> then that they blend really well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think they perform very well</li>
            <li> I like them and was delivered fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, it is a must have!</li>
            <li> it will go away but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> I use the four smaller brushes for my eye makeup application and the fluffier ones are fantastic for blending the eyeshadow edges.  </li>
            <li> The construction of the brushes is better than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Now I can save so much on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> but I washed mine with gentle soap before using and it went away.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d way to much hair did not apply my foundation</li>
            <li> Brush quality was even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> They came much faster than I thought.</li>
            <li> But I washed them really well before using, and the smell went away.  </li>
            <li> These brushed arrived in a cute sliding zip bag, and then packaged in a clear cello envelope.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, but make sure to wash them before using them, they did have a chemical smell but a simple wash made the smell disappear.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, and they are super high quality.</li>
            <li> Seriously NO SHEADING, NO CLUMPY MAKEUP, AND GREAT FOR WET AND DRY PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> After 3 years one of the brushed is starting to shed (the flat top one which is the one I use the most).</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised when I stuck one of them in my NARS blushes and it picked it right up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice flat kabuki... similar to the SIGMA F80.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your brushes before you use them because like all new brushes there will be fallout and the smell isn&#x27;t the best but not that bad!</li>
            <li> If you are strapped for cash and need a starter kit of complexion brushes that you do not expect to be for consistent daily use, then these might work better for you, but for the price you should definitely look into Morphe, BH Cosmetics, Real Techniques, even the ELF pro brushes before considering these.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and pretty dense.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, love them.</li>
            <li> Other that that the brushes were okay.</li>
            <li> First off, wow!  </li>
            <li> Brissles are extremely durable and they are dry nice and quickly after machine washing.</li>
            <li> and I clean all my brushes regularly</li>
            <li> The brushes as so soft and easy to use and they are extra gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I will use my Elf Daily Spray to rid off the scent and clean them as well.</li>
            <li> Nice set for the price but who knows how long they will last.</li>
            <li> The Bristles: amazing and soft nice and thick, minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> This make-up brush set are of high quality and really well made.</li>
            <li> right, in the photo) and a normal one (direct middle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that they have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other inexpensive brushes before (free ones with purchase) and those have shed in the first use.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes have held up better which I can only assume is because I just don&#x27;t use them very often.</li>
            <li> They smelled normal to me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, these feel and work really well for the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and blend very well!</li>
            <li> When I used used them for the first time they were so soft.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bristles are good; however, the wooden handle on one of the bigger brushes already came off after several uses.  </li>
            <li> Pretty nice brushes, but they smell a little strange when you first receive them.</li>
            <li> I will say they do smell kind of like paint when you first open them (just the black part of the barrel)</li>
            <li> and I mean none have been as good as these they&#x27;re soft to the skin but work well !</li>
            <li> Honestly they&#x27;re so soft, smell a little package</li>
            <li> They are easily my new go to brushes!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, and came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I even love the matte black handles.</li>
            <li> SO IN LOVE I HAVE THROWN AWAY HALF OF MY BRUSHES FOR THIS SET</li>
            <li> These brushes came SO quickly with standard delivery I had to check my receipt!</li>
            <li> They worked better than some of my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It does have a smell when you first open the package, but that goes away with the first cleaning.</li>
            <li> They apply makeup decently, but I would recommend​ washing them before use.</li>
            <li> I usually use elf brushes which are pretty inexpensiv, but these are even better.  </li>
            <li> They all ship in individual wrapping and they ship quickly.</li>
            <li> I found that they made my makeup stay on longer and appear more vivid than my other brushes.</li>
            <li> For the price I guess they are decent, though.</li>
            <li> can get better quality brush sets at your local pharmacy, Target, or Walmart for around the same price point.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are of decent quality and work well with creams or powder.</li>
            <li> The round top is comparable to the Real Techniques buffing brush.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous not knowing how they would work or the feel of the brush, but the brushes are very soft and work well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and handle is very strudy</li>
            <li> very soft, works very well</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft!</li>
            <li> just because they&#x27;re soft doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re good brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li> Would highly recommend....</li>
            <li> I actually feel cheated when it comes to the other brushes I own.</li>
            <li> Seems like I have to pump a little bit more liquid foundation for coverage.</li>
            <li> I think they might be a little better</li>
            <li> Love the little ones as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great set for someone who is just starting to take makeup a little more seriously.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers in regards to a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Their handles are hard ,nice weight.</li>
            <li> Great brush set for the price but the brush roll gets very dirty easily if you don&#x27;t keep up with the cleaning of the brushes.</li>
            <li> So soft and gently on the skin..</li>
            <li> Got these for my 13 year old daughter and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too soft, they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> They are very dense and apply makeup well, but you aren&#x27;t buying professional grade brushes.</li>
            <li> really anything you need to complete your look.</li>
            <li> soft, and apply makeup very evenly.</li>
            <li> Very dense but also soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very dense and soft.</li>
            <li> so soft and blend really well ..</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and and the brush itself is very dense.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes, fast delivery</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and very durable.</li>
            <li> The pink small bag them come in is great for traveling as well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very dense and soft with no fallout.</li>
            <li> The brushes are just as they are described &amp; they are amazingly soft, &amp; the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I think they are as soft and work as well as my Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very silky soft.</li>
            <li> So i was thrilled to find such quality at such low pricing!</li>
            <li> but the hairs ripped out and now everywhere after normal use.</li>
            <li> still soft and nice quality but overall not really comparable to the sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes just sucks</li>
            <li> Example: eye shadow applier brush is fatter than normal.</li>
            <li> The only brushes that are good in this set are the small brushes used for eye shadows/concealers.</li>
            <li> Love these, use everyday.</li>
            <li> To be synthetic, they feel pretty soft, like natural.  </li>
            <li> once you first get them, but barely at all.</li>
            <li> shipping was pretty alright fast enough.</li>
            <li> I have no complaint on the quality of the bristles; however.  </li>
            <li> me start by saying I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.  </li>
            <li> Since you are supposed to wash your brushes before first use this shouldn&#x27;t be a real problem to anyone because the smell goes away instantly.</li>
            <li> I spent $300 on Sigma brushes and these are just as soft and nice, I will definitely be telling everyone about these!</li>
            <li> I am getting married next month and wanted to buy new brushes without spending so much on them.</li>
            <li> They also go right back to normal after washing.</li>
            <li> There is a strong smell, but if you wash your brushes properly it&#x27;s not noticeable (and really, who would put something out of a factory directly onto their face/body whether it&#x27;s makeup brushes or a new t-shirt, gross).</li>
            <li> I constantly read about brushes with a smell, I always thought people were exagerating and too sensitive, no these brushes come with like a super glue scent.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and they are super soft and standard sizes.</li>
            <li> But very soft and not harsh on face!!</li>
            <li> Only problem is, now that I&#x27;ve been using them, my most used brushes are coming loose from the handle at the metal part.</li>
            <li> but that can easily be washed out (: soo as far as that I&#x27;m going to judge them by function within this week &amp; other than that I give them a 3 for now because they&#x27;re sensitively soft and not tough on my hands</li>
            <li> The only brush I don&#x27;t really ever use is the large tapered brush.</li>
            <li> of the eye brushes are stiffer than what I&#x27;d like, but they aren&#x27;t sharp or pokey at all like with cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I feel like they are not quite on par with Real Techniques brushes but better than your average generic drugstore brushes.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a new one, so as I was looking around on Amazon</li>
            <li> It just smells like brand new, just manufactured smell...</li>
            <li> IlAs a makeup artist I like to try new things to see if they work.  </li>
            <li> with  my new  brushes.</li>
            <li> let me know they were new and had never been used.</li>
            <li> Their is no hair loss on the brush and it smells like a new car</li>
            <li> I am new to using brushes to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> They do absorb a lot of product which is fine and the little brushes, that are a bit more wispy, shed just a little.</li>
            <li> I did have one that came off of its black handle... but an easy fix .</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say about them is they are  a slightly bit more flexible then the real techs brushes.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and steady, it doesn&#x27;t fall.</li>
            <li> Its firm yet soft, work just as well as the name brand, love this product.</li>
            <li> They are smaller and more dense than I expected.</li>
            <li> The bag did smell like paint when I opened it, which I found really odd because it was STRONG so the brushes got the scent too.</li>
            <li> Love the little tote bag they come with!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure I could use one as a blush brush since the one I had bought a little while back was a bit too soft.</li>
            <li> But already after about 2.5 months of use the ferrule is barely hanging onto the handle on 3 of the large brushes.</li>
            <li> those brushes are very soft when you apply to you face.</li>
            <li> Very soft and versatile.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> they were very soft.</li>
            <li> The brush feels very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft on your skin and apply my makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> theyre very soft but they don&#x27;t seem to sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> I like it ,its very  soft</li>
            <li> Bristles themselves were very soft, and picked up pigment</li>
            <li> In all no brushes were damaged and all very soft</li>
            <li> The brushes are sturdy and very soft.</li>
            <li> Very very soft bristles...</li>
            <li> These feel soooo soft and high quality.</li>
            <li> Their very soft like velvet.</li>
            <li> The bristles are all VERY soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft, haven&#x27;t got a chance to use them yet but will update when I have.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice and soft but it did come with a weird smell</li>
            <li> No initial shedding with the first application.</li>
            <li> The only problem with these is the first brush in the picture (tapered brush)</li>
            <li> When they arrived I was so pleasantly surprised, however!</li>
            <li> Have to hot glue the wood and the silver part back</li>
            <li> so I had to glue them back on but the quality of the fibers are pretty unreal for the price.  </li>
            <li> in that they don&#x27;t have specific uses (e.g., crease) but are pretty interchangeable.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and work so well!</li>
            <li> But other than that, I love these and definitely would recommend to others /</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to air the brushes out when you first open them for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I did notice some of the brush hairs falling out when I first got them in one of the larger brushes...but it hasn&#x27;t happened since.</li>
            <li> The only off putting thing I have noted is that they feel greasy at first.</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Soft against your face!</li>
            <li> I bought ones before that look exactly like this but have the name brand and oddly enough</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy amazon brushes because more than once they have fallen apart on me immediately.</li>
            <li> Soft and no fall out !</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the handles; the handles are short and very thick--however these brushes are worth the price and they won&#x27;t disappoint you.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of makeup products and I almost like these more than the other larger brushes that came with my costal scents 22 piece brush set.</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li> So soft and dense!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t lose makeup in the brushes and they are soft to the touch!</li>
            <li> so I trust them on my face &amp; they look professional plus the size options are a must have !</li>
            <li> 3 of the 4 face brushes in this kit are pretty similar and I use them interchangeably for liquid and powder foundation.</li>
            <li> so soft could not belive the quality!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft !</li>
            <li> They are soft and don&#x27;t shed like a lot of other cheap brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are dense, soft, and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> I compared the round top kabuki to my real techniques buffing brush and as you can see they are practically the same.</li>
            <li> I do recommend washing them before you use them the first time just to get any leftover chemical residue left on the bristles.</li>
            <li> these are so soft!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and durable!</li>

            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> As soft as my Mac brushes!</li>
            <li> One brush handle is a little wiggly, but I can fix that easily.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect blending brush and are stiff enough to apply hard and soft powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist &amp; needed a new set to travel with.</li>
            <li> These are typical cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li> These, not only seem sturdy but they&#x27;re REALLY soft and don&#x27;t shed much!</li>
            <li> They are very soft and have held up so far with NO shedding.</li>
            <li> They are soft, lightweight, and look very professional.</li>
            <li> The flat kabuki brush is hands down my new favorite liquid foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I fixed it with a super glue, but then the other ones are starting to wiggle and are becoming loose as well.  </li>
            <li> There is a smell but only when you first open the package and not so much on the brush themselves</li>
            <li> Only real difference is that there&#x27;s no brand name stamp on the handle which I can live without.</li>
            <li> I live that the tips are white so you can really see how dirty/clean they are .</li>
            <li> They are okay, they&#x27;re all very stiff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any shedding, very soft and dense brushed.</li>
            <li> But other than that they are super soft and dense .</li>
            <li> But on the other hand, these brushes are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> They arrived in an &amp;#34;antimicrobial&amp;#34; zip pouch where each brush was individually encased in very cheap, loud, stiff plastic sleeves.</li>
            <li> Soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> but they are not as soft as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> They distribute product evenly and are really soft.</li>

            <li> All the brushes are soft without a doubt but they&#x27;re not dense.</li>
            <li> and I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much money for brushes especially after reading the reviews for these.</li>

            <li> Talked about how soft they were and how even and blended her makeup went on, I must say that I do see a difference so because I can see the difference I&#x27;ll give them 4 stars</li>

            <li> I am surprised at the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> They are soft and densely packed.</li>
            <li> They did have a funky smell to them when I first opened them, but I washed them and the smell was long gone.</li>
            <li> the hairs on these brushes are baby soft.</li>
            <li> and these are a very close second.</li>
            <li> Really professional</li>
            <li> Dense and soft.</li>
            <li> They are so soft.</li>
            <li> I cleaned them before I used them and none of the bristles fell off so far.</li>
            <li> I really like the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> these makeup brushes are amazing!The brushes are so soft and</li>
            <li> Love them but shipping was late</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> They are all extremely soft</li>
            <li> I contemplated over whether I sho buy them because come one that price is crazy good, but I went for it and my brushes arrived 2 days later in a cute pink bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft bristles but need to label them.</li>
            <li> no fall out so far</li>
            <li> They are so incredibly soft</li>
            <li> Extremely soft tips.</li>
            <li> Plus they came in early.</li>
            <li> They are soft &amp; dense, as they should be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are definintely soft to the touch and for the price that I paid</li>
            <li> I am honestly pleasantly surprised with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are definitely useable and worth purchasing if you want a simple set of brushes to start off with.</li>
            <li> though, these are good quality brushes with out the expensive price.</li>
            <li> good substitute for expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> They are my first real set of makeup brushes and they have not let me down yet.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use my brushes, after the second use, the handle of one of them fell off the brush, then the next day I had another brush happen the same thing...</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a few more eye makeup brushes and a flat kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> No&lt;br /&gt;Issues and still going strong after 2 months of heavy usage!</li>
            <li> Love how soft they are, they do have a weird smell at first though.</li>
            <li> For instance, a the smaller brushes in the black set are more dense/stiff than the white set.  </li>
            <li> Overall they are decent brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not great quality and have a very strong chemical odor.  </li>
            <li> They are high end brushes at low cost.</li>
            <li> They arrived earlier than I thought, they are truly high quality</li>
            <li> I would disagree in saying they&#x27;re the same quality as high end brushes but</li>
            <li> It came is an adorable little pink zipper bag and another clear bag.</li>
            <li> Usually I use cheap dollar store brushes and a sponge for my foundation</li>
            <li> My only issue is I think there are a few of the exact same brush, and I didnt need so many, but not really something to complain about.</li>
            <li> The stick and brushes are fatter than normal or like regular brushes.</li>
            <li> FINALLY I found one that seems so similar for more than half the price!.</li>
            <li> And the flat top big brush does a little as well.</li>
            <li> The only downside about the smaller brushes is that they are about 25% too large for eye makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I have not cleaned the bristles yet, but so far they are not loose.</li>
            <li> Not a single hair has come out and they are compact and soft.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t have much give, extremely soft fibers that aren&#x27;t rough at all.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the overwhelming paint smell which I hope goes away soon.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the handles aren&#x27;t very sturdy -- the stippling brush is already starting to dislodge some.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes skeptical that they would be similar to or as good of quality as the Sigma synthetic kabuki brush set.</li>
            <li> They had a very slight smell but not bad</li>
            <li> Although I have never purchased any high end makeup brushes since I can not bring myself to spending that much money on a brush when I am a single mom and brushes are not a high priority on my list, I was still skeptical about purchasing these without being able to see them first.</li>
            <li> very soft ,  the only thing is that you have to buy a container or a bag to keep them, because they come in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love these little brushes.</li>
            <li> My sister has tons of them and they are so similar and so soft on the face!</li>
            <li> I do own a few small Kabuki&#x27;s but did not have a complete set.</li>
            <li> I have MAC and other high end brushes that are very procy but last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I ordered another brand of flat kabuki brush that was the same price as this whole set.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the bristles felt very soft and the build was decent for the price range (BUT bear in mind that I did get a damaged set</li>
            <li> The pink bag the brushes came in smelled like someone had washed it in pure rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Meh, if you aren&#x27;t looking to have high quality brushes and aren&#x27;t looking for them to stay glued together for long - go for these.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and comparable to other high end brushes.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical based on the price and mixed reviews, but am so happy I took a chance.  </li>
            <li> These are as soft as my Sephora, Mac, and Urban Decay brushes.</li>
            <li> but I would definitely recommend to all..very soft.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and are dense enough to do what they need to do.</li>
            <li> They are soft but not dense enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> They held their fluff much longer than the others.</li>
            <li> The brushes are moderately dense and have a soft texture, but I feel they do not transfer my powders well.</li>
            <li> One of the bigger brushes fell apart with the bristles being detached to the handle completely.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals as my makeup.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are as nice as my expensive Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> And the price is just crazy for how good these are.</li>
            <li> I own sigma brushes don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Today was the first time using the eyeshadow brushes and Iove these very firm and dense as well as soft!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that one of them is a little loose where the metal attaches to the handle, it still works great.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft, comparable to other high end make up brushes I paid a lot for.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they smell strongly of chemicals or paint, but that&#x27;ll probably fade</li>
            <li> When I first got these, they had a slight smell but after washing them, the smell went away.</li>
            <li> first I thought the buffing brush was angled, turns out there&#x27;s both a slightly angled one (</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but I have a feeling the only useful ones will be the small face brushes that I will use for my eye shadow</li>
            <li> These brushes are just as good as any expensive ones I&#x27;ve bought!  </li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and minimal shedding so far.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the strong smell coming off them, however it doesn&#x27;t deter me from using  them daily.</li>
            <li> I washed them before I used them the first time because they smelled a little bit of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed was that the density of the white brushes is higher than the black brushes.  </li>
            <li> Like some others mentioned there is a slight paint-like smell when you first open them.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell to when you first open the package, but nothing that a wash can&#x27;t get rid off.</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes broke after the first few days</li>
            <li> After about a month of pretty consistent use, I noticed the brushes started to shed so heavily that I had to throw a few away.</li>
            <li> Soft, barely any loose bristles if any, and they grab the makeup.</li>
            <li> other than that they are decent brushes</li>
            <li> Soft and durable, when I receive the brushes their was a clear hard substance on the brushes but just washing them off fixed that.</li>
            <li> If they only last a short time, no huge loss since they did not cost much.</li>
            <li> Mine previous ones were getting very old and I read other reviews that compared these to high end</li>
            <li> I realize they were under $10, and I guess for that price they are good brushes, but I found them way to stiff and difficult for blending.</li>
            <li> I thought that at least 4 of the brushes would be fluffy, but none was, so they all pretty much serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the handle on one of the large brushes is about to break after very little use which is very disappointing because I like them quite well otherwise.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and unlike other inexpensive brushes the bristles don&#x27;t fall out at all.  </li>
            <li> The only thing negative I will say is that initially they have a string smell of paint when first removing them from the plastic.</li>
            <li> They have an odd smell to them, but that&#x27;s because they need to be washed before they&#x27;re used (just like any new brush).  </li>
            <li> I have only high end cosmetics and they can usually be harder to pick up powders vs other lower end brushes.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are too small to really use correctly for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Comparable to sigma but a little less sense but totally worth it....</li>
            <li> the metal neck is wobbly on the wooden base on two of them and when i use the bigger flat top one for my foundation it picks up too much product.</li>
            <li> Super soft, applies makeup as well as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I use the flat one for my liquid foundation</li>
            <li> Will see how long they last</li>
            <li> I started using the flat blending kabuki brush and there was some shedding.</li>
            <li> Not meant for long term use or if you&#x27;re constantly using them on clients.</li>
            <li> They will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t SUPER dense but the quality of these are unbelievable !!</li>
            <li> The fibers are just as soft but its like the black ones are &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handles of the brushes aren&#x27;t secured very well.</li>
            <li> the smaller bushers were a bit thicker than I had expected, I will leave another review as soon as I use them because of the thickness of the smaller brusher</li>
            <li> So Soft Yet Firm At The Same time.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of bristles and they are firm enough but still soft against the skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazingly soft and plush yet firm enough to do their job.  </li>
            <li> The brushes upon opening the box had a VERY distinctive chemical smell, which slowly faded after multiple washes.</li>
            <li> For the casual makeup user like myself (I enjoy putting on makeup but usually only wear makeup when I&#x27;m going out)</li>
            <li> I like that there not too soft and stiff enough to blend well.</li>
            <li> but the only thing is that one of the brushes got loose and came off</li>
            <li> Some of them came with the tiniest bit of shedding, but again, that stuff doesn&#x27;t bother me, cut them short, pull them out if they&#x27;re loose.</li>
            <li> I had some minor shedding in my first wash, and a few had stray hairs that needed to be trimmed down to size.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because I have ordered brush sets that are low quality in the same price range, but after reading the other reviews and the fact that they are so affordable I took a chance on these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no makeup brush connoisseur, but all I know is I spent half as much for this set of 8 brushes than I had spent on one brush from Sephora...</li>
            <li> You get a lot for your money but the have a very strong unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> Very strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Ultra soft, wash well, and little to no shedding.</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t long.</li>
            <li> I soaked them for way long and even tried apple cider vinegar, but no use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional</li>
            <li> I cannot rate these brushes for long term usage because I received them a week ago.</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on brushes as a makeup artist and painter in the last 25 years ranging in prices from $1-60.</li>
            <li> I spent over ten minutes rinsing one brush before I gave up and threw them all away soon after.</li>
            <li> One round top big brush was manufacture wrong on mine.</li>
            <li> Soft, but firm.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not as big as I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I had to trim up a couple long hairs</li>
            <li> These brushes are not meant to be long term use</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out what to do with the large round slightly pointy one</li>
            <li> The eye brush are a little too large in my opinion and I have found little use for them with the exception of one which I use for concealer.  </li>
            <li> metal tops loosen from wood base but is easy to fix with a little super glue.</li>
            <li> This whole set cost less than my Sigma F80 brush, which is the one I use everyday to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are a little large for small details like applying eyeliner or creating cat-eye looks , and definitely not for lip lining or defining eyebrows, but work well for contouring and blending.</li>
            <li> I mean, it was a very chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I took away one star due to various indentations on the brush handles and for the slightly larger brush heads--neither of which take away from the effectiveness of the brush but does make it look like it&#x27;s been chewed on and can sometimes wipe on product on too wide of an area.</li>
            <li> Out of the entire set, I only used 3 of the small ones and 1 of the big ones.</li>
            <li> Handles are still solid unlike other inexpensive brushes that come apart.</li>
            <li> I have more expensive brushes that I probably won&#x27;t use now!</li>
            <li> I like the flat kabuki for BB cream, the angled brush for blush, and the wide brush for powder.  </li>
            <li> I have been hunting for a set for a while that I could use universally for face products, and I am so thankful that I came across these instead of shelling out lots of money for other name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> They take very long to dry and don&#x27;t pick up product/disperse it evenly.</li>
            <li> And I am never pleased when buying something that is different than what I generally work</li>
            <li> I even washed it a few times but the last wash finally did it.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t be mad if they don&#x27;t last too long because they were quite cheap.</li>
            <li> I was also in the market for a smaller duo fibre brush for my concealer, and low and behold, the bundle had the two brushes I was in search of for less than a quarter of the price MAC or Ulta or even Target would charge me, and I got 8 of them!</li>
            <li> Every single handle detached from the metal piece that holds the handle and the brush together.</li>
            <li> Brushes were so soft, and not cheap!</li>
            <li> I watched a lot of reviews on YouTube and visited a few cosmetic stores and was set on purchasing various MAC eye makeup brushes and the Sigma flat kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> First one of the brushes came broken, silver part wasnt glued correctly.  </li>
            <li> I wash them at least two to three times a week and air dry, they are in like new condition each time.</li>
            <li> With some brushes lower priced brushes the handle may become loose over time.</li>
            <li> And even the ones I still have feel loose like the glue could stop holding at any second..pretty bummed.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box, the barrels of one of the brushes came loose and fell off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the problem of loose bristles falling out after use.</li>
            <li> No shedding or loose bits.</li>
            <li> After a while the handles separate and come loose</li>
            <li> The worst is after using the one larger angled brush ONCE a huge chunk of bristles just fell right out.  </li>
            <li> I bought a set in white and black.  </li>
            <li> 2 brushes break to half because not enough glue.</li>
            <li> It made application weird with longer strands, especially with the first 2 brushes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only been a week and a half</li>
            <li> They are all thickly bristled and soft!  </li>
            <li> I use the little brushes for under-the-eye concealing and the bigger ones for foundation and contouring.</li>
            <li> However, I like the shadow brushes, a little big, but I can work them.</li>
            <li> The only little problem might be the plastic/glue smell</li>
            <li> Not only this but the handles started to fall apart as well, and I am very careful about upside down drying after washes.</li>
            <li> I think some exaggerated a little bit on how they smelled; they smell wasn&#x27;t so harsh that you couldn&#x27;t be around them, nothing a wash can&#x27;t remove. :)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish there were smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall not impressed, go to Walmart and buy their synthetic brushes, you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> They are so soft that even the eye shadow brushes do not pull on the delicate skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> all of my brushes came separate absolutely no glue on the feral and in two separate pieces, do not expect quality.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no shedding what so ever..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from where they are being stored or what, but YUCK.&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected when I opened the package and it makes me leary to use these items on my face.</li>
            <li> Just having trouble with the wooden handles falling off of the metal part.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using these everyday.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll continue to use them with BB creams and power foundations over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes last month and have been using them almost everyday since then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-They feel lightweight, so I would be careful with the handles and not try to get ferrule wet</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> I almost spent $40 for a sigma foundation brush.</li>
            <li> It did come in a pink case</li>
            <li> After a few months one of the brushes handle fell off, but I glued it back on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on big name brands!</li>
            <li> Only a few of the hairs on the brushes have came off or weren&#x27;t even.</li>
            <li> Will give another review in a few months on how they hold up and last.</li>
            <li> Not very dense.</li>
            <li> No shedding &amp; I&#x27;m a rough washer</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to shed and feel rough after washing it.  </li>
            <li> When these arrived by nieces spent about 30 minutes rubbing them on their faces.</li>
            <li> I feel the flats tops aren&#x27;t stiff enough</li>
            <li> The small ones are actually bigger than pictured, and a little big for what I prefer for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> That was also the only brush I had a slight problem with, as the hairs on the brush were secured well but applied slightly off-center.</li>
            <li> They do have a weird smell when you first open them, but the smells goes away within a few days.</li>
            <li> The handles of the eye brushes are a little too long for my taste</li>
            <li> Soft but not good quality</li>
            <li> Not like other brushes for a similar price that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The do have a weird smell at first...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these other people are talking about.</li>
            <li> Then, I tried it for the first time and it was difficult to apply powder over my foundation because the brush, instead of applying the powder  (i used highlight colors from anastasia&#x27;s contour kit)</li>
            <li> no matter how many times i wash them the smell won&#x27;t go away. :(</li>
            <li> There is no bristle fallout like other brushes that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Weird paint smell at first</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed at all, not like other inexpensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think about deciding what other brush set to get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical at first reading all the reviews about the smell of the brushes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve bought other brushes and they had that smell</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t steal a lot of your product like some other brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> They will never know what you really spent!</li>
            <li> other reviews:&lt;br</li>
            <li> The larger brushes have fairly small heads for what they should be used for.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first bought them</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail (literally 2 minutes ago) and they arrived a lot sooner then expected!</li>
            <li> I hate paying so much for brushes especially since I&#x27;m a young mother in school.</li>
            <li> I have two broken brushes, wish I can return them and get new ones again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really bad, strong glue smell.  </li>
            <li> I trimmed a few bristles that looked like they were coming loose.</li>
            <li> The smell was unpleasant but you have to clean them and air them out before use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a foundation brush that I actually like using.</li>
            <li> They are washed weekly, and I have not dealt with shedding (although a brush or two is developing a loose base where the brush head is glued to the handle, but I can easily repair that with wood glue or superglue).</li>
            <li> It smells really bad when you first open the package.</li>
            <li> The ONLY bad thing I can say about them is the smell when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li> They are dense enough and soft enough, I am rather shocked at the quality.</li>
            <li> Eye brushes too big and face brushes too small and stiff.</li>
            <li> Also I didn&#x27;t pull out the long strand that each brush had I just cut it down to the normal size, nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> the few that were glued were crooked and not nice.  </li>
            <li> my previous blush brush.</li>
            <li> Half the brushes came off of the handle even before use...have to re glue with gorilla glue...</li>
            <li> have it brushed to the wrong spot because the brush doesn&#x27;t move properly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the black and silver ones.</li>
            <li> They arrived at my house very quickly, less that a week I believe.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s used these, much less blotchy, cakey.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about these brushes being only the $11 something dollars I paid for them, but have become my holy grail of daily use.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a less costly version this is it.</li>
            <li> Slight chemical smell washes away after one wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recounting my previous statement.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you can&#x27;t afford those expensive brushes</li>
            <li> I spent less than what I usually spend on an eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> ** Trying to add my photos which compare the size of a MAC 217 brush with these but no link available to upload :(</li>
            <li> I have lots of brand names &amp; are they a little less dense?</li>
            <li> saw a few comments putting these down, so I was a bit worried, but I&#x27;ve now been using them for a while now</li>
            <li> They are not as harsh on my contour palet as the other brushes!</li>
            <li> The bristles are tightly packed and are so dense..they do smell but one wash and</li>
            <li> But these bristles aren&#x27;t packed as tightly in the metal casing so the soap gets up in there and WILL NOT COME OUT.</li>
            <li> So much so that I had to throw 2 of the big ones away! :(</li>
            <li> Sadly this set didn&#x27;t last long for me.</li>
            <li> For the smell, yes they smell a little funky like plastic</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical as everyone else because of the price, but what a surprise!</li>
            <li> so you will have to cut the little &amp;#34;strays&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The have little to none shedding.  </li>
            <li> The little silver part keeps coming off and the brushes detach from the bottom</li>
            <li> a little flimsy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I even tugged a little and nothing which for the price i was worried itd have the little hairs everywhere</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little irritating.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I was a little sketchy about buying these brushes over amazon</li>
            <li> These brushes do smell A LITTLE</li>
            <li> There was a plastic smell coming from them in the packaging but once removed &amp; washed with a little Purity, bam gone.</li>
            <li> Comes in the cutest little bag</li>
            <li> and I would still say it is a little under priced.</li>
            <li> I have had them for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I have had them for about two weeks now, and I cannot put them down!</li>
            <li> had dried glue in a part of the bristles.</li>
            <li> A few fell apart on opening😞</li>
            <li> I do not wear make-up everyday.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical about this product like everyone else was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes everyday since they came in the mail.</li>
            <li> I use this brushes everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now</li>
            <li> There is a v shape on the side with bristle missing.</li>
            <li> the wood feels really firm, the bristles are packed in their and</li>
            <li> I have a lot of expensive brushes from Mac and Japonesque, but these are my favorites by far.</li>
            <li> evenly left streaks behind.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed horribly either but the bristles are kind of uneven</li>
            <li> Got them in less than a week too!</li>
            <li> So my boyfriend cut out what bristles were stiff.</li>
            <li> The pointed stiff brush I like for buffing in concealer under the eye and also using to pat powder under the eye.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are decent for the price, but the face brushes are kindkf awkward shaped.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used them about everyday for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> A little superglue fixed the issue, but it was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Fell apart right away  :(</li>
            <li> its definitely not as good quality as the other ones out there</li>
            <li> These brushes have had very little shedding</li>
            <li> She was totally shocked when she used them, then told her how much they were.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion, I recommend these brushes for someone that&#x27;s just starting with makeup and someone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend money on expensive brushes, like me.</li>
            <li> and I use the small angled brush to set my liquid with powder when I&#x27;m contouring.</li>
            <li> Came in from china which is something I usually don&#x27;t trust, should have paid closer attention.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like how the brush fibers (not sure of material) feel on my face</li>
            <li> broke off:/ I will say I do like the small ones</li>
            <li> Only thing they smelled awful when I first got them</li>
            <li> i usually tuin my brushes washing them?</li>
            <li> I washed them at the same time as my expensive Sigma brushes and the soap washed out of those with no problem.</li>
            <li> I usually name a pros and cons list, but there are no cons to give.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a part of my everyday makeup routine now!</li>
            <li> Definitely not the fake plastick feeling.</li>
            <li> The reviews were dead on, in these did not disappoint me at all!</li>
            <li> However, the quality of the brushes were extremely rough and irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said that they came squished in a small box</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how they would apply those products.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a damp sponge over any brush</li>
            <li> Sadly I pulled one of the hairs from the Angled kabuki brush and it resulted in more hairs coming out :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> these brushes do the job and aren&#x27;t harsh on the face at all!</li>
            <li> Not very good because they  are too flimsy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend I&#x27;m shocked at how they are cheaper</li>
            <li> There was some shedding, but my biggest problem was with random long strands that need to be cut/trimmed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how common this is).</li>
            <li> The hair brush is too hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No bad scent nor too dense or soft</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of $$ for one foundation brush from an expensive make up line</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, so I am not that bummed, but I just wish they had at least lasted thru the end of the year.  </li>
            <li> None of the brushes were broken or missing any pieces.</li>
            <li> They are thick and sturdy with no shedding.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else said there is a little smell when they first arrive but nothing horrible just let them sit out then wash them.</li>
            <li> unbelievable quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that there were no small brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li> These brushes will cost you less and you can experiment with HOW to place the make up without going broke!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious guys.</li>
            <li> Sorry for previous review I did get them.just don&#x27;t knw what brushes is for what</li>
            <li> Seriously....</li>
            <li> Seriously, spend the $17 and get these brushes.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because of the price &amp; not being &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Honestly not good brushes.</li>
            <li> I desperately wanted the Sigma F80,82,84,86 and after my husband saw the price he said absolutely not.</li>
            <li> Weird smell when it arrived in the packaging, but that went away after a few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on sigma or expensive brushes, you want these.</li>
            <li> Hardly any shedding if any!</li>
            <li> They do smell horrible at first</li>
            <li> Not very impressed</li>
            <li> But after this purchase, once I&#x27;m tired of these brushes I&#x27;ll just buy the sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any shedding whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Some reviews mentioned the brushes coming broken or in two pieces</li>
            <li> 3 of them comes broken.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t shed or broken.</li>
            <li> There could be worse.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks the brushes have broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase at all.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s bugging me is that after just one use they seem to look filthy</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE NOT GREAT</li>
            <li> Did not even smell bad like I read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> seriously this was a steal!</li>
            <li> My only negative is they smell horrible.</li>
            <li> unfortunately handles are two pieces and poorly glued.</li>
            <li> I was so nervous and skeptical of buying these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so weird.</li>
            <li> But they do smell weird when you take them out of package.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to buy one of those Premium Expensive Sigma Brushes.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this bases on the reviews, but unfortunately they are not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price</li>
            <li> I was skeptical by how inexpensive these brushes are</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t go wrong with these guys.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve worked for companies who make expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Disappointed... :/</li>
            <li> The cuts on the face brushes are not perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so obsessed with these.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately one of the eye-shadow brushes arrived damaged.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these brushes, I am a licensed cosmetologist and do a lot of make up services.</li>
            <li> I hate all black brushes !</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t like a bad smell just weird...</li>
            <li> Just grab some crazy glue to reattach the brush to the handle &amp; keep going.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get crazy tactical on the buy just because it comes with some hairs out of place, it&#x27;s Amazon, you&#x27;re paying $10.</li>
            <li> I was afraid these would be flimsy but no .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really disappointing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to rewash the rest and debating about tossing them.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable unpleasant paint/plastic smell, but that lessens with airing out and washing the brushes.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about these brushes...wash them and the paint sell goes away.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
            <li> I feel bad for the girls who don&#x27;t know about this yet.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not too bad, yeah</li>

            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed 😳</li>
            <li> The brush comes aprt from the base in the 1st 10 minutes of using.</li>
            <li> Just one bad thing i had to say was the terrible chemical smell.</li>
            <li> they do in fact smell very bad, I assume they spray painted the silver parts</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love. Soft and sturdy. With some brushes lower priced brushes the handle may become loose over time. Just grab some crazy glue to reattach the brush to the handle &amp; keep going. I am so glad I purchased these and they arrived in time for a wedding I&#x27;m doing. I read most of the recent reviews as well. Great buy! Amazing price</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was hoping.  The bristles are coming out and we&#x27;re falling out of some of brushes prior to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought better brushes in Walmart.  One of heads has already come apart.</li>
            <li> These brushes have had very little shedding but they are not as soft as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes. Very soft to the touch but perfect for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> These are really nice brushes that are super soft and don&#x27;t fall out.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect these brushes to be incredible since they&#x27;re so inexpensive... But already after about 2.5 months of use the ferrule is barely hanging onto the handle on 3 of the large brushes. They take very long to dry and don&#x27;t pick up product/disperse it evenly. I recommend saving up for a beauty blender or some it cosmetics, sigma, or Luxie brushes.</li>
            <li> the hairs are coming out on some of them but arrived fast</li>
            <li> The only reason why I won&#x27;t give 5 stars would be because of the smell! Other then that these brushes are great for the price! I would def. recommend these.</li>
            <li> no shedding and super soft.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. Good quality brushes and my order was fast.</li>
            <li> all of my brushes came separate absolutely no glue on the feral and in two separate pieces, do not expect quality. the few that were glued were crooked and not nice.  plus they have a very strong chemical scent</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes broke after the first few days and I had to glue them back together. And the hairs shed.</li>
            <li> Fell apart right away  :(</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They are so soft, holds makeup well and blends really good.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good. and are a great value.  Keep in mind (as stated) they are synthetic so they don&#x27;t give the full richness as the natural but then again price is a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a pretty decent brush and value.</li>
            <li> Good, decent brushes.</li>
            <li> Beautiful make up brushes &amp; the quality is nice!!</li>
            <li> I have a rabbit and these brushes are softer than his fur. I even showed them to my husband and he said, ever so eloquently, &amp;#34;That feels like Panda butt!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m so empressed with the quality. I can finally get the makeup effects I&#x27;ve always wanted to with the different angled brushes. Now I know why these are the topped rated brushes. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> These brushes came SO quickly with standard delivery I had to check my receipt! Thank you! @antoniablain 💋😍😘❤️</li>
            <li> wonderful quality! love these brushes</li>
            <li> Ok I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these brushes. I bought them because they were cheap and I needed them for a project. They smelled really strongly of chemicals when I first opened them. I washed the heads once and wiped off the handles and the smell went away. Once I used the brushes I was really impressed! They didn&#x27;t shed when I cleaned them. They don&#x27;t suck up and keep any of the makeup. They distribute product evenly and are really soft. The handles of the eye brushes are a little too long for my taste but it&#x27;s not a big deal. They worked better than some of my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the brushes Great Purchase</li>
            <li> the handles are falling off these brushes.  I guess they don&#x27;t believe in glue.  They are coming off after just a couple of applications</li>
            <li> Well its not that shick</li>
            <li> Not the quality I expected. Kelley</li>
            <li> These brushes are so amazing for the price, iv had lots of expensive brushes in my life and these are quite comparable to many of them.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Very good brushes soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Really like these! They&#x27;re sturdy and very full and soft. Arrived individually wrapped and in a reusable cloth bag.They have an odd smell to them, but that&#x27;s because they need to be washed before they&#x27;re used (just like any new brush).  I&#x27;ve never tried Sigma brushes, but after receiving these, I have no interest. Very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Love how they feel my makeup goes on perfectly but the only thing is that one of the brushes got loose and came off but I glued it back together and still work great</li>
            <li> Great quality and variety. Excellent price for solid brushes.</li>
            <li> the brushers are really soft and they did not have a scent. the smaller bushers were a bit thicker than I had expected, I will leave another review as soon as I use them because of the thickness of the smaller brusher, I hopr they work out well.</li>
            <li> I was so nervous and skeptical of buying these makeup brushes. I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice flat kabuki... similar to the SIGMA F80. FINALLY I found one that seems so similar for more than half the price!. So impressed with all of these brushes, they are so soft and just perfect. For the smell, yes they smell a little funky like plastic but hey they were wrapped in plastic people! Just clean them before using if thats a real concern. Overall I&#x27;m so impressed and happy; will be purchasing another set just for backup :)!</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;Because they are awesome and they are very soft... but they had a wierd smell and my mim thought theyy would have names on their brushes  just got them in the mail... i would put 5 stars if they had their names on each brush! I recommend them!</li>
            <li> They came in on Time but smelled horrible</li>
            <li> A very good product. Wonderful job applying make up.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Sigma. So amazing for the price. Have washed several times and has never shed, and dries perfectly back into shape. 5 stars</li>
            <li> I think these are nice brushes for the price, and they arrived quickly and in good condition. My only complaint is that I wish there were smaller brushes. The small ones are actually bigger than pictured, and a little big for what I prefer for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I simply can not believe the quality of these brushes for only $10. I just received them in the mail today and used them to apply my makeup. No initial shedding with the first application. I&#x27;ve used other inexpensive brushes before (free ones with purchase) and those have shed in the first use. They are the perfect blending brush and are stiff enough to apply hard and soft powder. These are as soft as my Sephora, Mac, and Urban Decay brushes. Only time will tell if they last.</li>
            <li> Great Quality Brushes for the price.  The quality of the fibers used is almost the same as MAC brushes.  So i was thrilled to find such quality at such low pricing!</li>
            <li> good, but no instructions.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! At first I was skeptical as everyone else because of the price, but what a surprise! Great quality, blend everything perfectly. Would you consider making a set of smaller brushes just for the eyes?</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love these brushes...I was really nervous not knowing how they would work or the feel of the brush, but the brushes are very soft and work well. I personally perfer to use them for my powders</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they&#x27;d be comparable to my favorite sigma brushes, but nope. These brushes are soft, but they are not dense at all. They smelt horrible when I opened the package, and when i opened the brushes all of them were already shedding. I&#x27;ll be returning these.</li>
            <li> Love these! They are so soft, and they are super high quality. Not like other brushes for a similar price that I have purchased in the past. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> These are amazing..So soft and gently on the skin..My makeup finish is flawless.The bristles are tightly packed and are so dense..they do smell but one wash and some airing out sorts that issue out..Absolutely no shedding what so ever..I highly recommend them and I love them.The seller was great too..</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes were good but the application of products especially the contour brush is too thick that the color would not go nicely to your face.</li>
            <li> Thank you sooo much for fast shipment</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Girls, buy these! They are amazing!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical based on the price and mixed reviews, but am so happy I took a chance.  Love these brushes</li>
            <li> I love my brushes . I own the Sedona lace brushes, they are very pricey .I decide to try these out . Reading the reviews a lot of people said they are cheaply made . Only problem was the smell but it went away soon as I washed them with baby shampoo. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering more .</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. Was looking for a denser blush brush and came across these for $10!! I already have a foundation brush, and eye brushes but I thought why not try these. Pretty sure I could use one as a blush brush since the one I had bought a little while back was a bit too soft. I kept wondering why my blush wasn&#x27;t going on like I wanted it to, was too light. Then I figured out that my blush brush was softer then my previous blush brush. I had thrown out my old blush brush that I had for years, which I loved how it applied my blush. The only problem with these is the first brush in the picture (tapered brush) had dried glue in a part of the bristles. So my boyfriend cut out what bristles were stiff. I still need to wash them and I will see how it turns out. Other than that though, these are good quality brushes with out the expensive price.</li>
            <li> they are ok brush, noting special,</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the money. The handles are a little big and clunky but this is really a great set for the price. The buffer brush is very nice and I also like the pointed kabuki brush for blending concealer.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes skeptical that they would be similar to or as good of quality as the Sigma synthetic kabuki brush set. When they arrived I was so pleasantly surprised, however! They are such great quality and even softer than sigma brushes!! I am a high-end make up snob and these brushes totally compete with any high-end brand&#x27;s brushes. I even love the matte black handles. These are so cheap just take a chance and you&#x27;ll thank me later!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Super soft, Packed tightly enough for good product pickup and blending. And easy to clean!</li>
            <li> 1. so if you&#x27;re like me, this deal won me over because I read a review that said it came in a package, I uploaded a picture of it, it&#x27;s a cheap bag. I will Prob reuse it for something else not the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Someone said they&#x27;re just like the sigma brushes, I uploaded a picture of my sigma brush with the flat top brush that it comes with. They look similar but they are different. Obviously the sigma brush is denser.&lt;br /&gt;3. All the brushes are soft without a doubt but they&#x27;re not dense. So I&#x27;ll have to see how the makeup applies. I&#x27;ll come back and let you guys know how it is.&lt;br /&gt;4. I constantly read about brushes with a smell, I always thought people were exagerating and too sensitive, no these brushes come with like a super glue scent. It&#x27;s so weird. Also I didn&#x27;t pull out the long strand that each brush had I just cut it down to the normal size, nothing too crazy. (I added a picture of this)&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, I recommend these brushes for someone that&#x27;s just starting with makeup and someone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend money on expensive brushes, like me. But after this purchase, once I&#x27;m tired of these brushes I&#x27;ll just buy the sigma brushes. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;Ps. With the free Amazon shipping it came in 1 day 😳</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I have a huge collection of brushes but I wanted an upgrade, I looked into the Sigma Kabuki line and I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much money for brushes especially after reading the reviews for these. I decided I would give these a try first and if I didn&#x27;t like them I would bite the bullet and go with the Sigma. Bullets have yet to be bitten. These brushes are awesome! The bristles are soft I haven&#x27;t see any fall off. I have the bare minerals brush that goes with their serum foundation, it cost about $28, there is a brush in here that does a job that is 5x better than that brush I paid almost $30 for. If you want to contour the angled brush is great for applying powder or liquid and I use the small angled brush to set my liquid with powder when I&#x27;m contouring. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because when these brushes came, THEY STUNK. It was that horrible plastic smell, and it took a while for it to go away even after using brush shampoo to cleanse them. I didn&#x27;t use them right away but now these are one of the most important parts of my daily routine. I recommend these to anyone who wants high quality brushes for a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They arrived before the estimated date. The quality is great. I also liked the reviews before purchasing they helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and easy to use!  I love them and surprisingly they are good quality.</li>
            <li> They are so soft.  I own a sigma F80. This is the closest brush to it. It&#x27;s not as  dense but i really do care.  I reach for the bestope more often then my F80. These are DUPES people.....GET THEM</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best brushes in my bag. I have several high end brushes, but these are the best by far. I&#x27;ve washed them several times and no shedding at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Highly recommend them to everyone and will be ordering more for gifts!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes! They are so soft help apply my makeup flawlessly.  It&#x27;s best to have all the right tools to help apply your makeup, these are it. None of the brushes were broken or missing any pieces. The brushes do have a strong smell but I let them sit out of the packaging for a day and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> These brushes came super fast and well packaged. As others have described, there was a strong smell to them at first, but after a good washing the smell was gone. I love the face brushes. I use them for foundation application and bronzer. The eye brush are a little too large in my opinion and I have found little use for them with the exception of one which I use for concealer.  Overall, a great price for the brushes I use and pretty good quality!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this product, good quality</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  Arrived when promised.</li>
            <li> Had a strong smell when i opened pack of brushes when they arrived. I let them air out for an hour or so before I used them and I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price - smells a little funny at first but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> those brushes are very soft when you apply to you face. nice quality.</li>
            <li> Got these for my 13 year old daughter and she absolutely loves them. they are very soft and good quality!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. So Soft Yet Firm At The Same time.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I use the flat one for my liquid foundation and I will never again use anything else to apply it. It blends and applys on so smooth. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that mine smelled strong of chemicals when I first got them. Any time I use a new one I clean it with soap and water and then use them. I mean, they are from China and no one really likes the US, lol.</li>
            <li> When I first got these, they had a slight smell but after washing them, the smell went away. They make blending so easily and the hairs are so soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes and how they worked unfortunately handles are two pieces and poorly glued. A few fell apart on opening😞</li>
            <li> Had three of the same face brushes, I wanted more of a variety.  The eye brushes are good.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft and nice only thing is the strong smell but I&#x27;m sure after washing them they will be okay</li>
            <li> One brush arrived bent. These brushes added really chunky....not to much shedding. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Got here in 9 Days... great</li>
            <li> Got this for my cousin for Christmas who loves makeup and needed brushes. They worked well for awhile but the hairs ripped out and now everywhere after normal use. Good for price</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes for a steal! Never owned sigma brushes but was directed to these ones from reddit users who have and say they are dupes. I don&#x27;t really notice any shedding, very soft and dense brushed. Use the eye brushes for every look they are my go to brushes. I did have an issue with a couple of the fennels (metal part) came off but I glued them and they are better than before. Again I can&#x27;t be overly critical for such a great price for a set of 8 great brushes, when most higher end brushes start off around $10-$15 per brush. I don&#x27;t need the label just the brush to do it&#x27;s job which this do!</li>
            <li> One would really get a good deal with this set. All the brushes are very good quality with really soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out. Each brush is sooo dense and soft. This set is just super jam-packed with great, magnificent brushes you will ever need.</li>
            <li> Great buy!  Dense brushes! Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Perfection! Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes.</li>
            <li> These are awesome starter brushes. I am just learning so they were great for me. They did have a funny smell to them when I first got them but now they are fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars because the brushes and the bag they came have a very strong chemical odor, like paint thinner. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from where they are being stored or what, but YUCK.&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected when I opened the package and it makes me leary to use these items on my face.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. One fell apart when I opened the bag, but I just glued it together and its held up just fine. I like the quality of the brushes. I washed them before I used them the first time because they smelled a little bit of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, after a couple of months using it. They have a good performance in general.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied with these brushes. The do have a weird smell at first...kind of like paint thinner. But that goes away after washing them about two times. They don&#x27;t shed horribly either but the bristles are kind of uneven so you will have to cut the little &amp;#34;strays&amp;#34;. Other than that they work almost as good as my Sigma brushes for 1/8 of the price!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft brushes I&#x27;ve only used a few of them so far but they&#x27;ve worked good for me so far. But they do smell weird when you take them out of package. They kinda smell like spray paint or something amongst them lines. But pretty good product for price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a great price! Would definitely say this is a best for a beginner/ starter who rly loves doing makeup.</li>
            <li> Love love love the brushes. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> These brushes really feel pretty nice. I agree that the strong smell took awhile to dissipate after opening the package. I&#x27;m pretty sure the handle on one of the large brushes is about to break after very little use which is very disappointing because I like them quite well otherwise. The smaller brushes are too small to really use correctly for eye shadow. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars overall based on the price and what seems to be good quality of the actual brush material.</li>
            <li> My new brushed are amazing, my make goes on very nicely and i would recommend them to my BFF, I actually bought her a set 😊.</li>
            <li> These brushes are as nice as my expensive Mac brushes. They are soft, high quality and clean easily. There is a strong paint odor right out of the package from the plastic but it dissipates pretty quickly. I was hesitant because I have ordered brush sets that are low quality in the same price range, but after reading the other reviews and the fact that they are so affordable I took a chance on these. These are a great find.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Very soft great brushes</li>
            <li> They do have a chemical smell from the paint on the handles but the smell goes away with use. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing a brush set. Went with this set because of the price. I would recommend these they are very soft on the face and don&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I showed this brush to my MUA cousin, and she said it was very good quality and very comparable to the Sigmax essential brush kit for $150! If she didn&#x27;t know better, she&#x27;d think it was sigma brushes! She&#x27;s thinking of ordering one for herself!&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the smell. But after a couple days airing it out, it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes (: do recommend cleaning them !!! But other than that they are super soft and dense . These were delivered on time which is great .</li>
            <li> They feel great, they don&#x27;t have a smell! They came packaged really nice with a really cute bag for them to go in. Nothing was out of place. I&#x27;m going to wash them &amp; use them forever lol... j/k over all I&#x27;m satisfied ☺️</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft and well built. They work pretty well for my normal every day use.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. The smell fades as time goes. Which isn&#x27;t long. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes ...good choice for me. Everyone has their own personal preference but I would definitely recommend to all..very soft. And sturdy</li>
            <li> Love it nice and soft!!!!! Good buy</li>
            <li> I own a lot of makeup brushes, but these are probably my grail. The foundation brush/ flat brush is the best I have ever used, with soft bristles that don&#x27;t hurt your skin, very dense to not just soak up and slosh foundation around but great for pressing the product in to give that air brushed look to the the skin,. The hairs do not shed and it is very comfy to use. The eye brushes are a little large for small details like applying eyeliner or creating cat-eye looks , and definitely not for lip lining or defining eyebrows, but work well for contouring and blending.</li>
            <li> they look cheaply made some were glued on kinda of crooked and they had a really chemically smell when i first received them. But there was no hair fall out which is good. Will do for now.</li>
            <li> Great brushes when you are on a low budget they didn&#x27;t a good job for them being so cheap did not disappoint!! I would definitely buy them again!</li>
            <li> Half the brushes came off of the handle even before use...have to re glue with gorilla glue... they don&#x27;t shed, that&#x27;s a huge plus for me! Soft bristles, work well, good value, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I read the reviews and that did help me make up mu mind. Thank you buyers for your reviews.</li>
            <li> These are the best make up brushs hands down! Not a single hair has come out and they are compact and soft.</li>
            <li> Amazing, soft... buy these brushes!!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, very soft.</li>
            <li> They are so nice besides the fact that I got 2 of the same brushes and not receive a tappered brush</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo nice! They feel really really soft and apply makeup beautifully! And the price is unbeatable! This is. Must buy!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the quality of these brushes.  My only complaint is that one of them is a little loose where the metal attaches to the handle, it still works great.  Honestly I have paid lots more for just one brush, so I was skeptical about how these were going to work - but they don&#x27;t shed (even my higher priced ones shed) and they work with my mineral make up perfectly.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get these because of the mixed reviews but I&#x27;m so glad I did!! They had a very slight smell but not bad AT ALL. super soft and no lose hairs. absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> love love these brushes!! they&#x27;re soft and feel and i can say can it can compare to my more expensive brushes. Great quality and price!</li>
            <li> Came in from china which is something I usually don&#x27;t trust, should have paid closer attention. You get a lot for your money but the have a very strong unpleasant smell and I don&#x27;t like how the brush fibers (not sure of material) feel on my face</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ! Great quality. I would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> My daughter says she loves them</li>
            <li> Before, I only used MAC brushes but these work great for a fraction of the cost.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes, zero shedding, blends well.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes they&#x27;re so soft and gentle!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft which I love! Not all of them are conducive for blending but for the price they are a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. They&#x27;re not as good as the higher end one but the set it under $20 so I can&#x27;t complain. They get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the money. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> First time using them and they blended my make up so well.  Great investment</li>
            <li> Great brushes the only downfall is the smell</li>
            <li> I really was hoping these would be amazing.  I got them and before I even opened the plastic it smelled so strong of paint.  I can&#x27;t imagine using that on my face!  Especially because I am pregnant, maybe my nose is more sensitve, but it is unbearable to me.  I soaked them for way long and even tried apple cider vinegar, but no use.  They still smell.  If anyone could help and knows what to do so that they get rid of the smell that would be great! Thanks.</li>
            <li> LIke these brushes. My make-up is now flawless because of them. The only down point, they didn&#x27;t come with information on best uses.  Had to look that information up myself. It didn,the help not to have descriptions of each either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking pass those two facts and the brushes are good !</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and she loved them! She was totally shocked when she used them, then told her how much they were. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very high quality for the price. easy to clean and use. metal tops loosen from wood base but is easy to fix with a little super glue.</li>
            <li> I just got these and they are very well made .I can&#x27;t wait to try them !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she just love them. Talked about how soft they were and how even and blended her makeup went on, I must say that I do see a difference so because I can see the difference I&#x27;ll give them 4 stars</li>
            <li> Great quality. Great price. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes, I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> LOVE. LOVE. These brushes and they came so fast in the mail!</li>
            <li> Very very nice and soft brushes!! And i love the case it came in too</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and came fairly quickly. They are pretty good for the money. They are not quite dense enough for applying powder over foundation but still better than most brushes I&#x27;ve tried. I like the big angled one for applying liquid foundation and the stubbier one for blush.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes. They are awesome! Hair is soft and steady, it doesn&#x27;t fall. I honestly adore this brushes. They make my makeup routine easier.</li>
            <li> these are nice looking set but not really soft and after the use the brushes are still left on my face but great gift for young girls starting out ..</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. You get what you paid for. The hair on the brushes are nice &amp; dense &amp; blends pretty. But on one of the brushes the part between the handle &amp; metal is already coming apart. I might glue gun it back together.</li>
            <li> These brushes are FANTASTIC! My MAC blush brush completely fell apart on me and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a new one, so as I was looking around on Amazon I came across these. I was also in the market for a smaller duo fibre brush for my concealer, and low and behold, the bundle had the two brushes I was in search of for less than a quarter of the price MAC or Ulta or even Target would charge me, and I got 8 of them! A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;- These brushes do have a strong scent to them. It just smells like brand new, just manufactured smell... WASH THEM. it&#x27;s that simple. Don&#x27;t let the smell deter you away from this great buy. And if you have to wash them again, so what? It&#x27;s $10, and these brushes are great.&lt;br /&gt;- These things pick up product AMAZINGLY WELL. I was actually surprised when I stuck one of them in my NARS blushes and it picked it right up. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re too soft, they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;- Some of them came with the tiniest bit of shedding, but again, that stuff doesn&#x27;t bother me, cut them short, pull them out if they&#x27;re loose. Don&#x27;t get crazy tactical on the buy just because it comes with some hairs out of place, it&#x27;s Amazon, you&#x27;re paying $10. Just do it.</li>
            <li> Love the little tote bag they come with! And the brushes are SUPER soft. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> These arrived by the predicted date and I gave two sets of them for Christmas. So far I&#x27;m pretty sure my sisters like them.</li>
            <li> Love these :) perfect for the whole face :)</li>
            <li> these brushes are awesome!!they are very inexpensive and very soft and gentle on my skin by far best dupe I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> Love these..bought another set for my daughter in law</li>
            <li> They are okay, they&#x27;re all very stiff. I&#x27;ve had some shedding, more than I&#x27;d like. I thought that at least 4 of the brushes would be fluffy, but none was, so they all pretty much serve the same purpose. My most liked brush would have to be the tampered crease brush. Out of the entire set, I only used 3 of the small ones and 1 of the big ones. I was disappointed with my purchase. It arrived on time though!</li>
            <li> they are good brushes but if you think they are going to be like the sigma sigmax kabuki brushes don&#x27;t buy them. i thought they were and the are not as dense at all. still soft and nice quality but overall not really comparable to the sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. I do not wear make-up everyday. I wear make-up about 3-4 days our of the week. But these brushes are dense and soft. I wasn&#x27;t going to buy them because the mixed reviews, but I am happy I did. Plus, its only like $10</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great buy! I actually feel cheated when it comes to the other brushes I own. I compared these to the ones I own from sephora and bare minerals and the performance and texture are the same. What a steal even if you only like one of the brushes. Only real difference is that there&#x27;s no brand name stamp on the handle which I can live without.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes just sucks they get loose from the top, but work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no professional but I&#x27;m really enjoying these brushes. They pick up product nice. The handles are nice</li>
            <li> So far so good...what can I say I have been using this product since I received it . shipped fast,works great and great quality</li>
            <li> Pretty great brushes! Very soft and versatile. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very strong chemical smell.  I don&#x27;t know if it is safe to use it.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEE these brushes! The bristles are super soft and they work perfectly with both powder and liquid foundation. It does have a smell when you first open the package, but that goes away with the first cleaning. BUTTTTTTTT, some of the hairbrushes had a lot of fallout. So much so that I had to throw 2 of the big ones away! :(</li>
            <li> Meh, if you aren&#x27;t looking to have high quality brushes and aren&#x27;t looking for them to stay glued together for long - go for these. They are very dense and apply makeup well, but you aren&#x27;t buying professional grade brushes. I still enjoy them though.</li>
            <li> This brushes are awesome!</li>
            <li> In love with these brushes. Great quality!</li>
            <li> IlAs a makeup artist I like to try new things to see if they work.  Well these WORK. they do have a funny smell  at first but that goes away within a hour.  The have little to none shedding.  I actually loved them so much I got two sets and plan to order more for myself and gifts. I love to contour with them.</li>
            <li> The brushes upon opening the box had a VERY distinctive chemical smell, which slowly faded after multiple washes. The brushes themselves are very soft and I was extremely impressed initially, especially for the price. Application was smooth and extremely similar to my Sigma brushes. After about a month of pretty consistent use, I noticed the brushes started to shed so heavily that I had to throw a few away. Not only this but the handles started to fall apart as well, and I am very careful about upside down drying after washes. I glued them back together in hopes that it would work but nope, the larger brushes have all ended up i the trash. The smaller brushes have held up better which I can only assume is because I just don&#x27;t use them very often. If you are strapped for cash and need a starter kit of complexion brushes that you do not expect to be for consistent daily use, then these might work better for you, but for the price you should definitely look into Morphe, BH Cosmetics, Real Techniques, even the ELF pro brushes before considering these.</li>
            <li> Best brushes I was really surprised to be honest due to the pricing of the brushes. They are soft and the work well. Easy to clean no shedding. The only thing is that they smell when you initially get them.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to buy one of those Premium Expensive Sigma Brushes. but they are so pricey and I just can&#x27;t afford to spare $$ on those brushes. But then I found this! they are amazing brushes! the Round Foundation Brushes I uses with my BareMinerals foundation and its amazing because it buffs the powder on my face without it looking cakey. These are really sturdy brushes. I have brushes from MakeupGeek, MAC, TooFaced, BareEscentuals, and Basic Eyes Kit from Sigma. but these brushes does the job without the overprice :)</li>
            <li> I like these. The bristles are soft. Just having trouble with the wooden handles falling off of the metal part. Guess I can just superglue it back together. Get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! No&lt;br /&gt;Issues and still going strong after 2 months of heavy usage!</li>
            <li> Strong paint smell at first, but that doesn&#x27;t take away from the actual quality. Best set I&#x27;ve owned yet. Glad I didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these other people are talking about. When I opened the package up I didn&#x27;t smell a strong smell at all!! There wasn&#x27;t any strong smell. They smelled normal to me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, these feel and work really well for the price. So i&#x27;m happy with them!</li>
            <li> I Simply can not believe the quality of these brushes for only $ 10, they loved, are the perfect blend brush and sufficiently rigid to apply hard and soft powder. The applying foundation charm me, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are very soft and have held up so far with NO shedding. I wash them at least two to three times a week and air dry, they are in like new condition each time. I am impressed! Will see how long they last but they&#x27;re holding up as good as my &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; brushes :) Would buy them again!</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and handle is very strudy they do the job right.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about these brushes...wash them and the paint sell goes away. They&#x27;re great and I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! Like everyone else said there is a little smell when they first arrive but nothing horrible just let them sit out then wash them. No fallout so far and I&#x27;ve used them about everyday for the past 2 months. They&#x27;re perfect! I plan on buying my mom and sister this set!</li>
            <li> I looovee them! they all are soft and made with a good material.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have Mac and Sephora ones, but I find these ones better: softer, cheaper, and easier to carry</li>
            <li> Was good quality. I did have to buy a case to keep them in. But I would buy them again</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft, and seems kinda sturdy I guess. My only negative is they smell horrible. They came smelling like chemicals hopefully when I wash them the smell will go away. But it is a very noticeable and strong smell. These most likely came from CHINA.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Good quality and perfect for what I will be using it for!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best deal around. They are perfect for foundation, blush, and contouring. Coupled with the Coastal scents 22 piece set on here and the never to be duped Mac 219 pencil brush that is all you will ever need! I&#x27;m simply amazed and will be buying extra sets in case they ever stop selling them. Buy them! Lol. Best 10 bucks on brushes ever. Don&#x27;t buy them for eyes etc, just foundation bronzer and contouring.</li>
            <li> These are amazing brushes! They are high end brushes at low cost. Look and feel just like sigma</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!! Amazing brushes and the price is phenomenal! I can definitely say they are very alike in similarity and quality.</li>
            <li> amazing!!! the brushes are so soft and work awesome!</li>
            <li> Not The best brushes. i would not recomend</li>
            <li> Nice set for the price but who knows how long they will last. I have MAC and other high end brushes that are very procy but last quite a while. If they only last a short time, no huge loss since they did not cost much. If you are looking for high end brushes, keep looking. If you want reasonably decent brushes for a fair price, you have found them.</li>
            <li> Very soft and super durable!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great they are very universal and can be used from anything from applying blush to a cream concealer to a concealer pencil,  to loose mineral powder,  contouring and highlighting,  really anything you need to complete your look. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 4 months and I use them  daily and have yet to notice any shedding  or deformation of the brushes they are still in perfect condition ! Great buy especially for the price !!! I spent less than what I usually spend on an eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set of brushes and you cannot beat the price. I have not experienced any shedding whatsoever. The only reason I gave them 4/5 stars is because I wish they were a tiny bit denser.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes!!! Soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. Very soft. Holds make-up perfectly.</li>
            <li> These were my absolute favorite brushes until they were cleaned. After cleaning twice with coconut oil and dishwashing liquid,  they began to shed terribly and fell apart.  Prior to that,  they blended well,  they were very soft. I used them mostly for loose powder mineral makeup. Great for contouring. I&#x27;m really disappointed they fell apart.</li>
            <li> Not too bad. Great for the price. The bigger brushes are really nice, but almost a Dupe of a Dupe. I purchased the Beauty Junkies one and was extremely happy. This seems like a Dupe of that Dupe of the Sigma brushes. The tapered brush is great for applying concealer, and the angled brush is my go-to contour brush.</li>
            <li> the brushes are great, i haven&#x27;t had any problems with them (:</li>
            <li> Great brush set for the price but the brush roll gets very dirty easily if you don&#x27;t keep up with the cleaning of the brushes. Just after one use of the brush and putting it back in the roll it was already stained by my makeup residue.  Other than that I love these little brushes.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes sooner than expected. I was pretty impressed with the quality of the brushes</li>
            <li> My makeup goes  on  very smooth  with  my new  brushes.</li>
            <li> No bad for the price. Better quality than some in the same price range.</li>
            <li> These brushes smelled horribly, had to return them.</li>
            <li> you get all the bang for your buck with this</li>
            <li> I love these brushed they are extremely soft and nice on the face! Make sure you wash your brushes before you use them because like all new brushes there will be fallout and the smell isn&#x27;t the best but not that bad!</li>
            <li> loved the packaging! nice brushes, kinda smelled chemically but i washed it with some baby soap :) cant wait to use! theyre super soft :)</li>
            <li> The price was right, so I bought these. I was not disappointed! These really are quality brushes. Sure makes putting on contouring makeup more fun.</li>
            <li> I just order these about a week ago. I really like them the brushes on them are really soft. The stick and brushes are fatter than normal or like regular brushes. Example: eye shadow applier brush is fatter than normal.</li>
            <li> Its firm yet soft, work just as well as the name brand, love this product.</li>
            <li> I suggest this to everyone since I have received these! love it.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! They don&#x27;t smell funny</li>
            <li> These bristles are SO soft. I have experienced zero shedding. Handles are still solid unlike other inexpensive brushes that come apart. And they are very dense, so they don&#x27;t feel like a cheap makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt; These are my go-to brushes for foundation application and contouring. The smaller ones are great for blending on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great quality and a great value.</li>
            <li> These brushes are of amazing quality for the price!</li>
            <li> great product! I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes well worth the money I have purchased four different brush sets and none and I mean none have been as good as these they&#x27;re soft to the skin but work well !</li>
            <li> well made. its smooth and soft. love it</li>
            <li> The brushes are very high Quality for the price! This is a steal!</li>
            <li> Honestly not good brushes. The only brushes that are good in this set are the small brushes used for eye shadows/concealers. The bigger ones are not dense at ALL. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Without even using them, the handles came off a couple of the brushes. And even the ones I still have feel loose like the glue could stop holding at any second..pretty bummed.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and cover well. I love them.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase! I love my brushes. Good quality and fast shipping! I highly recommend these makeup brushes!!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. Easy to use. And I&#x27;ve been able to apply make up flawlessly. I would recommend them to anybody that wants nice makeup brushes but doesn&#x27;t want to spend much.</li>
            <li> Great brushes they&#x27;re perfect and great quality!</li>
            <li> Perfect set of brushes. Great buy, will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Excellent! High quality</li>
            <li> My brushes broke within 3 weeks very disappointed with the quality</li>
            <li> Pretty...and so far they are of good quality</li>
            <li> Wow, smelly like others have reviewed but work great for foundation, concealer, and contouring. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Wonderful quality and great price.</li>
            <li> I Love these brushes....excellent quality</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected. Fast delivery. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes last night and immediately tried them out. I love them! They&#x27;re extremely soft, and are good quality. I have a hard time finding a foundation brush that I actually like using. it works perfect, and it feels a lot better than my old one. If you&#x27;re looking for good make up brushes, these are the ones I recommend.</li>
            <li> Have to hot glue the wood and the silver part back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the brushes are soft &amp; still holds up after washes.</li>
            <li> I have never used brushes as nice as these!</li>
            <li> I feel like if one of those days it will broke and the hair will come out of the brush... Sometimes i feel the brush moving while im using them.. But it is okay. They blend everything very well and that&#x27;s the most important</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s talk about these AMAZING brushes. The smell: YES there was a chemical smell. Air them out (the bag smells) and they were fine. I spritzed them with brush cleaner and use them the next day. The Bristles: amazing and soft nice and thick, minimal shedding. I trimmed a few bristles that looked like they were coming loose. Overall: these brushes applied my makeup FLAWLESSLY I have more expensive brushes that I probably won&#x27;t use now!</li>
            <li> Buy these brushes, They are as good as Trish and way less money.Its all about the make and the ability to put it on NOT the brush...These brushes will cost you less and you can experiment with HOW to place the make up without going broke!!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are professional quality and work beautifully!!! They arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Got them really fast and I love them! They are not as harsh on my contour palet as the other brushes! So thank you!</li>
            <li> these are wonderful and came in on time</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these brushes!! They are so easy to use</li>
            <li> love these brushes! perfect for contouring!</li>
            <li> For the price I shouldn&#x27;t complain.i needed eyeshadow brushes and these just don&#x27;t cut it for me.they end up spreading eyeshadow dust all over my face even after putting lid primer.the foundation brushes aren&#x27;t so bad.i was able to work with them</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved these! Full and soft. A great variety for a complete look. Thinking about buying a back up set for myself and one as a gift! Great price!</li>
            <li> Very good brushes. Only thing is they aren&#x27;t labeled as to which does what.</li>
            <li> Item as described. All brushes seem to be of good quality. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Product came in very quickly, great quality brushes</li>
            <li> These are extremely high quality brushes....super super soft! I bought a set in white and black.  I will say that 2 of the bristle tops fell off then handles the second I took them out of the packaging so I had to glue them back on but the quality of the fibers are pretty unreal for the price.  The angled brush does a great job blending foundation. The only downside about the smaller brushes is that they are about 25% too large for eye makeup application.  They&#x27;re all about the size of a blending brush or concealer brush which is larger than I like to use regularly, but I&#x27;m getting used to using them.  They blend beautifully though.  Another thing I noticed was that the density of the white brushes is higher than the black brushes.  For instance, a the smaller brushes in the black set are more dense/stiff than the white set.  The fibers are just as soft but its like the black ones are &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; if that makes sense.  Anyway, I&#x27;m really really impressed and for the money you can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase on Amazon and I&#x27;m highly satisfied with these brushes I received. They arrived earlier than I thought, they are truly high quality</li>
            <li> To many of the same brushes</li>
            <li> great, came on time and the product is wonderful</li>
            <li> Amazing product, and came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Just go it , Not bad at all ,They are SUPER soft and pretty ! i love it.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate these brushes for long term usage because I received them a week ago. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> What an awesome makeup brush set! The brushes are much better than I expected. I have purchased brush sets before and this the best one I&#x27;ve had so far. They are soft and feel so nice on the skin.and I highly recommend this makeup brush set.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the price! I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist &amp; needed a new set to travel with. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchse. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these, use everyday.</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes in the mail today and let me just say I absolutely LOVE them so far! I still have not used them to apply makeup but I will say they are super soft and I have not seen any shedding yet (I did swipe them on my hands and tug on the hairs lightly to test them). They are very good quality for such an amazing deal. Definitely a MUST BUY.</li>
            <li> Great blending brushes</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! These are the softest, most durable, brushes I have ever used. A must buy! Great for gifts, too.</li>
            <li> Pretty great for the money spent. I would disagree in saying they&#x27;re the same quality as high end brushes but high end brushes are ridiculously priced so this is a wonderful compromise</li>
            <li> Cheap material the brush came apart from the wood</li>
            <li> The a brushes are better than brushes you can find at a beauty store. They don&#x27;t shed. They apply makeup very neatly. They are definitely the best I&#x27;ve seen on here!</li>
            <li> absolutely love these brushes!! they&#x27;re so soft and blend out foundation so beautifully and so easy to clean! definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> These brushed arrived in a cute sliding zip bag, and then packaged in a clear cello envelope. Very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a scent that I noticed, and it reminded me of paint. I think it might come from the handles, I&#x27;m hoping the bristles aren&#x27;t just cheaply coated. The bristles feel soft and well bounded together in the brush. I didn&#x27;t wash them yet, but will update when I do. This is offered at a great price for 8 brushes. I love kabuki brushes for foundation and contouring.  So far so good,  I love them and each one applies just as well as my mac and sonia kashuk ones. Much better than ELF brand.</li>
            <li> love order. great quality</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! I started out trying to build my brush collection with Sigma brushes and I had to get one at a time because of their price. This whole set cost less than my Sigma F80 brush, which is the one I use everyday to apply foundation. These brushes do just as good of a job as their Sigma counterparts. To get rid of the chemical-ish smell (and to clean my brushes every day), I wash them with hot water and Softsoap milk and honey liquid hand soap. You don&#x27;t need to buy fancy brush cleaner because the hand soap already has antibacterial stuff in it and it my brushes now smell so good when I apply my makeup. These are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I liked these brushes. For the price they are perfect! The only thing is that when you first get them they kind of smell funky , but that smell does go away. They are so soft and are dense enough to do what they need to do. I was afraid these would be flimsy but no . They are good quality. the reason I didn&#x27;t give it all the stars was that some of the brushes tend to shed. I would recommend these though. Good buy oh and they arrived pretty fast!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They are soft, lightweight, and look very professional. I will definitely be using these everyday.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Good Quality. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t last and become wobbly</li>
            <li> very good, live up to sigma brush quality - I use the smaller tapered &amp; round brushes for concealer and they work awesome</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve been applying my liquid foundations with the flat top brush, and the blending and coverage it leaves is amazing. I was a little skeptical because of the price &amp; not being &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name. But I&#x27;ll continue to use them with BB creams and power foundations over the next few weeks. Honestly they&#x27;re so soft, smell a little package but it fades once you wash. For this price, you would be a fool for not purchasing. Some reviews mentioned the brushes coming broken or in two pieces but mine are pretty sturdy. AGAIN buy these brushes!!!!! For the price they&#x27;re amazing!</li>
            <li> I am simply amazed by these brushes. I will never order sigma because these do it for me. Absolutely incredible for the price. I have a FULL REVIEW on my blog where I go in depth on everything about these brushes. (shipping, how I use each brush, etc). Check it out!&lt;br /&gt;itsbeautybyb.weebly.com</li>
            <li> This is a great product &amp; I recommend it to eveyone.  It travel alot so this aet is just what I need.  I would compare this product to M.A.C cosmetics.  Every brush does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to! Love the way it lays the makeup on my skin . They are very soft to the skin &amp; very easy to clean .I will be buying from this seller again!  :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Works as well as Sephora brushes I&#x27;ve bought. Wish I&#x27;d found these first!</li>
            <li> The little silver part keeps coming off and the brushes detach from the bottom</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved these brushes and the fact that they got to my house less than a week made it even better. The quality of the brushes is fantastic. The brush feels very soft. Also, the foundation brush does not leave streaks like how some brushes do. I will definitely be buying another set when needed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely cute, quality is better then I expected, and the brush is very soft.The brushes put the makeup on smoothly without getting blotchy.Great purchase. Very satisfied will be buying more products.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are great and a great price!  These brushes are a great buy! They are exactly as described and affordable.Would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone else.</li>
            <li> 3 of them comes broken.</li>
            <li> Super soft and glides nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li> A pretty good product, good for beginners! I started using the flat blending kabuki brush and there was some shedding. on one of the brushes there were some strands of hair longer than others. Hoping they hold up but I won&#x27;t be mad if they don&#x27;t last too long because they were quite cheap.</li>
            <li> The quality exceeds the price!  I bought several extra sets for gifts!  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase of these makeup brushes! The quality is really impressive. I have paid this amount for a single brush so to get all of these different high quality brushes is truly a great value and superb buy! I really needed a good kabuki brush for applying mineral makeup so I was a bit hesitant when I didn&#x27;t see a short fat one however I realize now I don&#x27;t need it. With this collection of brushes I have everything including a flat top brush for buffing which works perfect for minerals as well as a few rounded brushes which also work great. The brushes are soft but not too soft. The handles feel good made of wood and high quality. When I showed my friend she was blown away and immediatly went to order a set? You will love these brushes and be glad you got them too!</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes and i LOVE them! they are soft and apply my makeup smoothly! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed but they are ok better than nothing</li>
            <li> It smells really bad when you first open the package. They apply makeup decently, but I would recommend​ washing them before use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for contouring!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are not great quality and have a very strong chemical odor.  I ended up throwing them out.</li>
            <li> I literally LOVE these. Seriously so great</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Love the foundation and stipling brushes. The eyeshadow ones are alright ... a little flimsy in my opinion. Overall though, for the price, I would&#x27;ve been happy with just one or two working brushes! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very impressed on how soft they were. Good quality good price</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes so soft on d skin</li>
            <li> Love them, they are so soft, and work great. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> By far the best brushes I own, these are my go too brushes...they did have a strong smell but it wasn&#x27;t so bad once I washed them the smell went right away...but in a way I was happy it had a smell let me know they were new and had never been used. They do not shed on me at all and I use them ALL THE TIME. I will be buying these brushes again and I will be giving them away as gifts to some of my friends 😊😊👍👍</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the quality of these brushes. I can truly relate them to the sigma brushes but a better price and a little bit better quality. I get such amazing pay off when I use this with my revlon color stay foundation. Amazing customer service shoutout to Linda for helping me out. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Great brushes I use them everyday only wish they came in a case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this makeup brush set.  I spent a lot of $$ for one foundation brush from an expensive make up line and it leaves bristles all over my face.  These BESTOPE brushes don&#x27;t do that.  They apply my foundation evenly.  I really only use 5 out of 8 pcs and are very happy with this purchase.  I would highly recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> 2 brushes break to half because not enough glue. The hair brush is too hard.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes.  Amazing price.  I usually use elf brushes which are pretty inexpensiv, but these are even better.  The brushes are very soft and pretty dense.  I have used all but 3 so far and I&#x27;ve washed them a couple of times and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding.  I don&#x27;t own any of the more exprensive brushes these are supposed to be similar to or &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; for so I can&#x27;t compare, but I can say these are an excellent buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome for the price! Not too soft or stiff, perfect for packing on color in the correct areas... I&#x27;d definitely recommend these for everyone!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, good price.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes that are easy to wash to clean, without losing most of their bristles as soon as you use or wash them.Love the color and that they are soft. So I would recommended for those makeup lovers.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed when I recieved these sets of brushes. and I absolutely love them! They are very durable. soft, and apply makeup very evenly. I highly recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use my brushes, after the second use, the handle of one of them fell off the brush, then the next day I had another brush happen the same thing... They worked great while applying foundation but now they&#x27;re just coming apart from the metal part, like the glue wasn&#x27;t strong enough or something...&lt;br /&gt;Now I have two broken brushes, wish I can return them and get new ones again.</li>
            <li> These started falling apart about a week after I started using them</li>
            <li> I love my new makeup brushes! I received them in just 3days! I recomend getting them</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush! Quality and price cannot be beat! This brush set is well worth the money, and then some!!!!</li>
            <li> These are great brushes! I use them every day and wash them once a week and so far they are holding up well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! No shedding whatsoever! They are so soft, but make sure to wash them before using them, they did have a chemical smell but a simple wash made the smell disappear.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes, I enjoy make up and these brushes work great. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love them! I have had many and these are great and very well priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few months and they started out working great. Only problem is, now that I&#x27;ve been using them, my most used brushes are coming loose from the handle at the metal part. It&#x27;s very annoying to be putting makeup on and not have it go on correctly or have it brushed to the wrong spot because the brush doesn&#x27;t move properly.</li>
            <li> Great set and price, I use this set everyday</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Very dense but also soft. Great for powders.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great quality and speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> So soft and easy to clean. I love these, I bough them for contouring and they work perfectly for my needs. I will buy these again when I need to replace my current set.</li>
            <li> Customer service is exemplary. They reach out and give you wonderful suggestions to keep and preserve these beautiful brushes. These are a bargain. You won&#x27;t go wrong. I highly recommended the brushes, customer service</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING! I highly recommend-</li>
            <li> Great!  I&#x27;ve always wanted to get a set for easy access and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> great brush set for the money.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in time time, excellent quality just plain AMAZING</li>
            <li> Better than most. I did have to use a hot glue gun to keep the metal piece on the handle. Like to several brushes. But I love these. WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> Comparable to sigma but a little less sense but totally worth it....best brushes ever</li>
            <li> I loved how quickly I got my brushes. I ordered the black and silver ones. The silver metal on the brushes is solid, and not thin and cheap looking which is what I was expecting for the price. I was impressed at how sturdy and well made they are. I have been loving them and using them. I have not had one strand of the bristles fall out. I just cannot get over the superior quality for such a low price. Thank you so much for keeping your price low. I will be buying more. Thanks again. I cannot ever see myself buying Sigma or Mac when I can get these for such a steal. I feel bad for the girls who don&#x27;t know about this yet. Amazing! Im going to search next for a brush holder.. I hope Bestope has one. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this set mainly for the flat top kabuki and pointed foundation brushes. The brushes are very dense and soft. I had some minor shedding in my first wash, and a few had stray hairs that needed to be trimmed down to size. The eye brushes are great for packing on shadow, but their sizes and shapes are rather odd, imo, in that they don&#x27;t have specific uses (e.g., crease) but are pretty interchangeable. For the price, this is a great set but if you don&#x27;t already have many brushes, it may not be a good starter kit.</li>
            <li> Was kind of iffy to get them but these babies work bomb! Highly recommended if you can&#x27;t afford those expensive brushes</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> They are really good I will buy them for some one as a gift they work great</li>
            <li> I have only used 3 out of the lot, used them once and I must say, it is very fantastic. I used the shadow brush damp and I got the best application ever!!!! Using the powder brush, it blended perfectly and I didn&#x27;t want to stop blend. Highly recommended. OH Yea and I did receive everything on time...</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes, especially for beginners.Really soft, was surprised that it does pick up makeup. They work great will buy again.they don&#x27;t shed or fall apart and I clean all my brushes regularly</li>
            <li> These brushes are great so soft and they feel great in my hand very excellent quality</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> so soft and blend really well .. its great</li>
            <li> The brushes are absolutely beautiful soft and non frizz. I would reccommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great brush set! Really high quality. No shedding at all. They are very well made.I really like that the brushes and metal.I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on brushes as a makeup artist and painter in the last 25 years ranging in prices from $1-60. These are amazing synthetic brushes that can be used for a variety of makeup techniques. I have stopped using my Too Face, Makeup Forever, MAC and Smashbox brushes as my primary set and have started using these first. I ended up ordering 4 more sets for my kit.</li>
            <li> Great brush set! Probably the best yet. Comparable to any high end brush set. Did not even smell bad like I read in other reviews. Worth a shot.</li>
            <li> These brushes really great! They are dense and shaped really well. These are amazing for! The synthetic bristles make them very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, easy to clean and for an inexpensive set they do just great.</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are amazing</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and are super easy to clean. Their is no hair loss on the brush and it smells like a new car</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical about this product like everyone else was. I have been looking for a good blending/foundation brush forever; I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much for just ONE brush, so I came across this set. I read through the reviews and everyone seemed to love them and even compare them to the high-end brushes, why not give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;All I have to say is..Oh my goodness! These brushes are amazing! The bristles are soft and and the brush itself is very dense. My foundation goes on smoothly and evenly, which I love. I think some exaggerated a little bit on how they smelled; they smell wasn&#x27;t so harsh that you couldn&#x27;t be around them, nothing a wash can&#x27;t remove. :)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and if I ever need another set, I will definitely buy from them again. :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes everyday since they came in the mail. GREAT QUALITY FOR AN EVEN GREATER PRICE. I use the little brushes for under-the-eye concealing and the bigger ones for foundation and contouring. I&#x27;d definitely recommend(:</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes hoping to find something similar to the Sigma brushes. I have yet to try Sigma, but as a beginning freelance makeup artist I needed more brushes to add to my kit. I was impressed with these brushes. They are washed weekly, and I have not dealt with shedding (although a brush or two is developing a loose base where the brush head is glued to the handle, but I can easily repair that with wood glue or superglue). The eye brushes are perfect for blending and for using for contouring or highlighting or diffusing contour lines on the face. The pointed stiff brush I like for buffing in concealer under the eye and also using to pat powder under the eye. I do find these face brushes are more suited for cream products as they pick up powders very, very lightly. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking to expand their brush set as an affordable option.</li>
            <li> They apply great and made nicely.</li>
            <li> The brushes work really good the silver comes apart and needs to be re-glued</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! Soft, barely any loose bristles if any, and they grab the makeup.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Im a baller on a budget lol&lt;br /&gt;And a makeup enthusis &amp; these work just as well as more expensive brands. I own brushes from ELF, Real Techniques, Walmart &amp; CVS Brands. No shedding that I&#x27;ve noticed but I&#x27;ve only opened one brush that I didnt have in my collection. Saving the rest as back ups.</li>
            <li> Very nice and good quality brushes.  To be synthetic, they feel pretty soft, like natural.  Good sizes and shapes.... 100% recommended!</li>
            <li> I got mine today and I was pleasantly surprised. Even though they are synthetic they are supreme quality. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. I only gave it four stars because mine were not labeled. Like the picture shows. But all in all, great quality and I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice and soft but it did come with a weird smell it wasn&#x27;t like a bad smell just weird... So I just washed them and it came right out. and one of my brushes right out of the box fell apart, but I just glued that would superglue and it&#x27;s cool now. Not that big of a problem.</li>
            <li> They started to fall apart after the second use-not well made or durable at all.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and work so well!</li>
            <li> The brush comes aprt from the base in the 1st 10 minutes of using.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good quality, they are sift and blend makeup very well! Great for contouring,</li>
            <li> So pretty. Works well, arrived fast and organized.</li>
            <li> love my new make up brushes ordering more.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I use this brushes everyday.</li>
            <li> Super soft came in a cheap looking bag but brushes were in near perfect condition except for one or two hairs sticking out of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the brush set that I ordered. They work very wel</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, these brushes shed too much &amp; most of them broke off:/ I will say I do like the small ones, that&#x27;s why I will give them 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Brushes had a slight scent of alcohol when first received, but are great for the price paid. They work fabulously for every day makeup application. They haven&#x27;t shed or broken. Awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and makeup artist, this brushes are very good quality. I ordered them because they look similar to a name brand I use at work and they feel very similar!</li>
            <li> Very good quality! Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> They are ok. Application is easy. Seems like I have to pump a little bit more liquid foundation for coverage. It does shed a bit but not drastic amounts.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with what I got and it came on time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Super impressed with the quality for the price! They have good density and are incredibly soft. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding and I&#x27;ve already both used, and washed all the brushes. Love the smaller brushes for eyeshadow and for blending out my contouring and highlighting on my face (especially the nose) and the larger brushes are great for buffing out foundation, applying blush, and setting foundation with a powder. The only brush I don&#x27;t really ever use is the large tapered brush. That was also the only brush I had a slight problem with, as the hairs on the brush were secured well but applied slightly off-center. But other than that, I love these and definitely would recommend to others / buy again!</li>
            <li> these are some very good brushes!!</li>
            <li> Great quality for such a cheap price! And Arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> one of them came up defective</li>
            <li> Got these in the mail today! Super soft and the bristles didnt come out after i cleaned them and used them I even tugged a little and nothing which for the price i was worried itd have the little hairs everywhere but so far so good</li>
            <li> Worth ever cent.  Only thing they smelled awful when I first got them</li>
            <li> I loooooove these brushes. They are very soft and very full ... worth the money i purchased them for . I did have one that came off of its black handle... but an easy fix . Will purchase again !</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are super soft and easy to clean. When they are cleaned bristles do not fall ou</li>
            <li> Great brushes, and for the price they&#x27;re even better! They&#x27;re so soft and blend very well! I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now and I love them, I will definitely be ordering these again when the time comes!!</li>
            <li> I really love this brushes they were more than what I expected. the items were great quality items</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price</li>
            <li> For the longest time (almost a week) I went back and forth on whether I wanted to get these. I was nervous they would be horrible. I gave in and bought them. So far I&#x27;ve used them and they work great! I&#x27;ve gotten complements on how good my makeup looks. These are great brushes, and I recommend these to anyone who wants great brushes at a low price! Don&#x27;t think twice, just get them:) they are soo worth it!</li>
            <li> These are great! I really enjoy using them. They are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes and the price is great. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived super fast and the package is so professional and cute. It came is an adorable little pink zipper bag and another clear bag. The brushes are so soft I think they might be a little better then my MAC brushes especially for the cost. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Really great set of brushes. Work very well and easy to clean,</li>
            <li> Brush set was of high quality and good value.</li>
            <li> Very impressed by this product!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for such a nice price!</li>
            <li> I like how the brushes are soft. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of these brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a fantastic quality for the price</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are very soft on your skin and apply my makeup evenly. So much more than I expected for the cost.</li>
            <li> For the casual makeup user like myself (I enjoy putting on makeup but usually only wear makeup when I&#x27;m going out) you can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price.  The brushes seem well made and the bristles are soft and effective.  I&#x27;m by no means a makeup artist or expert but they are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent value! These brushes are soft on the skin</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, good quality, good price, the bristles are super soft, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use them daily but not as dense as I thought they would be</li>
            <li> I like that there not too soft and stiff enough to blend well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality brushes for a steal at the price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They&#x27;re exactly what you expect for when hoping all comes out well. They make my make up glide on easily and don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;streaks&amp;#34;-Blending everything oh so well. The bag did smell like paint when I opened it, which I found really odd because it was STRONG so the brushes got the scent too. But after washing them and caring for them BEFORE using them, they really were worth the buy. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for some great, cheap brushes! I&#x27;m serious guys.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the brushes yet, but be warned that as soon as you open your package you will be overwhelmed with a chemical paint smell. It turned me off immediately. The brushes are soft but I have a feeling the only useful ones will be the small face brushes that I will use for my eye shadow</li>
            <li> These brushes are just as good as any expensive ones I&#x27;ve bought!  They are so soft and unlike other inexpensive brushes the bristles don&#x27;t fall out at all.  You&#x27;ll need to air the brushes out when you first open them for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving three stars for the price but the quality isn&#x27;t so great. theyre very soft but they don&#x27;t seem to sturdy. the metal neck is wobbly on the wooden base on two of them and when i use the bigger flat top one for my foundation it picks up too much product. its definitely not as good quality as the other ones out there but you can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Totally recommended!!</li>
            <li> Loooveeee these brushes. Cheap, but so so good!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! The blush brush is my absolute favorite. It&#x27;s the perfect size and the cut is lovely. it gives me a wonderful, natural look. All of the brushes are great.The brushes are well made and are nice and soft.and I&#x27;m happy to say that I really recommend them!</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes. Great quality for the price. Beats paying 5X the price on Sephora brushes. I did notice some of the brush hairs falling out when I first got them in one of the larger brushes...but it hasn&#x27;t happened since. I use them every day!</li>
            <li> The amount of shedding was tremendous and ridiculous. I gently swept the brush across my cheek and a bunch of hair was left on my face from the brush. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Love brushes</li>
            <li> great for blending!!!</li>
            <li> Delivered super fast. Brushes are high quality. What I like the most is that, they do not shed. My money was well invested.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Nice soft brushes. Have washed once and no shedding. Don&#x27;t expect them to last for ever but great bargain for the price so far!</li>
            <li> I dont know what to think of it.  First one of the brushes came broken, silver part wasnt glued correctly.  But, I decided to move on because it was a cheap buy.  Then, I tried it for the first time and it was difficult to apply powder over my foundation because the brush, instead of applying the powder  (i used highlight colors from anastasia&#x27;s contour kit) it would retain foundation from my face, so areas I tried to highlight ended up getting foundation reapplied.  I dont know maybe I&#x27;m not using the brushes correctly.  Bottom line, I wasnt impressed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I purchased these brushes last month and have been using them almost everyday since then. At the time, I just wanted some good quality kabuki brushes that I can use to apply my foundation and BB cream with and these were cheap so gave them a try. I honestly have been impressed by how easy to use they are. They blend my face products so well, do not shed, and are so dense. I did not expect such good quality for $10. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love these best brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these brushes. I received them sooner than they promised. They are soft and work great. I would definitely say they are comparable to Mac brushes. I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> The brushes are not the high/top quality I was expecting after reading prior reviews prior to purchase but they are good.</li>
            <li> so many brushes and all great quality  the hairs doesnt fall out</li>
            <li> the brushes are alright. theres just a problem. the brushes smell like paint. no matter how many times i wash them the smell won&#x27;t go away. :(</li>
            <li> Soft, well-made, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These are really good brushes. They&#x27;re soft, dense, and haven&#x27;t shed ,I&#x27;m really surprised at the quality. Definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> absolutely love these! good quality and makes a definite difference in my makeup appearance</li>
            <li> Soft, durable and good looking as well. The brushes blend beautifully.Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed these makeup brushes! They are a very nice quality. They are SUPER soft, maybe the softest brushes I own! There is no bristle fallout like other brushes that I have owned.I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> unbelievable quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes. They are some of the softest synthetic brushes I have ever felt. Perfect for blending. The only off putting thing I have noted is that they feel greasy at first. I recommend cleaning them well before use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just wonderful. The brushes are made natural hair.These are really pretty brushes! So far none of the hairs have fallen out and they don&#x27;t feel too rough or stiff。I would order again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! Super soft, professional looking, great variety, amazing value! the bristles of the brushes have not fallen out.These are the best deal I could find and I am very happy with them!</li>
            <li> So far so good. They arrived on time and they are super soft and standard sizes. I haven&#x27;t got to use them because I just got them today, they look like good quality brushes. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that they have a strong scent. Smells like permanent markers or rubber  cement glue.  But I&#x27;m sure after using them that will go away. No biggie.</li>
            <li> This brush set is Amazing!!....The hairs on the brush are soft and they don&#x27;t shed off. I highly recommend these brushes. They&#x27;re well made, durable, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Applied make-up very well.. Great product ... Great price.  Thx !</li>
            <li> just because they&#x27;re soft doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re good brushes. they do in fact smell very bad, I assume they spray painted the silver parts and that&#x27;s the source of the smell, they&#x27;re okay as far as picking up foundation but I don&#x27;t see them as great brushes just because they&#x27;re soft. I used them this morning and wasn&#x27;t impressed. ELF makes better brushes.</li>
            <li> Delivery was excellent. Packaging was fine. However, two of the brush heads were detached from the handles and three more wee loose. Very disappointed about that. Do NOT recommend! Will not purchase any products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set it is very well made. They are very soft yet nice and dense.</li>
            <li> Omg these brushes are amazing! This price is a freaking steal! If you&#x27;re looking for good dense sturdy makeup brushes look no further. I took all of them out messed with the bristles and only 2 or 3 hairs came out, out of all 8 brushes!! I can&#x27;t wait to use these!</li>
            <li> These are amazing makeup brushes. They are professional. I&#x27;m very satisfied with their quality . They are made of high quality synthetic and apply makeup smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> A-Mazing brushes for the price! foundation goes on flawlessly and quickly now</li>
            <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever brought.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty good, they aren&#x27;t the best  though. They are really easy to clean and grip. Some people say the bristles come off early but that hasn&#x27;t happened to me. They get the job done.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not too bad, yeah they have funky strong smell when you open them, but it goes away pretty quickly. It didn&#x27;t really bother me at all. They&#x27;re pretty good for the price that you pay. There could be worse.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality shipped in one day.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Brushes were so soft, and not cheap! Recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money!</li>
            <li> These brushes exceeded my expectations!The brushes themselves are soft and durable.. All in all, I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected ~ very nice brushes!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!!!  I will never by a brand name brush ever again and the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> Received the items super fast which is a plus. When I recived them they were all individulaly wraped. When I used used them for the first time they were so soft. For the price it is a steal! Love them</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. All the bristles stay intact and are super soft on my face.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting these brushes from reading the previous reviews but as soon as I got my brushes and began to play them with them one broke off, after a day two more broke off. Soft but not good quality</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes. They are a nice variety of sizes and were a good value. They work better than I thought they would</li>
            <li> these brushes are a must buy. they are super soft. i love love love them. but remember to always always wash them after each use with regualr Dawn or Palmolive dish washing liquid. Trust me. I&#x27;ve done it everytime and it works.</li>
            <li> Huge fan! Far exceeded my expectations! I work in television, so I beat the hell out of my makeup brushes. These, not only seem sturdy but they&#x27;re REALLY soft and don&#x27;t shed much! They arrived super quick, too. I am in shock as to how much I actually like these. These hold up against any of the more expensive brushed I&#x27;ve purchased from Sephora, The Face Shop or the like... Great value. I will definitely order more when needed. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have the Mac set ...,my nice got it I had replace with this great set its worth every penny ..,you will not regret it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Bruges start shedding after extended use</li>
            <li> I got my package in just 2 days because of prime. The product looks how it should but it smelt really strong in an alcohol smell. Very strong and unpleasant. Otherwise they look great.</li>
            <li> Really soft on the skin--good assortment of sizes.</li>
            <li> I was initially super geeked when I got these....they appeared to be high quality full brushes.  However, a couple of months later, they are just okay.  The bristles are shedding, and the silver part of the brush is loose on most of them.  I guess you get what you pay for, so I am not that bummed, but I just wish they had at least lasted thru the end of the year.  But what are you gonna do?</li>
            <li> i really love how it blends the make up i just wonder how to wash them properly i usually tuin my brushes washing them?</li>
            <li> Love these!  Super soft!just as good as mac!  Wish there was a smaller liner brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this bases on the reviews, but unfortunately they are not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;overall they are OK, but I will still go with an other brand looking for better quality, not professional a better ones.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a set that is not expensive and do the job, this is ok.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good but they had a send smell irritated my face I&#x27;m putting on foundation I love it though it was cheap and everything I could recommended to my friend if the smell doesn&#x27;t bother them The smell might go away after watching it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft. They work well for the price and have a really great professional look to them. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> there okay. i dont know if i would buy them again.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife. She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Sorry for previous review I did get them.just don&#x27;t knw what brushes is for what</li>
            <li> Really good brushes for the price... cant complain...</li>
            <li> Very nice makeup brushes I just didn&#x27;t like the smell of them when they arrived</li>
            <li> These are very nice for the price!  I am happy with them and shared them with my daughters.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes worth the money and so much more!! I love them soooo much!! They make my makeup look and feel flawless!!</li>
            <li> Yes! These are exactly what I was looking for! Equal to my MAC brushes!</li>
            <li> Brushes feel really soft work amazing gives you that clean classic look great product!</li>
            <li> I only used these for about two weeks before I had to throw them away. Initially I was very happy and thought I had gotten a good deal, but when I washed them I realized that due to the cheap design any soap you use to wash them is literally IMPOSSIBLE to wash out. I washed them at the same time as my expensive Sigma brushes and the soap washed out of those with no problem. But these bristles aren&#x27;t packed as tightly in the metal casing so the soap gets up in there and WILL NOT COME OUT. I spent over ten minutes rinsing one brush before I gave up and threw them all away soon after.</li>
            <li> Surprised by the quality. Great transaction.</li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this brush set. There are plenty of bristles and they are firm enough but still soft against the skin. I have washed them several times and have not noticed any hair shedding. I liked them so much that I bought a set for my sister. (I&#x27;m a pretty good sister, but I&#x27;m kind of cheap. She will be surprised when she gets them because the quality of these brushes easily beats what I paid for them.)</li>
            <li> Glad I bought these. Great prices for quality beginner make up brushes</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box, the barrels of one of the brushes came loose and fell off. Not the best first impression, but over all they&#x27;re okay. Not the best, not the worst. They are soft but not dense enough for my liking. I still prefer my Sedona Lace Midnight Brush set over these since they do not &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; as easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was okay not what I expected</li>
            <li> Love them! Recommend them to everyone, very awesome brushes</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t used these brushes yet but overall, I think these brushes are a good bargain because they are dense and soft. They wash well so far. There is a smell but only when you first open the package and not so much on the brush themselves but I would recommend washing them anyways. No shedding so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complaints:&lt;br /&gt;- I feel the flats tops aren&#x27;t stiff enough but I until I try them out, I don&#x27;t know how well they will perform.&lt;br /&gt;- One round top big brush was manufacture wrong on mine. There is a v shape on the side with bristle missing. I don&#x27;t know how that will impact use but it&#x27;s a little irritating.&lt;br /&gt;Some Observations:&lt;br /&gt;-The big face brushes are smaller than I thought they would be (They are probably standard size but I was hoping for bigger brushes)&lt;br /&gt;-They feel lightweight, so I would be careful with the handles and not try to get ferrule wet or they might off the handle.&lt;br /&gt;-I feel like they are not quite on par with Real Techniques brushes but better than your average generic drugstore brushes. I have no clue about Sigma since I don&#x27;t owned those. Still, they are way cheaper in price than Real Techniques and really, a great bargain for what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally feel that if you are in want of brushes for whatever reason, these would be a great buy. I am pretty sure they will apply nice since they have the makings to do so, but if I notice that&#x27;s not the case I will edit this review.</li>
            <li> Omg I really loved my brushes they are so soft and work so perfect ..I got my yesterday everything was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Got sets for both girls and they love them.</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding. Other than that, love them.</li>
            <li> I was amazed on how fast I received my order.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> smelled right out the bag. other than that they&#x27;re wonderful</li>
            <li> Best brushes I ever purchased! only one brush wasn&#x27;t dense.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. I purchased these brushes after reading the review and I had high hopes for them but they are TOO SOFT and not dense at all. I don&#x27;t think these would be good with liquid foundation and that&#x27;s why I had bought them. People compared then to sigma brushes but there is NO COMPARISON</li>
            <li> These came super fast! They did smell funny right out of the packaging but I&#x27;m hoping washing them will help. They are sooooooooo super soft and the price just makes these 10x better! I can&#x27;t wait to use these to apply my makeup!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them, they&#x27;re so soft and blend eye shadows well, great price too.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Weird paint smell at first</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice, but they had a very very strong smell to them. Not bleach, but definitely some kind of a cleaning agent. The smell was soo strong that it smelled up my makeup bag. I let them air out before I used them. It took about 3 days before the smell went away, but other than that they work great</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
            <li> So got my brushes toda. They came right on time according to the estimated date. Which only took 5 days. So I ran upstairs ripped them out of the package. It came with a cute pink eco friendly bag. I took them all out of there individual package. Felt the brushes and they were so soft. So I went and started on my makeup and they worked so well. Which I was very pleased. I almost spent $40 for a sigma foundation brush. But for the prices of this set. I took a chance. And I&#x27;m glad I did. Will recommend these to my friends and will buy again😁✨💄</li>
            <li> Excellent set for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are actually good quality for the price. I was satisfied. They did have a &amp;#34;permanent marker&amp;#34; scent once I opened the package. I believe it was the wrapping rather than the brushes itself that had the smell. Yet, the product was as promoted. Def a good buy for this great price!</li>
            <li> Get these brushes. They are so soft and well made. I&#x27;ve washed mine numerous times, and no shedding nor losing their shapes. I love these brushes.I recommend this brush set!</li>
            <li> The brushes are just okay. The bristles could be shorter to provide a stiffer brush all around and it&#x27;s really disappointing these did not come with some sort of pouch to keep them all separate. They arrived in an &amp;#34;antimicrobial&amp;#34; zip pouch where each brush was individually encased in very cheap, loud, stiff plastic sleeves. But hey, it&#x27;s like $8 so if you need something in a pinch, it works.</li>
            <li> Have had no issues, almost a year later all the brushes are intact and work just fine.</li>
            <li> Just got in the mail. I&#x27;m so happy with the packaging and the carrying bag that came with the brushes. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> They all arrived on time and well places</li>
            <li> Just received my order. Nothing like the picture. The brushes look nothing like the picture displayed. they all are about the same shape and angle. I havent tried them yet. They have a string smell but i hope by washing them smell can go away.</li>
            <li> Soft, but firm. Feel and work great.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is a GREAT deal. The brushes are really good quality for the price. Like some others mentioned there is a slight paint-like smell when you first open them. I took mine out of the wrappers and let them air out &amp; they were absolutely fine. Alternatively you may just rinse them or wash them before using the first time. Since I use these so often &amp; wash them after each use I know they may shed one or two bristles but that may be because of the way I wash my brushes. Either way, if you&#x27;re looking for some starter makeup brushes for a great price, THESE ARE THE WAY TO GO!</li>
            <li> I like it ,its very  soft</li>
            <li> The packaging was okay one brush was squished and another brush didn&#x27;t work. That brush had some of the brissels falling off in chunks. Other that that the brushes were okay.</li>
            <li> Really soft. But strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Soft, dense, seems sturdy. It came with a cute (cheap) bag, which was nice. My only complaint is that they smell strongly of chemicals or paint, but that&#x27;ll probably fade</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a bit for this review. Very good brushes for the price. Makeup goes on very nice. I washed them about 5 times already (every two weeks) with baby shampoo and they&#x27;re still in great condition.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks the brushes have broken. The wood handle has come off several of the brushes.</li>
            <li> When I first received them I was super excited, as soon as I opened them they had a funky smell but I just washed them and smelled went away. After trying brush for the first time I wasn&#x27;t excited because the bristles were falling out while i was applying foundation on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product for purchase because you can just go to target and purchase their brand make up brushes which are cheap and are way better in quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft. They apply make-up beautifully. I love them so much. They are completely worth it.</li>
            <li> In Love with these brushes! super cheap as well</li>
            <li> I received my item very quick and works well. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! Soft against your face! Easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> They came in really fast, and they&#x27;re really good for the price. I love them!</li>
            <li> I was a little sketchy about buying these brushes over amazon BUT these are probably the best brushes I have got! I&#x27;m a makeup artist so I know good brushes when I feel them! Seriously NO SHEADING, NO CLUMPY MAKEUP, AND GREAT FOR WET AND DRY PRODUCT! LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good brushes, no shedding</li>
            <li> Great starter brush set! Soft; easy to clean</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I bought ones before that look exactly like this but have the name brand and oddly enough I found I liked these ones a lot better. They held their fluff much longer than the others. They didn&#x27;t get all clumpy with makeup or stop holding it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes! Just as good as MAC or sigma. I use these on myself and clients and everyone loves how soft they are. I always love brushes that are soft and have great application. GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, I love them so much I&#x27;m ordering another set now.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes, really soft! I was skeptical because of the price but wow i love them! Would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> Arrived prior to estimated delivery date.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and great quality! For a beginner it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> Love this set of brushes. Good price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great value, no shedding, soft. Will repurchase</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing for only. I would definitely recommend them to anyone searching for good brushes.</li>
            <li> Super soft, I use them almost every day!</li>
            <li> Love them, very soft and they don&#x27;t shed. They&#x27;re easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great brushed for the price</li>
            <li> These would get 5 stars for quality and the price if I hadn&#x27;t gotten one that had already been used. YUCK!</li>
            <li> The brushes are not as big as I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price!  Love them and use them every day.  It has changed how I do my makeup!</li>
            <li> Prefer the Smashbox brush.</li>
            <li> I tried these and love them. Im a beginner and don&#x27;t want to spend to much so these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! Can&#x27;t wait to use them and love the quality.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly great set of brushes at a super price. Ultra soft, wash well, and little to no shedding. Will purchase another set.</li>
            <li> very nice brush kit, sometimes they loose hairs , but they are nice.  very soft ,  the only thing is that you have to buy a container or a bag to keep them, because they come in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> great QUALITY! I was skeptical by how inexpensive these brushes are but they are such great quality. They&#x27;re very soft!</li>
            <li> I loved my brushes and they came right on time, i thank you and greatly appreciate everything..</li>
            <li> Loved this set. The brushes are soft and very durable. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great quality, good price, soft touch, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Great brushes at an amazing price! Would recommend or purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> I love this set!  Fair price and wonderful quality.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Great quality and shpiped on time .</li>
            <li> It is a very nice set. I love these brushes. They are very good quality; soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly picky about brushes. I usually don&#x27;t buy amazon brushes because more than once they have fallen apart on me immediately. However, these brushes have far exceeded expectations. They feel strong and rich and soft. They give you a tool for everything you need, and for an awesome price!&lt;br /&gt;I saw a few comments putting these down, so I was a bit worried, but I&#x27;ve now been using them for a while now and they have worked beautifully. I usually name a pros and cons list, but there are no cons to give. I am proud to apply my very expensive makeup with these beautiful brushes.</li>
            <li> Best makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! Got them in less than a week too!</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected and I felt like it was my birthday. I had previously bought a set of brushes but they were cheaply made and fell apart easily. These brushes were a great price and are pretty firm. None of the bristles have come out, and they are a great size. It did come in a pink case but it&#x27;s just a quick case to put them in, nothing fancy. (not complaining) :)&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a starter set that is good quality you won&#x27;t go wrong with these guys.</li>
            <li> nice brushes at a great price....what more can be said</li>
            <li> The hairs in the brush keep coming out and feel apart i wish i didn&#x27;t get these.... they sucked</li>
            <li> I tried out these brushes today and absolutely love it!! Each brush so amazing! I would so recommend these to anyone because I am just in love with them!</li>
            <li> I have to say these brushes are amazing. The brushes are soft. They are very sturdy. I don&#x27;t have the problem of loose bristles falling out after use.I am so in love with these brushes!! They are so easy to use</li>
            <li> They are great for the price. More than great in fact. However, I am super demanding when it comes to my brushes, I want to have no trace of a brush on my skin when I apply foundation. This one doesn&#x27;t blend foundation as perfectly as I would like, I have to run my hands to erase the trace. However, I like the shadow brushes, a little big, but I can work them. Buy it. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> A little rough packaging, just use a plastic bag sealed, hope that after the packaging more perfect; the use of items for a while, carding can also, more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Some of brushes for the face are great but the eye ones seem cheaper and are shaped funny</li>
            <li> Love these brushes best investment.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I took one star away is because there is no description of each individual brush. This is my first brush-set. I do own a few small Kabuki&#x27;s but did not have a complete set.This one is incredibly soft. I have not cleaned the bristles yet, but so far they are not loose.</li>
            <li> good substitute for expensive brushes. After a few months one of the brushes handle fell off, but I glued it back on. They don&#x27;t shed at all, not like other inexpensive brushes. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great brushes ! Soft and no fall out ! Fast shipping bought a second set for mom</li>
            <li> great brushes for cheap! Perfect for my contouring routine</li>
            <li> Great brushes but when I first got them they smell like paint?</li>
            <li> Very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t shed at all...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a makeup artist for 13 years and I&#x27;ve worked for companies who make expensive brushes. These brushes are really good quality. No shedding and the handles don&#x27;t come apart. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Work really well, and are easy to clean! So good for the price, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE SIZES, GREAT FOR FOUNDATION, BLUSH AND EYES.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just great and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.  They are dense enough and soft enough, I am rather shocked at the quality. Just as good as some higher end brushes. Great job to this company.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are very soft, thick, and does a great job apply make up.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the handles; the handles are short and very thick--however these brushes are worth the price and they won&#x27;t disappoint you.</li>
            <li> I love these, I use them everyday and ordering more!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft! They blend super easy and are easy to handle! LOVE! I haven&#x27;t used the eye brushes too much yet though. But when I have, they&#x27;ve been amazing.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing I love mine!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and well made. Hardly any shedding if any!</li>
            <li> Great purchase...I&#x27;m a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! they&#x27;re so soft, blend out foundation and concealer flawlessly. The smaller brushes i use them to contour. They haven&#x27;t shed yet and I&#x27;ve washed them 5 times already. These brushes are AMAZING!!! Don&#x27;t think about deciding what other brush set to get. This is what you want. Trust me :) lol</li>
            <li> Got these within a week of ordering. There was a noticeable unpleasant paint/plastic smell, but that lessens with airing out and washing the brushes. Bristles themselves were very soft, and picked up pigment well. Makes blending much easier.</li>
            <li> Great brushes worth the money and feel a lot more expensive.......I wish it came with a bigger powder brush but oh well its still a must have set.........</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are soft and smooth, and they apply my makeup perfectly.  These brushes are so far non shedding. Love them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality so far. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with any pieces falling out. They aren&#x27;t too firm and they have a great shape. Love the little ones as well. The pink small bag them come in is great for traveling as well. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> These brushes do smell A LITTLE once you first get them, but barely at all. They all ship in individual wrapping and they ship quickly. The brushes are so soft and so great. They work flawlessly. Highly recommended!! Don&#x27;t hesitate, for this price they&#x27;re perfection.</li>
            <li> Great brush kit, nice soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a few more eye makeup brushes and a flat kabuki brush. I watched a lot of reviews on YouTube and visited a few cosmetic stores and was set on purchasing various MAC eye makeup brushes and the Sigma flat kabuki brush. I came across this brush set on Amazon, read the reviews and ordered them. I figured I had nothing to lose since the price was around $10. I received the brushes quickly. Each brushhead was covered with plastic and all placed in a ziplock plastic pouch. I do agree with other reviewers in regards to a strong chemical smell. I&#x27;ve had the brushes for over a week now and the smell has dissipated. The brushes are super soft and have the right amount of density to pick up product and distribute it very well. I took away one star due to various indentations on the brush handles and for the slightly larger brush heads--neither of which take away from the effectiveness of the brush but does make it look like it&#x27;s been chewed on and can sometimes wipe on product on too wide of an area. *** Trying to add my photos which compare the size of a MAC 217 brush with these but no link available to upload :(</li>
            <li> Wonderful wonderful wonderful! So soft,  and came quickly. They did have a bit of  smell to them, but let them air and they are fine :)))) definitely getting more</li>
            <li> Great brushes and so affordable.</li>
            <li> OMG THESE BRUSHES ARE EXCELLENT THEY ARE THE BEST I AM SO IN LOVE I HAVE THROWN AWAY HALF OF MY BRUSHES FOR THIS SET DONT HESITATE TO BUY!!!!❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Not very good because they  are too flimsy.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product when I got it in the mail , got for a friend for Xmas hopefully she likes it too shipping was pretty alright fast enough. In all no brushes were damaged and all very soft I loved touching them.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.  And I am never pleased when buying something that is different than what I generally work with.&lt;br /&gt;I am a picky makeup artist, and these are great brushes for the price.  I will get another set, and I have already recommended.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. In the pictures, they look dense and that was what I was looking for and they are not and thats okay because they work great for an airbrush type of finish. They do absorb a lot of product which is fine and the little brushes, that are a bit more wispy, shed just a little. And the flat top big brush does a little as well.</li>
            <li> The quality of the bristles are good; however, the wooden handle on one of the bigger brushes already came off after several uses.  I fixed it with a super glue, but then the other ones are starting to wiggle and are becoming loose as well.  I have no complaint on the quality of the bristles; however.  They&#x27;re not shedding and they of good quality.  For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these. They smell like rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.  This is my first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first reading all the reviews about the smell of the brushes. I thought perhaps people were just being too not picky like they sometimes will be. These brushes are $10, you can&#x27;t expect top notch quality. But the price was good so I went ahead and bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived promptly. But as soon as I picked up the package I could smell it through the large bubble wrap interior manila envelope. I mean, it was a very chemical smell. After opening the package the smell was even stronger. The pink bag the brushes came in smelled like someone had washed it in pure rubbing alcohol. I thought maybe it was just the bag and the brushes themselves were fine. Nope. I smelled one brush and it just reeked of rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no way I was going to use that brush on my face without knowing what that smell was. I don&#x27;t know what the company uses on their materials but this is just unacceptable. How anyone gave these brushes a good review is incredulous. Do not buy this item! I will be returning this in the morning.</li>
            <li> Okay these are truly great brushes! !!!!!!!! I am so relieved to say that after reading reviews etc - But these are truly superb!!!!!! Idc if they do eventually break - I&#x27;ll buy more or just fix them! !!!! You do get what you pay for after all - but these are a steal! !!!!! I also will say if you&#x27;re looking for dupes of high quality brushes - these are it! !!!!</li>
            <li> Brushes don&#x27;t really hold the minerals as they should.</li>
            <li> Absolute love these brushes</li>
            <li> great deal! nice quality</li>
            <li> I love the brushes. The quality was great especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how amazing these brushes are! I am a professional makeup artist and I use these on myself and my clients. I have spent more money on worse brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. Buy it now.</li>
            <li> Love love love love ! For the price it&#x27;s definitely a great buy! I recommend ! You won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these. They&#x27;re super soft and incredibly useful. They&#x27;re a part of my everyday makeup routine now!</li>
            <li> Been using these for over a month and they are awesome!</li>
            <li> not the quality that was described. will have to return them</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and awesome price!</li>
            <li> I use these brushes every time i do my makeup! I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase at all.  Eye brushes too big and face brushes too small and stiff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They arrived at my house very quickly, less that a week I believe. The quality of the brushes are amazing as well. They hold well and they do not leave streaks which I am very happy of compared to other make up brushes. I will definitely be buying another set when needed.</li>
            <li> None are kabuki sized brushes good for foundation, still fast ship and great brushes for price</li>
            <li> Bought these for my lady friend. She loves them. Says they&#x27;re the best brushes she&#x27;s ever had. Compares them to Sigma brushes that cost 10 times as much. I have noticed her makeup improve a lot over the last week she&#x27;s used these, much less blotchy, cakey. So I guess I can place this item in the good boyfriend gift list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a very distinct paint smell when you first open up the package. &amp;#34;Paint&amp;#34; as in paint you buy at home depot to paint your interior walls. It went away with a quick wash and rinse with soap.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great and super soft brushes</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely love these brushes. Super soft on your skin. We will just have to give it some time to see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my brushes yesterday, which is way earlier than I thought. All my brushes are in perfect condition, the brushes are supper soft!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to start using them. I will buy another set for a gift. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Did have a chemical smell at first but don&#x27;t shed at all. I like the variety in brushes. They are all good quality and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes ! Better than Mac or sigma! Don&#x27;t waste your money on big name brands! These are great</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They are just like name brand brushes and I am completely satisfied with my purchase! :)</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this brush set, especially for the price. The brushes are sturdy and very soft. Definitely not the fake plastick feeling. I buy a lot of makeup products and I almost like these more than the other larger brushes that came with my costal scents 22 piece brush set. It was also shipped in a timely manor, which is always nice.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft. They came early which i realled liked! Just one bad thing i had to say was the terrible chemical smell. So wash and rinse well!</li>
            <li> Best brushes!!! So soft and perfect price.</li>
            <li> The brushes came quicker then I expected.and they look just like the picture. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the quality of the brushes. They perform just as well as high end brushes, but for a much better price. One brush handle is a little wiggly, but I can fix that easily. They are soft and densely packed. I don&#x27;t use the flat top or tapered kabuki, but they are still great brushes. My favorite is the buffer, and pointed eye brush. The pointed brush is the perfect smudger/crease brush. I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about these brushes being only the $11 something dollars I paid for them, but have become my holy grail of daily use.  They are super soft and I have no problem at all with them picking up the product.  I have only high end cosmetics and they can usually be harder to pick up powders vs other lower end brushes.  They did have a funky smell to them when I first opened them, but I washed them and the smell was long gone. MUST buy if your a Sigma Brush junkie, but need a cheaper version!!&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li> I love my makeup brushes! Quick shipping and durable brushes! So soft!</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft! This is a great set for someone who is just starting to take makeup a little more seriously. The brushes are very dense and soft with no fallout. There is a slight smell to when you first open the package, but nothing that a wash can&#x27;t get rid off.</li>
            <li> But them, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Really nice product . Came on time only took 4-5 days.There really soft and nice.They haven&#x27;t lost any of the hairs on it.Im very pleased with this product although they do smell like paint but I&#x27;ve bought other brushes and they had that smell it goes away once you wash them or use them all the time.</li>
            <li> These were very good quality, worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Holy cow..cannot believe the quality of these brushes for the price! Wish i had known about these before i bought my sigma brushes. Great for foundation and contouring. So soft and dense! No smell either like some have said.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes. They are smaller and more dense than I expected. Not a bad thing but they definitely won&#x27;t do as your only brushes.  I still need my real techniques eye brushes and powder brushes but these are a great addition to my collection.  I had to trim up a couple long hairs but overall the quality seems good. No shedding or loose bits. They are very soft and I love the flat top brush for my foundation. It gives beautiful coverage and blending.</li>
            <li> REALLY NICE SET, SUPER SOFT AND MAKE UP GLIDES ON</li>
            <li> Very happy with these.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it! Love how soft they are, they do have a weird smell at first though. Overall , i&#x27;m a satisfied customer! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Love them. Received them very fast. Very very soft bristles... LOVE THIS..</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I am new to using brushes to apply makeup.  These are great. They are nice and dense, easy to control and there has been no shedding.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very soft, works very well</li>
            <li> The brushes did come with a chemical smell, but after being washed they were fine. Only a few of the hairs on the brushes have came off or weren&#x27;t even. The brushes do what they are meant to do. So far it seems to be a good buy for how much I paid. Also it got here in a pretty good time.</li>
            <li> the hairs on these brushes are baby soft. I&#x27;ve had them for a year now but I don&#x27;t use them that much. I wash them after every use. After a while the handles separate and come loose so I have to superglue them back together. this is why I updated my review. other than that they are decent brushes</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. When I first got them they smelled at first but it went away</li>
            <li> The reviews were dead on, in these did not disappoint me at all!</li>
            <li> great brushes for the money very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and great price!</li>
            <li> I like this set very much. Brushes are very nice and easy to use. I&#x27;ll highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> This brush set is so handy! Although some of the brushes I don&#x27;t use, a lot of them I use every day! Great value.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t an actual Bestope product. There was no label on the brushes. I will not order from Amazon again regarding this product.</li>
            <li> The brushes work well and don&#x27;t shed. The smell was unpleasant but you have to clean them and air them out before use.&lt;br /&gt;I like them, would order again:)</li>
            <li> Lovely for the price!</li>
            <li> Love love love. I desperately wanted the Sigma F80,82,84,86 and after my husband saw the price he said absolutely not. I did some research on line and read the reviews and these are a very close second. So much so that my friends when they saw them almost didn&#x27;t notice the difference. If you are looking for a less costly version this is it. I have purchased another set for my nieces birthday told a bajilllion people about these and I will be purchasing another set for when I wash my brushes. Which they have no problems after being cleaned. ❤️</li>
            <li> Im in love with them!!!</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING! I have had them for about two weeks now, and I cannot put them down! I am a makeup junkie and I have fallen in looooove with these. They blend beautifully; you barely have to move the brush to blend your products; densely packed bristles make for an AH MAZE ING brush! Dont miss out on this awesome deal! I will def. continue buying from this company. Item shipped very quickly and packaging was a huge plus. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived super quick, These brushes are super dense snd extremely soft!! I would so buy another set seriously this was a steal! I would recomnend these to anyone so if you plan on buying them but arent sure GET THEM you will not dissapoint:)</li>
            <li> I would  like to thank the merchant for the prompt service rendered. However, the quality of the brushes were extremely rough and irritating to my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to purchase these items.</li>
            <li> I almost always read reviews before I buy and so I did read about these. They were not kidding!!. These feel soooo soft and high quality. They blend beautifully and it even looks like I have airbrush make up on (lol). They&#x27;re a perfect size to handle. Some reviews said that they came squished in a small box but my box was just perfect even bigger that the product. The smell IS strong but it goes away. The only thing that&#x27;s bugging me is that after just one use they seem to look filthy but then again that&#x27;s because of the white bristles. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with these and I already recommended to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Love them. Even though they are synthetic and not goat hair brushes still nice quality for a decent price. Next best thing to my MAC pro brushes. Will give another review in a few months on how they hold up and last. But very soft and not harsh on face!! A+</li>
            <li> I really love my brushes !! Really professional I order a second set for gift and my sister you loved ♡♡ thanks for your great service ♡♡</li>
            <li> I really liked these brushes.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week and cant complain. I think they re a really good deal for such a cheap cost</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT make up brushes. I highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I use to use a sponge for my make up but these blend so much better and they do not shed at all. I&#x27;ve only used them 3 times and the brush still looks intact. Great Buy.</li>
            <li> Missing two brushes, the ones I did get really suck. Some the heads fell out and like the foundation brush leaves lots of streaks and doesn&#x27;t pick up the makeup very well. Disappointed 😳</li>
            <li> Dense and soft. No shedding after washes. Only complaint is the strong smell coming off them, however it doesn&#x27;t deter me from using  them daily.</li>
            <li> Wow! Although I have never purchased any high end makeup brushes since I can not bring myself to spending that much money on a brush when I am a single mom and brushes are not a high priority on my list, I was still skeptical about purchasing these without being able to see them first. But OMG! These brushes are great! They are so soft. The flat kabuki brush is hands down my new favorite liquid foundation brush. My foundation looks flawless! I will say they do smell kind of like paint when you first open them (just the black part of the barrel) but 2 days later i could not smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I Order these brushes very happy with them. Their handles are hard ,nice weight. Their very soft like velvet. Very happy with them would order again.</li>
            <li> The first day I had them the handle broke off of one. I had to glue it back in. Overall they are decent brushes. They apply the makeup as expected and I like the foundation brushes the best. Very affordable. Smelled strongly of the plastic they came wrapped in.</li>
            <li> my daughter love it came fast</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I was looking for.  Great for blending eye shadow or applying blush, contour and powder foundation.  I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation so I&#x27;m not sure how they would apply those products.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these and received them today. Usually I use cheap dollar store brushes and a sponge for my foundation but after watching a tutorial, I purchased these. They made my makeup look absolutely flawless! I didn&#x27;t lose makeup in the brushes and they are soft to the touch! Amazing buy!</li>
            <li> Lack of quality. Strong chemical smell. Not very dense. Very cheaply made. Would probably not recommend. Disappointed... :/</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money-nice, versatile, soft brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are honestly amazing for the price. They are my first real set of makeup brushes and they have not let me down yet. I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now and they are still going strong. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> Soft brushes but make sure you wash your brushes because the brushes intially smell like paint.</li>
            <li> I just got them delivered at my door today &amp; I was super excited to open up my package!!! First things first: I am going to agree with the first impression SMELL,(they smell like ...sharpie chems :l ) but that can easily be washed out (: soo as far as that I&#x27;m going to judge them by function within this week &amp; other than that I give them a 3 for now because they&#x27;re sensitively soft and not tough on my hands so I trust them on my face &amp; they look professional plus the size options are a must have ! If I continue liking them I&#x27;ll sure give them the extra stars(:</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. The brushes are just as they are described &amp; they are amazingly soft, &amp; the shipping was fast. I would definitely recommend anyone to buy this item</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price! Super soft, applies makeup as well as the expensive brands. No shedding. Only complaint is the overwhelming paint smell which I hope goes away soon. Seriously....so strong that you can smell them when you walk into the room!! :/</li>
            <li> They are really great! And for the price even better!!</li>
            <li> LOVE MY BRUSHES! I GOT THEM ON TIME.. AND I LOVE HOW THEY BLEND IN MY MAKEUP:) I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THEM.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice for starting a bigger and better makeup collection. The several different kinds of brushes are very useful in applying makeup and they are easy to clean for the most part. I found that they made my makeup stay on longer and appear more vivid than my other brushes. They don&#x27;t steal a lot of your product like some other brushes I have used. They are also great for blending, everything from foundation to eye shadow looks naturally blended.</li>
            <li> Wonderful makeup brushes, soft and good quality. I cleaned them before I used them and none of the bristles fell off so far.</li>
            <li> Love love love these makeup brushes. The brushes as so soft and easy to use and they are extra gentle on my skin. The brushes are also easy to clean! we love them!</li>
            <li> Well, I was expecting more since there were so many great reviews, but I&#x27;m disappointed. I realize they were under $10, and I guess for that price they are good brushes, but I found them way to stiff and difficult for blending. There was some shedding, but my biggest problem was with random long strands that need to be cut/trimmed. It made application weird with longer strands, especially with the first 2 brushes. Just not what I was hoping for. For the price I guess they are decent, though. I have since bought another set of brushes from Amazon that I am more than happy with, though.</li>
            <li> got these for my daughter and we both use them.  great make up brushes, very soft, yet stiff too</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a low price. They do have a weird smell when you first open them, but the smells goes away within a few days. Good quality</li>
            <li> Very good brushes. Work like a brand brush would do. I love them so much. I will for sure buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The are amazing! I strongly recommend them! I like them more than my real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! For the price these work very well..  Almost as good as Mac Brushes.. Highly recommend.!</li>
            <li> What the heck are all the complaints about! Amazon&#x27;s prime shipping got these brushes to me light speed fast &amp; the seller packaged them beautifully! You need to know what you&#x27;re purchasing before giving back feedback on the item. NO, it doesn&#x27;t say what each brush is for... but it&#x27;s not rocket science to find out or already know. These are better than beginner brushes for the price, actually. I have lots of brand names &amp; are they a little less dense? SURE! We&#x27;re they a steal to have extras for travel, etc? YES! The quality is fantastic, very soft. There was a plastic smell coming from them in the packaging but once removed &amp; washed with a little Purity, bam gone. Love them. Would buy again &amp; again. No shedding &amp; I&#x27;m a rough washer LOL. THANKS AMAZON &amp; BESTOPE!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, but wish that there were more smaller eye make up ones.</li>
            <li> Best brushes for the price I&#x27;ve ever found. These brushes are similar to Sigma but for a fraction of the cost!!! So pleased and happy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still amazed at the quality of these brushes for the price! As soon as I got them, I washed the brushes with Dove soap to get the smell out of them.  The brushes didn&#x27;t even shed! The day after, when the brushes have finally dried, I was impressed at how soft the bristles were still! I was expecting it to shed and feel rough after washing it.  Using it to apply makeup was also great and the quality compares just as good if not better to my more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price. I mainly got it for the stippling brush, because I prefer using that for my foundation, but I&#x27;ve actually fallen in love with using the angled brush for my blush. The bristles are all VERY soft. They pick up and blend product well. My only gripe is the handles aren&#x27;t very sturdy -- the stippling brush is already starting to dislodge some. But considering the price and the quality of the actual brush, it&#x27;s a drawback I can handle. Also, I did notice a pretty harsh chemical smell when I opened them, but they aired out fairly well.</li>
            <li> the brushes a very soft and good quality my mother has no complants and she loves them, wonderful gift to give</li>
            <li> My favorite set of brushes !! They blend well and machine was amazing ! Brissles are extremely durable and they are dry nice and quickly after machine washing. No damage to your machine, brushes , or clothes . I live that the tips are white so you can really see how dirty/clean they are . I hate all black brushes ! These are affordable and will last you a while</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to go with the contouring makeup that I purchased.  I really like to brushes and the variety that you get.</li>
            <li> This seller is great. Product is good for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these make up brushes. I tried them the minute I got them. They are easy to clean and handle really well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!!! Love love love!</li>
            <li> I had been using the ELF powder brush and Real Techniques Expert Face Brush for my foundation before I got these. 3 of the 4 face brushes in this kit are pretty similar and I use them interchangeably for liquid and powder foundation. I think they are as soft and work as well as my Real Techniques brushes. They are softer then the ELF brush I use. The cuts on the face brushes are not perfect but I didn&#x27;t notice that affecting my makeup application in any way. I really like the smaller brushes. They are great for concealer and placing eyeshadow. The only t liked to hing I would have liked to see in this kit was s lightly fluffier brush for blush, but otherwise, it is great quality at a great price and I am tempted to buy more of them.</li>
            <li> these makeup brushes are amazing!The brushes are so soft and perfect!!!Very good purchase for the quality. i will definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> You absolutely can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> These brushes are AWESOME and you can&#x27;t be the price.  These could have easily been priced on the high end and would have been justified.  The flat head large brush is great for applying foundation in a circular motion. The more pointy large one is great for contouring below the cheek bone.  The angled large one is great for blending under the eye up through the corner of the eye.  Haven&#x27;t figured out what to do with the large round slightly pointy one but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll figure it out.  All the little brushes are great for the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the quality of this brush set! I was a makeup artist for MAC cosmetics for 10 years, and a lot of the time their 20 dollar brushes would shed hairs everywhere. This set has not done that! I just cannot believe how low the cost is for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;And it shipped in only 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievably happy with this brush set!</li>
            <li> These are typical cheap brushes.  Not cut well, some of the hairs are sticking out.  Overall not impressed, go to Walmart and buy their synthetic brushes, you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> Love them but shipping was late</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! Very good quality and for such an amazing price. It&#x27;s a win-win. I highly recommend and would definitely purchase this as a gift for a good friend.</li>
            <li> Excellent high quality brushes! Definite sigma dupes. Do not smell or shed even after multiple washes. Very dense and soft, and make up application is a lot more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes for the price !! I hate paying so much for brushes especially since I&#x27;m a young mother in school. After reading these reviews I thought why not try them ? MAGNIFICIENT definitely buying more for my mother and mother in law. Perfect for a gift for someone who loves makeup. They will never know what you really spent! They aren&#x27;t SUPER dense but the quality of these are unbelievable !! I love them and I just got them Saturday tried them Sunday and can&#x27;t stop using them ! THANKKK YOU!!! Perfectly blended face as seen in my photo !</li>
            <li> This make-up brush set are of high quality and really well made.They are made of synthetic hair, really easy to clean,and will recommend them to family and friends</li>
            <li> First day I received and used them two of them broke .. Cheaply made in my opinion but the brushes are soft</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes!! I&#x27;m so obsessed with these. They&#x27;re such good quality for your money! They ship super fast and come just like it says</li>
            <li> so soft could not belive the quality! have recommended it to many friends</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They are very silky soft. My make up really does go on so much better using these. I am going to purchase another set for my Daughter. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously, spend the $17 and get these brushes. Soft, dense, efficient, amazing. Slight chemical smell washes away after one wash. Holds up well after washing. I cannot rave enough about these brushes! Arrived promptly, too!</li>
            <li> I really like these. I usually prefer a damp sponge over any brush but i like this brush, i like all of them. My only issue is I think there are a few of the exact same brush, and I didnt need so many, but not really something to complain about. They are much better than my old brushes from estee lauder. but i owned those for almost 20 years so time will tell, would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> So AMAZING! These brushes are so soft ! Not what I expected, very happy that I purchase these brushes can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> Gets the job Done.  Look bueatiful in my room.  And gives my makeup a flawless finish</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5590d10d9ff901a6c49a511310d9f83c]]Bestope Review on Premium Synthetic Kabuki Makeup Brush Set in Silver and black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these within 3-4 days of purchasing them and was very impressed they arrived in a bubble wrap envelope and each of the brushes were wrapped individually in plastic covers. I am happy with the quality, they are very dense, the only thing I noticed was a painty smell to them but Im hoping that goes away after washing them. They are very soft and comparable to other high end brushes. Applies makeup flawlessly!  It a great buy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3FNsA1vFRuQpL2O-Py1xGA</li>
            <li> So far, so good! They feel soooo soft and good quality! Sadly I pulled one of the hairs from the Angled kabuki brush and it resulted in more hairs coming out :( I believe that&#x27;s my fault though! They did smell like paint but I washed them abs the smell out! I wasn&#x27;t too concerned about the smell considering my Urban Decay foundation also smells like paint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes! They Look really nice. The brushes are so soft and minimal shedding so far. They hold make up very well as well. The big angled brush has to be my favorite brush in the set. It applys foundation so smoothly and evenly! The set is a great buy!</li>
            <li> The larger brushes have fairly small heads for what they should be used for. I&#x27;m no makeup guru by any means. The worst is after using the one larger angled brush ONCE a huge chunk of bristles just fell right out.  I can&#x27;t imagine what would happen when the time comes to clean the brush,,,,,,You can get better quality brush sets at your local pharmacy, Target, or Walmart for around the same price point.  Don&#x27;t buy this set.</li>
            <li> nice soft brushes good value for money</li>
            <li> I love how they feel on my skin, and they work very well, blend everything perfectly... Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> So soft. The price is amazing. No shedding. I will buy these again when these are done for.</li>
            <li> feel apart after only two weeks..was able to super glue them back. then that they blend really well</li>
            <li> Very large brushes&lt;br /&gt;Nice and soft&lt;br /&gt;Picks up product beautifully&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting smaller blending brush and conic brush for the eyes&lt;br /&gt;But the brushes are extremely nice and great price</li>
            <li> These brushes smelled so bad when I opened them up.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so amazing! I have been doing my own makeup every day for the past 10 years and these brushes have improved my skills and application right away.  They are soft and don&#x27;t shed like a lot of other cheap brushes I&#x27;ve used.  They are also perfect for blending eyeshadows to make for a professional, blended, and finished look.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am getting married next month and wanted to buy new brushes without spending so much on them. I read the reviews and saw how many girls compared them to MAC brushes....um....YES!! My sister has tons of them and they are so similar and so soft on the face! They did have a tiny smell but hey, they are brand new and freshly manufactured. Nothing a wash won&#x27;t fix. Literally LOVING these!</li>
            <li> Update: I have had these brushes for almost 3 years and use them daily (washed weekly-ish with dove soap). After 3 years one of the brushed is starting to shed (the flat top one which is the one I use the most). But for 3 years and such a good price - I can&#x27;t be upset! These guys are really great and should be in everyone&#x27;s makeup bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are dense, soft, and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent for the price. I think they perform very well and I use them daily. The only thing negative I will say is that initially they have a string smell of paint when first removing them from the plastic. This goes away pretty quickly once they have been exposed to air for a bit.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and are amazing quality. They don&#x27;t shed and place product well. Love them!</li>
            <li> I love the flat top foundation brush... They are all extremely soft</li>
            <li> Great quality my new favorite brushes they are super soft don&#x27;t shed top quality only gave four stars because they are a bit bigger then I would like but they still work great for my bb creams and concealers love love I highly recommend I&#x27;m shocked at how they are cheaper then elf but quality is sooooo much better not as good as sigma but pretty close but for the price difference forget sigma!</li>
            <li> I like them and was delivered fast</li>
            <li> Weird smell when it arrived in the packaging, but that went away after a few days.  I&#x27;m no makeup brush connoisseur, but all I know is I spent half as much for this set of 8 brushes than I had spent on one brush from Sephora... and I can&#x27;t tell the difference in quality...so, I would say I got a great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these brushes! I contemplated over whether I sho buy them because come one that price is crazy good, but I went for it and my brushes arrived 2 days later in a cute pink bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe the quality of these brushes! They are amazing. I compared them to my tarte kabuki brush and my bare minerals brushes and they&#x27;re just as good. I can&#x27;t afford to splurge on brushes anymore so this was perfect for my budget and my standards.... The only little problem might be the plastic/glue smell but I&#x27;m sure it will go away after a wash or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K I&#x27;m done ranting Thanks Bestope!</li>
            <li> Great brushes(: Super soft and good quality for the price! Would buy again</li>
            <li> Out of the box the brushes all had a strong chemical smell so I would highly recommend washing these and airing them out before using them. The ones I got were faulty and had weird deep scratches/grooves along the handles (wasn&#x27;t just one but many of them) so I ended up returning them. Other than that the bristles felt very soft and the build was decent for the price range (BUT bear in mind that I did get a damaged set and I&#x27;m not sure how common this is). I would recommend this set of brushes if you&#x27;re on a budget and wouldn&#x27;t mind the initial smell, but I do have to give a low rating because of them being damaged and I had to spend the time to return them (and there was no exchange button so I just didn&#x27;t bother re-purchasing).</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, they leave my face looking flawless only downside is the smell</li>
            <li> these brushes were amazing for the price . i got them for my sister but they were just so great and it came with everything i needed</li>
            <li> These brushes are just as good as they look. I compared the round top kabuki to my real techniques buffing brush and as you can see they are practically the same. The only thing I will say about them is they are  a slightly bit more flexible then the real techs brushes. But great for anything liquid. They do have a smell like almost all brushes do. Since you are supposed to wash your brushes before first use this shouldn&#x27;t be a real problem to anyone because the smell goes away instantly. For the price you are paying here to get all 8 you would pay for one brush anywhere else. Def worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Good so far. It&#x27;s shed just a tiny bit. Comes in the cutest little bag</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I use Chanel, Stila and Lancome foundations. I loved them so much, got some for my sister to try. She is hooked too. They use less product, lays your liquid foundation flawlessly onto your face. Don&#x27;t miss this makeup tool.</li>
            <li> My Sigma F80 broke. So i needed a replacment. I looked and looked for just the right brushes and found these.  I could not be happier with them.  My face has an airbrushed appearance.  I&#x27;m amazed at the quality</li>
            <li> They shed a lot. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee these brushes! Very soft.</li>
            <li> Initially they had a smell, but once I cleaned them they were fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the quality and amount of brushes you get for this price!</li>
            <li> Great quality. I love these brushes more than my Sigma ones!</li>
            <li> Just like the Sigma kabuki brushes. I was skeptical when I first bought them but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, I&#x27;ve had them for over a month now, washed them and use them every day and they are all great quality, soft and no fall out.</li>
            <li> These are super soft! They are also very pretty in person and work very well for applying my makeup. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> arrived suprisingly quick!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set</li>
            <li> These are awesome! I have two sets and I love them. I use them for basic makeup and they are great for the price!</li>
            <li> I love them they are amazing for contouring and highlighting</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, great price! I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li> Cheap product, brushes have been shedding since first day of use. Probably why cost was low.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for the price! They don&#x27;t clean super easily and they smell weird out of the package but overall they great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the brushes feel great.  Worth the price paid!</li>
            <li> This set of brushes has a very good quality, so far they seem durable and easy to use. I apply foundation to my face with one of them, that&#x27;s a good technique to hide skin imperfections or those little scars that remain after acne with the years. I find it is better than using a sponge applicator or my fingers. I have noticed that foundation spreads and covers better using these brushes and they are easy to wash. The quality is way better than the regular brushes I buy over the counter. I highly recommend it, it is a must have!</li>
            <li> After the first use the brushes fall apart. Not meant for long term use or if you&#x27;re constantly using them on clients.</li>
            <li> I spent $300 on Sigma brushes and these are just as soft and nice, I will definitely be telling everyone about these!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price!!! So happy definitely I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> Strong smell when opening. Had to soak wash them for smell to leave. Soft bristles but need to label them. Not a bad price</li>
            <li> I use these as blending tools and to apply my foundation. They are very soft!! no fall out so far, I&#x27;ve washed them once.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. Easy to clean. Easy to use with makeup and they do not shed</li>
            <li> The brushes work pretty well. If you are lookin for something high end these are not the brushes for you. But for the price you just can&#x27;t miss out. I love the angled blending brush it has the perfect length for my face and is stiff enough to blend your product well. Brushes are definitely useable and worth purchasing if you want a simple set of brushes to start off with.</li>
            <li> They were great! I received them in a timely manner.  Would order them again</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> Great quality.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this order</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Great value, good quality, great customer service.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money good product came faster than expected</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much! They are very soft, the packeging is great, and it arrived in week.</li>
            <li> niece says she like&#x27;s them! Great gift!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this brush set. I must say, they are very good quality.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They&#x27;re so soft, comparable to other high end make up brushes I paid a lot for. No bristles fall out, unlike the drugstore cheapie brushes.I&#x27;d recommend this set</li>
            <li> These are wonderful brushes!!! They arrived quickly，I am very pleased &amp; highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these brushes after reading tons of reviews but I caved and figured I would give them a try. The brushes are moderately dense and have a soft texture, but I feel they do not transfer my powders well. When it comes to blending liquids and creams, they work great.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these brushes until I find a new set more suitable to my needs.</li>
            <li> Sadly this set didn&#x27;t last long for me. One of the bigger brushes fell apart with the bristles being detached to the handle completely. At first it worked great and I practically used it every time I put makeup on. I even washed it a few times but the last wash finally did it. I&#x27;m afraid to rewash the rest and debating about tossing them. These brushes are not meant to be long term use and I would recommend investing on really good quality brushes for everyday usage. Note: this is the second time I&#x27;ve reviewed this product. I&#x27;m recounting my previous statement.</li>
            <li> Okay, so first things first. this is a perfect brush set for beginners and people who want a low priced but goof quality brush set. Overall the brushes are really good quality. the wood feels really firm, the bristles are packed in their and the metal part doesn&#x27;t move.  so far I&#x27;ve only tried the foundation brushes and I love them! I did not get any streaks and my face did not get irritated by the synthetic bristles. I do recommend washing them before you use them the first time just to get any leftover chemical residue left on the bristles. The brushes did smell like chemicals but that&#x27;s the glue that your smelling. it will go away but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I would have left a five star review but unfortunately one of the eye-shadow brushes arrived damaged. I can still use it but not for the purpose it was created for. The metal part was dented it and it morphed the bristle shape and so now its basically like another blending brush. overall its really great and I do recommend this brush set</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed and used these almost exclusively in the month since I&#x27;ve gotten them and I love them.  I use the large flat top for powder foundation, the rounded flat top for liquid foundation blending, the angled flat brush for blush and bronzer, and surprisingly the oval pointed brush for patting in and setting my under-eye concealer.  I use the four smaller brushes for my eye makeup application and the fluffier ones are fantastic for blending the eyeshadow edges.  They are all thickly bristled and soft!  I&#x27;m buying a second set for travel!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these sets, one for myself and one for my daughter-in-law.  The brushes are of decent quality and work well with creams or powder. The pointed kabuki brush is great for applying cream blush.  The stipple brush is good for applying foundation if you want sheer coverage.  The rounded kabuki brush is good for applying powder and the angled one, is good for powder blush.  The eye makeup brushes are excellent for shading and blending but aren&#x27;t as nice as the kabuki brushes.  Usually, I&#x27;m not a fan of synthetic brushes but this is a nice set for the price.  My daughter-in-law is just starting her collection of makeup brushes and this set is a good addition.  The construction of the brushes is better than I expected it to be.  They will last a long time.  I&#x27;m taking off one star because they&#x27;re not so great that they blew me away, but I was pleasantly surprised that the quality was an good as it proved to be.  For anyone starting a collection, this would be a good first purchase.  However, natural bristle brushes are better in general and if you buy ones of excellent quality, they will last for decades (if you take good care of them).  I do recommend this set of brushes, they are a good buy.</li>
            <li> these are so soft! i love them!</li>
            <li> I  love my brushes work amazing and arrive on time 😄</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes!!! Would highly recommend.... Received them in the mail super fast.... Great for all types of makeup applications.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and durable! I love them and I cannot believe how great they work on my clients for this price!</li>
            <li> Theses brushes are amazing for the price! I am in shock over how nice they are. I have a lot of expensive brushes from Mac and Japonesque, but these are my favorites by far. Packaged really cheaply, or I would buy 10 more sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> Great set for the price. My only complaint is that the handles of the brushes aren&#x27;t secured very well. Every single handle detached from the metal piece that holds the handle and the brush together. A little superglue fixed the issue, but it was a bit disappointing. Other than that, the brushes are quite good, I haven&#x27;t had too much &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; and they seem to blend makeup really well.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a foundation brush that gives the sort of airbrushed look that I like. Most of the ones I looked at were $30-50 for a single brush. This set is just as soft and the bristles are just as secure as the more expensive products. The foundation brush gives amazing, consistent coverage and the other brushes are a joy to use. They are so soft that even the eye shadow brushes do not pull on the delicate skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I literally NEVER write reviews this might actually be my first product review for anything. But I had to review these brushes because they are SO amazing! I realized they are imitations of Sigma brushes and I&#x27;m telling you they are definitely up to par. If you have any doubt in your mind about buying these, get them!! They are so incredibly soft it&#x27;s unbelievable. They don&#x27;t shed AT ALL and they haven&#x27;t fallen apart or anything. They also go right back to normal after washing. I bought these as back up brushes but they are now my primary brushes that I use every day! And the price is just crazy for how good these are. Get them!</li>
            <li> Just received the brushes today and they are amazing. They are so soft, but yet firm; which is perfect for blending and applying makeup. The brushes do have a strong smell to them. It reminds me of the smell of paint, but I am pretty sure once they have been shampooed and cleaned the smell will go away. Super excited to try the brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> Today was the first time using the eyeshadow brushes and Iove these very firm and dense as well as soft!! Would recommend I also received these brushes in tact which I was very pleased about that!!</li>
            <li> blends makeup perfectly almost too good for the low price LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Amazing great quality brushes and fabulous price!! I have no complaints as they&#x27;re super soft and dont shead. I would definitely repurchase if i had to even even for gifts. I use these every single day :)</li>
            <li> These brushes work amazingly! Smooth application, and easy to clean. The bristles are not easily removed, which makes me happy. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> Good makeup brushes although the smell of pain is kinda strong!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great - exactly as pictured! They are thick and sturdy with no shedding. Mine previous ones were getting very old and I read other reviews that compared these to high end make up brushes (but for a fraction of the price - BONUS). One thing I wish was included either on the brushes or with some type of instructions/directions would be what each brush should be used for. It would be nice to know which brush is for concealer/foundation, blush, contouring etc. I guess it is not a big deal, but it would be nice to know.</li>
            <li> So smooth and nice they work well so far and became a really good quality but it&#x27;s only been a week and a half</li>
            <li> Very nice variety of brushes. Extremely soft tips. With bristles ranging from stiff to softer.&lt;br /&gt;Application is great</li>
            <li> First off, wow!  These brushes are so soft and so beautiful, it is a shame to use them to apply makeup really!  The brushes are amazingly soft and plush yet firm enough to do their job.  I use bare minerals as my makeup.  I was really just in the market for a nice that allowed me to use less makeup to get that coverage I want.  I was using the bare minerals full flawless face brush and let me just say that a 30 dollar brush is LITERALLY no comparison to these.  My makeup buffed on so beautiful and skin truly looked airbrushed when I used these brushes.  I can&#x27;t wait to get the 12 piece set as a gift to myself a spare set of brushes to throw in my makeup bag for touch up on the go.  So so SO glad I bought these!  An utter delight?  No shedding of the brushes either.  They are beautifully crafted and do not fall out.  Now I can save so much on my makeup.  I literally was able to use an eighth of what I usually put into my bare minerals lid (and I don&#x27;t put a lot) and got a beautiful superior coverage.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on sigma or expensive brushes, you want these. Will be buying as gifts this year as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes really surprised me ! Their quality is amazing. No shedding when washed. Super soft, great blending. Yes they came with a funny smell but nothing a good wash can&#x27;t fix. Plus they came in early. I&#x27;m happy with this cheap purchase. Definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> When these arrived by nieces spent about 30 minutes rubbing them on their faces. They are very soft. I have no idea what most of them are for.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price I was amazed on the texture of the bristles! Love!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with these brushes! They are soft &amp; dense, as they should be.&lt;br /&gt;I just got them today, and have just washed them, so if there is any change I will update this review. Based on application tests on my arm (nothing goes on my eyes until it&#x27;s been cleaned) they grab product nicely, and blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these as a backup set because I find that I always need an extra brush for this or that. I can see someof these easily becoming primary brushes!</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are the absolute best!</li>
            <li> Brushes are really nice and dense but bristles are reallyy flimsy and they smell like sharpies when you first open the package. Other then that im happy!:)</li>
            <li> bought as a gift but planning on getting  myself.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so good! Nice and soft no fallout. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the cost. Does have varnish smell but it does go away once you open up package and air out.</li>
            <li> Ehhh they are ok.  The eye brushes are decent for the price, but the face brushes are kindkf awkward shaped.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I was hoping for more, especially after reading reviews others wrote comparing the brushes to Sigma and Mac.  These are nothing like Sigma and Mac brushes!!!  I just feel like the brushes don&#x27;t apply product to the face as well.  Bummer....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these brushes, I am a licensed cosmetologist and do a lot of make up services. The brushes you use are just as important as the make up you use and these are great. They do smell horrible at first but I washed mine with gentle soap before using and it went away. I would definitely recommend this brush set, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it and I would still say it is a little under priced. Get em and love em</li>
            <li> these brushes are great! there very soft on my skin.i just wish a couple of the brushes were better for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> I loved all the brushes I use them all, great buy!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that there were no small brushes in this kit. The description makes it sound as though there is an eyeliner brush (there is not), and all of the ones that could even possibly be used for the eyes are quite large. I will be returning these and trying a different brand/set.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d way to much hair did not apply my foundation evenly left streaks behind. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very well pleased with my order, got her in record time.</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail (literally 2 minutes ago) and they arrived a lot sooner then expected! They are definintely soft to the touch and for the price that I paid I am pleased. There is a smell to it, but I&#x27;m sure you can get rid of it. I will use my Elf Daily Spray to rid off the scent and clean them as well. The smell does remind me of a chemical/car repairs shop. Perhaps these brushes will get a 5 star rating after I put them to the test, but as a first impression 4 stars it is!</li>
            <li> I just received it and love it. good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> I hoped that these brushes would be a good dupe for the Sigma brushes. I own the F80 by Sigma, and the flat top brush by BESTOPE is not as dense as the Sigma one. There&#x27;s a lot of bend with these brushes. The round top is comparable to the Real Techniques buffing brush. It&#x27;s packed more with bristles. But on the other hand, these brushes are SUPER soft. They do smell like permanent markers though when I first opened them, so I recommend washing them before using. I am really satisfied with this purchase, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE NOT GREAT BUT THEY ARE NOT BAD EITHER. THEY ARE SIMPLY OK. I USE THEM MOSTLY FOR POWDER AND BLUSH. THE SMALLER ONES ARE TOO LARGE TO USE FOR SHADING BUT PERFECT FOR BLENDING.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes 2x. I loved them so much I bought them again for a gift. I own sigma brushes don&#x27;t get me wrong I love them but ever since I&#x27;ve had these I find myself reaching for these instead.</li>
            <li> There is a strong smell, but if you wash your brushes properly it&#x27;s not noticeable (and really, who would put something out of a factory directly onto their face/body whether it&#x27;s makeup brushes or a new t-shirt, gross). Brush quality was even better than I expected. They don&#x27;t rival my MAC brushes but they easily rival my Sephora ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the buffing brush was angled, turns out there&#x27;s both a slightly angled one (right, in the photo) and a normal one (direct middle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the eye brushes are stiffer than what I&#x27;d like, but they aren&#x27;t sharp or pokey at all like with cheap brushes. They just don&#x27;t have much give, extremely soft fibers that aren&#x27;t rough at all. That could also be good depending on what you use them for.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice brushes, but they smell a little strange when you first receive them.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that the brushes were such good quality. As soft as my Mac brushes!</li>
            <li> They came much faster than I thought. For the price I&#x27;m amazed at the quality. They are so soft and blend so easily. They are easily my new go to brushes!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I will buy it again👍</li>
            <li> I recently dumped the contents of my makeup drawer in the garbage, and began replacing everything.  This set of brushes is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made.  I like the flat kabuki for BB cream, the angled brush for blush, and the wide brush for powder.  I don&#x27;t contour, so am reserving the pointed brush for something else.  The eye brushes are perfect as well;  eye shadow, crease, highlighting and lining are covered in this set.  The brushes are well made, and don&#x27;t leave a trail of bristles on my skin.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality i love how soft they are. I have may high end brushes and these ones are pretty good for the price if you do not want to spend big money for some brand ones.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they clean well and make my make process very smooth</li>
            <li> I ordered another brand of flat kabuki brush that was the same price as this whole set.  They were almost identical except for the brand name printed on the  handle.  This is an exceptional deal and the brushes are super soft without any fall out.  I haven&#x27;t washed them yet, so we will see how that goes.</li>
            <li> I did not expect such good quality for the price. I have an expensive IT cosmetics brush and next to these you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> They are amazing! The are very dense which it good for foundation and still very soft.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes there amazing I have had them for a little over a month and there great I definitely recommend getting them</li>
            <li> I am honestly pleasantly surprised with these brushes. They feel divine. I have been hunting for a set for a while that I could use universally for face products, and I am so thankful that I came across these instead of shelling out lots of money for other name brand brushes. For the price of all of these I couldn&#x27;t have even found one at Sephora or MAC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, admittedly they do have a chemical smell upon opening the package, but I feel confident that will dissipate. Excited to get some use out of these!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for the prompt shipping and quality brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Soft and durable, when I receive the brushes their was a clear hard substance on the brushes but just washing them off fixed that. So I recommend these to everyone</li>
            <li> Super great buy and definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;No bad scent nor too dense or soft just right and trust me i know what a good brush is &amp; i absolutely love !!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price! I bought one set for my daughter, and was so impressed that I bought a set for myself.</li>
            <li> loved them! so glad I didn&#x27;t spend hundreds at sephora these brushes do the job and aren&#x27;t harsh on the face at all!</li>
            <li> Very soft, haven&#x27;t got a chance to use them yet but will update when I have.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!  They are super soft!!  I was looking for a good foundation brush--and found it with these.  The brush I use blends my foundation in so well.  The ONLY bad thing I can say about them is the smell when I first opened it.  It&#x27;s a really bad, strong glue smell.  But I washed them really well before using, and the smell went away.  I think they are good quality brushes for the price you are paying.  I haven&#x27;t had any of the ones I&#x27;ve used shed at all. I say it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Did not blend makeup or hold powder textured makeup</li>
            <li> AMAZING. Applies liquid foundation flawlessly</li>
