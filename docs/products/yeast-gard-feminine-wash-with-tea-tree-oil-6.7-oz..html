            <li>great service...great product</li>
            <li>is perfect for us gals:)</li>
            <li>Great price here and dont have to worry when my own pharmacy is out of stock URG.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It honestly did everything that it claimed</li>
            <li>( It has a wonderful scent and all natural wash</li>
            <li>Love Love Love it!</li>
            <li>I added this personal wash to my arsenal &amp; it worked brilliantly!</li>
            <li>My favorite feminine wash.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesnt have Parabens...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>i love this scent, it is sphisticated - clean - grassy - sexy.  </li>
            <li>I tried this after my favorite wash, Propoline, seems to no longer be available.  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the Tea Tree oil thing, but I actually liked this.  </li>
            <li>I thought the tea tree would be bothersome but is so very mild in sensation and scent.</li>
            <li>I think you get a better clean feeling</li>
            <li>after seeing the product was not listed on their website and they confirmed that they are discontinuing this product.  </li>
            <li>I very rarely get).</li>
            <li>I was having bouts of infections and I first tried this brands douche and was pleased.</li>
            <li>I feel that it gets me clean without leaving residue.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have much faith, searched Amazon for something with tea tree oil and a good price, and landed on this gem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame, I really would have loved to continue to use it!</li>
            <li>As more and more women finding out, especially now as they are wearing the tights, yoga and gym pants as an all day wear, that the female-face-wash and female-feminine-wash are just as important.</li>
            <li>it helps ease any itching and leaves me feeling fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I bought them just in case, and to be honest, I bought them when I purchased the Yeast-Gard Feminine Wash for the first time from Amazon and fell in love with it and wanted to have all their product on hand not knowing I guess from my first hand experience with the wash that all their product are natural and I have</li>
            <li>With Yeastgard, I get squeaky clean and stay fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Did not guard against my recurring yeast, but its not irritating and it smells fine.  </li>
            <li>but it really is worth it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a big deal for me.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s worth a try over the higher priced brands.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended that tea tree oil might be good as a wash down there, as a preventative measure.</li>
            <li>; products which they have few I might add in many forms, anymore, forgetting that they will sell and profit more by selling large quantity per demands and words of mouth.</li>
            <li>I wrote them back and told them it was a tragedy that they would discontinue a product that is helping so many of us.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stock up as much as I can possibly afford to and hope that maybe they&#x27;ll change their minds if more of us write to them and ask them not to discontinue the wash.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean, not dry, and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>first i like to say thanks amazon for your fast and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>feminine wash definitely leaves you with a fresh, clean feeling and after the first use I woke up in a much better condition and less pain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and i was looking for something soothing as i suffer with so much pain and this help to ease it..</li>
            <li>I have ordered this twice and really like the product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Trust me, they really work...</li>
            <li>Really helped w/the itching, burning, etc.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps everything down below fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I do feel more balanced as well down there with no odor issues.</li>
            <li>I like to use it nearly everyday because it&#x27;s safe &amp; gentle</li>
            <li>While I was waiting for it to work, I also used natural feminine hygiene products and it really sped up the healing process.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer Summer&#x27;s Eve Cleansing Wash Sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this problem to anyone who is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have leaned that if you take a probiotic (I use Pro-B) daily and then at the first sign of infection use ALL the products as directed, it is a 2 day recover tops and</li>
            <li>It helps you feel clean down there.  </li>
            <li>I have been plagued with frequent yeast infections for years and feminine body washes can either hurt or help the problem.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating only because it doesn&#x27;t really prevent a yeast infection.</li>
            <li>I suffered from chronic infections after a childbirth complication that left me very susceptible to yeast infections.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it loyally for 3 years now and have had NO issues down there since.</li>
            <li>Before I used it, I was using clear glycerin soap and it was causing major dryness and bacterial vaginosis issues because of the glycerin.  </li>
            <li>it is very moisturizing and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Especially, when you wear tightly fitting bottoms, such as, jeans, yoga and/or gym legging and living in hot Arizona makes worse.  </li>
            <li>It gives a soothing effect... especially if you are in the early stages of an infection.  </li>
            <li>How in the world can a product claim to prevent yeast infections when the active ingredients are the most common causes of yeast infections....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it vs. the other over the counter products.</li>
            <li>Too bad, because I used it for a long time, and have always been happy with it.</li>

            <li> I could barely use anything and plain old warm water wasn&#x27;t cutting it either.  </li>
            <li> However, it is very gentle when your already uncomfortable and it won&#x27;t make things any worse like many soaps do.</li>
            <li> It works well so far in keeping me feeling comfortable, and is MUCH less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Non-irritating and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I hope this stuff is around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly frustrating considering how much success I had with it.</li>
            <li> I recently tried switching back to Summer&#x27;s Eve for a few days, and I could not believe the immediately noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> A little worrisome, but the other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; feminine washes don&#x27;t have entirely natural ingedients either, nor do they indicate non-animal tested.  </li>
            <li> This wash is a tad on the expensive side but to me, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am telling this because I don&#x60;t know how the wash would help without the other</li>
            <li> /&gt;They stopped making, thinking that, once they make the wash then females would not need their other &amp;#34;Yeast-Gard&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that,  I have purchased their other product, and some have expired already and some are expiring because I do not need them as I have no yeast issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so devastated to learn from other reviewers that it&#x27;s no longer being made.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to any one who suffers from the occasional infection.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that my daily use of this wash means that I will never again be forced to suffer through the pain and itching associated with a yeast infection.</li>
            <li> my normal wash was adding to my uncomfortable symptoms(which</li>
            <li> Now I am back to using regular pads, and haven&#x27;t had to worry about itching, rashes, or just being plain uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> very sensitive skin not knowing that I will never be able to reorder the Feminine Wash ever again from Amazon or at this point any other place :( :( :</li>
            <li> By using this product everyday I can prevent all the irritation and embarrassment that comes along with yeast overgrowth.</li>
            <li> I tried to stop using it for a few days</li>
            <li> Only drawback to me is that I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s NOT animal tested and there seems to be an artifical color added, which is totally unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking all over for this product, I even checked with the small private pharmacies as I saw they had other &amp;#34;YeastGard&amp;#34; products but not the Feminine Wash, and I asked them if they can order it for me, but, they were unable to do so as it was not on the order book, go</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it has been discontinued, but I hope they reconsider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased YeastGard wash at CVS for the past year but to my disappointment, they recently stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> and it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I kept getting really painful urinary tract and bladder infections with occasional cysts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately due to a very bad diet and some antibiotics I have a quite serious yeast infection.</li>
            <li> When I was suffering from a terrible yeast infection that kept coming back</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2yrs and sad to find they&#x27;ve discontinued making it:</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m waiting for them to take out the sodium lauryls which can be an irritant to some, but for now its working wonders and Ill try another brand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after contacting the manufacturer, this product is no longer in production.</li>
            <li> as for this prouduct i like it as i have very bad to severe yeast infections due to my diabetes</li>
            <li> so I thought I would give it a try because summers eve wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Doctor visit after doctor visit was so uncomfortable, painful, and pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly expensive but I will never let mine run out again!</li>
            <li> I am so sad that they stopped making this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just one of the unpleasant facts of life, ALL women at some point in their life will experience vaginal infections &amp; the unpleasant side effects that come along with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works wonders, a bit pricy but it really is worth it. Very pleasant smell, all throughout the day. Highly recommend it vs. the other over the counter products.</li>
            <li> first i like to say thanks amazon for your fast and speedy delivery. as for this prouduct i like it as i have very bad to severe yeast infections due to my diabetes and i was looking for something soothing as i suffer with so much pain and this help to ease it..great prouduct i will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with frequent yeast infections for years and feminine body washes can either hurt or help the problem. By using this product everyday I can prevent all the irritation and embarrassment that comes along with yeast overgrowth. I would recommend this problem to anyone who is very sensitive. I tried to stop using it for a few days and I can tell the difference. It&#x27;s slightly expensive but I will never let mine run out again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just one of the unpleasant facts of life, ALL women at some point in their life will experience vaginal infections &amp; the unpleasant side effects that come along with them. When I was suffering from a terrible yeast infection that kept coming back I added this personal wash to my arsenal &amp; it worked brilliantly! I like to use it nearly everyday because it&#x27;s safe &amp; gentle helps to restore &amp; keep things in balance! It honestly did everything that it claimed &amp; I don&#x27;t want to ever have to use anything else but this wash so NEVER stop making it!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2yrs and sad to find they&#x27;ve discontinued making it:( It has a wonderful scent and all natural wash is perfect for us gals:) Love Love Love it!</li>
            <li> I started using this wash when I had an actual yeast infection over a year ago and have been hooked on it ever since. I recently tried switching back to Summer&#x27;s Eve for a few days, and I could not believe the immediately noticeable difference. With Yeastgard, I get squeaky clean and stay fresh all day. Not so with Summer&#x27;s Eve, which never rinses well and does nothing to prevent odor. I&#x27;ve purchased YeastGard wash at CVS for the past year but to my disappointment, they recently stopped carrying it. The suppositories, pills, etc. made by Yeastgard are still on the shelf. This wash is a tad on the expensive side but to me, it&#x27;s well worth the price. An added bonus is that my daily use of this wash means that I will never again be forced to suffer through the pain and itching associated with a yeast infection.</li>
            <li> I was having bouts of infections and I first tried this brands douche and was pleased. I was purchasing at CVS until I saw a circular Ad (flyer) for Rite Aid with the brand on sale for a BOGO 50% off. I went to Rite Aid with the intent to get two of the douches and saw the wash so I thought I would give it a try because summers eve wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I could barely use anything and plain old warm water wasn&#x27;t cutting it either.  I bought this and tried it and now I am HOOKED.  This product could sell for twice it&#x27;s retail and i would still use it. The tea tree oil is a great added benefit. It gives a soothing effect... especially if you are in the early stages of an infection.  I haven&#x27;t had an onset since i started using this product (knocks on wood). I highly recommend to any one who suffers from the occasional infection.</li>
            <li> How in the world can a product claim to prevent yeast infections when the active ingredients are the most common causes of yeast infections....Candida albicans?????????  Don&#x27;t buy this UNLESS you are looking to get a yeast infection.  It&#x27;s great for that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately due to a very bad diet and some antibiotics I have a quite serious yeast infection. It got out of control so at the same time I started to use this feminine wash, take grapefruit seeds extract and I went on a candida-diet. I am telling this because I don&#x60;t know how the wash would help without the other 2.&lt;br /&gt;This feminine wash definitely leaves you with a fresh, clean feeling and after the first use I woke up in a much better condition and less pain.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice and really like the product. I feel that it gets me clean without leaving residue. I do feel more balanced as well down there with no odor issues. I will definitely order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  I wrote the company (info@lakeconsumer.com) after seeing the product was not listed on their website and they confirmed that they are discontinuing this product.  I wrote them back and told them it was a tragedy that they would discontinue a product that is helping so many of us.  I&#x27;ll stock up as much as I can possibly afford to and hope that maybe they&#x27;ll change their minds if more of us write to them and ask them not to discontinue the wash.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating only because it doesn&#x27;t really prevent a yeast infection. However, it is very gentle when your already uncomfortable and it won&#x27;t make things any worse like many soaps do.</li>
            <li> My favorite feminine wash. I have been using it for a year now. Little goes a long way. Very good product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! It really keeps everything down below fresh and clean.  I can&#x27;t believe I have lived without this all these years.</li>
            <li> Did not guard against my recurring yeast, but its not irritating and it smells fine.  Would not buy again because it didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> I like you was a skeptic when I found this. I had started with the gel from them for the itching and I now use all four products in the yeast guard line. I suffered from chronic infections after a childbirth complication that left me very susceptible to yeast infections. I tried the prescription versions which are way more expensive and they didn&#x27;t work as well. I have leaned that if you take a probiotic (I use Pro-B) daily and then at the first sign of infection use ALL the products as directed, it is a 2 day recover tops and the the repeats don&#x27;t happen. Trust me, they really work...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best feminine wash, oder-control-prevention ever! to me and in my book anyway!  Especially, when you wear tightly fitting bottoms, such as, jeans, yoga and/or gym legging and living in hot Arizona makes worse.  I have been looking all over for this product, I even checked with the small private pharmacies as I saw they had other &amp;#34;YeastGard&amp;#34; products but not the Feminine Wash, and I asked them if they can order it for me, but, they were unable to do so as it was not on the order book, go figure!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stopped making, thinking that, once they make the wash then females would not need their other &amp;#34;Yeast-Gard&amp;#34; products which they have few I might add in many forms, anymore, forgetting that they will sell and profit more by selling large quantity per demands and words of mouth. As more and more women finding out, especially now as they are wearing the tights, yoga and gym pants as an all day wear, that the female-face-wash and female-feminine-wash are just as important. just like we don&#x27;t wash our face with soup or body wash so is our feminine body part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that,  I have purchased their other product, and some have expired already and some are expiring because I do not need them as I have no yeast issues.  I bought them just in case, and to be honest, I bought them when I purchased the Yeast-Gard Feminine Wash for the first time from Amazon and fell in love with it and wanted to have all their product on hand not knowing I guess from my first hand experience with the wash that all their product are natural and I have very sensitive skin not knowing that I will never be able to reorder the Feminine Wash ever again from Amazon or at this point any other place :( :( :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone out here reads my comments and knows of place to get it or I many have been wrong in anyway of ordering it or perhaps the product is been recalled please let me know. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I tried this after my favorite wash, Propoline, seems to no longer be available.  It works well so far in keeping me feeling comfortable, and is MUCH less expensive.  Only drawback to me is that I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s NOT animal tested and there seems to be an artifical color added, which is totally unnecessary.  A little worrisome, but the other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; feminine washes don&#x27;t have entirely natural ingedients either, nor do they indicate non-animal tested.  Anyway, it&#x27;s worth a try over the higher priced brands.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating and lasts a long time.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely worth the money.  Before I used it, I was using clear glycerin soap and it was causing major dryness and bacterial vaginosis issues because of the glycerin.  The feminine wash also has glycerin, but the tea tree oil prevents it from causing problems.  I have been using it about a month.  While I was waiting for it to work, I also used natural feminine hygiene products and it really sped up the healing process.  Now I am back to using regular pads, and haven&#x27;t had to worry about itching, rashes, or just being plain uncomfortable.  I hope this stuff is around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product cannot be found in stores anymore.  I believe it&#x27;s being discontinued.  Highly frustrating considering how much success I had with it.</li>
            <li> I started using this daily wash after I noticed my normal wash was adding to my uncomfortable symptoms(which I very rarely get). It took awhile to resolve but with the help of their probiotic douche this company makes as well and this wash, I am now hooked. It leaves me feeling clean, not dry, and fresh feeling. I thought the tea tree would be bothersome but is so very mild in sensation and scent. Great price here and dont have to worry when my own pharmacy is out of stock URG. I purchase two at a time because I will never be without. I love that it doesnt have Parabens...i&#x27;m waiting for them to take out the sodium lauryls which can be an irritant to some, but for now its working wonders and Ill try another brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am not sure why it has been discontinued, but I hope they reconsider. Summer&#x27;s Eve has nothing on this product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after contacting the manufacturer, this product is no longer in production. Too bad, because I used it for a long time, and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li> i love this scent, it is sphisticated - clean - grassy - sexy.  it is very moisturizing and lasts a long time.  it helps ease any itching and leaves me feeling fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am so sad that they stopped making this! I wish I had stocked up before it was all gone!</li>
            <li> I kept getting really painful urinary tract and bladder infections with occasional cysts. Doctor visit after doctor visit was so uncomfortable, painful, and pricey. A friend recommended that tea tree oil might be good as a wash down there, as a preventative measure. I didn&#x27;t really have much faith, searched Amazon for something with tea tree oil and a good price, and landed on this gem. I&#x27;ve used it loyally for 3 years now and have had NO issues down there since. I absolutely love this product. Everything about it is perfect! The price, the size of the bottle, the consistency, the lather, the scent, its benefits.. I could go on. I&#x27;m so devastated to learn from other reviewers that it&#x27;s no longer being made. I&#x27;ve been checking back because it&#x27;s time for me to reorder! Instead I had to switch to Dr. Bronners. I hope it works as well, but I will definitely miss this product!! It&#x27;s such a shame, I really would have loved to continue to use it!</li>
            <li> It last forever since you&#x27;re only using it on one part of your body. I&#x27;m prone to yeast infections but in using this every night I haven&#x27;t gotten one in months. Kind of a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I much prefer Summer&#x27;s Eve Cleansing Wash Sensitive.  I think you get a better clean feeling and it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> NEVER GOT THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Used this product while I was fighting a YI.  Really helped w/the itching, burning, etc.  It helps you feel clean down there.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the Tea Tree oil thing, but I actually liked this.  Would use it again if needed and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> great service...great product</li>
