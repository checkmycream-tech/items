            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>I honestly would!</li>
            <li>Lmao!</li>
            <li>the bright side, as I was trying to mush together some of the crumbs into some sort of usable ball or something, I tried wetting them and everything, trying to stick them together.</li>
            <li>a good moisturizer won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t stick together, but did notice that this soap lathers nicely and is good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It works amazing.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing...</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, I immediately smelled the amazing scent coming from the bars.</li>
            <li>honestly if it smelled like sweat and doritos or flowers and kitten sneezes, but worked, I don&#x27;t think I would care what it smelled like.)</li>
            <li>I got a nice size piece for 3 dollars</li>
            <li>It felt like butter honestly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing, cheap, and effective!</li>
            <li>I found out that the best way to use this cleaning bar is to wet my face cloth and rub the bar on it until I get a good lather.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier or more satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li>lovely.</li>
            <li>and it has cleared my skin up 99% better than anything else.</li>
            <li>I love this soap I will never use dove again.</li>
            <li>My skin is more even toned and brighter.</li>
            <li>a bit so make sure to moisturize afterwards</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s even better for the skin instead of all those chemicals that is found over the counter.</li>
            <li>Over all the product was ok for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>after use did not end up becoming anything.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m so thrilled that this 4oz option is available because it&#x27;s SO CHEAP</li>
            <li>is that a pea sized amount is plenty for your whole face and more!</li>
            <li>A huge difference.</li>
            <li>So I assumed it would be great on my face, until I woke up the next morning with rashes all over that appeared like heat rashes, ughhhh</li>
            <li>After using this cleanser, I follow up with a non-greasy light moisturizer since I have combination skin.</li>
            <li>It got rid of my pimples, even my skin tone and smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it but a couple of weeks, so, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Before using this my nose and chin was never dried out, but i think its because i don&#x27;t have a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think the price is very reasonable, and I&#x27;m a very cheap</li>
            <li>It has a very clean and fresh smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>I do a a pimple right now but other than that my face is flawless.</li>
            <li>I used this in my skin and it made a significant difference on the tone and darkened areas of my skin and face.</li>
            <li>My skin appearance has significantly improved.</li>
            <li>so I was REALLY excited when it came</li>
            <li>This soap makes my skin feel so clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Great, this is what I expected even though it does not look like the picture at all.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>which is really good, which will get smaller soon.</li>
            <li>But I really do like this product and its showing so much better results than anything I have tried, which is tons.</li>
            <li>This soap is a dream come true for me.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and it really lathers great.</li>
            <li>I received the item quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be bleaching, but more just...evening out tone and show new</li>
            <li>This is great black soap.</li>
            <li>First time trying the soap!</li>
            <li>AND ONE important thing do not mix washing with anything with too much chemicals</li>
            <li>but besides that, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It took forever to come, but it seems like it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m in complete love with it now!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come update it in a month or so with my findings.&lt;br /&gt;Something worth mentioning</li>
            <li>overall, the soap seems like a good product, it arrived quickly, it was as described...and so far seems like it is helping.</li>
            <li>Just add a little lotion and your good to go.</li>
            <li>My goal with using this soap is to fade scars &amp; discoloration, I JUST used it for the first time, but I already notice a difference in the texture &amp; color of my skin.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and we do see great results as long as he cuts back on piling lotion in his face after washing his face!</li>
            <li>first thing I did with my soap was cut off a chunk, and keep the rest in its original plastic wrap then placed it in a baggie and into a cool dry location.</li>
            <li>I still only left it on for about 20 seconds, after getting a good lather going (which was not hard to do, lathers very well surprisingly)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived ( arrived fast), I weighed the soap and it was 6oz!!</li>
            <li>I use a gentle Cetaphil cleanser before using this soap, lightly exfoliate with a cloth, and finish with a witch hazel toner and a gentle Cetaphil daily lotion to restore moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a exfoliator, perhaps too much of a exfoliator.</li>
            <li>But I just really can&#x27;t use crumbs in the shower.</li>
            <li>or even really at the sink.</li>
            <li>It came so fast I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
            <li>: This product is very drying</li>
            <li>Was very helpful and worked well for my skin which is on the oily side.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>was really bothering me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very generous amount for the price.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much for results.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really look like the listing.</li>
            <li>And it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very good that this seller offers such a small amount.</li>
            <li>but I did notice that this one was a lot smoother and had a lot more moisture in it than the other companies.</li>
            <li>Then I place the bar in a dry place away from water because it will dissolve very quickly in water.</li>
            <li>I like the black soap better , this soap does work</li>
            <li>but I think black soap works even better.</li>
            <li>Love this black soap product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I most definitely recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>I do understand that the soap can crumble after use but would have thought that when received it would have been more solid not in tiny pieces.</li>
            <li>My skin actually felt REALLY clean &amp; moisturized &amp; SOFT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with acne since high school</li>
            <li>this stuff was ok it just dried out my skin</li>
            <li>The 3rd use of this soap cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>First off, it got here very quickly given being on the other end of the country combined with recent weather issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan on buying this by the pound next time and I strongly urge anyone with hesitation to buythis small 4oz bar right now and try it yourself!</li>
            <li>all my scars have faded my skin is very clear and glowing....</li>
            <li>I am a very natural person so taking medication</li>
            <li>Buy this one first, try it, see how it works, and I guarantee you&#x27;ll be back to buy</li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes oil better than any of my other soaps, which are two different kinds of bar castile soap.</li>
            <li>It was SO soft!</li>
            <li>I ordered from two other distributors and both of them had much better packaging and the soap is a solid piece.</li>
            <li>I even washed my natural hair (african american btw) and my hair was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it on my face it burned and a few months later I noticed a light streak going across my face</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate, adding insult to injury, my bathroom does not get rid of extra moisture</li>
            <li>SO I wanted to keep my soap well away from extra moisture because I knew it was likely to turn into a puddle of brown goop fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It is helping clear up my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The soap is fairly soft, and you can mold it almost like clay.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne that started about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not round or cream colored (or a bottle of Dudu osun soap).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin -- on days when my face is sensitive, it might tingle or sting a little bit at first, but the solution is to dilute it with more or less water, depending on how irritable my skin is that day.</li>
            <li>It stings a little, its a good buy, not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>If I see major progress within the next few weeks, then i&#x27;ll DEFINITELY be buying more.</li>
            <li>; acne, uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation, eczema or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;Twice daily use might be too strong for some people with extremely sensitive skin, and I would probably say the first few times to wash off about when it starts to tingle...</li>
            <li>What I have noticed, on myself, even after just 3 times, is that my skin tone seems a bit more even and a few darker spots from old scars seemed a bit less noticeable.</li>
            <li>just so you have time to get used to the product.&lt;br /&gt;(For people who actually give a crap about this kind of thing, I think the unscented quality of the soap means it would be fine for people of any gender.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>an African told me its the right black soap.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only con about natural black soap is the little pebbles, so you have to wash lightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a week of regular use and I feel renewed, regenerated, and confident wearing less and less concealer when I go out because this soap has been perfecting my face in ways I never thought were possible.</li>
            <li>I am not going to name names, but I did buy this one to compare it to another companies black soap- which was very pebbly and had a lot of branches in it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have breakouts any more but a few small ones, which goes away.</li>
            <li>I give it a 4 star just because it was a little dry after and kinda itchy, but so worth it.</li>

            <li> all my scars have faded my skin is very clear and glowing....</li>
            <li> I am a very natural person so taking medication</li>
            <li> Buy this one first, try it, see how it works, and I guarantee you&#x27;ll be back to buy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes oil better than any of my other soaps, which are two different kinds of bar castile soap.</li>
            <li> It was SO soft!</li>
            <li> I ordered from two other distributors and both of them had much better packaging and the soap is a solid piece.</li>
            <li> I even washed my natural hair (african american btw) and my hair was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it on my face it burned and a few months later I noticed a light streak going across my face</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate, adding insult to injury, my bathroom does not get rid of extra moisture</li>
            <li> SO I wanted to keep my soap well away from extra moisture because I knew it was likely to turn into a puddle of brown goop fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It is helping clear up my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> The soap is fairly soft, and you can mold it almost like clay.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne that started about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not round or cream colored (or a bottle of Dudu osun soap).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin -- on days when my face is sensitive, it might tingle or sting a little bit at first, but the solution is to dilute it with more or less water, depending on how irritable my skin is that day.</li>
            <li> It stings a little, its a good buy, not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> If I see major progress within the next few weeks, then i&#x27;ll DEFINITELY be buying more.</li>
            <li> ; acne, uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation, eczema or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;Twice daily use might be too strong for some people with extremely sensitive skin, and I would probably say the first few times to wash off about when it starts to tingle...</li>
            <li> What I have noticed, on myself, even after just 3 times, is that my skin tone seems a bit more even and a few darker spots from old scars seemed a bit less noticeable.</li>
            <li> just so you have time to get used to the product.&lt;br /&gt;(For people who actually give a crap about this kind of thing, I think the unscented quality of the soap means it would be fine for people of any gender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> an African told me its the right black soap.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only con about natural black soap is the little pebbles, so you have to wash lightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a week of regular use and I feel renewed, regenerated, and confident wearing less and less concealer when I go out because this soap has been perfecting my face in ways I never thought were possible.</li>
            <li> I am not going to name names, but I did buy this one to compare it to another companies black soap- which was very pebbly and had a lot of branches in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have breakouts any more but a few small ones, which goes away.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star just because it was a little dry after and kinda itchy, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> The first few times of usage will sting and dry</li>
            <li> (that is true for all raw african black soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, moist and doesn&#x27;t get hard and pebbly when dry after having been wet.</li>
            <li> This product is very pliable, therefore I only use small portions at a time.</li>
            <li> Have been getting results from this soap, first I must say it makes you pores very small, I only got on big bump.</li>
            <li> When I got in the shower, I chose not to use the whole bar, so I broke a small piece off &amp; then began to lather.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really like washing with black soap.</li>
            <li> I had these black dots/marks on my face near to my nose.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that because it&#x27;s such a deep cleanser it an leave your skin a little dry so you have to use a deep or oily moisturizer after to keep your skin lubricated.</li>
            <li> previous comments stated, it comes wrapped in a plastic sheet and is by nature rather crumbly, but that can be fixed by  using a soap mesh bag and keeping it dry while not in use.</li>
            <li> My dark marks and circles on my face have lightened and barely there anymore.</li>
            <li> and I am a dark skin african american</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that this soap can be soft and you are supposed to kindof mush together a chunk of it for use, but there is no way whatsoever to mush together these dried out crumbs.</li>
            <li> and I should&#x27;ve bought this long time ago.</li>
            <li> I want all the money back that ever spent at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with this soap for the long haul.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with painful chronic cystic acne, redness, and enlarged pores for years and spent hundreds on harsh chemicals which were moderately effective but not without damaging, burning, and overdrying my skin!</li>
            <li> When I got out my skin wasn&#x27;t SEVERELY dry like everyone in these reviews are complaining about.</li>
            <li> I ordered two &amp; they were bigger than I expected them to be, they were about the length of a credit card &amp; about 2 inches wide.</li>
            <li> Beware of this soap, well at least from this seller, just from the first use I broke out all over my face and neck, with little bumps all over...</li>
            <li> I may look for palm kernel oil in the future, if my skin tolerates black soap</li>
            <li> Received African Black soap today.</li>
            <li> (supposedly this type of soap, if cared for properly, will last quite a long time, which I believe it will given the very small amount I need.</li>
            <li> They have completely turned me off from raw black soap....</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just leave it in a wet puddle unless you want it to turn into said</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely drying</li>
            <li> One zit I did have, on my jawline (fun) which was pretty swollen and annoying and just in a terrible spot, has pretty much vanished since beginning use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a few dark spots, due to severe dry spots, so  hoping it will fade soon with my ambi cream.</li>
            <li> Overall these are minor downsides hardly to be considered when placed against how well this soap works!</li>
            <li> There was a bunch of hard-as-a-rock dried out crumbles that were loosely piled into a piece of saran wrap and didn&#x27;t even stay in that, they were dumped all inside the box.</li>
            <li> I do have one whitehead, since beginning use, which will be something I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on, but on the other hand I felt like I had a few bumps coming on that</li>
            <li> About 1 inch thick and the bar was a little bit bigger than the size of a credit card.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t worry me (I&#x27;ve never used black soap before, I just did my research beforehand).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I finished the soap and the black marks/spots have not reappeared.</li>
            <li> thank GOD for SheaMoisture black soap that help get rid of them.</li>
            <li> however she doesn&#x27;t really have acne, just a few random breakouts.</li>
            <li> This soap has done wonders to fade the dark marks on my face and exfoliate my skin, but be careful when washing because the small grains in the soap can scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> I am not knocking all raw black soaps down, but beware of this seller&#x27;s black soap.</li>
            <li> The potash in the soap, I would imagine, might help remove dead skin, which could lead to someone of a darker complexion seemingly having slightly lighter skin.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to get used to</li>
            <li> , so the Raw Black (brownish) soap itself, was packaged in plastic wrap which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I took antibiotics for a few years and then had to stop.</li>
            <li> Have ordered from this company a few times will continue to.</li>
            <li> This soap was too harsh for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Just purchase the SheaMoisture black soap it does wonders!</li>
            <li> But the Raw ABS got my skin cleaner faster than the others.</li>
            <li> started off with a few lil bumps, bad reaction again with a too much chemical product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> The chunk I removed I put into a small plastic container with a lid, and put it in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> No more use for lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a small piece of cake.</li>
            <li> Im not really sure</li>
            <li> Not sure how I&#x27;m going to use it?</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne-prone skin, so I&#x27;m always hesitant about buying new products because I never know when I&#x27;ll react badly and experience painful symptoms (itching, burning, extreme drying, etc).</li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter sometimes on my body, but I&#x27;m a bit weird about my hands being greasy, and my other soaps never felt like the got it all off,</li>
            <li> I went to wash my face, all I did was scrape off a very small amount of the soap in the container with my finger nail..</li>
            <li> , that will get you a bad reaction, which happened recently with me, but its recovering now.</li>
            <li> so far I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very pale person, painfully shockingly caucasian in complexion (and i&#x27;m not even all caucasian..)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s a little ugly.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, just give it to a friend or use it as hand soap, and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people I know with troubled skin</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a really bad complexion for years.</li>
            <li> Hate to give this a bad  review</li>
            <li> so this product did not do anything but make my skin worse!!!</li>
            <li> My face broke out very bad after I quit taking the antibiotics, but once I found this soap and decided to give it a try, I have never had to use anything else</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Speedy shipping.  Great product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m so thrilled that this 4oz option is available because it&#x27;s SO CHEAP and it&#x27;s a perfect trial size. I have very sensitive acne-prone skin, so I&#x27;m always hesitant about buying new products because I never know when I&#x27;ll react badly and experience painful symptoms (itching, burning, extreme drying, etc). I knew if my skin didn&#x27;t take well to it, I wouldn&#x27;t regret spending just a couple bucks on it anyway, so it&#x27;s very good that this seller offers such a small amount. Buy this one first, try it, see how it works, and I guarantee you&#x27;ll be back to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing, cheap, and effective! I have struggled with painful chronic cystic acne, redness, and enlarged pores for years and spent hundreds on harsh chemicals which were moderately effective but not without damaging, burning, and overdrying my skin! This soap is gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin -- on days when my face is sensitive, it might tingle or sting a little bit at first, but the solution is to dilute it with more or less water, depending on how irritable my skin is that day. It tones my redness, minimizes my pores, reduces pain and swelling of cystic acne, AND firms and softens my skin. I use a gentle Cetaphil cleanser before using this soap, lightly exfoliate with a cloth, and finish with a witch hazel toner and a gentle Cetaphil daily lotion to restore moisture. My skin regenerates oil but doesn&#x27;t get greasy under my makeup since I&#x27;ve incorporated this soap into my daily skincare routine. I use it twice a day (once before bed and once while I&#x27;m in the shower) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. It&#x27;s only been a week of regular use and I feel renewed, regenerated, and confident wearing less and less concealer when I go out because this soap has been perfecting my face in ways I never thought were possible. I couldn&#x27;t be happier or more satisfied with my purchase. I plan on buying this by the pound next time and I strongly urge anyone with hesitation to buythis small 4oz bar right now and try it yourself! If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, just give it to a friend or use it as hand soap, and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY soap that prevents me from having itchy skin. It&#x27;s a exfoliator, perhaps too much of a exfoliator. That&#x27;s the only con about natural black soap is the little pebbles, so you have to wash lightly. Other than that, I really like washing with black soap.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel. Organic all the way. I give it a 4 star just because it was a little dry after and kinda itchy, but so worth it. Just add a little lotion and your good to go.</li>
            <li> This soap is nothing but tiny crumbs wrapped in plastic. There was no &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; or soap, or even a chunk of soap. There was a bunch of hard-as-a-rock dried out crumbles that were loosely piled into a piece of saran wrap and didn&#x27;t even stay in that, they were dumped all inside the box. I&#x27;ve read that this soap can be soft and you are supposed to kindof mush together a chunk of it for use, but there is no way whatsoever to mush together these dried out crumbs. 4oz of crumbs. lovely. I don&#x27;t even think this weighs 4oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, as I was trying to mush together some of the crumbs into some sort of usable ball or something, I tried wetting them and everything, trying to stick them together. Didn&#x27;t stick together, but did notice that this soap lathers nicely and is good on my skin. But I just really can&#x27;t use crumbs in the shower. or even really at the sink.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this product again. It meets all of the expectations that I have and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> First off, it got here very quickly given being on the other end of the country combined with recent weather issues.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so the Raw Black (brownish) soap itself, was packaged in plastic wrap which I didn&#x27;t mind. The soap is fairly soft, and you can mold it almost like clay.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would describe it as looking like dung, but it certainly is different than your regular run of the mill bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did with my soap was cut off a chunk, and keep the rest in its original plastic wrap then placed it in a baggie and into a cool dry location. The chunk I removed I put into a small plastic container with a lid, and put it in my bathroom. I live in a very humid climate, adding insult to injury, my bathroom does not get rid of extra moisture well. SO I wanted to keep my soap well away from extra moisture because I knew it was likely to turn into a puddle of brown goop fairly quickly. (that is true for all raw african black soap. You can&#x27;t just leave it in a wet puddle unless you want it to turn into said puddle.)&lt;br /&gt;When I went to wash my face, all I did was scrape off a very small amount of the soap in the container with my finger nail..then brought it to a lather on my hands. (supposedly this type of soap, if cared for properly, will last quite a long time, which I believe it will given the very small amount I need. I think the price is very reasonable, and I&#x27;m a very cheap person.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will try to leave an updated review in a week or two, since I have only used the soap 3 times since it arrived (yesterday morning, evening, and this morning)&lt;br /&gt;It does tingle, and bordered on stinging. But I knew it would, so it didn&#x27;t worry me (I&#x27;ve never used black soap before, I just did my research beforehand). I still only left it on for about 20 seconds, after getting a good lather going (which was not hard to do, lathers very well surprisingly)&lt;br /&gt;It removes oil better than any of my other soaps, which are two different kinds of bar castile soap. Both of which I like, for different reasons.  But the Raw ABS got my skin cleaner faster than the others. I use cocoa butter sometimes on my body, but I&#x27;m a bit weird about my hands being greasy, and my other soaps never felt like the got it all off, where as the ABS did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of using it on my face, again, I have used it all of three times. But. I have to say, so far I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very pale person, painfully shockingly caucasian in complexion (and i&#x27;m not even all caucasian..)  so I can not say how it would affect someone with darker skin tones. What I have noticed, on myself, even after just 3 times, is that my skin tone seems a bit more even and a few darker spots from old scars seemed a bit less noticeable. The potash in the soap, I would imagine, might help remove dead skin, which could lead to someone of a darker complexion seemingly having slightly lighter skin. I don&#x27;t think it would be bleaching, but more just...evening out tone and show new skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I do have one whitehead, since beginning use, which will be something I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on, but on the other hand I felt like I had a few bumps coming on that after use did not end up becoming anything. One zit I did have, on my jawline (fun) which was pretty swollen and annoying and just in a terrible spot, has pretty much vanished since beginning use.&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t use any moisturizer, ever, because I&#x27;ve never had one that didn&#x27;t make me break out. literally all oils I have ever tried, regardless of how supposedly noncomedogenic they were. I may look for palm kernel oil in the future, if my skin tolerates black soap well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, the soap seems like a good product, it arrived quickly, it was as described...and so far seems like it is helping. I would recommend it to people I know with troubled skin be it; acne, uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation, eczema or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;Twice daily use might be too strong for some people with extremely sensitive skin, and I would probably say the first few times to wash off about when it starts to tingle...just so you have time to get used to the product.&lt;br /&gt;(For people who actually give a crap about this kind of thing, I think the unscented quality of the soap means it would be fine for people of any gender. honestly if it smelled like sweat and doritos or flowers and kitten sneezes, but worked, I don&#x27;t think I would care what it smelled like.)</li>
            <li> Very good. I used this in my skin and it made a significant difference on the tone and darkened areas of my skin and face. It works amazing. The only thing is that because it&#x27;s such a deep cleanser it an leave your skin a little dry so you have to use a deep or oily moisturizer after to keep your skin lubricated.</li>
            <li> I am not going to name names, but I did buy this one to compare it to another companies black soap- which was very pebbly and had a lot of branches in it. Now, I have not bought theirs in bulk yet, so I don&#x27;t know if there will be branches but I did notice that this one was a lot smoother and had a lot more moisture in it than the other companies. I am going to update this, perhaps, after I get a chance to see how well it works on my face. So far, I like it. It&#x27;s smooth, moist and doesn&#x27;t get hard and pebbly when dry after having been wet. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far. Maybe I&#x27;ll update in a week-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best face soap I have ever tried. I have suffered from a really bad complexion for years. I took antibiotics for a few years and then had to stop. My face broke out very bad after I quit taking the antibiotics, but once I found this soap and decided to give it a try, I have never had to use anything else and it has cleared my skin up 99% better than anything else. If you are debating on whether to get this soap or not, I recommend you try it. You have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> It stings a little, its a good buy, not sure if I would buy it again. I like the black soap better , this soap does work but I think black soap works even better.</li>
            <li> Have been getting results from this soap, first I must say it makes you pores very small, I only got on big bump. which is really good, which will get smaller soon. I haven&#x27;t used it but a couple of weeks, so, so far so good. Hoping it fades like it say its suppose to do. But I really do like this product and its showing so much better results than anything I have tried, which is tons. I don&#x27;t have breakouts any more but a few small ones, which goes away. I have a few dark spots, due to severe dry spots, so  hoping it will fade soon with my ambi cream. OH AND ONE important thing do not mix washing with anything with too much chemicals, that will get you a bad reaction, which happened recently with me, but its recovering now. started off with a few lil bumps, bad reaction again with a too much chemical product. DONT DO THAT TRUST ME.</li>
            <li> I love this soap I will never use dove again. This soap makes my skin feel so clean. It came so fast I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. I got a nice size piece for 3 dollars</li>
            <li> Love this black soap product. Have ordered from this company a few times will continue to.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing...I was suffering from sever hyperpigmentation scars and blemishes after four weeks of using this product all my scars have faded my skin is very clear and glowing....this is a must have in your skin care regime...Renee C..A</li>
            <li> I had these black dots/marks on my face near to my nose. The 3rd use of this soap cleared it right up. I used the soap until it was finish. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I finished the soap and the black marks/spots have not reappeared.</li>
            <li> Love this product! No more use for lotion.</li>
            <li> Great, this is what I expected even though it does not look like the picture at all.&lt;br /&gt;But an African told me its the right black soap.</li>
            <li> This is great black soap. It&#x27;s like a small piece of cake. I have used it several times and it really lathers great. My skin appearance has significantly improved. This product came in a zip lock bag as a container. But I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! Where have you been all my life??! This soap is the business and I should&#x27;ve bought this long time ago. I have combination skin with occasional hormonal breakouts with my cycle and once I started using this my skin has done a 360. My skin is more even toned and brighter. My dark marks and circles on my face have lightened and barely there anymore. I even washed my natural hair (african american btw) and my hair was squeaky clean. The first few times of usage will sting and dry a bit so make sure to moisturize afterwards but besides that, it&#x27;s worth it. Plus, it&#x27;s all organic so it&#x27;s even better for the skin instead of all those chemicals that is found over the counter. Overall, I most definitely recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I relieved it in 2days! It works wonders, my skin has cleared up quite a bit! Consistency is key</li>
            <li> If I could give it a 0 I honestly would! Beware of this soap, well at least from this seller, just from the first use I broke out all over my face and neck, with little bumps all over...thank GOD for SheaMoisture black soap that help get rid of them. With the soap came a note telling you that you should test it out on your hand before your face, which I did, and I didn&#x27;t have any reaction on my hand. So I assumed it would be great on my face, until I woke up the next morning with rashes all over that appeared like heat rashes, ughhhh, I haven&#x27;t even looked at the soap since. Save your money please!! Just purchase the SheaMoisture black soap it does wonders! I am not knocking all raw black soaps down, but beware of this seller&#x27;s black soap. They have completely turned me off from raw black soap....</li>
            <li> It took forever to come, but it seems like it was worth the wait. I ordered two &amp; they were bigger than I expected them to be, they were about the length of a credit card &amp; about 2 inches wide. When I opened the package, I immediately smelled the amazing scent coming from the bars. They smelled so edible lol. I had never tried any African soap before so I was REALLY excited when it came &amp; I immediately used it. When I got in the shower, I chose not to use the whole bar, so I broke a small piece off &amp; then began to lather. It was SO soft! I read earlier reviews where they said it burned &amp; scratched their skin..... I didn&#x27;t feel ANY of that! Lmao! It felt like butter honestly. When I got out my skin wasn&#x27;t SEVERELY dry like everyone in these reviews are complaining about. My skin actually felt REALLY clean &amp; moisturized &amp; SOFT! My goal with using this soap is to fade scars &amp; discoloration, I JUST used it for the first time, but I already notice a difference in the texture &amp; color of my skin. If I see major progress within the next few weeks, then i&#x27;ll DEFINITELY be buying more.</li>
            <li> Pro: I like this product and I will purchase it again. It is helping clear up my acne prone skin. It has a very clean and fresh smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Con: This product is very drying and i can only use it a couple times a week. After using this cleanser, I follow up with a non-greasy light moisturizer since I have combination skin. I found out that the best way to use this cleaning bar is to wet my face cloth and rub the bar on it until I get a good lather. Then I place the bar in a dry place away from water because it will dissolve very quickly in water. This product is very pliable, therefore I only use small portions at a time.</li>
            <li> Im not really sure how I feel about this soap wasnt too keen on the packaging! Also when I opened it and looked inside it was a white hair that looked like dog hair that was what turned we off all together! Hate to give this a bad  review but some things are just a turn off!</li>
            <li> Awesome product... My daughter loves it.. Already seeing results!!</li>
            <li> So far, I like it. It makes my skin squeaky clean. I will have to update later because I bought it to see if it would get rid of underarm bumps.</li>
            <li> this stuff was ok it just dried out my skin -_-. Before using this my nose and chin was never dried out, but i think its because i don&#x27;t have a good moisturizer. Over all the product was ok for my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap was too harsh for my skin type. I have seen it do wonders for others though so maybe it was just me.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Was very helpful and worked well for my skin which is on the oily side.&lt;br /&gt;As previous comments stated, it comes wrapped in a plastic sheet and is by nature rather crumbly, but that can be fixed by  using a soap mesh bag and keeping it dry while not in use. Overall these are minor downsides hardly to be considered when placed against how well this soap works!</li>
            <li> This soap is a dream come true for me. I want all the money back that ever spent at the dermatologist. Why didn&#x27;t I know about this sooner? I&#x27;ve had problems with acne since high school and I&#x27;m thirty now. I saw a difference in my skin in just 3 days. A huge difference. It got rid of my pimples, even my skin tone and smooth my skin. If you have and proned skin get this soap now I promise you won&#x27;t regret. It&#x27;s extremely drying but it&#x27;s nothing a good moisturizer won&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it. I&#x27;ll be using this soap for a lifetime.</li>
            <li> It came in UNSEALED PLASTIC WRAP!! It was crumbled too! very disappointed with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Received African Black soap today. The soap was wrapped in plastic wrap that wasn&#x27;t sealed. The soap is all crumbled up not a solid piece. Not sure how I&#x27;m going to use it? I ordered from two other distributors and both of them had much better packaging and the soap is a solid piece. I do understand that the soap can crumble after use but would have thought that when received it would have been more solid not in tiny pieces.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about this soap before I tried it. I have adult acne that started about 4 years ago. I have been taking medication ever since to keep from looking like a teenager. I am a very natural person so taking medication was really bothering me. So, I tried this stuff. I am so happy that I stumbled upon this soap. I have been off my medication for a month and my face looks great. I do a a pimple right now but other than that my face is flawless. I feel the soap is a tiny bit drying but it is also winter which does not help. I&#x27;m sticking with this soap for the long haul.</li>
            <li> First time trying the soap! It&#x27;s a very generous amount for the price. About 1 inch thick and the bar was a little bit bigger than the size of a credit card. The scent is earthy but pleasant! It took a little bit to get used to but I&#x27;m in complete love with it now!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days so I can&#x27;t say much for results. I&#x27;ll come update it in a month or so with my findings.&lt;br /&gt;Something worth mentioning is that a pea sized amount is plenty for your whole face and more! So I can see this bar lasting a while.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really look like the listing. It&#x27;s not round or cream colored (or a bottle of Dudu osun soap).&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s a little ugly. But I don&#x27;t mind!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband and teenage daughter. She doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working however she doesn&#x27;t really have acne, just a few random breakouts. My husband loves it and we do see great results as long as he cuts back on piling lotion in his face after washing his face!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived ( arrived fast), I weighed the soap and it was 6oz!! Will be buying again</li>
            <li> This soap has done wonders to fade the dark marks on my face and exfoliate my skin, but be careful when washing because the small grains in the soap can scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it on my face it burned and a few months later I noticed a light streak going across my face and I am a dark skin african american so this product did not do anything but make my skin worse!!!</li>
            <li> I received the item quickly.  And it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I&#x27;m probably never going to use another soap</li>
