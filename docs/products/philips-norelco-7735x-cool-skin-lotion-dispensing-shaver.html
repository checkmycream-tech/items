    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best for shaving stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it will be after a year (or three) of use, but for now it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>This razor was excellent for 5 years.</li>
            <li>and it provides me with the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>and im already impressed.</li>
            <li>Well it isn&#x27;t perfect  </li>
            <li>This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Very impressed on the combination of closeness and lack of irritation.  </li>
            <li>supplied lotion is excellent and definately stops irritation.  </li>
            <li>This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>He said it&#x27;s a great shave!</li>
            <li>you want to save some time every morning, avoid cuts, and have a shaver that works well in the shower, this product is an excellent option.</li>
            <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve had for my skin/beard type.  </li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower with the lotion gives the best results.</li>
            <li>This shaver is great!</li>
            <li>The best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Price - I got mine refurbished for $40, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a very good shave, and my face feels irritated afterwards.  </li>
            <li>In/Out of Shower Shaver as a very good shaver and rate it with 5 out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the lotion dispenser would be ideal for him.  </li>
            <li>So, my immediate joy in using this one means something.</li>
            <li>This is one great shaver.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise a great product.    </li>
            <li>&quot; has been great.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower every morning and it takes no time to have a great shave, no nicks, no bleeding, no irritation.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>but then when I got this and it was great.</li>
            <li>the lotion works great and gives me no irritation.</li>
            <li>This razor is great.</li>
            <li>in all a great product, and I got a $20 rebate from Norelco.</li>
            <li>Another plus, I have almost NO redness after my shaves, a welcome surprise after the Reminton.</li>
            <li>My sking feels great -  </li>
            <li>And also the nivea stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Every place I look this razor gets great reviews.</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco 6800 series shaver before this one, and it did great for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To say I&#x27;m happy with this shaver is to understate it.</li>
            <li>I always had great luck with the norelco shavers and this one is no differnt.</li>
            <li>I bought the model 7735x and was not ver happy with this model.  </li>
            <li>This razor is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Imagine yourself on a stressful business trip having to contend with this kind of junk! &lt;</li>
            <li>With the listed shortcoming it&#x27;s a very good razor and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower every day and get a very good shave ( all most as good as the blade ).  </li>
            <li>quality is excellent, close and smooth with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It is good to rotate this in on days when you just don&#x27;t want irritation.</li>
            <li>It does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>Gives a really good close shave and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>Good shave</li>
            <li>It works good in both settings.  </li>
            <li>I just loved this shaver.</li>
            <li>I also get good results with the lotion when I have rinsed the head off with water.</li>
            <li>- Good shave &lt;br</li>
            <li>and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Norelco has always gave a good shave, but the quality of the shavers are not as they once were.</li>
            <li>As for closeness, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s almost as good as a Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li>Good shave, after break in period.  </li>
            <li>It did take about 2 weeks to get a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li>so Good:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Cool Skin now for over three years and have gotten the best shaves of my life WITHOUT using disposables.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve been very, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 weeks and have been very pleased with the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li>and was so happy with it that when I had the means I went ahead and bought Brauns top of the line 9595 Pulsonic</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to be able to use an electic razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life on the shaver and the gel/lotion dispenser is a nice feature that gives a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d bet most women don&#x27;t use them because they don&#x27;t have forever to shave their legs!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing in my point of view.</li>
            <li>This thing is just amazing; apply the gel or lotion as you shave and it makes an amazing difference in how close of a shave you get.</li>
            <li>However, despite all that, this is an amazing razor.</li>
            <li>I liked the performance of the razor but</li>
            <li>I was refuse to use a electric Shaver, but i really choice the best product.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that I have used every kind of shaving cream/lotion with it.  </li>
            <li>it kind of slides around in the charger ambiguously.</li>
            <li>but hey, it feels good :)).</li>
            <li>I also used a Mach 3 whenever I wanted a really nice shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It struggles with my neck hairs, i still tidy these up with the mach III.</li>
            <li>My neck still gets irritated, but I&#x27;m not going to blame that on the razor, but rather my own physiology.  </li>
            <li>Also was thrilled about the convertible electrical setup, being that he&#x27;s overseas.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use,and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>, caches on everything and comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>It is very easy of using this shaver.</li>
            <li>By far the best razer.  </li>
            <li>I have kept good care of it, kept it clean, replaced the heads every year, and it still works wonders.</li>
            <li>at first i was not too happy wit</li>
            <li>Shaves very smoothly.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth, even going against the grain.</li>
            <li>i love this razor.  </li>
            <li>When you push the button, the lotion just spits out in the one spot on the top and doesn&#x27;t get distributed throughout the razor as you shave.  </li>
            <li>On both counts, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Mostly standing over the sink.  </li>
            <li>So, I would prefer to have a better razor that may not be able to go in the shower.</li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable good design.</li>
            <li>But man was i glad i got it.</li>
            <li>But all in all, I have never had a better shaver than this.</li>
            <li>The shaviong gel is very usefull and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>do recommend using the strap to make sure you don&#x27;t drop the razor.</li>
            <li>or the shaver won&#x27;t be able to pick it up.  </li>
            <li>A top notch shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I think I could&#x27;ve done a better job with just my fingers plucking my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver in 2005 and have been so pleased with it, when it came time for my son to have a quality electric shaver</li>
            <li>But, be sure to shave every morning or else</li>
            <li>Fortunately I received this Norelco shaver for Christmas and it offers the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>- I find the shave lotion packs that come with it to be more of a gimmick than anything else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaver for almost two years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use regular shaving gel and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with the performance of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Most days it looked like I didn&#x27;t even shave.      </li>
            <li>but more then satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>the more I use it).  </li>
            <li>This shaver provides shaving that is almost as close as a blade but at much more comfort.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this Norelco.  </li>
            <li>i have a smooth face every day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mightely pleased.</li>
            <li>It has better grip to use.</li>
            <li>i satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Remington Titanium shaver i had before.</li>
            <li>and it works even better.</li>
            <li>I ve been using this shaver for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>The recharger is heavier and more stable than Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>As another reviewer already stated, this isn&#x27;t the most convenient design--yet another thing to lug with you when you travel.  </li>
            <li>I found that the lotion works better.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest shelling out more than that.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>It is nice to use this in the shower, but, in reality, I very rarely use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>my opinion, the pros greatly outway the cons, and I HIGHLY recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>and I wanted my first shaver to be good, so after a week of research I bought this shaver.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>They say you need to try it for 3 weeks for your skin to adjust but it worked real fine for me right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The Norelco 7735X Cool Skin is simply the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>No damage done but for the price i think they could come up with something more secure.</li>
            <li>provides really good shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I got this as my first electric razor ever and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Overall, if you can live with the trimmer issue, this is a very good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Easy to Use.  </li>
            <li>cleans extremly easy, and workds with after shave lotion while you shave.</li>
            <li>the decision to go with this one for him was an easy one.</li>
            <li>Clean-up is also easy - just run it under the shower head</li>
            <li>Nivea lotion packs are easy to load and administer while shaving.  </li>
            <li>The shaver&#x27;s \\&quot;cap\\&quot; falls off too easily.  </li>
            <li>and I found it rather easy to snap on, and I found it worked quite well.    </li>
            <li>I have charged the razor once since I bought it, unplugged the charger, and it has been going strong for a week.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the mach 3 because with the cool skin i can go against the grain and with my razor</li>
            <li>Cheap charging unit that does not automatically shut off after full charge is reached!  </li>
            <li>and I made her promise to let me buy a new \\&quot;good shaver\\</li>
            <li>as for the 8 hour charge time, unless your are the wolfman and need to shave 6 times a day, 8 hours between charges is fine with me.</li>
            <li>The lotion button is fine.  </li>
            <li>I have MUCH less of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and I am very happy with the way I look when I leave for work.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that this new model is the best one ever.</li>
            <li>I actually like this razor, but it does not give you a great shave.  </li>
            <li>It performed fantastic.</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>The battery finally just stopped holding a charge after 9 months and I was so happy to be rid of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with the lotion stuff, without, with shaving cream, or with simply just water and all work great.  </li>
            <li>twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean and take care of too.  </li>
            <li>Now my face is really smooth.</li>
            <li>Why should it matter if it feels cheap?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;  - easy to clean</li>
            <li>a cheap SOB, so here&#x27;s my way of stretching out the life of the packets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean up too.  </li>
            <li>It is now about 3 years later, 01/13/2009, and still never a problem with this great razor.    </li>
            <li>Close shave, easy to clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very easy to clean</li>
            <li>There is no &#x27;click&#x27; when you put the shaver in, so it&#x27;s not all that secure.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean after using.  </li>
            <li>I have had nearly as good results using Nivea Aftershave Balm Sensitive. &lt;</li>
            <li>Everything is good so far..    </li>
            <li>You will see far superior results.</li>
            <li>Very easy clean up - just run under hot water.  </li>
            <li>A great feature is the ability to just wash it out under the sink; much better than other razers that require cleaning with brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can just wash it out with hot water when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop rubbing my neck and face after the first shave (and it seems the shave gets better</li>
            <li>My first review on Amazon, despite shopping online for many years.  </li>
            <li>If you buy it and aren&#x27;t satisfied, that&#x27;s fine, but please don&#x27;t give it unwarranted reviews based on really miniscule details.</li>
            <li>It shaves virtually as close as a blade, is quick and comfortable because of the gel, and gets into everycurve and cranny of my face, neck, and adams apple perfetly.  </li>
            <li>This updated model is easier to clean and works well.</li>
            <li>It also is a breeze to clean up.  </li>
            <li>the Norelco Coolskin was a great solution to this, as it keeps the blades from getting too close or too dry.  </li>
            <li>This is my 3rd electric shaver and so far it seems to be the best.</li>
            <li>Save time and clean up time, too.</li>
            <li>other than that, the razor works beautifully</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>i get a very close shave, which is surprising because i&#x27;ve been using a mach 3 for years and had to shave up (against the grain) to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this has been great.  </li>
            <li>The shave is every bit as close as the top of the line triple blade straight razor I used to use.  </li>
            <li>There are fancier electric shavers out there, but I doubt that you&#x27;ll get a better shave from an electric no matter how much you spend.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower and just rinse it off is a real time saver.</li>
            <li>I really like being able to use it in the shower and wash it by placing it in the streaming water.</li>
            <li>The plastic strap is useful to secure the shaver to your hand in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and I think it is a good product overall.</li>
            <li>My advice is to stick to the Norelco HQ170 Cool Skin Nivea for Men Lotion Replacement Cartridge.</li>
            <li>Cool Skin Additive</li>
            <li>It has a fair amount of fluorescent yellow, and the super glossy, irridescent housing looks like a pair of vinyl rave pants.</li>
            <li>Maybe the more pricier models will do a better shaving job, but I am staying away from the entire line.</li>
            <li>the Marlboro Man will quickly turn into the Neanderthal man.</li>
            <li>Same battery, same cutter heads and works perfectly.    </li>
            <li>The instructions claim that it can take several weeks for your skin to become acclimated to this shaver, but I had good results right from the start.</li>
            <li>Razor will cause irritation (as warned) in the first week of use but after that it&#x27;s smooth sailing as your face adjusts.</li>
            <li>loving it, i get a clean shave every time i use, i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Everything snapped back together all right, but it does feel kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s the case, and you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice having a clean-cut shave for a quick and easy shave, then this is an ideal alternative outside of the following setbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Remington Microscreen (don&#x27;t bother unless you are a masochist) and the  Norelco 715 corded shaver (also a good product if you dry shave).</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, and the Nivea really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>The gel/shaving cream is mostly for people with very sensitive skin, and you could probably just use soap lather.</li>
            <li>The flexibility to use it either wet or dry is great and the Nivea Cool Skin lotion and gel make shaving much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Cancelled the order, then bought at Amazon, got it in 3 days regular free shipping!!</li>
            <li>My husband and I are really disaapointed with the cheap parts this razor assembly head is made of.</li>
            <li>the lotion provides is worth it.</li>
            <li>Even though the colour scheme is a bit akward, this shaver is definately well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it, though, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Had the plug gone directly to the razor, you&#x27;d still be able to shave--though probably not in the shower.</li>
            <li>a quick shave, a quick rinse, and i&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>The last Norelco Cool Skin I had lasted for about 4 or 5 years with yearly head replacements, but part of the top broke</li>
            <li>Just buy yourself a beard cream from Jack Black or Kiehl&#x27;s and get more for your money and better product.  </li>
            <li>The battery held the first charge for more than three weeks, and I know that was better than my old one, which was this same model.  </li>
            <li>Nice close shave, battery lasts very long time in between charges.  </li>
            <li>The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower, and so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure many cannot scrape away with a blade everyday.  </li>
            <li>Norelco is a breeze to clean as you just need to put it under a strong water current.</li>
            <li>The lotion is easy to clean as well, using only water.</li>
            <li>This thing is so good that my grandpa used and within a week of getting my shaver his old one broke and he instantly wanted me to buy one for him.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near as close as a blade, but nearly good enough (see below).</li>
            <li>Loved the previous generation that was made 2 years before this.  </li>
            <li>than that, it&#x27;s a great razor with smooth, clean results almost as close as a regular razor, but there is a slight difference and someone who has fast growth and/or a coarse beard may have to shave more often.</li>
            <li>Also, the shaving gel packets are easy to replace, it comes with a charger stand, it&#x27;s easy to clean the rotating blades and it takes up little bathroom counter space.  </li>
            <li>Going with the Cool Shaver a second time was an easy decision to make.  </li>
            <li>I like this razor very much.</li>
            <li>i got this as a present about 5 years ago very nice shave especially in the shower with Nivea shaving lotion packets.</li>
            <li>I get a good, close shave (depending on how much time I&#x27;m willing to invest each morning), with no cuts, drags, sore spots, or any other after effects.  </li>
            <li>I find that the shave I get is nearly as good as with a blade and with little or no irritation.</li>
            <li>Having the trimmer as a separate head looked like a nuissance at first glance.  </li>
            <li>The only thing i had against this razor was that the gel that came with it created some irritation, but the lotion is definately much better, and you can feel the difference when you use the lotion.</li>
            <li>I have charged the razor only once, when I got it, still waiting to see how many shaves I get on a charge.</li>
            <li>so this was my first</li>
            <li>this is the first electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>it is my first electric shaver.it works well .</li>
            <li>Think about how much I save using rechargeable AA batteries!</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin, so it was important that the shaver not produce any irritation.  </li>
            <li>so I stopped with my first Norelco wet/dry razor</li>
            <li>I have used Gel, foam, and even bar soap at a hotel with the razor  to no ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li>Well, let me first state that nothing outdoes a normal hand razor for a true clean-cut shave.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the lotion dispensing button is a tiny bit challenging to operate (I just use my index finger</li>
            <li>I have had the razor for 21 days now and the first time I recharged</li>
            <li>Do a first pass shave.</li>
            <li>You absolutely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>You just pop the top open in the shower and rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also planning to try a regular can of Nivea Shave Gel which is a lot cheaper than the cartridges and some have said works even better.    </li>
            <li>The floating head design gives such a close, comfortable shave that I do not always apply the cool skin additive.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t keep a beard, but my facial hair grows (as it tends to with most guys).</li>
            <li>I get the best results by pressing lightly against my face (despite my instinct to push harder to shave closer) and moving the head around somewhat slowly.</li>
            <li>To me, clean and neat is professional, and this shaver enhances the look.</li>
            <li>I also really like the built in dispenser for the Nivea shaving gel, but I find the refills pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>Despite its near endless line of drawbacks, you do get a good shave with the 7735x.  </li>
            <li>I also find it easy to hold and the heads simply glide over my face.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to and practice, especially when shaving your neck, but once you get it down, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;goo\\&quot; that comes with it certainly helps</li>
            <li>Takes forever to dry that way and doesn&#x27;t get very clean.    </li>
            <li>He used it to shave his beard everyday and had a close enough shave to make both myself and his Air Force career happy.</li>
            <li>Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast.</li>
            <li>Relatively quiet and light.</li>
            <li>we have to be shaven every day and this razor cuts very close.</li>
            <li>I get a reasonably close shave without the burn.  </li>
            <li>I really like the lotion integrated with the razor.  </li>
            <li>and I will be happier than using one that requires me to replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Your sideburns will still need to be straightened by a hand razor, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be maneuvering this thing in a straight line, to make a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am indeed getting blade-close shaves, but I think it is important to use the razor properly if you expect that close of a shave.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t that much of a problem).</li>
            <li>They also really contribute to the feel of the shave.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve heard it makes for a really irritation-free shave.</li>
            <li>- Have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns straight &lt;</li>
            <li>Using it in the shower really helps take away the irritation of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I am just absolutely amazed at how well it shaves.    </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed with the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the shaving gel that can be applied to the skin at the touch of a button while shaving</li>
            <li>Using the gel or lotion really helps out.  </li>
            <li>It only displays a charging light.</li>
            <li>If I have a complaint (and this shaver is so good</li>
            <li>I think  it is as least as good and won&#x27;t miss having to buy the blade refills.</li>
            <li>PROS: close shave; less skin irritation and no cut; quick and easy cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Nivea lotion better than the gel and have used a total of 3 packs so far.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with any kind of electric shaver, so you may wish to take my review with a small grain of salt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t apply a heavy layer to the face so the shaver can do its job effectively.</li>
            <li>shaver is quieter than other shavers (especially the Braun), but seems to be much slower so shaving takes a good bit longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, comfortable and shaves closer than my previous shavers.  </li>
            <li>I consistently end up with red abrasions that last most of the day.    </li>
            <li>It took a full ten minutes with fresh blade in my utility knife to complete the task.  </li>
            <li>Last one used the shaving gel, same as this one but the 7735X has a more open head design which allows for quicker and more complete cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and have lost tolerance for the nicks and bleeding I get from a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Using it (with the lotion) does not irritate the skin at all and clean up is ridiculously simple.</li>
            <li>like the lotion button being placed strangely, an 8 hour charging time, or that it feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>initially had my doubts about splurging, and getting the 7735x cool skin shaver.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad shave</li>
            <li>The 3-blade rotary design is good for getting tight under the nose (something that my microscreen simply could not do).</li>
            <li>Cheap Strap for letting the shaver hang out and dry.  </li>
            <li>The gel pack lasts me about 2-1/2 weeks (not bad), and a charge lasts 3 weeks (mainly so long, Ithink, because shaving is fast with this oen).  </li>
            <li>is my third Norelco in the last 10 years or so and they just seem to keep getting better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver itself is decent.  </li>
            <li>- lot easier to insert packets (compared to my older model) &lt;</li>
            <li>The shaver does a decent job of shaving the hair off of my cheeks, mustache, and chin.</li>
            <li>The main advantage is that it is a lot quicker and can be used in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent razor--</li>
            <li>Wet your face first with hot water, rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion.</li>
            <li>and I will spend the extra money to get the next better Norelco shaver, the reviews seem a little better.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>: I HIGHLY recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li>Other than the cheaply made head assembly falling off, this shaver worked very well, except on longer hairs.</li>
            <li>I find it takes just as long to use it as it does to shave with a razor and don&#x27;t gat as clean of a shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of other electric shavers, but this one is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>He  uses with a similar consistency moisturizer instead of the little packets, saving the packets for travel only, works great.</li>
            <li>and it worked great to prevent irritation, albeit the expensive cost of the lotion.</li>
            <li>that I probably will rarely use the trimmer (I just touch up the side-burns with a blade when necessary).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s saying a lot, since I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind out there that there is to try, starting WAY back when Norelco only made the two-head shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend just using normal shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve shaved with many blade razors, a wide variety of electric shavers, from a nifty little Panasonic travel shaver to an older model Norelco, and even (many years ago) a French wind-up shaver.  </li>
            <li>Newer design which has corrected a few design faults experienced with previous model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of an old school shaver because previous electric razors I&#x27;ve owned just didn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended).</li>
            <li>Let me stress that this works fine for a daily shaver; for normal daily events.  </li>
            <li>There are two lotions available, and I do recommend the one with Chamomille, but not the other one, with menthol.</li>
            <li>I replaced the blades after about 18 months of use and it&#x27;s like have a brand new</li>
            <li>you just get a new one.</li>
            <li>nothing I can&#x27;t live with.  </li>
            <li>I can live with this though.</li>
            <li>I fully expected to use up my pack after one week, but my first lotion pack lasted for 17 straight days of shaving!</li>
            <li>The main problem is when I try to shave hair near my Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li>Mainly because my face is too sensitive to shave with a blade.  </li>
            <li>It hangs head down, and it dries out just fine between shaves for me.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As someone with very sensitive skin, I have always had problems with razor burn after shaving.</li>
            <li>There are other razors on Amzn that are similar in price that would give you a much better shave.  </li>
            <li>The only thing consistent about this razor was the razor burn</li>
            <li>(exact same as the 7735x, but a longer battery life).</li>
            <li>For the first time since pre teen</li>
            <li>The additive definitely helps, but does require a bit of extra work to clean up periodicaly.</li>
            <li>The Norelco 7735x gives a decent shave, but not one that you are going to get really close, especially if you want to do a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave.  </li>
            <li>After shaving a quick rinse with hot water and a little lubricant (Spray Oil) and it is ready to go for the next shave.  </li>
            <li>Second, the charger does not provide a positive stop or click or anything when the shaver is placed into it to charge...</li>
            <li>Disposables never see my neck or face due to my Cool Skin doing the job.    </li>
            <li>So far, it has not toppled over, but the look of it made me nervous for nearly a week.   </li>
            <li>My wife says that it shaves closer than my old three-blade.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>Nivea sensitive \\&quot;after shave balm\\</li>
            <li>WOW, &lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The old model had two lateral buttons.  </li>
            <li>The recharger head is an improvement from the old model.</li>
            <li>Not as convenient as my old Philips which doesn&#x27;t require a separate charging station and can also be used while plugged in.</li>
            <li>But I cant complain much since I got mine at Marshals for only 30 bucks.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>But from what I&#x27;ve read/heard, this is a common problem with most relectric razors.</li>
            <li>I had to use my old $10 Braun foil shaver to finish the job this one started.</li>
            <li>Women&#x27;s leg hair vs. men&#x27;s facial hair...not much difference.    </li>
            <li>Our advice: use the long hair attachment first.</li>
            <li>I have owned Braun and Remington before and neither shaves nearly as close as the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Also, the manual recommends to unplug the charger after the charge is complete.</li>
            <li>Maybe at 30 I&#x27;m too old for this shaver&#x27;s demographic.</li>
            <li>About shave quality - it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close as my Mach 3, but it comes really close - especially with the lotion.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive skin or you get some irritation or bleeding when you use a blade, this shaver is your choice.</li>
            <li>Besides, I haven&#x27;t tried this one shaving gel I&#x27;ve heard about that&#x27;s supposed to completely snuff out irritation.  </li>
            <li>Some tips for those with sensitive skin: I don&#x27;t use the lotion packets.</li>
            <li>I use Noxema Sensitive Skin shave cream</li>
            <li>&quot; if she took my &#x27;old reliable&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delivery system of the additive squirts near the blades, so you end up needing to spread it around with your shaver heads.</li>
            <li>design &lt;br /&gt;-Optional lotion dispenser, in case you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t display how much charge is left</li>
            <li>I have always been intrigued by the idea of a wet shave, since shaving &#x27;wet&#x27; always shaves better.  </li>
            <li>The Cool Skin additive is not worth it.  </li>
            <li>It dilutes the rather thick lotion and seems like it works better.</li>
            <li>I paid $100 or so for this item here at Amazon and after little more than a year the little plastic clip head keeps coming off and the whole razor head assembly falls off!</li>
            <li>To clean it now we just leave the head closed or risk fighting it trying to get it back on.</li>
            <li>I originally moved away from this shaver to skip the cost of lotion cartridges and the messy exchanges.  </li>
            <li>then too, how dare they increase the price for the same older product?)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor especially using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as heavy as my old Norelco from the early eighties, but actually I like the light weight of this one.</li>
            <li>: 1) my positive experience with it was such that it became the shaver of choice when it came time for to get one for my son, and 2) the packaging is out of control and potentially unsafe.  </li>
            <li>I finally found this replacement, and now my face feels normal again.....</li>
            <li>Also the lotion pack takes the place of where the pop-up trimmer would normally go which brings me to my second  gripe - The trimmer that comes with the shaver must be assembled on for each use.</li>
            <li>Plus the refill cartridges for the Cool Skin are not cheap, 4 for 5 or 6 dollars.</li>
            <li>A few months ago I received a Norelco 7735X Cool Skin Additive</li>
            <li>now i am shopping for a new razor, different brand.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use the shaving lotion, it is just more comfortable for me, but the gel isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li>Shaves very well in the shower and on dry skin but not on moist skin.</li>
            <li>I agree that only using the Nivea packets can really increase the total cost of the razor</li>
            <li>People who have sensitive necks need to be careful not to spend too much time on their necks, or you&#x27;ll go raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the one problem I have is that liberating the shaver from the packaging was a major project.  </li>
            <li>Although the shave was extremely close, due to my paper like skin i was only able to shave once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>(Seriously, bought this first of September and still on first battery charge October 21.)</li>
            <li>Clearly, the shaver and parts cannot be accessed by simple unwrapping.  </li>
            <li>This shaver by far gives me the closest shave and in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I tried all sorts of things in the meantime, including shaving the old fashioned way, with a disposable razor, and nothing felt the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never waste my money on another rotary shaver, especially not one from Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have used electric shavers for the last 10 years, and my skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver to anyone, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a replacement charger, so it looks like it&#x27;s back to the old three blade disposable razor and cream for us.</li>
            <li>The only problem, in my mind, is that the cord doesn&#x27;t plug directly into the razor.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t trade this back for my old Braun Shaver.</li>
            <li>The lotion dispenser is an interesting gimmick, but I find it totally unnecessary.</li>
            <li>My Norelco Reflex Action series left me high and dry.  </li>
            <li>Purchased as a replacement for an older Norelco razor that was in need of some minor repair if it was to continue in daily use.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how extremely well it performs and for what I thought was a quite reasonable price.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several of the Mach 3 variants with little success.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad, because the little packets that come with the razor are expensive considering how quickly they run out.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product to any first time electric user - you&#x27;ll never want to use shaving creme and the conventional razor again!</li>
            <li>The only time I touch the disposables is to touch-up the sideburn areas near my upper ears and hairline.</li>
            <li>big Plus to this shaver is that you can rinse it out right away and hang it up with the little strap provided.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to disconnect the heads, connect a straight edge (which connects differently than the other heads), shave, and then re-assemble for storage.    </li>
            <li>Apparently the battery in it finally died..</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s cool about this shaver is that you can take it in the shower, a feature commonly found on chick electric shavers but not on men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>plus the heads dull quickly therefore buy another product not norelco.</li>
            <li>I have a heavy beared that grows very fast, which left me looking untidy.</li>
            <li>I used a shaver during my early teens and found it was very patchy and left my face raw with shaver burn.  </li>
            <li>However, after getting the handle of the change of heads and using it a few times, I discovered two nice things about it:  (1) it isn&#x27;t needed as often as I thought it would be, since the shaver gets a nice, neat trim of my sideburns in regular shaving, and (2) as a separate head, it is slightlyt bigger than a typical pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t get a super close shave under my jaw, close to my neck.</li>
            <li>However after all of the other shaving methods I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ll live with the extra cost and the goo.</li>

            <li> Well it isn&#x27;t perfect  </li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Very impressed on the combination of closeness and lack of irritation.  </li>
            <li> supplied lotion is excellent and definately stops irritation.  </li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> He said it&#x27;s a great shave!</li>
            <li> you want to save some time every morning, avoid cuts, and have a shaver that works well in the shower, this product is an excellent option.</li>
            <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve had for my skin/beard type.  </li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower with the lotion gives the best results.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great!</li>
            <li> The best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Price - I got mine refurbished for $40, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a very good shave, and my face feels irritated afterwards.  </li>
            <li> In/Out of Shower Shaver as a very good shaver and rate it with 5 out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the lotion dispenser would be ideal for him.  </li>
            <li> So, my immediate joy in using this one means something.</li>
            <li> This is one great shaver.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise a great product.    </li>
            <li> &quot; has been great.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower every morning and it takes no time to have a great shave, no nicks, no bleeding, no irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> but then when I got this and it was great.</li>
            <li> the lotion works great and gives me no irritation.</li>
            <li> This razor is great.</li>
            <li> in all a great product, and I got a $20 rebate from Norelco.</li>
            <li> Another plus, I have almost NO redness after my shaves, a welcome surprise after the Reminton.</li>
            <li> My sking feels great -  </li>
            <li> And also the nivea stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Every place I look this razor gets great reviews.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco 6800 series shaver before this one, and it did great for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To say I&#x27;m happy with this shaver is to understate it.</li>
            <li> I always had great luck with the norelco shavers and this one is no differnt.</li>
            <li> I bought the model 7735x and was not ver happy with this model.  </li>
            <li> This razor is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Imagine yourself on a stressful business trip having to contend with this kind of junk! &lt;</li>
            <li> With the listed shortcoming it&#x27;s a very good razor and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower every day and get a very good shave ( all most as good as the blade ).  </li>
            <li> quality is excellent, close and smooth with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It is good to rotate this in on days when you just don&#x27;t want irritation.</li>
            <li> It does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> Gives a really good close shave and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Good shave</li>
            <li> It works good in both settings.  </li>
            <li> I just loved this shaver.</li>
            <li> I also get good results with the lotion when I have rinsed the head off with water.</li>
            <li> - Good shave &lt;br</li>
            <li> and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Norelco has always gave a good shave, but the quality of the shavers are not as they once were.</li>
            <li> As for closeness, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s almost as good as a Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> Good shave, after break in period.  </li>
            <li> It did take about 2 weeks to get a fairly close shave.</li>
            <li> so Good:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Cool Skin now for over three years and have gotten the best shaves of my life WITHOUT using disposables.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve been very, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 weeks and have been very pleased with the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> and was so happy with it that when I had the means I went ahead and bought Brauns top of the line 9595 Pulsonic</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great to be able to use an electic razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life on the shaver and the gel/lotion dispenser is a nice feature that gives a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bet most women don&#x27;t use them because they don&#x27;t have forever to shave their legs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing in my point of view.</li>
            <li> This thing is just amazing; apply the gel or lotion as you shave and it makes an amazing difference in how close of a shave you get.</li>
            <li> However, despite all that, this is an amazing razor.</li>
            <li> I liked the performance of the razor but</li>
            <li> I was refuse to use a electric Shaver, but i really choice the best product.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that I have used every kind of shaving cream/lotion with it.  </li>
            <li> it kind of slides around in the charger ambiguously.</li>
            <li> but hey, it feels good :)).</li>
            <li> I also used a Mach 3 whenever I wanted a really nice shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It struggles with my neck hairs, i still tidy these up with the mach III.</li>
            <li> My neck still gets irritated, but I&#x27;m not going to blame that on the razor, but rather my own physiology.  </li>
            <li> Also was thrilled about the convertible electrical setup, being that he&#x27;s overseas.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use,and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> , caches on everything and comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> It is very easy of using this shaver.</li>
            <li> By far the best razer.  </li>
            <li> I have kept good care of it, kept it clean, replaced the heads every year, and it still works wonders.</li>
            <li> at first i was not too happy wit</li>
            <li> Shaves very smoothly.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very smooth, even going against the grain.</li>
            <li> i love this razor.  </li>
            <li> When you push the button, the lotion just spits out in the one spot on the top and doesn&#x27;t get distributed throughout the razor as you shave.  </li>
            <li> On both counts, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Mostly standing over the sink.  </li>
            <li> So, I would prefer to have a better razor that may not be able to go in the shower.</li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable good design.</li>
            <li> But man was i glad i got it.</li>
            <li> But all in all, I have never had a better shaver than this.</li>
            <li> The shaviong gel is very usefull and smells great.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> do recommend using the strap to make sure you don&#x27;t drop the razor.</li>
            <li> or the shaver won&#x27;t be able to pick it up.  </li>
            <li> A top notch shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I think I could&#x27;ve done a better job with just my fingers plucking my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in 2005 and have been so pleased with it, when it came time for my son to have a quality electric shaver</li>
            <li> But, be sure to shave every morning or else</li>
            <li> Fortunately I received this Norelco shaver for Christmas and it offers the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> - I find the shave lotion packs that come with it to be more of a gimmick than anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for almost two years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I use regular shaving gel and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the performance of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Most days it looked like I didn&#x27;t even shave.      </li>
            <li> but more then satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> the more I use it).  </li>
            <li> This shaver provides shaving that is almost as close as a blade but at much more comfort.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this Norelco.  </li>
            <li> i have a smooth face every day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mightely pleased.</li>
            <li> It has better grip to use.</li>
            <li> i satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Remington Titanium shaver i had before.</li>
            <li> and it works even better.</li>
            <li> I ve been using this shaver for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> The recharger is heavier and more stable than Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> As another reviewer already stated, this isn&#x27;t the most convenient design--yet another thing to lug with you when you travel.  </li>
            <li> I found that the lotion works better.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest shelling out more than that.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> It is nice to use this in the shower, but, in reality, I very rarely use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> my opinion, the pros greatly outway the cons, and I HIGHLY recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> and I wanted my first shaver to be good, so after a week of research I bought this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> They say you need to try it for 3 weeks for your skin to adjust but it worked real fine for me right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 7735X Cool Skin is simply the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> No damage done but for the price i think they could come up with something more secure.</li>
            <li> provides really good shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I got this as my first electric razor ever and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> Overall, if you can live with the trimmer issue, this is a very good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Easy to Use.  </li>
            <li> cleans extremly easy, and workds with after shave lotion while you shave.</li>
            <li> the decision to go with this one for him was an easy one.</li>
            <li> Clean-up is also easy - just run it under the shower head</li>
            <li> Nivea lotion packs are easy to load and administer while shaving.  </li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s \\&quot;cap\\&quot; falls off too easily.  </li>
            <li> and I found it rather easy to snap on, and I found it worked quite well.    </li>
            <li> I have charged the razor once since I bought it, unplugged the charger, and it has been going strong for a week.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the mach 3 because with the cool skin i can go against the grain and with my razor</li>
            <li> Cheap charging unit that does not automatically shut off after full charge is reached!  </li>
            <li> and I made her promise to let me buy a new \\&quot;good shaver\\</li>
            <li> as for the 8 hour charge time, unless your are the wolfman and need to shave 6 times a day, 8 hours between charges is fine with me.</li>
            <li> The lotion button is fine.  </li>
            <li> I have MUCH less of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and I am very happy with the way I look when I leave for work.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that this new model is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> I actually like this razor, but it does not give you a great shave.  </li>
            <li> It performed fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> The battery finally just stopped holding a charge after 9 months and I was so happy to be rid of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with the lotion stuff, without, with shaving cream, or with simply just water and all work great.  </li>
            <li> twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean and take care of too.  </li>
            <li> Now my face is really smooth.</li>
            <li> Why should it matter if it feels cheap?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;  - easy to clean</li>
            <li> a cheap SOB, so here&#x27;s my way of stretching out the life of the packets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean up too.  </li>
            <li> It is now about 3 years later, 01/13/2009, and still never a problem with this great razor.    </li>
            <li> Close shave, easy to clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very easy to clean</li>
            <li> There is no &#x27;click&#x27; when you put the shaver in, so it&#x27;s not all that secure.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean after using.  </li>
            <li> I have had nearly as good results using Nivea Aftershave Balm Sensitive. &lt;</li>
            <li> Everything is good so far..    </li>
            <li> You will see far superior results.</li>
            <li> Very easy clean up - just run under hot water.  </li>
            <li> A great feature is the ability to just wash it out under the sink; much better than other razers that require cleaning with brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can just wash it out with hot water when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop rubbing my neck and face after the first shave (and it seems the shave gets better</li>
            <li> My first review on Amazon, despite shopping online for many years.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it and aren&#x27;t satisfied, that&#x27;s fine, but please don&#x27;t give it unwarranted reviews based on really miniscule details.</li>
            <li> It shaves virtually as close as a blade, is quick and comfortable because of the gel, and gets into everycurve and cranny of my face, neck, and adams apple perfetly.  </li>
            <li> This updated model is easier to clean and works well.</li>
            <li> It also is a breeze to clean up.  </li>
            <li> the Norelco Coolskin was a great solution to this, as it keeps the blades from getting too close or too dry.  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd electric shaver and so far it seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> Save time and clean up time, too.</li>
            <li> other than that, the razor works beautifully</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> i get a very close shave, which is surprising because i&#x27;ve been using a mach 3 for years and had to shave up (against the grain) to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this has been great.  </li>
            <li> The shave is every bit as close as the top of the line triple blade straight razor I used to use.  </li>
            <li> There are fancier electric shavers out there, but I doubt that you&#x27;ll get a better shave from an electric no matter how much you spend.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower and just rinse it off is a real time saver.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to use it in the shower and wash it by placing it in the streaming water.</li>
            <li> The plastic strap is useful to secure the shaver to your hand in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is a good product overall.</li>
            <li> My advice is to stick to the Norelco HQ170 Cool Skin Nivea for Men Lotion Replacement Cartridge.</li>
            <li> Cool Skin Additive</li>
            <li> It has a fair amount of fluorescent yellow, and the super glossy, irridescent housing looks like a pair of vinyl rave pants.</li>
            <li> Maybe the more pricier models will do a better shaving job, but I am staying away from the entire line.</li>
            <li> the Marlboro Man will quickly turn into the Neanderthal man.</li>
            <li> Same battery, same cutter heads and works perfectly.    </li>
            <li> The instructions claim that it can take several weeks for your skin to become acclimated to this shaver, but I had good results right from the start.</li>
            <li> Razor will cause irritation (as warned) in the first week of use but after that it&#x27;s smooth sailing as your face adjusts.</li>
            <li> loving it, i get a clean shave every time i use, i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Everything snapped back together all right, but it does feel kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s the case, and you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice having a clean-cut shave for a quick and easy shave, then this is an ideal alternative outside of the following setbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Remington Microscreen (don&#x27;t bother unless you are a masochist) and the  Norelco 715 corded shaver (also a good product if you dry shave).</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, and the Nivea really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> The gel/shaving cream is mostly for people with very sensitive skin, and you could probably just use soap lather.</li>
            <li> The flexibility to use it either wet or dry is great and the Nivea Cool Skin lotion and gel make shaving much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Cancelled the order, then bought at Amazon, got it in 3 days regular free shipping!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I are really disaapointed with the cheap parts this razor assembly head is made of.</li>
            <li> the lotion provides is worth it.</li>
            <li> Even though the colour scheme is a bit akward, this shaver is definately well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> I rarely use it, though, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Had the plug gone directly to the razor, you&#x27;d still be able to shave--though probably not in the shower.</li>
            <li> a quick shave, a quick rinse, and i&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> The last Norelco Cool Skin I had lasted for about 4 or 5 years with yearly head replacements, but part of the top broke</li>
            <li> Just buy yourself a beard cream from Jack Black or Kiehl&#x27;s and get more for your money and better product.  </li>
            <li> The battery held the first charge for more than three weeks, and I know that was better than my old one, which was this same model.  </li>
            <li> Nice close shave, battery lasts very long time in between charges.  </li>
            <li> The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower, and so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure many cannot scrape away with a blade everyday.  </li>
            <li> Norelco is a breeze to clean as you just need to put it under a strong water current.</li>
            <li> The lotion is easy to clean as well, using only water.</li>
            <li> This thing is so good that my grandpa used and within a week of getting my shaver his old one broke and he instantly wanted me to buy one for him.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as close as a blade, but nearly good enough (see below).</li>
            <li> Loved the previous generation that was made 2 years before this.  </li>
            <li> than that, it&#x27;s a great razor with smooth, clean results almost as close as a regular razor, but there is a slight difference and someone who has fast growth and/or a coarse beard may have to shave more often.</li>
            <li> Also, the shaving gel packets are easy to replace, it comes with a charger stand, it&#x27;s easy to clean the rotating blades and it takes up little bathroom counter space.  </li>
            <li> Going with the Cool Shaver a second time was an easy decision to make.  </li>
            <li> I like this razor very much.</li>
            <li> i got this as a present about 5 years ago very nice shave especially in the shower with Nivea shaving lotion packets.</li>
            <li> I get a good, close shave (depending on how much time I&#x27;m willing to invest each morning), with no cuts, drags, sore spots, or any other after effects.  </li>
            <li> I find that the shave I get is nearly as good as with a blade and with little or no irritation.</li>
            <li> Having the trimmer as a separate head looked like a nuissance at first glance.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i had against this razor was that the gel that came with it created some irritation, but the lotion is definately much better, and you can feel the difference when you use the lotion.</li>
            <li> I have charged the razor only once, when I got it, still waiting to see how many shaves I get on a charge.</li>
            <li> so this was my first</li>
            <li> this is the first electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> it is my first electric shaver.it works well .</li>
            <li> Think about how much I save using rechargeable AA batteries!</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin, so it was important that the shaver not produce any irritation.  </li>
            <li> so I stopped with my first Norelco wet/dry razor</li>
            <li> I have used Gel, foam, and even bar soap at a hotel with the razor  to no ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> Well, let me first state that nothing outdoes a normal hand razor for a true clean-cut shave.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the lotion dispensing button is a tiny bit challenging to operate (I just use my index finger</li>
            <li> I have had the razor for 21 days now and the first time I recharged</li>
            <li> Do a first pass shave.</li>
            <li> You absolutely get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> You just pop the top open in the shower and rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also planning to try a regular can of Nivea Shave Gel which is a lot cheaper than the cartridges and some have said works even better.    </li>
            <li> The floating head design gives such a close, comfortable shave that I do not always apply the cool skin additive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t keep a beard, but my facial hair grows (as it tends to with most guys).</li>
            <li> I get the best results by pressing lightly against my face (despite my instinct to push harder to shave closer) and moving the head around somewhat slowly.</li>
            <li> To me, clean and neat is professional, and this shaver enhances the look.</li>
            <li> I also really like the built in dispenser for the Nivea shaving gel, but I find the refills pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> Despite its near endless line of drawbacks, you do get a good shave with the 7735x.  </li>
            <li> I also find it easy to hold and the heads simply glide over my face.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to and practice, especially when shaving your neck, but once you get it down, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;goo\\&quot; that comes with it certainly helps</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry that way and doesn&#x27;t get very clean.    </li>
            <li> He used it to shave his beard everyday and had a close enough shave to make both myself and his Air Force career happy.</li>
            <li> Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast.</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet and light.</li>
            <li> we have to be shaven every day and this razor cuts very close.</li>
            <li> I get a reasonably close shave without the burn.  </li>
            <li> I really like the lotion integrated with the razor.  </li>
            <li> and I will be happier than using one that requires me to replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Your sideburns will still need to be straightened by a hand razor, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be maneuvering this thing in a straight line, to make a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am indeed getting blade-close shaves, but I think it is important to use the razor properly if you expect that close of a shave.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t that much of a problem).</li>
            <li> They also really contribute to the feel of the shave.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve heard it makes for a really irritation-free shave.</li>
            <li> - Have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns straight &lt;</li>
            <li> Using it in the shower really helps take away the irritation of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I am just absolutely amazed at how well it shaves.    </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed with the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the shaving gel that can be applied to the skin at the touch of a button while shaving</li>
            <li> Using the gel or lotion really helps out.  </li>
            <li> It only displays a charging light.</li>
            <li> If I have a complaint (and this shaver is so good</li>
            <li> I think  it is as least as good and won&#x27;t miss having to buy the blade refills.</li>
            <li> PROS: close shave; less skin irritation and no cut; quick and easy cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Nivea lotion better than the gel and have used a total of 3 packs so far.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with any kind of electric shaver, so you may wish to take my review with a small grain of salt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t apply a heavy layer to the face so the shaver can do its job effectively.</li>
            <li> shaver is quieter than other shavers (especially the Braun), but seems to be much slower so shaving takes a good bit longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, comfortable and shaves closer than my previous shavers.  </li>
            <li> I consistently end up with red abrasions that last most of the day.    </li>
            <li> It took a full ten minutes with fresh blade in my utility knife to complete the task.  </li>
            <li> Last one used the shaving gel, same as this one but the 7735X has a more open head design which allows for quicker and more complete cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and have lost tolerance for the nicks and bleeding I get from a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Using it (with the lotion) does not irritate the skin at all and clean up is ridiculously simple.</li>
            <li> like the lotion button being placed strangely, an 8 hour charging time, or that it feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> initially had my doubts about splurging, and getting the 7735x cool skin shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad shave</li>
            <li> The 3-blade rotary design is good for getting tight under the nose (something that my microscreen simply could not do).</li>
            <li> Cheap Strap for letting the shaver hang out and dry.  </li>
            <li> The gel pack lasts me about 2-1/2 weeks (not bad), and a charge lasts 3 weeks (mainly so long, Ithink, because shaving is fast with this oen).  </li>
            <li> is my third Norelco in the last 10 years or so and they just seem to keep getting better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver itself is decent.  </li>
            <li> - lot easier to insert packets (compared to my older model) &lt;</li>
            <li> The shaver does a decent job of shaving the hair off of my cheeks, mustache, and chin.</li>
            <li> The main advantage is that it is a lot quicker and can be used in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor--</li>
            <li> Wet your face first with hot water, rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion.</li>
            <li> and I will spend the extra money to get the next better Norelco shaver, the reviews seem a little better.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> : I HIGHLY recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> Other than the cheaply made head assembly falling off, this shaver worked very well, except on longer hairs.</li>
            <li> I find it takes just as long to use it as it does to shave with a razor and don&#x27;t gat as clean of a shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of other electric shavers, but this one is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> He  uses with a similar consistency moisturizer instead of the little packets, saving the packets for travel only, works great.</li>
            <li> and it worked great to prevent irritation, albeit the expensive cost of the lotion.</li>
            <li> that I probably will rarely use the trimmer (I just touch up the side-burns with a blade when necessary).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s saying a lot, since I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind out there that there is to try, starting WAY back when Norelco only made the two-head shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend just using normal shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve shaved with many blade razors, a wide variety of electric shavers, from a nifty little Panasonic travel shaver to an older model Norelco, and even (many years ago) a French wind-up shaver.  </li>
            <li> Newer design which has corrected a few design faults experienced with previous model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of an old school shaver because previous electric razors I&#x27;ve owned just didn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> Let me stress that this works fine for a daily shaver; for normal daily events.  </li>
            <li> There are two lotions available, and I do recommend the one with Chamomille, but not the other one, with menthol.</li>
            <li> I replaced the blades after about 18 months of use and it&#x27;s like have a brand new</li>
            <li> you just get a new one.</li>
            <li> nothing I can&#x27;t live with.  </li>
            <li> I can live with this though.</li>
            <li> I fully expected to use up my pack after one week, but my first lotion pack lasted for 17 straight days of shaving!</li>
            <li> The main problem is when I try to shave hair near my Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> Mainly because my face is too sensitive to shave with a blade.  </li>
            <li> It hangs head down, and it dries out just fine between shaves for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As someone with very sensitive skin, I have always had problems with razor burn after shaving.</li>
            <li> There are other razors on Amzn that are similar in price that would give you a much better shave.  </li>
            <li> The only thing consistent about this razor was the razor burn</li>
            <li> (exact same as the 7735x, but a longer battery life).</li>
            <li> For the first time since pre teen</li>
            <li> The additive definitely helps, but does require a bit of extra work to clean up periodicaly.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 7735x gives a decent shave, but not one that you are going to get really close, especially if you want to do a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave.  </li>
            <li> After shaving a quick rinse with hot water and a little lubricant (Spray Oil) and it is ready to go for the next shave.  </li>
            <li> Second, the charger does not provide a positive stop or click or anything when the shaver is placed into it to charge...</li>
            <li> Disposables never see my neck or face due to my Cool Skin doing the job.    </li>
            <li> So far, it has not toppled over, but the look of it made me nervous for nearly a week.   </li>
            <li> My wife says that it shaves closer than my old three-blade.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> Nivea sensitive \\&quot;after shave balm\\</li>
            <li> WOW, &lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The old model had two lateral buttons.  </li>
            <li> The recharger head is an improvement from the old model.</li>
            <li> Not as convenient as my old Philips which doesn&#x27;t require a separate charging station and can also be used while plugged in.</li>
            <li> But I cant complain much since I got mine at Marshals for only 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> But from what I&#x27;ve read/heard, this is a common problem with most relectric razors.</li>
            <li> I had to use my old $10 Braun foil shaver to finish the job this one started.</li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s leg hair vs. men&#x27;s facial hair...not much difference.    </li>
            <li> Our advice: use the long hair attachment first.</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun and Remington before and neither shaves nearly as close as the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Also, the manual recommends to unplug the charger after the charge is complete.</li>
            <li> Maybe at 30 I&#x27;m too old for this shaver&#x27;s demographic.</li>
            <li> About shave quality - it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close as my Mach 3, but it comes really close - especially with the lotion.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive skin or you get some irritation or bleeding when you use a blade, this shaver is your choice.</li>
            <li> Besides, I haven&#x27;t tried this one shaving gel I&#x27;ve heard about that&#x27;s supposed to completely snuff out irritation.  </li>
            <li> Some tips for those with sensitive skin: I don&#x27;t use the lotion packets.</li>
            <li> I use Noxema Sensitive Skin shave cream</li>
            <li> &quot; if she took my &#x27;old reliable&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delivery system of the additive squirts near the blades, so you end up needing to spread it around with your shaver heads.</li>
            <li> design &lt;br /&gt;-Optional lotion dispenser, in case you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t display how much charge is left</li>
            <li> I have always been intrigued by the idea of a wet shave, since shaving &#x27;wet&#x27; always shaves better.  </li>
            <li> The Cool Skin additive is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It dilutes the rather thick lotion and seems like it works better.</li>
            <li> I paid $100 or so for this item here at Amazon and after little more than a year the little plastic clip head keeps coming off and the whole razor head assembly falls off!</li>
            <li> To clean it now we just leave the head closed or risk fighting it trying to get it back on.</li>
            <li> I originally moved away from this shaver to skip the cost of lotion cartridges and the messy exchanges.  </li>
            <li> then too, how dare they increase the price for the same older product?)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor especially using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy as my old Norelco from the early eighties, but actually I like the light weight of this one.</li>
            <li> : 1) my positive experience with it was such that it became the shaver of choice when it came time for to get one for my son, and 2) the packaging is out of control and potentially unsafe.  </li>
            <li> I finally found this replacement, and now my face feels normal again.....</li>
            <li> Also the lotion pack takes the place of where the pop-up trimmer would normally go which brings me to my second  gripe - The trimmer that comes with the shaver must be assembled on for each use.</li>
            <li> Plus the refill cartridges for the Cool Skin are not cheap, 4 for 5 or 6 dollars.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I received a Norelco 7735X Cool Skin Additive</li>
            <li> now i am shopping for a new razor, different brand.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use the shaving lotion, it is just more comfortable for me, but the gel isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well in the shower and on dry skin but not on moist skin.</li>
            <li> I agree that only using the Nivea packets can really increase the total cost of the razor</li>
            <li> People who have sensitive necks need to be careful not to spend too much time on their necks, or you&#x27;ll go raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the one problem I have is that liberating the shaver from the packaging was a major project.  </li>
            <li> Although the shave was extremely close, due to my paper like skin i was only able to shave once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> (Seriously, bought this first of September and still on first battery charge October 21.)</li>
            <li> Clearly, the shaver and parts cannot be accessed by simple unwrapping.  </li>
            <li> This shaver by far gives me the closest shave and in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I tried all sorts of things in the meantime, including shaving the old fashioned way, with a disposable razor, and nothing felt the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never waste my money on another rotary shaver, especially not one from Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for the last 10 years, and my skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver to anyone, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a replacement charger, so it looks like it&#x27;s back to the old three blade disposable razor and cream for us.</li>
            <li> The only problem, in my mind, is that the cord doesn&#x27;t plug directly into the razor.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t trade this back for my old Braun Shaver.</li>
            <li> The lotion dispenser is an interesting gimmick, but I find it totally unnecessary.</li>
            <li> My Norelco Reflex Action series left me high and dry.  </li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for an older Norelco razor that was in need of some minor repair if it was to continue in daily use.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how extremely well it performs and for what I thought was a quite reasonable price.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the Mach 3 variants with little success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad, because the little packets that come with the razor are expensive considering how quickly they run out.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product to any first time electric user - you&#x27;ll never want to use shaving creme and the conventional razor again!</li>
            <li> The only time I touch the disposables is to touch-up the sideburn areas near my upper ears and hairline.</li>
            <li> big Plus to this shaver is that you can rinse it out right away and hang it up with the little strap provided.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to disconnect the heads, connect a straight edge (which connects differently than the other heads), shave, and then re-assemble for storage.    </li>
            <li> Apparently the battery in it finally died..</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s cool about this shaver is that you can take it in the shower, a feature commonly found on chick electric shavers but not on men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> plus the heads dull quickly therefore buy another product not norelco.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beared that grows very fast, which left me looking untidy.</li>
            <li> I used a shaver during my early teens and found it was very patchy and left my face raw with shaver burn.  </li>
            <li> However, after getting the handle of the change of heads and using it a few times, I discovered two nice things about it:  (1) it isn&#x27;t needed as often as I thought it would be, since the shaver gets a nice, neat trim of my sideburns in regular shaving, and (2) as a separate head, it is slightlyt bigger than a typical pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t get a super close shave under my jaw, close to my neck.</li>
            <li> However after all of the other shaving methods I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ll live with the extra cost and the goo.</li>
            <li> All in all I highly recommend this shaver and if you search online you can find a refurbished one for half the price, which is what I did</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything particularly special about the contents of the expensive little packets, though they are very convenient for traveling, which I do frequently with this product.  </li>
            <li> As other users with sensitive skin can attest to, this electric razor works wonders for those of us who can&#x27;t use disposable blades on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> other hand, one will face fewer cuts when compared to the old fashioned way, which is the actual reason why I kept it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if you have a strong jawbone you may have trouble getting some patches along the neck-jawline area, so I have to go over that area several times.</li>
            <li> , it provides a very close shave that doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like a traditional razor, and there&#x27;s very little skin irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Not a major undertaking, but cumbersome enough</li>
            <li> I used it normally yesterday, then today, out of nowhere, it simply would not stay running and would not light up when placed on charger.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve gotten about a half dozen shaves out of it with the initial charge, so it seems to hold a charge well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: long charging time; pricy cartridges; fragile looking body</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and only shave every couple of days don&#x27;t let your hair get too long</li>
            <li> only problem is that the charger is a bit bulky to carry, but the battery lasts so long that I never have to take it with me &lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews I read here gave me a pretty accurate perspective, so I was not at all disappointed in the razor.</li>
            <li> This can be a big problem if the battery runs dry and you need to shave - there&#x27;s no way to plug the shaver into the wall and use it.  </li>
            <li> I only continued to use this because I don&#x27;t have enough time before work to wet shave</li>
            <li> Modifying my review as the shaver broke a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, 8 hours are too long for charging-</li>
            <li> i expect to keep this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the 8-hour charging time is too long because the one customer was letting his friends use it or something.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Wet Shaver.</li>
            <li> Rinse the shaver and do a second pass without the lotion with a wet face/shaver.</li>
            <li> In the long run, the skin gets a bit smoother also.</li>
            <li> will go back to wet shaving when I run out of spares, $100</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> Overall, cool design, but the lotion depensing gimmick is just useless and</li>
            <li> I all ways used it wet, and only seldom used it dry.</li>
            <li> Further, it takes less time to shave and clean-up afterwards than with a traditional razor &amp; shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It seems to take a long time to shave compared to the dry Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy gives you the same quality as little five Nivea 0.4 oz.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but always come back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> similar, if not exactly like a Mach 3 Turbo shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend after he ineptly and regularly cut himself with other models.</li>
            <li> Like other users&#x27; complaints about the hinge design, the flip up mechanism is highly fragile.  </li>
            <li> Dry electric shavers tend to butcher my skin.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head has a yellow rubber piece that keeps the flip spring in place, once the yellow rubber piece falls out and the spring pops out, you&#x27;ll having nothing but trouble.</li>
            <li> it gave me every single day.</li>
            <li> The triple blades make it difficult to get under above your lip and I seem to have to get a disposible razor to get right under the nose.  </li>
            <li> I was seriously considering Brauns and Panasonic&#x27;s high end razors but decided against it because there was no clearly outlined guarantee if it didn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> the product, it was irritating my skin, but a friend told me at first thats how it is, after that</li>
            <li> First, I agree with one of the reviews that the &#x27;goo&#x27; button is poorly placed.</li>
            <li> the shave is just as close as i was getting with my old razor, in less than half the time.  </li>
            <li> about a year and half the power button started acting up.</li>
            <li> The stuff does work, but I get the same results from lathering my face with a moisturizing bar soap (and the cost is substantially less).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband just under a year ago (and might I add it was about $35 less back</li>
            <li> has not happy with my shaver and sent back to Norelco for repair since I live overseas, they sent me a check for $80.00, this model sells here for $99.95? &lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, it is somewhat expensive, but if you have very sensitive skin like me, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was with its performance.</li>
            <li> the plus side, the cleaning system works well and the wet shave does keep hair from getting all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use the trimmer, not really needed.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my electric shaver because the one that I had went missing on a recent air trip.  </li>
            <li> However I was really getting tired of lathering up every day and getting razor burn, but</li>
            <li> But this one i did felt not much heating happening while shaving. &lt;br /&gt;2).</li>
            <li> Traditional multi-blade razors (like the Mach 3) are easier on my skin, but as sensitive as my skin is, cuts are not uncommon.  </li>
            <li> i havent tried using shaving cream/gel or anything else with the razor yet, but hope that it works since the cartidges are small, and dont seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that the replacement cartridges are expensive, but think they are worth it.  </li>
            <li> So this is definitely not a good shaver for a frequent traveler.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i haven&#x27;t had any problems with the lotion button or shaving one handed like some other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> and so can do more--sideburns, nose and ear hairs, and just about any other trim job I need.</li>
            <li> :) Girly looking though :(</li>
            <li> Over the years however, I&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of shaving in the shower with a disposable razor due to the speed and convenience.</li>
            <li> an industrial designer, I have a few minor issues with the product design.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets extremely close...</li>
            <li> I can also \\&quot;re-do\\&quot; the other areas for a closer shave, and for whatever reason, when I do it this way, I don&#x27;t get nicked.    </li>
            <li> Other positives:</li>
            <li> Not sure all shavers have the same problem.</li>
            <li> shaver delivers on the promise and it does it extremely well.</li>
            <li> I use it with shave gel, and it gets closer and cleaner than any foil shaver or any other electric</li>
            <li> have tried using it with shaving creams other than those compatible with the unit, with no luck.</li>
            <li> Other brands/models have a flip up design, which I thought every shaver had.</li>
            <li> I like this machine, but getting spares for the lotion/gel is nigh on impossible unless you are willing to pay shipping to buy it on the net.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time finding the gel packs in local stores (target, etc) but other then that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> razor deserves a 5-star average.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times in the shower, (after all it can be wet and slippery) and a few pieces popped off.  </li>
            <li> shaver is bulky, sideburn trimmer is not attached to shaver, cool skin additive is very difficult to use for a person with rheumatoid arthriris.</li>
            <li> Let it run all the way down before you recharge, then don&#x27;t leave it in longer than 8 hours overnight.</li>
            <li> Here is my take after using a dry electric shaver for the past 2 years plus a weeks experience with the 7735x:    </li>
            <li> They must be surgically removed with a very sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little complicated to remove the blade Assembly (pop it up, then pull them straight up).</li>
            <li> Norelco on the other had advertises their&#x27;s quite well and after reading a few reviews, I decided (...)</li>
            <li> would have exchanged it for a different model except it is to difficult to repack and mail back.</li>
            <li> , i used for less than a month before throwing out.</li>
            <li> I quit the Mach 3 even though the shave was otherwise close because the irriation it left made me unable to make a second pass.  </li>
            <li> - Less razor burn &lt;br</li>
            <li> If you cannot stand anything less than a blade, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I pulled out my 30 year old Remington electric and was surprised that, with a little pre-shave lotion, it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time (at least 2 weeks), and the battery indicator is helpful as well.    </li>
            <li> , it is about the design of the bottom of the shaver, which comes to a point and thus sits in its cradle a little precariously (or appears to be precarious).  </li>
            <li> the colors/materials choices are a little fruity for my taste.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had it for two weeks now, and have used it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of using five and ten dollar razors.</li>
            <li> The amount of money you waste buy razir after razor, it&#x27;s a headache.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard by any means, and yet this thing still managed to yank out every hair on my neck,</li>
            <li> And so, if you&#x27;re like me, you may be looking to save a few bucks, so you&#x27;re considering an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I also use a pre-shave scrub by Clinique to get the dead skin off before each shave.</li>
            <li> Usually, dead skin is the reason we have the bumps, scrapes, cuts, burns, etc.     </li>
            <li> + bucks wasted.</li>
            <li> The main problem with my razor is that the charging base only lasted two months and died.</li>
            <li> I returned this one after my first shave because it was just THAT bad.</li>
            <li> After a year and a half of using this rather dull shaver... it dies on me...</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco 7737X and have been using it for the past 26 days.</li>
            <li> Using this in the shower only made the shave worse as the hairs on my face swelled and were harder to cut by this already useless product.</li>
            <li> Against or with the grain the Mach 3 would miss random places on my throat (especially around the adam&#x27;s apple).  </li>
            <li> Usually lot of shavers generates heat while shaving.</li>
            <li> But if you want something that will last longer than 10 months, be wary of this product.</li>
            <li> Closeness of shave, Hard to shave in small areas</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;  - Hard to get that \\&quot;patch\\&quot; under your nose &lt;</li>
            <li> The charging stand is awkward to pack, but it works with a variety of electrical configurations internationally.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had a difficult time getting a close shave and a shave with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> , there are at least 18 hours between my shaves.  </li>
            <li> The base is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> You will still have very very small stubs leftover, which may make you look like the Marlboro Man with his 5 &#x27;O&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the dispensing button oddly placed or difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem too hard to include circuitry which makes unplugging unnecessary.</li>
            <li> trimmer is somewhat inconvenient to use, as the shaver head must be detached, unlike my previous shaver which had a trimmer which flipped out and didn&#x27;t require any removal or reattachment.  </li>
            <li> another 4 to 6 years when this razor starts to get tired</li>
            <li> Give it 4 starts because of the poor packaging.</li>
            <li> the consumables price make it a poor buy.</li>
            <li> The blades cover is unnecessarily fancy</li>
            <li> probably the worse feature ever thought up of from</li>
            <li> the metal wire clip on the inside doesn&#x27;t appear to be bent or broken, just refuses to stay on.     </li>
            <li> While the lotion feature seems neat, the button is, in my opinion, poorly positioned and the replacement packets seem over-priced.</li>
            <li> But worse, is that should the charge run out (and why didn&#x27;t the engineers imagine that) you are stuck until it recharges.  </li>
            <li> The attachment was poor quality.</li>
            <li> 8 hour charge time is excessive and inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> the charging cradle is inconvenient, and difficult to carry when traveling as it does not fit in the traveling pouch.</li>
            <li> one real complaint is sturdiness.  </li>
            <li> that was less than 5 stars was because of stupid reasons...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to buy an expensive razor to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The lotion dispenser is difficult to press while shaving</li>
            <li> Not to mention the refills are quite expensive for something that is basically just lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect though.</li>
            <li> - packets are expensive</li>
            <li> In addition, the design of the shaver makes it unrealistic to shave sideburns.</li>
            <li> tried to put the trimmer in and found the instructions very poor.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Good:  Price, Lotion Attachment, Noise, Size of Base (small)</li>
            <li> Being frustrated with a poor shave, I bought a Braun 360 and</li>
            <li> can I was so angry!  </li>
            <li> Without the charging base the razor is useless.</li>
            <li> It was almost impossible to get the shaving assembly out without it coming apart.</li>
            <li> Really a bad shaver.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this saver to anyone who is sick of using disposable razors.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> Also the way the razor fits into the charging base is very awkward.</li>
            <li> Went online to find a charging base and could not find one.</li>
            <li> base -</li>
            <li> when you go to charge the shaver, you just put it in the included charging base.</li>
            <li> Angered over years of horrible shaving, I decided I would treat myself for my birthday.  </li>
            <li> I used my brother&#x27;s before this and his Remington was awful</li>
            <li> I used this razor for about 9 months and it gave me the worst shave of my life.</li>
            <li> The women&#x27;s versions (foil type) of a leg shaver are horrible!</li>
            <li> and the shocking part</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love this razor.  i&#x27;ve had it for two weeks now, and have used it everyday.  by now i think my face has adjusted and the shave is just as close as i was getting with my old razor, in less than half the time.  a quick shave, a quick rinse, and i&#x27;m ready to go.  i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever want to switch back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t had any problems with the lotion button or shaving one handed like some other reviewers.  i would recommend using the wrist strap if you&#x27;re in the shower though.  other than that, the razor works beautifully and i give it the highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who has very sensitive skin.  I thought that the lotion dispenser would be ideal for him.  I have found out that he doesn&#x27;t use that feature.  When you push the button, the lotion just spits out in the one spot on the top and doesn&#x27;t get distributed throughout the razor as you shave.  Otherwise, the razor seems to be serving him well but, if you are intrigued by the lotion aspect, I would reconsider.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 7735X Cool Skin is simply the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Over the years I&#x27;ve shaved with many blade razors, a wide variety of electric shavers, from a nifty little Panasonic travel shaver to an older model Norelco, and even (many years ago) a French wind-up shaver.  So, my immediate joy in using this one means something. &lt;br /&gt;   It shaves virtually as close as a blade, is quick and comfortable because of the gel, and gets into everycurve and cranny of my face, neck, and adams apple perfetly.  The gel injection system is simple and ingenious--and sit works well. &lt;br /&gt;   Having the trimmer as a separate head looked like a nuissance at first glance.  However, after getting the handle of the change of heads and using it a few times, I discovered two nice things about it:  (1) it isn&#x27;t needed as often as I thought it would be, since the shaver gets a nice, neat trim of my sideburns in regular shaving, and (2) as a separate head, it is slightlyt bigger than a typical pop-up trimmer and so can do more--sideburns, nose and ear hairs, and just about any other trim job I need. &lt;br /&gt;   The gel pack lasts me about 2-1/2 weeks (not bad), and a charge lasts 3 weeks (mainly so long, Ithink, because shaving is fast with this oen).  On both counts, I am pleased. &lt;br /&gt;   If I have a complaint (and this shaver is so good I&#x27;m embarrassed to even mention this), it is about the design of the bottom of the shaver, which comes to a point and thus sits in its cradle a little precariously (or appears to be precarious).  So far, it has not toppled over, but the look of it made me nervous for nearly a week.   &lt;br /&gt;   This is one great shaver.  I hope it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for an older Norelco razor that was in need of some minor repair if it was to continue in daily use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my third Norelco in the last 10 years or so and they just seem to keep getting better.  Last one used the shaving gel, same as this one but the 7735X has a more open head design which allows for quicker and more complete cleaning.  After shaving a quick rinse with hot water and a little lubricant (Spray Oil) and it is ready to go for the next shave.  (Didn&#x27;t see oil mentioned in the operators manual but I use it to help dissipate any moisture that may be left on the blades. It may not be required but I figure it can&#x27;t hurt anything either since it was recommended for the Norelco that just went into semi retirement.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shave quality is excellent, close and smooth with no irritation.  I do use a preshave and the Norelco shaving gel packs that go in the razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In another 4 to 6 years when this razor starts to get tired, I won&#x27;t hesitate to get another Norelco.</li>
            <li> I actually like this razor, but it does not give you a great shave.  There are other razors on Amzn that are similar in price that would give you a much better shave.  It is nice to use this in the shower, but, in reality, I very rarely use it in the shower.  Mostly standing over the sink.  So, I would prefer to have a better razor that may not be able to go in the shower.</li>
            <li> I got this as my first electric razor ever and fell in love with it! Smooth, comfortable good design. I all ways used it wet, and only seldom used it dry. It performed fantastic. Kooky beard/sidburns trimmer though. I never used it. &lt;br /&gt;After about a year and half the power button started acting up. I would have to push it about 3 or 4 times to get it to turn on or off. eventually it stopped all together. and wouldn&#x27;t shut off so the battery would run out, i would re-charge it and mash the button 10-12 times to get it to turn on, then let the battery run out again.  &lt;br /&gt;Drag. now i am shopping for a new razor, different brand.</li>
            <li> This updated model is easier to clean and works well. I bought one for my son-in-law, he loves it too</li>
            <li> provides really good shave at a reasonable price. Can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity, yet. Give it 4 starts because of the poor packaging. Shaver was sealed in one of those molded plastic boxes which came apart when i tried opening it. No damage done but for the price i think they could come up with something more secure. Otherwise a great product.    EDIT: Modifying my review as the shaver broke a long time ago. Dissappointing.</li>
            <li> I owned this shaver for awhile, but then I turned to the Mach 3 and eventually the Fusion.  Being frustrated with a poor shave, I bought a Braun 360 and then a Norelco 8150XL.  None of these options provided a closer or faster shave than the 7735X.  This shaver by far gives me the closest shave and in a short amount of time.  I originally moved away from this shaver to skip the cost of lotion cartridges and the messy exchanges.  However after all of the other shaving methods I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ll live with the extra cost and the goo.</li>
            <li> I tried this out after using Quadra and Reflex Norelcos for years.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  I don&#x27;t get a very good shave, and my face feels irritated afterwards.  It seems to take a long time to shave compared to the dry Norelcos.  The trimmer is very inconvenient.  And the shaver tends to deposit a hair/lotion (yuck) mix on my face towards the end of my shave.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the cleaning system works well and the wet shave does keep hair from getting all over the place.  However, I think I&#x27;m going to be trying out Norelco&#x27;s money-back guarantee on this one and either going back to my Quadra or trying a Spectra.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and have lost tolerance for the nicks and bleeding I get from a straight razor.  I pulled out my 30 year old Remington electric and was surprised that, with a little pre-shave lotion, it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I figured razor technology had to have improved in 30 years, so I did the research and bought the Norelco 7735X.  I&#x27;ve had it for a week and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The \\&quot;goo\\&quot; that comes with it certainly helps (I prefer the gel to the lotion), but I found I get an even closer shave using just regular off the shelf gel-type \\&quot;clensing wash\\&quot; that I use to wash my face with. I&#x27;m glad, because the little packets that come with the razor are expensive considering how quickly they run out. The shave is every bit as close as the top of the line triple blade straight razor I used to use.  I have charged the razor once since I bought it, unplugged the charger, and it has been going strong for a week.  I love that I can just wash it out with hot water when I&#x27;m done. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This razor is AMAZING! Using it (with the lotion) does not irritate the skin at all and clean up is ridiculously simple. My wife says that it shaves closer than my old three-blade. I think  it is as least as good and won&#x27;t miss having to buy the blade refills. I will have to buy the lotion (~$1/wk), but the feeling and close shave the lotion provides is worth it.</li>
            <li> PROS: close shave; less skin irritation and no cut; quick and easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: long charging time; pricy cartridges; fragile looking body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this shaver, I&#x27;ve had the closest shaves! It only took me several days for my face to get used to it.  Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this has been great.  The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower, and so easy to clean. Nevertheless, 8 hours are too long for charging- pricier 7775X model only takes 1 hour. Also the plastic body looks very fragile.  Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast. But I found a remedy- Nivea \\&quot;after shave balm\\&quot; 3.3 oz. at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy gives you the same quality as little five Nivea 0.4 oz. cartridges(total 2 oz.) at $5 do. I have a sensitive skin and Nivea sensitive \\&quot;after shave balm\\&quot; has been great.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> WOW, &lt;br /&gt;I initially had my doubts about splurging, and getting the 7735x cool skin shaver. But man was i glad i got it. Ive had it for about three days now, and ive never had a closer shave since. Even though the colour scheme is a bit akward, this shaver is definately well worth the price tag. The only thing i had against this razor was that the gel that came with it created some irritation, but the lotion is definately much better, and you can feel the difference when you use the lotion. But all in all, I have never had a better shaver than this. i expect to keep this for a long time. THANK YOU NORELCO.</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet and light. &lt;br /&gt;Shaves well but only after going over the same surface 5 -7 times. Shaves very well in the shower and on dry skin but not on moist skin. The shaviong gel is very usefull and smells great. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I used a razor for almost 50 years, never used an electric. My wife suggested I try an electric to get a closer shave. I bought the Norelco 7737X and have been using it for the past 26 days. I love it. It gives a very close shave and is very comfortable to use. I use it in the shower every morning and it takes no time to have a great shave, no nicks, no bleeding, no irritation. I have charged the razor only once, when I got it, still waiting to see how many shaves I get on a charge. I like the Nivea lotion better than the gel and have used a total of 3 packs so far. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried to put the trimmer in and found the instructions very poor. It was almost impossible to get the shaving assembly out without it coming apart. I won&#x27;t use the trimmer, not really needed. I use a razor to touch up my side-burns, takes a second. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do recommend using the strap to make sure you don&#x27;t drop the razor. I did that once, and it survived the fall. I highly recommend this razor especially using it in the shower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a blade for years and finally wanted to go electric so this was my first and I&#x27;m very happy with it. And I&#x27;m under a lot of scrutiny being in the Army deployed in Iraq...we have to be shaven every day and this razor cuts very close. My only complaint is that if you have a strong jawbone you may have trouble getting some patches along the neck-jawline area, so I have to go over that area several times. Razor will cause irritation (as warned) in the first week of use but after that it&#x27;s smooth sailing as your face adjusts. Highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li> I liked the performance of the razor but the consumables price make it a poor buy. Also the way the razor fits into the charging base is very awkward. The main problem with my razor is that the charging base only lasted two months and died. Without the charging base the razor is useless. Went online to find a charging base and could not find one.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shaver in March of 2006, for &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;$69.00&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; on Amazon.  I read some reviews and decided to buy extra packets of the shaving lotion vs. the gel.  I agree with everyone who has stated a preference.  This is my first experience with any kind of electric shaver, so you may wish to take my review with a small grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is decent.  I find that my closest shave is still with a blade razor, but having curly hair was leading to razor burn and ingrown hairs.  I get a reasonably close shave without the burn.  It does miss hairs sometimes but if you go back and forth enough you eventually catch it all.  NOTE: If you&#x27;re like me and only shave every couple of days don&#x27;t let your hair get too long or the shaver won&#x27;t be able to pick it up.  It&#x27;s best for shaving stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one real complaint is sturdiness.  I&#x27;ve removed one star off the rating for this.  I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times in the shower, (after all it can be wet and slippery) and a few pieces popped off.  Everything snapped back together all right, but it does feel kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The shaver works wells for the person who received the gift. They especially like the gel used with the product for close shave.</li>
            <li> By far the best razer.  Smooth. Easy to Use.  I really like the lotion integrated with the razor.  A great feature is the ability to just wash it out under the sink; much better than other razers that require cleaning with brushes.  Battery life is not a problem; mine lasts for weeks before needing a recharge.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> 1) I like the cream dispenser on the back. The old model had two lateral buttons.  &lt;br /&gt;2) The recharger head is an improvement from the old model. &lt;br /&gt;3) The base is very flimsy. The razor doesn&#x27;t want to stay on. &lt;br /&gt;4) The blades cover is unnecessarily fancy, caches on everything and comes off very easily. &lt;br /&gt;5) With the listed shortcoming it&#x27;s a very good razor and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  It holds a charge for over a month.  I don&#x27;t know how it will be after a year (or three) of use, but for now it is awesome.  The last Norelco Cool Skin I had lasted for about 4 or 5 years with yearly head replacements, but part of the top broke, so I had to replace it.  It also is a breeze to clean up.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a waterproof shaver.</li>
            <li> at first i was not too happy wit the product, it was irritating my skin, but a friend told me at first thats how it is, after that im loving it, i get a clean shave every time i use, i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Never found an electric shaver that is as close as a blade.  But I&#x27;m sure many cannot scrape away with a blade everyday.  It is good to rotate this in on days when you just don&#x27;t want irritation.</li>
            <li> Just got 7737x which is similar to 7735x. Shaves very smoothly. Only complain is the charger. Not as convenient as my old Philips which doesn&#x27;t require a separate charging station and can also be used while plugged in. Unplugging each time when fully charged is also a hassle. But I cant complain much since I got mine at Marshals for only 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> It does a fairly good job. Low irritaion :) Girly looking though :(</li>
            <li> A top notch shaver for the price.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> the Norelco Coolskin was a great solution to this, as it keeps the blades from getting too close or too dry.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is a breeze to clean as you just need to put it under a strong water current. The lotion is easy to clean as well, using only water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the charging cradle is inconvenient, and difficult to carry when traveling as it does not fit in the traveling pouch. So this is definitely not a good shaver for a frequent traveler. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the shaver and it worked great to prevent irritation, albeit the expensive cost of the lotion. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I started shaving about 6 months ago and I wanted my first shaver to be good, so after a week of research I bought this shaver. I used my brother&#x27;s before this and his Remington was awful but then when I got this and it was great. Gives a really good close shave and have had no problems with it. This thing is so good that my grandpa used and within a week of getting my shaver his old one broke and he instantly wanted me to buy one for him. I think that when a guy whos been around for 70 years loves this things I think it earns its stripes. BYW you can get this shaver between $35 and $65 on Ebay.</li>
            <li> Wow. I was so tired of using five and ten dollar razors. So I decided to buy an expensive razor to get the job done. The amount of money you waste buy razir after razor, it&#x27;s a headache. Basically this razor is both shower and non shower proof. cleans extremly easy, and workds with after shave lotion while you shave. It&#x27;s amazing in my point of view.</li>
            <li> I was refuse to use a electric Shaver, but i really choice the best product.</li>
            <li> This razor was excellent for 5 years. I never had to sharpen or change the blades even. Apparently the battery in it finally died.. I used it normally yesterday, then today, out of nowhere, it simply would not stay running and would not light up when placed on charger. If I can simply purchase a battery replacement I will. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is the first electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever used and i&#x27;ve been very, very satisfied. i&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 weeks and have been very pleased with the quality of the shave. i get a very close shave, which is surprising because i&#x27;ve been using a mach 3 for years and had to shave up (against the grain) to get a decent shave. Good battery life on the shaver and the gel/lotion dispenser is a nice feature that gives a smoother shave. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t get a super close shave under my jaw, close to my neck. But from what I&#x27;ve read/heard, this is a common problem with most relectric razors. I would reccomend this product to any first time electric user - you&#x27;ll never want to use shaving creme and the conventional razor again!</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 20 years. I have tried other brands but always come back to Norelco. I was surprised to find that this new model is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> it is my first electric shaver.it works well . it&#x27;s easy to use,and gives a good shave. i&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> shaver is bulky, sideburn trimmer is not attached to shaver, cool skin additive is very difficult to use for a person with rheumatoid arthriris. &lt;br /&gt;I would have exchanged it for a different model except it is to difficult to repack and mail back.</li>
            <li> I had to use my old $10 Braun foil shaver to finish the job this one started. Overall, cool design, but the lotion depensing gimmick is just useless and probably the worse feature ever thought up of from R&amp;D. Maybe the more pricier models will do a better shaving job, but I am staying away from the entire line. I returned this one after my first shave because it was just THAT bad. I think I could&#x27;ve done a better job with just my fingers plucking my hair. I&#x27;ll stick to using AA powered foil shavers for now. I can go through a dozen of those over a decade and I will be happier than using one that requires me to replace the whole thing. Think about how much I save using rechargeable AA batteries!</li>
            <li> I had to replace my electric shaver because the one that I had went missing on a recent air trip.  I tried all sorts of things in the meantime, including shaving the old fashioned way, with a disposable razor, and nothing felt the same.  I finally found this replacement, and now my face feels normal again.....I get a good, close shave (depending on how much time I&#x27;m willing to invest each morning), with no cuts, drags, sore spots, or any other after effects.  The battery held the first charge for more than three weeks, and I know that was better than my old one, which was this same model.  There are two lotions available, and I do recommend the one with Chamomille, but not the other one, with menthol.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for about 9 months and it gave me the worst shave of my life. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard by any means, and yet this thing still managed to yank out every hair on my neck, one by one it seemed. The only thing consistent about this razor was the razor burn it gave me every single day. The lotion dispenser is difficult to press while shaving and you need multiple presses for the entire shave. Not to mention the refills are quite expensive for something that is basically just lotion. Using this in the shower only made the shave worse as the hairs on my face swelled and were harder to cut by this already useless product. I only continued to use this because I don&#x27;t have enough time before work to wet shave and I didn&#x27;t have the money for anything else. The battery finally just stopped holding a charge after 9 months and I was so happy to be rid of it. I bought a Braun Pocket Go [[ASIN:B00022K48E Braun 370- Pocket Go battery operated electric shaver.]] and was so happy with it that when I had the means I went ahead and bought Brauns top of the line 9595 Pulsonic [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD Screen]] and it provides me with the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ll never waste my money on another rotary shaver, especially not one from Norelco.</li>
            <li> I paid $100 or so for this item here at Amazon and after little more than a year the little plastic clip head keeps coming off and the whole razor head assembly falls off! My husband and I are really disaapointed with the cheap parts this razor assembly head is made of. Neither one of us can figure out why it won&#x27;t stay on...the metal wire clip on the inside doesn&#x27;t appear to be bent or broken, just refuses to stay on.     To clean it now we just leave the head closed or risk fighting it trying to get it back on. Takes forever to dry that way and doesn&#x27;t get very clean.    Yes, guys, my husband and I both use this razor! The women&#x27;s versions (foil type) of a leg shaver are horrible! I&#x27;d bet most women don&#x27;t use them because they don&#x27;t have forever to shave their legs! Women&#x27;s leg hair vs. men&#x27;s facial hair...not much difference.    Other than the cheaply made head assembly falling off, this shaver worked very well, except on longer hairs. If you repeatedly missed one and it gets longer than say 1/4 to 1/3 inch, be prepared to have it yanked out...painfully! My husband also noticed this when he got too close to his sideburns. Our advice: use the long hair attachment first.</li>
            <li> This review will be brief and I have two points to make: 1) my positive experience with it was such that it became the shaver of choice when it came time for to get one for my son, and 2) the packaging is out of control and potentially unsafe.  I bought this shaver in 2005 and have been so pleased with it, when it came time for my son to have a quality electric shaver the decision to go with this one for him was an easy one. He has sensitive skin, so it was important that the shaver not produce any irritation.  Going with the Cool Shaver a second time was an easy decision to make.  However, the one problem I have is that liberating the shaver from the packaging was a major project.  It took a full ten minutes with fresh blade in my utility knife to complete the task.  Why is this necessary?  Is Norelco risking any liability in utilizing this packaging?  Clearly, the shaver and parts cannot be accessed by simple unwrapping.  They must be surgically removed with a very sharp blade.  It there is a safer and simpler way to do this, instructions should be placed on an obvious place on the outside of the box.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;BR&gt;This will be my third Norelco wet/dry razor and I can tell you that I have used every kind of shaving cream/lotion with it.  I agree that only using the Nivea packets can really increase the total cost of the razor so I stopped with my first Norelco wet/dry razor and I have never had a problem.  I have used Gel, foam, and even bar soap at a hotel with the razor  to no ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> i too have only used this razor for two days and im already impressed. the last 2 or 3 electric razors ive bought, or had bought for me, i used for less than a month before throwing out. the lotion works great and gives me no irritation. i havent tried using shaving cream/gel or anything else with the razor yet, but hope that it works since the cartidges are small, and dont seem to last very long. as for the 8 hour charge time, unless your are the wolfman and need to shave 6 times a day, 8 hours between charges is fine with me.</li>
            <li> Well, let me first state that nothing outdoes a normal hand razor for a true clean-cut shave.  And so, if you&#x27;re like me, you may be looking to save a few bucks, so you&#x27;re considering an electric shaver.  If that&#x27;s the case, and you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice having a clean-cut shave for a quick and easy shave, then this is an ideal alternative outside of the following setbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  You will still have very very small stubs leftover, which may make you look like the Marlboro Man with his 5 &#x27;O&#x27;clock shadow.  Almost the same as shaving only in a downward motion with your hand razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Your sideburns will still need to be straightened by a hand razor, don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be maneuvering this thing in a straight line, to make a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  People who have sensitive necks need to be careful not to spend too much time on their necks, or you&#x27;ll go raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shaver for about a year.  I&#x27;ve used it with the lotion stuff, without, with shaving cream, or with simply just water and all work great.  Let me stress that this works fine for a daily shaver; for normal daily events.  But, be sure to shave every morning or else the Marlboro Man will quickly turn into the Neanderthal man.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd electric shaver and so far it seems to be the best. I&#x27;ve tried the Remington Microscreen (don&#x27;t bother unless you are a masochist) and the  Norelco 715 corded shaver (also a good product if you dry shave). Over the years however, I&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of shaving in the shower with a disposable razor due to the speed and convenience. Fortunately I received this Norelco shaver for Christmas and it offers the best of both worlds. I find that the shave I get is nearly as good as with a blade and with little or no irritation. The instructions claim that it can take several weeks for your skin to become acclimated to this shaver, but I had good results right from the start. The 3-blade rotary design is good for getting tight under the nose (something that my microscreen simply could not do). Clean-up is also easy - just run it under the shower head and you&#x27;re all set. So far I&#x27;ve gotten about a half dozen shaves out of it with the initial charge, so it seems to hold a charge well. &lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars instead of 5? Well it isn&#x27;t perfect  - I find the shave lotion packs that come with it to be more of a gimmick than anything else. The stuff does work, but I get the same results from lathering my face with a moisturizing bar soap (and the cost is substantially less). Also the lotion pack takes the place of where the pop-up trimmer would normally go which brings me to my second  gripe - The trimmer that comes with the shaver must be assembled on for each use. This involves removing the shaver head and replacing it with the trimmer head. Not a major undertaking, but cumbersome enough that I probably will rarely use the trimmer (I just touch up the side-burns with a blade when necessary). Overall, if you can live with the trimmer issue, this is a very good product at a fair price. There are fancier electric shavers out there, but I doubt that you&#x27;ll get a better shave from an electric no matter how much you spend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of an old school shaver because previous electric razors I&#x27;ve owned just didn&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended). However I was really getting tired of lathering up every day and getting razor burn, but the Mach 3 did it&#x27;s job. Then I ran into the Norelco 7735X with goo (remember the commmercials?). This thing is just amazing; apply the gel or lotion as you shave and it makes an amazing difference in how close of a shave you get. You can even use it while showering, which is always a plus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My one big gripe is charging time..... 8 hours? Plus the refill cartridges for the Cool Skin are not cheap, 4 for 5 or 6 dollars. All in all I highly recommend this shaver and if you search online you can find a refurbished one for half the price, which is what I did and you can&#x27;t even tell that it was a refurb.</li>
            <li> Newer design which has corrected a few design faults experienced with previous model. &lt;br /&gt; Good shave etc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for almost two years now and love it.  I&#x27;ll never go back to a blade.  It takes some getting used to and practice, especially when shaving your neck, but once you get it down, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also don&#x27;t need to buy the Nivea replacement packs.  I use regular shaving gel and it works perfectly.  I replaced the blades after about 18 months of use and it&#x27;s like have a brand new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated like it does with a blade, even if I have to shave twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean and take care of too.  Being able to use it in the shower and just rinse it off is a real time saver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the performance of this shaver.  It&#x27;s quick, comfortable and shaves closer than my previous shavers.  I use it almost exclusively \\&quot;wet\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Call me a skeptic, but I&#x27;ve been using it with standard shaving gel for a couple of years now without issue.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything particularly special about the contents of the expensive little packets, though they are very convenient for traveling, which I do frequently with this product.  The charging stand is awkward to pack, but it works with a variety of electrical configurations internationally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is somewhat inconvenient to use, as the shaver head must be detached, unlike my previous shaver which had a trimmer which flipped out and didn&#x27;t require any removal or reattachment.  I rarely use it, though, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used.  I have owned Braun and Remington before and neither shaves nearly as close as the Norelco.  The flexibility to use it either wet or dry is great and the Nivea Cool Skin lotion and gel make shaving much more comfortable.  It is also very easy to clean.  You just push a button and the heads pop up so you can rinse then off.</li>
            <li> This razor is great. I have used it both out of the shower and in.  It works good in both settings.  I like it better than the mach 3 because with the cool skin i can go against the grain and with my razor i could never do that.  Now my face is really smooth.</li>
            <li> I just loved this shaver. I have used electric shavers for the last 10 years, and my skin has never been so soft. I think that&#x27;s because of the possibility of shaving in the shower... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the charger is a bit bulky to carry, but the battery lasts so long that I never have to take it with me &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great product, AAAA+++++</li>
            <li> After a year and a half of using this rather dull shaver... it dies on me... No way to replace the battery... you just get a new one.</li>
            <li> I like this razor very much. I am indeed getting blade-close shaves, but I think it is important to use the razor properly if you expect that close of a shave. I get the best results by pressing lightly against my face (despite my instinct to push harder to shave closer) and moving the head around somewhat slowly. I also get good results with the lotion when I have rinsed the head off with water. It dilutes the rather thick lotion and seems like it works better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As an industrial designer, I have a few minor issues with the product design. First, I agree with one of the reviews that the &#x27;goo&#x27; button is poorly placed. It takes a pause and two hands to operate the lotion dispenser. Second, the charger does not provide a positive stop or click or anything when the shaver is placed into it to charge... it kind of slides around in the charger ambiguously. Also, the manual recommends to unplug the charger after the charge is complete. I don&#x27;t know if battery performance is affected over time if you regularly leave it plugged in over the weekend, but I don&#x27;t want to have to think about it. It doesn&#x27;t seem too hard to include circuitry which makes unplugging unnecessary. Third (fourth?) the colors/materials choices are a little fruity for my taste. I think mine is different from the Amazon image. It has a fair amount of fluorescent yellow, and the super glossy, irridescent housing looks like a pair of vinyl rave pants. Maybe at 30 I&#x27;m too old for this shaver&#x27;s demographic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product, and I got a $20 rebate from Norelco.</li>
            <li> I actually have the Norelco 7737x (exact same as the 7735x, but a longer battery life). The reviews I read here gave me a pretty accurate perspective, so I was not at all disappointed in the razor. Yes, it is a little complicated to remove the blade Assembly (pop it up, then pull them straight up). Yes, the lotion dispensing button is a tiny bit challenging to operate (I just use my index finger and it isn&#x27;t that much of a problem). Yes, you end up taking longer showers (but hey, it feels good :)). However, despite all that, this is an amazing razor. Before I got the Norelco, I was using a Remington 950. What a difference! Before, I used to get all this reddish irritation under my neck, even after using the product for over a year! I also used a Mach 3 whenever I wanted a really nice shave. This shaver out-performs them both. It is so easy to use, and the Nivea really does make a difference. I prefer to use the shaving lotion, it is just more comfortable for me, but the gel isn&#x27;t bad either. I fully expected to use up my pack after one week, but my first lotion pack lasted for 17 straight days of shaving! (About 6 pumps per shave). I have had the razor for 21 days now and the first time I recharged it was yesterday! The battery wasn&#x27;t even low! About shave quality - it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close as my Mach 3, but it comes really close - especially with the lotion. My skin feels very smooth, even going against the grain. However, you definitly do get a shadow by the end of the day. Another plus, I have almost NO redness after my shaves, a welcome surprise after the Reminton. Bottom line: I HIGHLY recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had a difficult time getting a close shave and a shave with minimal irritation.  I&#x27;ve tried several of the Mach 3 variants with little success.  Against or with the grain the Mach 3 would miss random places on my throat (especially around the adam&#x27;s apple).  I quit the Mach 3 even though the shave was otherwise close because the irriation it left made me unable to make a second pass.  My Norelco Reflex Action series left me high and dry.  That&#x27;s right, it didn&#x27;t cut anywhere and left me burnt all over.  Most days it looked like I didn&#x27;t even shave.      Angered over years of horrible shaving, I decided I would treat myself for my birthday.  I was seriously considering Brauns and Panasonic&#x27;s high end razors but decided against it because there was no clearly outlined guarantee if it didn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like.  Norelco on the other had advertises their&#x27;s quite well and after reading a few reviews, I decided (...) I would take the plunge.      Here is my take after using a dry electric shaver for the past 2 years plus a weeks experience with the 7735x:    Pros:  1. Gets darn close for an electric.  Not quite Mach3 but more then satisfactory.  It does miss a bit around the adam&#x27;s apple but nothing I can&#x27;t live with.  2. Leaves me with almost no irritation.  In fact, I can shave 3 times a day with this thing if I feel like it!  Very impressed on the combination of closeness and lack of irritation.  3. Very easy clean up - just run under hot water.  4. Nivea lotion packs are easy to load and administer while shaving.  They also really contribute to the feel of the shave.  5. The shaver itself is well built and sturdy.  6. Quiet.    Cons:  1. Cost-Cutting abound!!  2. Cheap charging unit that does not automatically shut off after full charge is reached!  3. Ni-Cad batteries.   4. Cheap Strap for letting the shaver hang out and dry.  5. Cheap/useless carrying case.  6. The shaver&#x27;s \\&quot;cap\\&quot; falls off too easily.  7. Norelco recommends you run the shaver toempty before recharging.  This can be a big problem if the battery runs dry and you need to shave - there&#x27;s no way to plug the shaver into the wall and use it.  8. I can&#x27;t for the life of me (and after reading the instructions 5 times) figure out how to get the shaving head off to put the trimmer attachment on.     Despite its near endless line of drawbacks, you do get a good shave with the 7735x.  I couldn&#x27;t stop rubbing my neck and face after the first shave (and it seems the shave gets better the more I use it).  Oh yeah and the shocking part, I look forward to getting up at 6am just to shave! Yeah!</li>
            <li> This shaver provides shaving that is almost as close as a blade but at much more comfort. If you have a sensitive skin or you get some irritation or bleeding when you use a blade, this shaver is your choice.</li>
            <li> My first review on Amazon, despite shopping online for many years.  I used a shaver during my early teens and found it was very patchy and left my face raw with shaver burn.  I then resorted to Mach III razors for 10 years.  Although the shave was extremely close, due to my paper like skin i was only able to shave once or twice a week.  I have a heavy beared that grows very fast, which left me looking untidy. &lt;br /&gt;Whilst out in the states last month, i finally decided to try a shaver again.  I am extremely pleased with this Norelco.  I use it in the shower every day and get a very good shave ( all most as good as the blade ).  I also get zero razor burn or rash.  For the first time since pre teen i have a smooth face every day! My sking feels great -  I&#x27;m mightely pleased. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It struggles with my neck hairs, i still tidy these up with the mach III. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The supplied lotion is excellent and definately stops irritation.  Shame you can&#x27;t buy it in the shops.  I have had nearly as good results using Nivea Aftershave Balm Sensitive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8 hour charge time is excessive and inconvenient.  In order to remain waterproof,  you can&#x27;t use the shave whilst plugged in.  I can live with this though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. 4.5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I used to use a $20 rotary electric I bought from Wal-Mart, but after getting red-neck after every shave, I finally decided to upgrade.  This shaver gets extremely close... similar, if not exactly like a Mach 3 Turbo shave.  My neck still gets irritated, but I&#x27;m not going to blame that on the razor, but rather my own physiology.  Besides, I haven&#x27;t tried this one shaving gel I&#x27;ve heard about that&#x27;s supposed to completely snuff out irritation.  It&#x27;s called Coochy Cream and it&#x27;s designed for... well, you can probaby guess, so I&#x27;ve heard it makes for a really irritation-free shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor deserves a 5-star average.  Every customer review I read that was less than 5 stars was because of stupid reasons... like the lotion button being placed strangely, an 8 hour charging time, or that it feels cheap.  The lotion button is fine.  Why should it matter if it feels cheap?  Isn&#x27;t the shave what counts?  And I don&#x27;t mind an 8-hour charging time, since even if I shave every day, there are at least 18 hours between my shaves.  I wonder if the 8-hour charging time is too long because the one customer was letting his friends use it or something.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this is a five-star razor.  If you buy it and aren&#x27;t satisfied, that&#x27;s fine, but please don&#x27;t give it unwarranted reviews based on really miniscule details.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Wet Shaver. So, yes, I like the product. Here&#x27;s my rundown: &lt;br /&gt;Pluses: &lt;br /&gt;  - Good shave &lt;br /&gt;  - Less razor burn &lt;br /&gt;  - lot easier to insert packets (compared to my older model) &lt;br /&gt;  - easy to clean &lt;br /&gt;Minuses: &lt;br /&gt;  - Hard to get that \\&quot;patch\\&quot; under your nose &lt;br /&gt;  - Have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns straight &lt;br /&gt;  - battery/power seem to wane at times &lt;br /&gt;  - packets are expensive &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a cheap SOB, so here&#x27;s my way of stretching out the life of the packets. Wet your face first with hot water, rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion. Do a first pass shave. Rinse the shaver and do a second pass without the lotion with a wet face/shaver. Keep a blade on-hand to get the under-the-nose patch and your sideburns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All-in-all doner likes.</li>
            <li> It does the trick. They say you need to try it for 3 weeks for your skin to adjust but it worked real fine for me right out of the box. And also the nivea stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the similar model 7745X. It appears the only difference is that the 7745X has a travel pouch and indicator lights.    I bought this shaver because I was getting nicks several times every week when using the Mach3 / Mach3 Turbo blades. This shaver has addressed that problem, introduced another, and has not eliminated the need for blades.    The shaver does a decent job of shaving the hair off of my cheeks, mustache, and chin. Nowhere near as close as a blade, but nearly good enough (see below). The main problem is when I try to shave hair near my Adam&#x27;s apple. I consistently end up with red abrasions that last most of the day.    In addition, the design of the shaver makes it unrealistic to shave sideburns. You&#x27;d have to disconnect the heads, connect a straight edge (which connects differently than the other heads), shave, and then re-assemble for storage.    My solution: Shave with this shaver. Then follow up with the Mach3 / Mach3 Turbo blades. This way, I can do the sideburns and Adam&#x27;s apple area. I can also \\&quot;re-do\\&quot; the other areas for a closer shave, and for whatever reason, when I do it this way, I don&#x27;t get nicked.    Other positives: I really like being able to use it in the shower and wash it by placing it in the streaming water. The battery lasts a long time (at least 2 weeks), and the battery indicator is helpful as well.    The lotion dispenser is an interesting gimmick, but I find it totally unnecessary. It doesn&#x27;t place lubrication on the heads; it just goes on your face, which then makes contact with the heads. Easier just to put something (like soap) on your face, and then use it.</li>
            <li> I started using the shaver a month back. I haven&#x27;t tried while taking the shower. I felt the following thing i found with my short span of use: &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;1). Usually lot of shavers generates heat while shaving. But this one i did felt not much heating happening while shaving. &lt;br /&gt;2). It is very easy of using this shaver. &lt;br /&gt;3). It has better grip to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;1). Lot of irritation after every shave. Not sure all shavers have the same problem. &lt;br /&gt;2). Some times i can see lot of hars un shaved on the neck, so u need to re-shave again and again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall i satisfied with this shaver. Much better than the Remington Titanium shaver i had before.</li>
            <li> As other users with sensitive skin can attest to, this electric razor works wonders for those of us who can&#x27;t use disposable blades on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve had my Cool Skin now for over three years and have gotten the best shaves of my life WITHOUT using disposables. I have kept good care of it, kept it clean, replaced the heads every year, and it still works wonders. The only time I touch the disposables is to touch-up the sideburn areas near my upper ears and hairline. Disposables never see my neck or face due to my Cool Skin doing the job.    Some tips for those with sensitive skin: I don&#x27;t use the lotion packets. I use Noxema Sensitive Skin shave cream and it works even better. Just don&#x27;t apply a heavy layer to the face so the shaver can do its job effectively. I also use a pre-shave scrub by Clinique to get the dead skin off before each shave. Usually, dead skin is the reason we have the bumps, scrapes, cuts, burns, etc.     I would recommend this shaver to anyone, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ve been using this shaver for more than 3 months. Everything is good so far..    The plastic strap is useful to secure the shaver to your hand in the shower.  Battery life is as advertised   The recharger is heavier and more stable than Philips Norelco 9160XL SmartTouch-XL Men&#x27;s Shaver.</li>
            <li> You absolutely get your money&#x27;s worth. It has changed my shaving nightmare into pleasure. Thank you Philips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of other electric shavers, but this one is my favorite so far.  Using it in the shower really helps take away the irritation of shaving.  I also like the Nivea dispenser.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the replacement cartridges are expensive, but think they are worth it.  I didn&#x27;t find the dispensing button oddly placed or difficult to use.  I can use it with one hand.  It&#x27;s easy to clean up too.  You just pop the top open in the shower and rinse it out.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed an issue with the battery life.  I travel a lot for my job and it lasts for the week trip.  I don&#x27;t even take the charger unless it is a longer trip.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  It is now about 5 1/2 years later, 08/13/2011.  I&#x27;ve never had one problem with this razor.  Same battery, same cutter heads and works perfectly.    UPDATE:  It is now about 3 years later, 01/13/2009, and still never a problem with this great razor.    This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I am amazed at how extremely well it performs and for what I thought was a quite reasonable price.    Every place I look this razor gets great reviews. Cleaning it is a breeze, just hold it under water. And it can be used in the shower! It&#x27;s not as heavy as my old Norelco from the early eighties, but actually I like the light weight of this one. I also find it easy to hold and the heads simply glide over my face. I am just absolutely amazed at how well it shaves.    I also really like the built in dispenser for the Nivea shaving gel, but I find the refills pretty pricey. I tried Williams Lectric Shave Gel, and it works about as well and is a lot cheaper. I&#x27;m also planning to try a regular can of Nivea Shave Gel which is a lot cheaper than the cartridges and some have said works even better.    I&#x27;ve used the trimmer several times and I found it rather easy to snap on, and I found it worked quite well.    All in all, I give this razor my highest rating.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco 6800 series shaver before this one, and it did great for me. However, my wife wanted to use it ... and I made her promise to let me buy a new \\&quot;good shaver\\&quot; if she took my &#x27;old reliable&#x27;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I bought this shaver. I have always been intrigued by the idea of a wet shave, since shaving &#x27;wet&#x27; always shaves better.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver delivers on the promise and it does it extremely well. I use it with shave gel, and it gets closer and cleaner than any foil shaver or any other electric I have EVER used. That&#x27;s saying a lot, since I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind out there that there is to try, starting WAY back when Norelco only made the two-head shaver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A big Plus to this shaver is that you can rinse it out right away and hang it up with the little strap provided. It hangs head down, and it dries out just fine between shaves for me. The stand they provide with it doesn&#x27;t make you fiddle about with the strap to disconnect it; rather it just drops into the charging stand to recharge.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To say I&#x27;m happy with this shaver is to understate it. I have MUCH less of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and I am very happy with the way I look when I leave for work. To me, clean and neat is professional, and this shaver enhances the look.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend who keeps a shaved head as well as face and he loves it. Also was thrilled about the convertible electrical setup, being that he&#x27;s overseas. I&#x27;m having a hard time finding the gel packs in local stores (target, etc) but other then that, no complaints. He said it&#x27;s a great shave!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband just under a year ago (and might I add it was about $35 less back then too, how dare they increase the price for the same older product?) and he loved it. He used it to shave his beard everyday and had a close enough shave to make both myself and his Air Force career happy. The only problem is that the battery charger will not charge the battery any longer, and obviously he can&#x27;t use it without the battery. The charger will not even register that the shaver is on there anymore and it has been well cared for. Such a shame. I can&#x27;t find a replacement charger, so it looks like it&#x27;s back to the old three blade disposable razor and cream for us. I can&#x27;t afford to spend $100 for something that won&#x27;t last even a year when $4 pack of disposables lasts him two months. Very dissapointed with the quality of this product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great razor with smooth, clean results almost as close as a regular razor, but there is a slight difference and someone who has fast growth and/or a coarse beard may have to shave more often. The main advantage is that it is a lot quicker and can be used in or out of the shower. But if you want something that will last longer than 10 months, be wary of this product.</li>
            <li> I always had great luck with the norelco shavers and this one is no differnt. Close shave, easy to clean and I can use it in the shower. I recommend this saver to anyone who is sick of using disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Really a bad shaver.  Does not get the job done plus the heads dull quickly therefore buy another product not norelco.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend after he ineptly and regularly cut himself with other models. While the lotion feature seems neat, the button is, in my opinion, poorly positioned and the replacement packets seem over-priced. I&#x27;d recommend just using normal shaving gel. What&#x27;s cool about this shaver is that you can take it in the shower, a feature commonly found on chick electric shavers but not on men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor--it&#x27;s great to be able to use an electic razor in the shower.  I don&#x27;t know what that one reviewer was talking about--you don&#x27;t need two hands to dispence the lotion, nor do you have stop shaving to dispense.  Just dispense as you go as needed--this is of course assuming you have opposable thumbs.  The only problem, in my mind, is that the cord doesn&#x27;t plug directly into the razor.  Instead it plugs into a charging station.  As another reviewer already stated, this isn&#x27;t the most convenient design--yet another thing to lug with you when you travel.  But worse, is that should the charge run out (and why didn&#x27;t the engineers imagine that) you are stuck until it recharges.  Had the plug gone directly to the razor, you&#x27;d still be able to shave--though probably not in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for about three months and I think it is a good product overall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forget what Norelco says. I am a former Gillette MACH 3 user and this shaver will not shave as close as it the blade did. If you cannot stand anything less than a blade, this product is not for you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On other hand, one will face fewer cuts when compared to the old fashioned way, which is the actual reason why I kept it. In the long run, the skin gets a bit smoother also. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried using it with shaving creams other than those compatible with the unit, with no luck. My advice is to stick to the Norelco HQ170 Cool Skin Nivea for Men Lotion Replacement Cartridge. You will see far superior results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want to save some time every morning, avoid cuts, and have a shaver that works well in the shower, this product is an excellent option.</li>
            <li> I like this machine, but getting spares for the lotion/gel is nigh on impossible unless you are willing to pay shipping to buy it on the net.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will go back to wet shaving when I run out of spares, $100+ bucks wasted.</li>
            <li> The floating head design gives such a close, comfortable shave that I do not always apply the cool skin additive.  The additive definitely helps, but does require a bit of extra work to clean up periodicaly. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i got this as a present about 5 years ago very nice shave especially in the shower with Nivea shaving lotion packets.</li>
            <li> I bought the model 7735x and was not ver happy with this model.  Loved the previous generation that was made 2 years before this.  The attachment was poor quality. The shaver head has a yellow rubber piece that keeps the flip spring in place, once the yellow rubber piece falls out and the spring pops out, you&#x27;ll having nothing but trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I has not happy with my shaver and sent back to Norelco for repair since I live overseas, they sent me a check for $80.00, this model sells here for $99.95? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like using the shaver in the shower and I will spend the extra money to get the next better Norelco shaver, the reviews seem a little better.  Norelco has always gave a good shave, but the quality of the shavers are not as they once were.</li>
            <li> As someone with very sensitive skin, I have always had problems with razor burn after shaving. Dry electric shavers tend to butcher my skin.  Traditional multi-blade razors (like the Mach 3) are easier on my skin, but as sensitive as my skin is, cuts are not uncommon.  A few months ago I received a Norelco 7735X Cool Skin Additive In/Out of Shower Shaver as a gift and gave it a try.  Thanks to the shaving gel that can be applied to the skin at the touch of a button while shaving, it provides a very close shave that doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like a traditional razor, and there&#x27;s very little skin irritation afterwards.  As for closeness, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s almost as good as a Mach 3 razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One aspect about this shaver that I like is that it operates from a rechargeable battery so that there&#x27;s no electric cord to get in the way while shaving.  Also, the shaving gel packets are easy to replace, it comes with a charger stand, it&#x27;s easy to clean the rotating blades and it takes up little bathroom counter space.  Further, it takes less time to shave and clean-up afterwards than with a traditional razor &amp; shaving cream. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I regard the Norelco 7735X Cool Skin Additive In/Out of Shower Shaver as a very good shaver and rate it with 5 out of 5 stars.  Granted, it is somewhat expensive, but if you have very sensitive skin like me, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was with its performance.</li>
            <li> Pros: &lt;br /&gt;1.  Good shave, after break in period.  Not the best I&#x27;ve had for my skin/beard type.  Several passes were needed for my beard which is course.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:   &lt;br /&gt;1.  Like other users&#x27; complaints about the hinge design, the flip up mechanism is highly fragile.  I wish I sent it back to Norelco, instead I threw into the trash can I was so angry!  Imagine yourself on a stressful business trip having to contend with this kind of junk! &lt;br /&gt;2.  The Cool Skin additive is not worth it.  Just buy yourself a beard cream from Jack Black or Kiehl&#x27;s and get more for your money and better product.  It&#x27;s delivery system of the additive squirts near the blades, so you end up needing to spread it around with your shaver heads. &lt;br /&gt;3.  The trimmer is a hassle to put on if you&#x27;re looking for a speedy morning shave. Other brands/models have a flip up design, which I thought every shaver had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for a long time now.  Mainly because my face is too sensitive to shave with a blade.  The Norelco 7735x gives a decent shave, but not one that you are going to get really close, especially if you want to do a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave.  Using the gel or lotion really helps out.  I found that the lotion works better.  Shaving in the shower with the lotion gives the best results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver is quieter than other shavers (especially the Braun), but seems to be much slower so shaving takes a good bit longer.  The triple blades make it difficult to get under above your lip and I seem to have to get a disposible razor to get right under the nose.  It did take about 2 weeks to get a fairly close shave. Overall, not a bad shave considering I paid about $35 for a reconditioned one.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest shelling out more than that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good:  Price, Lotion Attachment, Noise, Size of Base (small) &lt;br /&gt;Not so Good:  Closeness of shave, Hard to shave in small areas</li>
            <li> If you have course facial hair as I do this will not work for you either. I find it takes just as long to use it as it does to shave with a razor and don&#x27;t gat as clean of a shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great! I don&#x27;t keep a beard, but my facial hair grows (as it tends to with most guys). I used to have an electric Braun foil shaver, but it never made the close shave like this one does. For those of you concerned about the extra cost of the gel packs, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that. The gel/shaving cream is mostly for people with very sensitive skin, and you could probably just use soap lather. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;-Very Close Shave. The best. I wouldn&#x27;t trade this back for my old Braun Shaver. &lt;br /&gt;-Can be used in the shower. &lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to clean - just put it under running water. &lt;br /&gt;-Sleak design &lt;br /&gt;-Optional lotion dispenser, in case you have sensitive skin. &lt;br /&gt;-Price - I got mine refurbished for $40, and it works perfectly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;-Charging base - when you go to charge the shaver, you just put it in the included charging base. There is no &#x27;click&#x27; when you put the shaver in, so it&#x27;s not all that secure. It only displays a charging light. &lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t display how much charge is left (ie: minutes left). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the pros greatly outway the cons, and I HIGHLY recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Nice close shave, battery lasts very long time in between charges.  Easy to clean after using.  He  uses with a similar consistency moisturizer instead of the little packets, saving the packets for travel only, works great.</li>
            <li> Had the earlier version for years. This one&#x27;s even better. Hang it in the shower and charge it overnight about once every 6 weeks! (Seriously, bought this first of September and still on first battery charge October 21.) Let it run all the way down before you recharge, then don&#x27;t leave it in longer than 8 hours overnight. I&#x27;ll never shave over the sink again. Save time and clean up time, too. Spend the money to buy it at Amazon. Don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; from off suppliers. I tried and waited 4 weeks. Cancelled the order, then bought at Amazon, got it in 3 days regular free shipping!!</li>
