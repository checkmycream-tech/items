            <li> This nail polish lasts up to the two weeks!  I am thoroughly impressed!  I have tried another color too and it works great too! Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> On my toes and it still looks like I just did it. Use the product as directed but I have the Sally Hansen UV LED light and it works great. adjust timing to mach this product&#x3D;2 30 second hits to cure the polish and I double the time on the final clear coat (2x30 seconds) and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This is my only gel polish that will chip within days of painting them. And when I put it under the led lamp it looks different than other gel polishes...</li>

            <li> I always get the shellac at the nail salon, and this stuff is just as good!  I was kind of skeptical with the mixed reviews at first but I LOVE it.  I got some for Christmas and now I keep buying more colors.</li>

            <li> My manicure always seem to last exactly ten days. But it doesn&#x27;t bother so much that I don&#x27;t get an extra four days like the box says becuase I will get bored with wearing the same color for too long. This is a really pretty, and vibrant pink.</li>
            <li> Love the system! This pink is really bright and pretty. It does on perfectly. I like this color better than the pink daisy color. Pink daisy seems muddier.</li>

            <li> This polish retails for a much higher price than I was able to get it here. It is the same product as is sold in stores and I have had great success with this brand.</li>
