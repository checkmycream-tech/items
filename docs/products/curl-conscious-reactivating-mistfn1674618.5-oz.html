            <li>This product makes your hair smell really good.  </li>
            <li>The reactivating mist is good to use to hold the curl</li>
            <li>So, Bumble and Bumble has created a spray that gently wets the hair, relaxes the curl, allows painless combing, smells good, and hair recurls beautifully as it dries.  </li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I felt that it didn&#x27;t do much refreshing</li>
            <li>If you already have curly hair you are going to looove this product, it doesn&#x27;t make it more curly but rather defines the curl and keeps it refreshed.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail quickly and I love this product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping good price.</li>
            <li>Easy on the hair, manageable, and easy to use, with</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for women who have permanents and want to give their curls a little pizazz as the perm starts wearing out.</li>
            <li>This mist is amazing and really does rejuvinate curls.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, no chemical smell here, and lifts the curls back into \\&quot;just permed\\&quot; state.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and worth the money for girls with naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>Its great for mid day touch ups or right before you go out at night.</li>
            <li>I have bone straight hair and have permed it most of my life.  </li>
            <li>It takes bed head and turns it into a beautiful mop of curls in less than a minute.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and it super easy to use and definitely works better at taming my curls than other products.</li>
            <li>I really really recommend it!!</li>
            <li>it is magic for my hair!It revitalize them as no other product</li>
            <li>Smells good and adds professional look for my daily life.</li>
            <li>If you have a naturally curly-haired toddler, you learn two things very quickly: you can&#x27;t comb curly hair when it is dry and curly hair has to be combed every morning (the original case of bedhead).  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product would work but its just hair spray</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair REALLY dry,hard and crispy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really damaged curly hair.</li>
            <li>Plus it really does reactivate my curls.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much of it to get the curl going.</li>
            <li>a pleasingly light fragrance, &#x27;Curled Up Reactivating Mis&#x27; is exactly what your looking for when wishing to carefully maintain your curl.  </li>
            <li>At last, after so many years, a product has come out that truly does take care of enhancing curls while leaving your hair silky enough to comb through.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had more of a tight hold like their cream.</li>
            <li>and my hair has improved so much since using lush products.</li>
            <li>Once dried, you&#x27;ll be able to style, or even comb your hair without sticky knots.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t suggest to use as a day 2 or 3 product just because you don&#x27;t want to use your normal gel.</li>
            <li>Without saturating the hair of stiffening it into contorted shapes, Reactivating Mist coats hair with a delicate, lightly scented spray that, when scrunched, aids the hair to return to it&#x27;s freshly curled state.  </li>
            <li>The curls are soft - not stiff.</li>
            <li>I never thought of myself as having \\&quot;curly\\&quot; hair but this product brought out my natural waves and believe it or not... curls.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>There is no other product like it!</li>
            <li>And im currently only using natural products and washing my hair every four days.</li>

            <li> I wander if I can gat a refund for this, I&#x27;m surprised that Amazon even sales fake products , because I&#x27;ve been ordering from them since they first started and this has never happend to me before.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this product tames frizz really well.  </li>

            <li> but you must use very little at a time or it makes the hair feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> Bumble&amp;bumble products sold here seem simply fake.</li>

            <li> I love the reactivating mist.  This mist is amazing and really does rejuvinate curls.  I use this on my wet hair and it keeps the frizz out and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy.  I also use it to liven up my curls before I go out or in the morning if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair. I can&#x27;t speak enough about this product.</li>
            <li> If you have a naturally curly-haired toddler, you learn two things very quickly: you can&#x27;t comb curly hair when it is dry and curly hair has to be combed every morning (the original case of bedhead).  So, Bumble and Bumble has created a spray that gently wets the hair, relaxes the curl, allows painless combing, smells good, and hair recurls beautifully as it dries.  Hint: I comb my granddaughter&#x27;s hair while she&#x27;s eating breakfast.  She&#x27;s occupied and her hair dries by the time we have to leave for school.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for women who have permanents and want to give their curls a little pizazz as the perm starts wearing out.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product on Amazon, but lo..! it is an imposer.It left my hair stiff and sticky and real B&amp;B product usually leaves my hair shiny and silky soft and never sticky. I wander if I can gat a refund for this, I&#x27;m surprised that Amazon even sales fake products , because I&#x27;ve been ordering from them since they first started and this has never happend to me before. Bumble&amp;bumble products sold here seem simply fake. Don&#x27;t waste your money and go to the salon.</li>
            <li> It helps liven up my curls, and calms down frizz.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to tame the frizz with my wild mane and get my waves to \\&quot;wake up\\&quot;! Its great for mid day touch ups or right before you go out at night. I wish it had more of a tight hold like their cream. But it did what it said it would and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I never thought of myself as having \\&quot;curly\\&quot; hair but this product brought out my natural waves and believe it or not... curls. Now all I have to do is wake up, take a shower, spray this in my hair and I am good to go. The only thing I wish was different is... the price. I bought it with a gift card I recieved for my birthday but when it runs out... who knows. I will definitely be torn.</li>
            <li> it is magic for my hair!It revitalize them as no other product</li>
            <li> This curl spray works better than any others I&#x27;ve tried. Instantly brings my curls back to life and adds volume to limp hair. After trying other curl sprays, I went back to this because none of the others compared. And it smells great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what magic is in this bottle. Its a little pricey but it works so well with getting gunky.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quickly and I love this product!</li>
            <li> I was just considering this product at my hair salon yesterday, where the retail price is $25. (And they have coupons for 20% off!) I believe Sephora also sells it for $25. So where does this vendor get off selling the re-activating mist for this inflated price?</li>
            <li> Smells good and adds professional look for my daily life.</li>
            <li> i like this as it works better, for curly hair, than hair spray.</li>
            <li> Smells good and worth the money for girls with naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have bone straight hair and have permed it most of my life.  At last, after so many years, a product has come out that truly does take care of enhancing curls while leaving your hair silky enough to comb through.  It smells great, no chemical smell here, and lifts the curls back into \\&quot;just permed\\&quot; state.  Without saturating the hair of stiffening it into contorted shapes, Reactivating Mist coats hair with a delicate, lightly scented spray that, when scrunched, aids the hair to return to it&#x27;s freshly curled state.  Once dried, you&#x27;ll be able to style, or even comb your hair without sticky knots.  Easy on the hair, manageable, and easy to use, with a pleasingly light fragrance, &#x27;Curled Up Reactivating Mis&#x27; is exactly what your looking for when wishing to carefully maintain your curl.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product would work but its just hair spray and it made my hair frizzy. Leaves your hair REALLY dry,hard and crispy. I washed my hair and my hair still felt off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really damaged curly hair. And im currently only using natural products and washing my hair every four days. and my hair has improved so much since using lush products. BUT i still needed something for the days in between wash and I heard great things about this product. I dont know if its just my hair thats not use to those chemicals but long story short my hair wasnt happy and neither was I.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend.  Makes my hair TOO soft and it loses the curl.  Will not be buying again.  Does smell really good, but that&#x27;s about all the *good* I can find with this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this on my 3a/b hair when it&#x27;s down. It makes my hair feel wiry and sticky. I do, however, use it if I just want to throw my hair in a pony tail and forget about it. It tames my hair just enough for it to work. But I don&#x27;t suggest to use as a day 2 or 3 product just because you don&#x27;t want to use your normal gel.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair.  This product awakens and revives the curls and waves and makes my life easier.  No need to use a hair dryer to get my hair looking good again.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair smell really good.  Plus it really does reactivate my curls.  I really really recommend it!!</li>
            <li> big name products but you must use very little at a time or it makes the hair feel sticky.  it was a great on line deal</li>
            <li> I get several days out out of a shampoo with this product, especially when combined with other B&amp;B products.</li>
            <li> I love this product - it makes my hair come to life. There are curls there I never knew I had. The curls are soft - not stiff. Very effective product and you don&#x27;t need much of it to get the curl going.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this product tames frizz really well.  For a bonus it smells great. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> It helps curl my hair without frizz.  I love this product. I have been using it for a long time. Fast shipping good price.</li>
            <li> Only product I use on my hair</li>
            <li> This product brought my curls back to life! Smells great and it super easy to use and definitely works better at taming my curls than other products.</li>
            <li> I have short curly hair.  I could not live without this product.  It takes bed head and turns it into a beautiful mop of curls in less than a minute.  There is no other product like it!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this to refresh my curls during the day. I felt that it didn&#x27;t do much refreshing and I almost feel like it made my curly hair frizzy. (3B curls)</li>
            <li> This spray weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> If you already have curly hair you are going to looove this product, it doesn&#x27;t make it more curly but rather defines the curl and keeps it refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I have tried numerous products. The reactivating mist is good to use to hold the curl</li>
