            <li>This stuff is worth its weight in gold!!</li>

            <li>This is the BEST product to use hands down if you want that stencil to stay put!!!</li>
            <li>Works great with heavy wiping.</li>
            <li>Definitely ordering more.</li>

            <li>Transfers really well if you use it correctly and the stencil stays on for pretty much the whole session.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use a lot to transfer either.</li>

            <li> Very long lasting</li>
            <li> either this product if a knock-off of the real deal, or this product sucks, my stencil faded within three wipes...</li>
            <li> If you while the area down with alcohol before applying the stencil the stencil will outlast the session</li>
            <li> after it dried over an hour.</li>

            <li> what can you say? This is the BEST product to use hands down if you want that stencil to stay put!!!</li>
            <li> Two wipes and its gone...after it dried over an hour. Tried it multiple times, many different ways...could have just melted a speed stick, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth its weight in gold!! I have had to let stay on for 20 minutes despite what the label says.. But that 20 mins is worth the wait, trust me!! It holds the stencil on with the strength of 100 men, does not wipe away!!! will definitely be ordering more !!!</li>
