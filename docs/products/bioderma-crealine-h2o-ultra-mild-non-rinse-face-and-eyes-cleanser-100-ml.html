            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I will grow to love it.</li>
            <li>In most of her videos she touts this as her go-to product for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>I now use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner, which works better as an overall toner, although this is great as a stand-alone makeup remover.</li>
            <li>After hearing so many positive things about this product, I was excited to finally be able to try it.  </li>
            <li>It is effective and extremely gentle on the skin and eye area.</li>
            <li>This one feels like water and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Completely worth it!</li>
            <li>I got a small container of this because so many people were raving about how great it was and wanted to give it a go for myself.</li>
            <li>it removes my makeup very well and doesn&#x27;t leave the oily residue like most makeup removers..</li>
            <li>I bought this on recommendation from a makeup artist and I love it so much.</li>

            <li>I first tried this sample size bottle, then when I knew that I really liked it, I went ahead and purchased the full size; I definitely recommend doing this first!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this gentile cleaner to do such an amazing job removing all my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Just leaves skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh.  </li>
            <li>Right now though, I do not feel like I will be purchasing it again.  </li>
            <li>You may have to use a couple of cleansing pads to really clean your face, but it still works very well.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it really gets everything off my face and makes it feel 100% clean.</li>
            <li>Works really well to clean everything off your skin without any harshness or irritation.  </li>
            <li>Super gentle</li>
            <li>and I have overly sensitive skin, can use this with no adverse reaction which is huge for me.</li>
            <li>After using it I can see why everyone seems to like it so much!</li>
            <li>I would definitely say I enjoyed using this product, but I do think it&#x27;s way overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li>I love this and ordered a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something simple, easy to use, keeps you feeling fresh, and don&#x27;t like most ingredients in regular face cleansers, then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>This did an amazing job of removing my makeup and left my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I really tend to love it just because it is so simple to use.</li>
            <li>You can see all of that dirt, grime, and sweat from the day (especially if you live in very warm/humid climates, you&#x27;ll love it)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to order another large bottle of this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really pricey to buy in the US</li>
            <li>Im a very strict person when comes to rate or review a product, so to me</li>
            <li>Im very picky with products that i use on my face, because im probe to acne.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle and really cleans my face well from the makeup I wear.</li>
            <li>I like this product and it seems to REALLY get everything off your face.</li>
            <li>I have really acne</li>
            <li>I have had adverse reactions to the gentle neutrogena wipes and most other so called &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but I have very sensitive skin that breaks out if I leave even the slightest trace.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I would say purchase only if you think it&#x27;s worth it to keep using.</li>
            <li>From my personal experience I&#x27;ve never had SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT to remove makeup from my face (so delicate skin).</li>
            <li>I am most definitely going to buy a bigger container when the one I have now runs low.</li>
            <li>Waterproof eyemakeup glides off effortlessly and it doesn&#x27;t strip natural oils!</li>
            <li>but if I add a little moisturizer afterwards it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of this product until I ran out and went back to my old eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It lets my skin so SOFT and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>My extremely sensitive</li>
            <li>prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Seems gentle and didn&#x27;t dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li>This removes waterproof mascara well AND does not irritate my extra sensitive skin or burn my eyes!</li>
            <li>Its a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>so even if it takes a few pads to get everything off, the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see if it is doing anything positive or negative.  </li>
            <li>Cleans makeup easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.</li>

            <li> It does leave me feeling a little bit dry</li>
            <li> Just not worth the $$.</li>
            <li> It takes all of my make-up off without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will not be repurchasing due to the fact that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s affordable as a makeup remover/toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to Lisa Eldrige&#x27;s Makeup videos.</li>

            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my face feels oily like other makeup remover, and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes ^_^</li>
            <li> tried it because of the you tube raves -it&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li> This stuff does NOT take off waterproof mascara. It is a total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really pricey to buy in the US but it is really great. It is effective and extremely gentle on the skin and eye area. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will probably repurchase but I am also trying to find a cheaper option.</li>
            <li> This works ok, but not as well as drugstore make up removers. I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> From my personal experience I&#x27;ve never had SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT to remove makeup from my face (so delicate skin). Im a very strict person when comes to rate or review a product, so to me THIS IS JUST AWESOME. It lets my skin so SOFT and hydrated. In other words I just LOVING IT!  SO GENTIL and accurate makeup remover!!!</li>
            <li> Just not worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I got a small container of this because so many people were raving about how great it was and wanted to give it a go for myself. After using it I can see why everyone seems to like it so much! It&#x27;s so soothing and refreshing. It takes all of my make-up off without irritating my sensitive skin. I love it! I am most definitely going to buy a bigger container when the one I have now runs low.</li>
            <li> Great product to remove makeup.  Not oily and does not leave any residue. No smell. Just leaves skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> this is great I loved this item . But reason why  It four stars is that I cnant find it in drugstore so that not god for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but Im going to continue using it.. it removes my makeup very well and doesn&#x27;t leave the oily residue like most makeup removers..</li>
            <li> Cleans makeup easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind. The opening of the container fits a Q-Tip perfectly, which is nice for removing makeup between your eyelashes. Seems gentle and didn&#x27;t dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li> was written in spanish. couldn&#x27;t read bottle.</li>
            <li> I have had adverse reactions to the gentle neutrogena wipes and most other so called &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; products. But this is superb. Super gentle and I have overly sensitive skin, can use this with no adverse reaction which is huge for me.</li>
            <li> A famous make up artist recommended this brand, and im so happy i tried it. Im very picky with products that i use on my face, because im probe to acne. But i have no problem with this product. Its a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this gentile cleaner to do such an amazing job removing all my makeup.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but I have very sensitive skin that breaks out if I leave even the slightest trace.  I still have to use a lotion-consistency eye makeup remover, but that is because I can&#x27;t rub around my eyes with a cotton pad/ball.  I use Bioderma H2O to remove most of my makeup, then a gentle eye makeup remover from Avon, rinse with a hot washcloth, and finish with a gentile moisturizer.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have! It removes eye makeup easily, and gently removes all of my makeup. I use it alone or before washing with my Clairsonic or weekly scrub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome!! I use it as a makeup remover &amp; a tissue-off cleanser because I have dry skin. The provider was also great; it came in about 3 days. I also recommend buying SW Basics cotton rounds because they&#x27;re reusable. :)</li>
            <li> This removes waterproof mascara well AND does not irritate my extra sensitive skin or burn my eyes!</li>
            <li> the size is best for travel. product result is good.</li>
            <li> Great makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and I think it&#x27;ll have a permanent spot in my cleansing regime. However, it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t do a great job in getting rid of the eyeliner. For everything else it&#x27;s awesome! Left my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This did an amazing job of removing my makeup and left my skin soft and hydrated. Definitely an item to repurchase!</li>
            <li> Good for the face, not for removing eye makeup. It burns your eyes. I love the fact that it is non-rinse on my face</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something simple, easy to use, keeps you feeling fresh, and don&#x27;t like most ingredients in regular face cleansers, then this is the product for you! I really tend to love it just because it is so simple to use. You may have to use a couple of cleansing pads to really clean your face, but it still works very well. You can see all of that dirt, grime, and sweat from the day (especially if you live in very warm/humid climates, you&#x27;ll love it) so even if it takes a few pads to get everything off, the end result is worth it. I first tried this sample size bottle, then when I knew that I really liked it, I went ahead and purchased the full size; I definitely recommend doing this first!</li>
            <li> I would definitely say I enjoyed using this product, but I do think it&#x27;s way overpriced for what it is. Unfortunately, I will not be repurchasing due to the fact that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s affordable as a makeup remover/toner. I now use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner, which works better as an overall toner, although this is great as a stand-alone makeup remover. I would say purchase only if you think it&#x27;s worth it to keep using.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest for eye makeup remover since Victoria Jackson cosmetics changed their formula . I don&#x27;t like creams, gels, or oily based removers . This one feels like water and is fragrance free. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and I only need to use one cottonball per eye. I love this and ordered a bigger bottle. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cap is hard to open.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cleanser for travel! Easy to use and very effective.  My extremely sensitive, rosacea face reacts well to this product.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover I have found!</li>
            <li> This product makes your makeup slide off like butter. I love it. Im ordering a bigger bottle next time. I recommend you order this small size first to try it out just in case you dont like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation from a makeup artist and I love it so much. it&#x27;s gentle and really cleans my face well from the makeup I wear. This is the only thing I will use from now on.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! No burning and takes everything off!!</li>
            <li> It is by far the best makeup remover I have used. Waterproof eyemakeup glides off effortlessly and it doesn&#x27;t strip natural oils!</li>
            <li> I like this product and it seems to REALLY get everything off your face. It does leave me feeling a little bit dry but if I add a little moisturizer afterwards it&#x27;s fine. I workout a lot and use this afterwards and I feel like it really gets everything off my face and makes it feel 100% clean.</li>
            <li> After hearing so many positive things about this product, I was excited to finally be able to try it.  It just feels like water (maybe its suppose to feel like this) on my face to be honest.  I can&#x27;t really see if it is doing anything positive or negative.  When it comes to taking off makeup, when I used it, I still had to use a baby wipe because it didn&#x27;t remove all the product.  However, I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long.  Maybe I will grow to love it. Right now though, I do not feel like I will be purchasing it again.  Especially not for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to Lisa Eldrige&#x27;s Makeup videos. In most of her videos she touts this as her go-to product for makeup removal. After so many positive reviews online and her very high recommendation, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely worth it! I&#x27;m getting ready to order another large bottle of this. A definite beauty essential!</li>
            <li> Works really well to clean everything off your skin without any harshness or irritation.  Even removes liquid lipstick!  Feels fresh.  Will definitely keep buying and using it.</li>
            <li> I have really acne prone, sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t think much of this product until I ran out and went back to my old eye makeup remover. Can&#x27;t wait until stores start carrying it in the USA.</li>
