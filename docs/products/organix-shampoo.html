    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I lather this creamy, milky shampoo into my hair, I forget I am standing in a freezing bathroom in Alaska and slip into a delicious fantasy of me bathing in a waterfall in Kauai!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is incredible!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best.    </li>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>Based on the information I read it seemed perfect.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome collection of products.</li>
            <li>(my hair is oily, it worked perfectly)</li>
            <li>I purchased these hair products believing that the fancy packaging would make them great shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I use a great conditioner from Aveda - one that has a coconut, grapefruit scent</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>And the smell is great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and works great!  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, my fiance noticed that my hair was smoother and said it smelled wonderful...</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a great shampoo i&#x27;ve tried so many.</li>
            <li>First, they smell delicious.</li>
            <li>and I have really fine, oily hair, but this product works great.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner was also nice.</li>
            <li>Of course, this isn&#x27;t a terribly warm climate, so I can&#x27;t attest for people in the south or what have you.    </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner made my hair look so healthy and so shiny.</li>
            <li>Anyway, love this product.</li>
            <li>I use the split end mender nightly and have been able to go longer between haircuts.    </li>
            <li>The smell is incredibly sexy too.  </li>
            <li>It also smells absolutely fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love to smell their hair after they&#x27;ve had their baths.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The conditioner was more moisturising</li>
            <li>My hair curls better, stays smoother, and also doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;poof</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, my sister (who doesn&#x27;t have curly hair) also used it while she was visiting and loved it.</li>
            <li>Since using the products my hair has been silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>The feel is just okay.</li>
            <li>more prone to static and tangles.</li>
            <li>My hair is colour treated and pretty beat up, so I&#x27;ve got to use good quality products to keep it at</li>
            <li>it makes my dry, brittle hair manageable, shiny and smelling great!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft, it smells great.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t that strong but you could pick up the scent if you hugged me or something.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful: it not only smells good, but I can actually tell a difference with my hair.  </li>
            <li>When I woke the next day hair still smelled and looked great.</li>
            <li>Today I tried it out for the first time and I am so completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Once I had rinsed out the conditioner (after leaving it in for 10 minutes or so) the softness of my hair was pretty good, but not that soft after getting all the product out.</li>
            <li>There are much safer and better choices out there for you and your family.</li>
            <li>the only thing good about this product was the smell.     </li>
            <li>I only bought this product because of the good reviews i got about the condition</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I read about the coconut milk split end mender in Lucky magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Inhaling the rich, sweet coconut milk scent of this shampoo reminds ms of a splendid, sunny day I spent on Waikiki, slathering Hawaiian Tropics all over my skin and thinking of absolutely nothing but the sun, sand, and surf.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I have to use conditioner to be able to do this.  </li>
            <li>I bought it simply because it&#x27;s not tested on animals, it smells amazing and the description on the back of the bottle convinced me that it was good stuff.    </li>
            <li>It does smell like a sweet, freshly cracked coconut.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave their hair excessively dry like some products do, and it does a wonderful job at removing any build-up that leave-in conditioners have left on their hair.  </li>
            <li>Well, it does have about 3-4 natural and safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>Please visit my blog to become educated on ingredients and learn about safe natural beauty with my product reviews.     </li>
            <li>I tried this because it is NOT tested on animals and sadly most professional products ARE.  </li>
            <li>Hours and hours later, he said my hair still smelled really nice.  </li>
            <li>Maybe on other hairtypes it would be good</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed my hair was softer right away.</li>
            <li>I have only used these products once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>And the whipped egg white protein has given my hair more body.  </li>
            <li>As someone with naturally wavy, almost curly hair, I am always on the lookout for products to keep my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the shampoo/conditioner a month ago</li>
            <li>I was even to able to flat iron without drying the heck out of my hair!</li>
            <li>Most products don&#x27;t linger this long, but I like when they do.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very clean but a tad on the dry side like when you use a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>So, after reading a few a reviews and smelling this amazing scent in the store, I decided I was going to try it out.</li>
            <li>Hair Type: Curly/Wavy/Blah/ and normally very frizzy without product    </li>
            <li>Very silky.</li>
            <li>Organix is medium priced &amp; it works very well.</li>
            <li>I will say that the fragrance was fantastic and that is the only reason I gave any stars.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s been pretty humid around here lately and so far my hair has stayed smooth without becoming frizzy and bushy.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair on the top with dry ends...</li>
            <li>I always figure the more expensive the product is, the better the product will work.</li>
            <li>I never usually spend this much money on a shampoo</li>
            <li>like I normally do...</li>
            <li>I live in the South where it&#x27;s quite humid...</li>
            <li>Wanting to know if I had tried the new mango/citrus shampoo and conditioner I had bought.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo feels clean, like its taking out the other products I put into my hair.</li>
            <li>At first, when lathering my hair up I was about doubtful as my hair didn&#x27;t really smell that great.</li>
            <li>I have fine, heavily colored hair.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the clear serum.</li>
            <li>But oh my god, after blow drying my hair, my hair is so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I must admit you have to be very liberal with the amounts, patient enough to let the conditioner sit, and must rinse well.</li>
            <li>Organix portrays itself as an natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the name fool you, Organix is far from organic.</li>
            <li>I also look for products that will keep my hair soft, minimize breakage and not affect my color.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, so I looked for a product that didn&#x27;t use sulphate and found this.  </li>
            <li>The scent of many shampoos usually goes away shortly after you shower.</li>
            <li>Just a little leave-in conditioner and my hair dried with some really nice waves in it.  </li>
            <li>It smells great but without the fake, overly done coconut fragrance that I sometimes find in other products.</li>
            <li>The coconut smell lasts a really long time!--the main reason I gave this four stars.</li>
            <li>Because I am licensed, I normally only buy professional products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually worried about coconut products because they&#x27;re super moisturizing</li>
            <li>I was surprised how silky it left my hair, especially considering the price!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair soft and silky, but it doesn&#x27;t leave it horribly dry, either.</li>

            <li> Then I let it dry for half an hour, without any product except heat protectant, and it was very frizzy.</li>
            <li> With daily use of the shampoo and the conditioner on the lower 2/3 of my hair, I have had soft, shiny hair every day and it hasn&#x27;t been weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself to be shampoo agnostic and will even use the stuff in the dispenser at the gym, but this stuff left my long, highlighted hair feeling like tangled straw.     </li>
            <li> Every time I read the label of some product that says that it will do exceptional things to my hair, I usually am quite skeptical.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or dry hair, definitely try these products.  </li>
            <li> out\\&quot; when I air dry it, like it used to do.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, make it too dry</li>
            <li> and you can feel it take the the other products out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Lots of hair products loose the smell after a few hours</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner left my hair dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo and conditioner does not cause heaviness that weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> All the rest is a toxic mess, including petrochemcials and preservatives linked to cancer and disease.</li>
            <li> I read a little bit about Organix on their website &amp; decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> It does leave it feeling a little stringy--i.e.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t need a heavy, intensive conditioner after a shampoo unless it&#x27;s a clarifier, and this isn&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li> Split ends, dry, weak, frizzy..</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner because spending the summer in the pool and outdoors usually fries my hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually use salon products,but saw this.</li>
            <li> The worse that can happen is that you wasted a 14 or less bucks on shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo made my hair hard and straw like.</li>
            <li> but I was desperate for a shampoo without sulfates and how could I resist such a heavenly scent?</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and multi-textured so some parts require a lot of tlc</li>
            <li> I thought if I used them again, they still might work, but they are just poor products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be mislead by \\&quot;forganic\\&quot; (fake organic) products like this one.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel weird after you wash it, even after you condition it.</li>
            <li> I found myself disappointed in the conditioner and in amazement of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I WRONG!!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Coconut shampoo and conditioner and was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Hair Type: Curly/Wavy/Blah/ and normally very frizzy without product    So, after reading a few a reviews and smelling this amazing scent in the store, I decided I was going to try it out. I never usually spend this much money on a shampoo but I was desperate for a shampoo without sulfates and how could I resist such a heavenly scent? Today I tried it out for the first time and I am so completely satisfied. At first, when lathering my hair up I was about doubtful as my hair didn&#x27;t really smell that great. Once I had rinsed out the conditioner (after leaving it in for 10 minutes or so) the softness of my hair was pretty good, but not that soft after getting all the product out. Then I let it dry for half an hour, without any product except heat protectant, and it was very frizzy. But oh my god, after blow drying my hair, my hair is so soft and silky. This shampoo and conditioner made my hair look so healthy and so shiny. The smell isn&#x27;t that strong but you could pick up the scent if you hugged me or something.  Anyway, love this product. If you were hesitating about getting this product, just go for it. The worse that can happen is that you wasted a 14 or less bucks on shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> looooove the organix coconut milk line! it makes my dry, brittle hair manageable, shiny and smelling great!</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair on the top with dry ends...this shampoo and conditioner does not cause heaviness that weigh your hair down yet if you leave it in for 3 mins it really hydrates the dried ends.  I must admit you have to be very liberal with the amounts, patient enough to let the conditioner sit, and must rinse well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these hair products believing that the fancy packaging would make them great shampoos and conditioners.  Boy, was I WRONG!!  I regret buying this liquid garbage.  This shampoo and conditioner left my hair dull and lifeless.  I thought if I used them again, they still might work, but they are just poor products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using Dove Shampoo products.</li>
            <li> Using this shampoo is like taking a head-trip to Hawaii.  Inhaling the rich, sweet coconut milk scent of this shampoo reminds ms of a splendid, sunny day I spent on Waikiki, slathering Hawaiian Tropics all over my skin and thinking of absolutely nothing but the sun, sand, and surf.  Everytime I lather this creamy, milky shampoo into my hair, I forget I am standing in a freezing bathroom in Alaska and slip into a delicious fantasy of me bathing in a waterfall in Kauai!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one warning about this shampoo though:  it cleanses your hair like a clarifying shampoo.  It leaves your hair very clean but a tad on the dry side like when you use a clarifying shampoo.  I use a great conditioner from Aveda - one that has a coconut, grapefruit scent and it works great.</li>
            <li> I read about the coconut milk split end mender in Lucky magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It is incredible!  I&#x27;m usually worried about coconut products because they&#x27;re super moisturizing and I have really fine, oily hair, but this product works great.  I use the split end mender nightly and have been able to go longer between haircuts.    Then I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner because spending the summer in the pool and outdoors usually fries my hair.  With daily use of the shampoo and the conditioner on the lower 2/3 of my hair, I have had soft, shiny hair every day and it hasn&#x27;t been weighed down.  And the whipped egg white protein has given my hair more body.  The smell is incredibly sexy too.  My hair has never been happier.  I&#x27;m hoping that this will work well for the winter months, too.</li>
            <li> Organix portrays itself as an natural shampoo. Well, it does have about 3-4 natural and safe ingredients. All the rest is a toxic mess, including petrochemcials and preservatives linked to cancer and disease. Don&#x27;t let the name fool you, Organix is far from organic. There are much safer and better choices out there for you and your family. Don&#x27;t be mislead by \\&quot;forganic\\&quot; (fake organic) products like this one.

            <li> As someone with naturally wavy, almost curly hair, I am always on the lookout for products to keep my hair smooth.  With my hair being color treated (bleach and low-lights) I also look for products that will keep my hair soft, minimize breakage and not affect my color.  This product line exceeded my expectations.  Because I am licensed, I normally only buy professional products.  I tried this because it is NOT tested on animals and sadly most professional products ARE.  I live in the South where it&#x27;s quite humid...This kept the frizzies under control.  I noticed I could run my fingers through my hair after shampooing and before applying the conditioner.  Normally, I have to use conditioner to be able to do this.  For what it&#x27;s worth, my fiance noticed that my hair was smoother and said it smelled wonderful...Wanting to know if I had tried the new mango/citrus shampoo and conditioner I had bought.  Hours and hours later, he said my hair still smelled really nice.  Most products don&#x27;t linger this long, but I like when they do.  I also did not have to apply hair smoothing cream like I normally do...Just a little leave-in conditioner and my hair dried with some really nice waves in it.  If you have curly or dry hair, definitely try these products.  And, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it on my children that I adopted from Ethiopia since we brought them home in July.  It doesn&#x27;t leave their hair excessively dry like some products do, and it does a wonderful job at removing any build-up that leave-in conditioners have left on their hair.  It also smells absolutely fabulous!  I love to smell their hair after they&#x27;ve had their baths. :)</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and works great!  I was surprised how silky it left my hair, especially considering the price!</li>
            <li> I bought it simply because it&#x27;s not tested on animals, it smells amazing and the description on the back of the bottle convinced me that it was good stuff.    I absolutely hated it. It makes your hair feel weird after you wash it, even after you condition it. My hair is colour treated and pretty beat up, so I&#x27;ve got to use good quality products to keep it at it&#x27;s best.    This ruined my hair. Split ends, dry, weak, frizzy.. the only thing good about this product was the smell.     Don&#x27;t buy it. You&#x27;ll have to buy something even more expensive to fix it&#x27;s damage!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a great shampoo i&#x27;ve tried so many. I only bought this product because of the good reviews i got about the condition so i bought them together, after using them I found myself disappointed in the conditioner and in amazement of the shampoo. It was so wonderfull after my shampoo i almost got out the shower forgetting about the conditioner this has never happenned before. My hair is very thick and multi-textured so some parts require a lot of tlc but after using this shampoo my hair is equal all around.</li>
            <li> Usually use salon products,but saw this. Smells great! Just like the salon and you can feel it take the the other products out of your hair. Conditioner was also nice. Very silky. When I woke the next day hair still smelled and looked great.Wnder if they body wash and lotion.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for shampoo that will do what I want. I&#x27;ve tried numerous salon shampoos &amp; drugstore shampoos. Every time I read the label of some product that says that it will do exceptional things to my hair, I usually am quite skeptical. I read a little bit about Organix on their website &amp; decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised. I always figure the more expensive the product is, the better the product will work. Organix is medium priced &amp; it works very well. Its smells yummy! The shampoo feels clean, like its taking out the other products I put into my hair. The conditioner softened it up and detangled my hair. I have only used these products once, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. Based on the information I read it seemed perfect. I bought the Coconut shampoo and conditioner and was very disappointed. I have fine, heavily colored hair. The shampoo made my hair hard and straw like. The conditioner was more moisturising but I still had to put in a lot of leave in moisturiser afterwards to compensate for all the flyaway dryness this product caused. Maybe on other hairtypes it would be good but if you have hair like mine, then I would not recommend it. I will say that the fragrance was fantastic and that is the only reason I gave any stars.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome collection of products. First, they smell delicious. Second, these are the only products I&#x27;ve used that I can tell a big difference in how my hair looks and feels after I use them. I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the clear serum.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed my hair was softer right away. I was even to able to flat iron without drying the heck out of my hair! It smells great but without the fake, overly done coconut fragrance that I sometimes find in other products. I&#x27;m definitely a fan!</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be shampoo agnostic and will even use the stuff in the dispenser at the gym, but this stuff left my long, highlighted hair feeling like tangled straw.     I shouldn&#x27;t need a heavy, intensive conditioner after a shampoo unless it&#x27;s a clarifier, and this isn&#x27;t.    The only thing to recommend it is the scent. It does smell like a sweet, freshly cracked coconut.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so I looked for a product that didn&#x27;t use sulphate and found this.  It is wonderful: it not only smells good, but I can actually tell a difference with my hair.  My hair curls better, stays smoother, and also doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;poof out\\&quot; when I air dry it, like it used to do.  Also, it&#x27;s been pretty humid around here lately and so far my hair has stayed smooth without becoming frizzy and bushy.  Of course, this isn&#x27;t a terribly warm climate, so I can&#x27;t attest for people in the south or what have you.    For what it&#x27;s worth, my sister (who doesn&#x27;t have curly hair) also used it while she was visiting and loved it.</li>
            <li> The scent of many shampoos usually goes away shortly after you shower. I washed my hair 6 hours ago and can still smell the coconut. Love it!! It didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, make it too dry (my hair is oily, it worked perfectly), it&#x27;s soft, it smells great. A+</li>
            <li> I first tried the shampoo/conditioner a month ago and I&#x27;m hooked. My hair is wavy and in the summer when it&#x27;s humid my hair is out of control. Since using the products my hair has been silky and healthy. And the smell is great. Lots of hair products loose the smell after a few hours but my hair still smells like coconuts when I wake up the next day.</li>
            <li> The coconut smell lasts a really long time!--the main reason I gave this four stars. I washed my hair twice with Pantene Pro-V shampoo/conditioner (on separate days) after using this shampoo, and I could still smell the coconut with each wash!    NOTE: I have wavy, semi-frizzy past-shoulder-length hair.    The feel is just okay. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair soft and silky, but it doesn&#x27;t leave it horribly dry, either. It does leave it feeling a little stringy--i.e. more prone to static and tangles.</li>
