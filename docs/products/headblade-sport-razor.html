            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using SensorExcel blades exclusively and the cost/performance ratio is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The HeadBlade unit coupled with a Gillette Sensor Excel cartridge is the best configuration I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>The thing is balanced almost perfectly for my hair.</li>
            <li>bought this razor along with a 50-pack of aftermarket Gillette Atra/Trac II razors, which was a great deal!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>The world&#x27;s best headshaving device.</li>
            <li>My husband shaves his head every nite and thought this to be the perfect gift.</li>
            <li>which is owned by Merkur (the best DE razors on the Planet)  </li>
            <li>Well the HeadBlade is the perfect razor for anyone who is thinking about shaving their head!</li>

            <li>The Headblade razor is the best razor for shaving my head</li>
            <li>The Headblade razor is the best razor for shaving my head</li>
            <li>The best deal after searching it turns out is from Personna (a blade company out of Israel).</li>
            <li>Best way I can find to shave head.</li>
            <li>it work very good people who shave therer head</li>
            <li>The quality of the shave is very good.</li>
            <li>Great improvement to an already great design!</li>
            <li>They works brilliantly when I take my dads Mach.</li>
            <li>There shave cream works great and the menthol cools, no razor burn anymore either.  </li>
            <li>follow that up with some headlube (a great moisturizing lotion)</li>
            <li>think the product is great, but it does have some limitation.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Their is no doubt that the Head Blade could be a great product.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be great</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>So if Sensor Excel blades are so great, why use a HeadBlade at all?</li>
            <li>Tried it again, and have been happy with it ever since.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product but it must be used as advised.</li>
            <li>but the adapter doesn&#x27;t swivel/rock like the Atra adapter which didn&#x27;t seem to give the Trac II blade the best shot at being effective.</li>
            <li>They work great in my Trac II handle.</li>
            <li>but it may not be the great solution you are expecting.</li>
            <li>I got one of these as a gift from a friend who thought it was a great idea.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for shaving the head.</li>
            <li>Probably a great tool for some, just not us.</li>
            <li>DOES A GREAT JOB.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Now the Headblade works great, and I can&#x27;t imagine anything giving a closer shave with no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ususally go over my head twice, with great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I was told this product was great for shaving my head</li>
            <li>Took some getting used to, but works great, even against the grain.</li>
            <li>great cut with 4 blade razors</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been that happy.</li>
            <li>great for baldness.</li>
            <li>This razor work great.</li>
            <li>Great concept but not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I never have experienced the problems some people have.  </li>
            <li>The price was great.</li>
            <li>its like running your fingers thru your hair if you had any lol.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Took a minute to get use to, but once he got it it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great gift for a buddy who is into head shaving.  </li>
            <li>It works best on the top of the head.  </li>
            <li>this it perfect for guy that want to go blad but scared to shave there heads, this makes it easy</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>A word to the wise:  </li>
            <li>Good product I recommend.</li>
            <li>It cut, scraped, gouged and nicked it&#x27;s way across my scalp like a vampire in search of a good meal.    </li>
            <li>This razor, when used with a good blade, will speed up you morning headshaving chore, and it will produce a shave as close as anything you have ever used.</li>
            <li>I prefer a good gel or foam.</li>
            <li>Mach 3 was good.  </li>
            <li>The sport does the job twice as good as the ATX and three times faster.</li>
            <li>This is a really good idea.  </li>
            <li>Because, in principal, it&#x27;s a good idea.]</li>
            <li>the folks who gave this thing good reviews must know the inventor or somthing.</li>
            <li>It works good</li>
            <li>It did a good job in the front</li>
            <li>It did not give as good a shave as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Great product and have recommended it to many of the bald, and balding men I know.</li>
            <li>Do not expect good or excellent results in the first week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not expect good or excellent results in the first week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it , took my about maybe 10 mins to shave and it was great no nicks or cuts and</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Ok!</li>
            <li>I bought this product about a month ago, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Outstanding!</li>
            <li>Better than fine, it&#x27;s excellent and better than any face razor I&#x27;ve ever used on my head.  </li>
            <li>The sensor excel blades fit with an adapter, and I have found those to work great on the headblade.    </li>
            <li>Taking it to the shower really softens the hair and has given me the closet and best shaves without cuts.  </li>
            <li>Nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I&#x27;m nice.</li>
            <li>Its a nice gadget to have,</li>
            <li>but, I own and have used both the 3 blade and 4 blade models</li>
            <li>Was a nice concept though.   </li>
            <li>But Headshave, Nice concept.</li>
            <li>A good multi blade razor (5 blade) is easier and more versatile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice concept</li>
            <li>The Headblade Sport is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivered, very nice!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and will now have a razor that allows me to shave my head more than twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed how good this thing is and how simple it is!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving the ol&#x27; bean very easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more effective.  </li>
            <li>far I am getting the best results with Cremo shave cream, and</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing thing I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>Amazing, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>This thing is great, ignore the complaints on here they are not doing something right.  </li>
            <li>As other have mentioned, this works best with a good blade on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li>After a nice hot bath and good scrubbing to exfoliate the skin, I lathered up.</li>
            <li>Showed up super fast ,in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>BE SURE TO GET THEIR SHAVE CREAM TO THIS</li>
            <li>I decided to give the HeadBlade a try to see if it would work better than the 5 blade razor I had been using.</li>
            <li>It worked better</li>
            <li>end-all of the dome clearing world, the shaving creams, lotions, and scrubs that headblade produces are top notch all the way.  </li>
            <li>Use a butter knife you will be better off.</li>
            <li>And the razorblade HeadBlade provides is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>it just takes more time and effort.  </li>
            <li>Just let it ride your head and make sure the wheel stays in contact with your skull at all times.</li>
            <li>stuffs the blade more than shaving your face</li>
            <li>stuffs the blade more than shaving your face</li>
            <li>The fusion costs more, but it works.</li>
            <li>When going against the grain, I find it helps to keep your ring finger off the front of the HB unit and instead try to keep it on top of the ring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to repeat the warning many have already talked about in these reviews.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love it for neatness and lubrication.</li>
            <li>I have found shaving with a hand lotion or only when your head is continuously under water, produces the best results.</li>
            <li>Using a regular razor also works best for the sideburns and neck hairline.    </li>
            <li>so you can find your favorite blade and put it on here.</li>
            <li>Better stay off from this invovative product.</li>
            <li>and i had some more razors for this one</li>
            <li>So, interesting idea</li>
            <li>Anyway, now I just bite the bullet and fork over the $10 for a set of four authentic HB3 replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>Gouged more than once.  </li>
            <li>so maybe with more practice</li>
            <li>To sum up, use your favorite razor, the one you use for your beard, on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Headblade should spend more time effort and energy in getting a better blade - like a Mach 3 blade.</li>
            <li>think I like this razor most for the way it keeps the blades on my head</li>
            <li>I love it because I am no longer called in to \\&quot;check\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Wish more stores sold these it would be easier to get refills which would make for more convenience.</li>
            <li>well, like most fathers I believe, mine is bald.</li>
            <li>It appears that most of the reviews on this product are from people who bought it for someone else as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>The Headblade&#x27;s form is more intuitive for us head shavers, it does move along your dome the way you want it to, but its form doesn&#x27;t translate as well into shaving effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>When I cut the top off and pulled the plastic apart the Headblade flew out and fell in the sink causing the blade holder to break.</li>
            <li>more like jagged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re better off trying to shave your head with a rusty steak knife.</li>
            <li>it is fun to use, and for me, it worked surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li>The Headblade with the push design does better than all of them.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is more like a gel than like a lathery cream.</li>
            <li>This newer one is even better with the wheel and rubberized finger strap.</li>
            <li>Also, four blades would make it more efficient.</li>
            <li>More design gimmick than anything else.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the newer &amp;#34;revisions&amp;#34; they made to these, they used to be better built/quality.</li>
            <li>This is a push razor, and it will do most of the work for you.  </li>
            <li>If you have gone more than a day or two between shaves then</li>
            <li>this thing is usless exept on the top of the head.</li>
            <li>When I used the Headslick with the Sport, I was able to shave faster and do so safely.</li>
            <li>In 2012, to remedy some of the problems of the Sport model, Headblade introduced their ATX model which does have a better finger holding loop and another curve for the index finger.</li>
            <li>Here on Amazon you can search for their Tri-Flexxx cartridges (which will fit the Headblade Sport and of course, the Sensor Excel (if you still own one))</li>
            <li>, I have no idea :)</li>
            <li>, I have no idea :)</li>
            <li>Then his father in law wanted one when he saw it, so bought some more.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>You just need to be more diligent with it, but I do love the sport.</li>
            <li>If you want a great, fast, thorough shave,  use the Gillette Fusion razor  with the electric mode.  </li>
            <li>The Headblade was a gadget - nothing more.</li>
            <li>my head is nice and smooth</li>
            <li>i love the headblade</li>
            <li>They love it, and being guys, like the car and the toy combination</li>
            <li>If, however, you don&#x27;t mind having visible stubble right after you shave, this may be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li>Great product I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>, I think its pretty good tool, and a novel invention.</li>
            <li>I still got a pretty good shave without the headslick</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it to avoid the blood bath!!</li>
            <li>The wheel is there to make sure the \\&quot;shovel\\&quot; glides easily across the \\&quot;dirt\\&quot; on your head.</li>
            <li>The design is innovative and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I would have hoped the blade assembly would be more suited to easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Makes shaving the head easy and safe.</li>
            <li>and I was able to find compatible replacement cartridges easily.</li>
            <li>The quality of the blade is not as good as many I&#x27;ve used (Gillette, CVS, straight edge).</li>
            <li>I believe they&#x27;re the most important part of the HeadBlade.  </li>
            <li>After visiting a lot of baldy sites and finding that most used the HB I noticed that in all cases the trick to the HB is a light touch.  </li>
            <li>To compare, I am useing the 2 blades now and find that they are not quite as comfortable as the 3 blades, but still exponentially better than the cheaper store bought ones.  </li>
            <li>I scored the Headblade Sport at Walgreen Drugstore recently, and I found that it does an incredible job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Woulda given more stars if available.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the package was supplied with an additional blade holder that works with most blades you get with disposable razors.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic, tryit, love it, use</li>
            <li>This razor gives the smoothest and most stubble free results.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to relearn all the contours of your scalp and be able to hit them correctly to get a perfectly smooth dome.</li>
            <li>Once you try the one free cartridge included in the package, head here to Amazon.com or another reputable supplier and look up Tri-Flexxx if you went for the Sport model.</li>
            <li>Once you try the one free cartridge included in the package, head here to Amazon.com or another reputable supplier and look up Tri-Flexxx if you went for the Sport model.</li>
            <li>but still he&#x27;s cool!)    </li>
            <li>It made the transition into head shaving easy.  </li>
            <li>It is very quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I can shave my head very quickly.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t allow them to be easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to rinse (when you use third-party</li>
            <li>and it was easy.  </li>
            <li>You spend more time trying to clean the cartridge out</li>
            <li>getting around the ears is tricky, and it is easy to nick yourself where your ear meets with your scalp.  </li>
            <li>Many men think they can just figure things out on their own, well this is a product you really should not do that with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (easier than a face razor)</li>
            <li>Easy to get the hang of to use.</li>
            <li>Flimsy blade mount that comes off too easily.</li>
            <li>It is not a design that allows water to flow easily through it for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Easy way to shave your head without tearing up skin.</li>
            <li>Nivea Active 3 is the perfect amount of lubricant so the razor glides over your head, but it does not clog up your razor.&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li>And so easy.</li>
            <li>For a number of years I have shaved my face in a nice hot shower using Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product, the cool marketing, the design, and even the price and color.</li>
            <li>Now the less than perfect part.</li>
            <li>and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>The Mach 3 cartridge is a fine system for shaving your face every 1-3 days.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve learned to shave my head according to how my hair grows and this works just fine.</li>
            <li>I tried both the HB3 blades for three weeks and the Sensor Excel and both did fine.</li>
            <li>do fine that I end up replacing the shaver about every 18 months.  </li>
            <li>Once you account for cleaning up the crevices and tricky areas that the Headblade isn&#x27;t going to get on a quick pass, it&#x27;s probably not going to be any easier than using a Mach 3--in fact, you may find it to be more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The triple-blade razor that comes with it shaves incredibly close, and I didn&#x27;t have one single nick or cut.  </li>
            <li>All this multi-bladed stuff is pure silliness to be honest.</li>
            <li>All this multi-bladed stuff is pure silliness to be honest.</li>
            <li>This little dohickey is awesome!</li>
            <li>This little shaver does a great job!</li>
            <li>good for a nice clean shave of your head, Much better than the conventional blade.</li>
            <li>I will probably always use both razors unless I am in a huge hurry.</li>
            <li>Headblade made a huge mistake by introducing the ATX model.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy shaving my head again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaves that I have received from the Headblade have been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>, aside from the fun factor, the most imporant things that one would want out of the Headblade are closeness of shave, time saved, and ease of use, here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>free sample of HeadSlick shaving cream included in packaging</li>
            <li>And if you fit the Sensor Excel blades on it, then you shouldn&#x27;t notice any leftover stubble.</li>
            <li>The blades are also cheap.  </li>
            <li>No razor is cheap, but this one carries a premium price tag.    </li>
            <li>Before you buy this product, it&#x27;s important to understand what it is and what it is not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wheels in the back of the device help to keep the blades at the correct angle for a great shave every time.</li>
            <li>I used regular Barbasol and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Obviously I can&#x27;t do it smooth in one pass</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done my head is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert at this stuff, I haven&#x27;t been shaving my head for years, but I really do enjoy this</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I think the design of the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; is great, and takes the idea of shaving out of the box, I&#x27;m utterly disapointed with the blades.</li>
            <li>Product has kept my head cut free.  </li>
            <li>The title says it all:  Well-designed but cheaply made unit.  </li>
            <li>Way better than Bic, far better than Schick, and even better than battery powered Gillette Proglide Fusion.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping he would enjoy the razor.  </li>
            <li>, so I think being so cheap</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s a@@.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s handy and fast.</li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I have alternated back and forth from my Gillette mach 3 turbo to see which I liked better and must say I like my mach 3 turbo much better.</li>
            <li>I can now shave my own head and the back of my neck in 4 to 10 minutes, depending on how picky I&#x27;m being, in the comfort of my own</li>
            <li>I have used them and they aren&#x27;t as good as the standard two-blade Twins you can get at most Walmart stores.</li>
            <li>Anyone who uses a Headblade will not achieve superior results in the first week (and maybe, even in the first month).</li>
            <li>As someone who has tried various methods of head shaving I can safely say that Headblade is the absolute best way to get the job done right.</li>
            <li>this thing works way better than it has any right too..</li>
            <li>Ok I started shaving my head a month ago and right after the buzz cut I used the head blade Triple blade.</li>
            <li>Using oil with the Headblade and shaving in the direction that works instead of the direction they say keeps my head clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Within a month, you will probably be shaving more smoothly and faster than with your old Mach 3, Hydro or Fusion Pro Glide, and more cheaply.</li>
            <li>Within a month, you will probably be shaving more smoothly and faster than with your old Mach 3, Hydro or Fusion Pro Glide, and more cheaply.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I did not read the full directions before I began to use this thing but just did what I do by instinct</li>
            <li>I contemplated this purchase for a while, did my research and am excited to say so much better than a regular razor and so much more ergonomic!</li>
            <li>Worth purchasing the extras too!</li>
            <li>The original Headblade had lots of \\&quot;nicking\\&quot; issues.</li>
            <li>She came home so excited, tore it out of the package, and couldn&#x27;t wait for me to try</li>
            <li>Both make a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it was invented by Satan himself.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best selling point, it really only makes a marginal difference over holding a more mainstream blade (like a Gillette fusion or Schick hydro) in a similar fashion.</li>
            <li>Headblade, why would you ever think that rolling the wheels over your foam instead of going blade first was a better thing than what you had with the Sport?</li>
            <li>The Excel was perhaps marginally better, but the price is usually higher as well.</li>
            <li>I was excited upon seeing the possibilities of something aimed at guys who shaved their heads.</li>
            <li>Change the design for easier clean out.    </li>
            <li>To get a really super close smooth shave I always follow up with my Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li>There is no way to get a clean shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be able to outperform the gillette fusion, but it comes nowhere near the performance (granted the fusion costs more).  </li>
            <li>You WILL need to go over the area 2-3 times for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the product and hoped it would make things easier and provide a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Headblade makes it easy and even fun to shave your head.</li>
            <li>you will need to clean the razor after every pass.  </li>
            <li>It seems more natural since I have used it for years and it seems to do a better job of shaving with fewer strokes.</li>
            <li>Works OK but not as good as I had expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Headblade is great, but you have to use the right shaving cream.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product it feels right its easy to use  and gets the job done</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always open to a better way to shave my head more efficiently, easily, etc.</li>
            <li>Either way, you will probably not be able to tell a large difference if you were blindfolded.</li>
            <li>Very easy to shave my head smooth smooth smooth without irritation or multiple passes.</li>
            <li>The blades seem to clog up easy and are not rinsed clean very well by shaking in a water filled sink, or with running water.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>However most any modern \\&quot;stick\\&quot; will give you a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much I&#x27;m going to order their FaceBlade and get rid of my Mach 3.    </li>
            <li>The Sport (with its cool sport wheels) has solved those problems.</li>
            <li>The cool thing is this thing is compatible with tons of razor blades</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, and is really cool looking.</li>
            <li>Of course, he has a full head of hair.    </li>
            <li>Saw the headblade &amp; thought it was cool.  </li>
            <li>Cool gadget.  </li>
            <li>make a similar dedicated head razor that uses blades, I&#x27;ve heard good things about it but have yet to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve ever ordered any type of $19.99 TV thingy, got it out of the box, and laughed at yourself for being ripped off by the 10 cent item you received, then you can expect to have the same reaction with Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really thought this headblade would be the easiest and most fastest way to shave.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to try the Headblade Headslick shaving gel, which is much slicker than most shaving creams.</li>
            <li>I would say I can now shave my entire scalp, and do a good job in about two minutes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though I like the ATX model better, you can use the much cheaper Tri-Flexxx cartridges with the Sport.</li>
            <li>Even though I like the ATX model better, you can use the much cheaper Tri-Flexxx cartridges with the Sport.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>I have been shaving for 10 years and have even used the single blade razors you can buy one at a time from a truck stop which are much more effective than this.</li>
            <li>It is VERY easy to use, and have yet to even nick myself up more less full out scalp myself!</li>
            <li>The head Blade will give you a quick, uniform shave if you follow the instructions and take your time.  </li>
            <li>A careful shave with a good blade like a Gillette Fusion produces an incredibly smooth result.  </li>
            <li>it would give a quick shave in the morning</li>
            <li>Fairly quick shave.  </li>
            <li>Being a young and mexican and having an incredible hair per inch amount.</li>
            <li>Quick and Efficient.</li>
            <li>The damn thing took a chunk out of my head, with blood quickly covering the shower floor.  </li>
            <li>And you can now find many compatible blades at many different stores.</li>
            <li>I broke my older one after using it for better than 6 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 20 years now and have tried everything to get a quick, thorough shave.  </li>
            <li>they were last year&#x27;s gifts everyone enjoyed them thank you, one person&#x27;s son stole his, so I may have to get more.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;ve got a fair amount of hair over a certain length the hair becomes jammed in between the blades on the cartridge at which point the effectiveness of the system is cut in 1/2 or more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as fast or easy as using my tried and true method.</li>
            <li>and it comes clean right away.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t checked Amazon&#x27;s prices for bulk blades, but I&#x27;ve been buying mine at a warehouse club where they&#x27;re pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t checked Amazon&#x27;s prices for bulk blades, but I&#x27;ve been buying mine at a warehouse club where they&#x27;re pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I was pretty much instantly comfortable with using the HeadBlade.  </li>
            <li>honestly can&#x27;t see the benefit of using this product instead of any other 3 or more blade cartridge system out there on the market.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I don&#x27;t work for Headblade, and their products aren&#x27;t that cheap, but they do work and very well!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, after the first week, I just turned the adapter around and now had the HB3 three blade cartridge facing in the correct direction.</li>
            <li>It is a good product as long as you keep up with shaving your head.</li>
            <li>Once you have mastered this razor it is very quick to remove the large areas.</li>
            <li>The razor actually cuts pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This last one, I bought the finger loop is flexible, and makes it feel pretty good in the hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the way nice productsafety wise but would only recommend to people who can afford to buy new blades every new use...</li>
            <li>I bet the HeadBlade would be good for somebody with limited range of motion, like if you have a rotator cuff injury, arthritis or anything like that.</li>
            <li>The first thing to remember, though, is DON&#x27;T APPLY ANY PRESSURE TO THE BLADE!</li>
            <li>The head slick shaving stuff is cool, and feels great on the skin, but I don&#x27;t think the cool factor justifies the added expense.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to Mac 3, which I used to use in the shower with no problem and most of the time no shaving cream or anything and never got one cut!</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the ATX model ever so slightly better than the Sport, but Headblade recommends the ATX be used with Headblade&#x27;s higher end bladed cartridges, which means more money for Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good way to visualize it is to think of pushing a flat-blade shovel across some loose dirt.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t rush I&#x27;m fine, because I keep it in a straight line.</li>
            <li>Great little invention.</li>
            <li>This thing is so smooth that you don&#x27;t really need a mirror unless you&#x27;re worried about accidentally shaving off an eyebrow.</li>
            <li>After that, don&#x27;t let it grow out too much, or you&#x27;ll be spending a lot of time getting your head smooth again.</li>
            <li>So I use my Mach 3 on the back which I feel gives me better control and which I feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Headblade for about three weeks and feel sure that I will soon feel comfortable using it on the back of my head.</li>
            <li>The novelty is a lot of fun, and appeals to the gadget-lover in me.  </li>
            <li>This razor is fun to use.</li>
            <li>I just make sure to steer clear of that area, as there is no hair to shave there anyway.    </li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t useful to me at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I switched from a national-brand gel-type shaving cream (the kind that starts as a gel but foams up on your skin) to a different type of shaving cream in the interim.  </li>
            <li>it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>If this helps….my head is smooth on the top, but not in the back.  </li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Just wish that the shave were closer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li>it was worth a try..</li>
            <li>If Headblade completely discontinues the Sport model, I&#x27;m sure they will go out of business.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could get this kind of smoothness or quality from trying to use a regular shaving on my head.</li>
            <li>I find the original HB with the feet as opposed to the little wheels provides infinitely more control and provides a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty quick to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m using Sensor blades in it right now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Sensor blades in it right now</li>
            <li>this product showed up defective right out of the box.</li>
            <li>On Amazon.com right now, you can get four HB3 cartridges for $8.20 (or $2.05 per cartridge).</li>
            <li>The first time he used it, of course not being ready for it, he cut a huge chunk out of his head.</li>
            <li>very dificult to clean</li>
            <li>After giving it a couple of tries, I threw it away and returned to the more nimble, easily manageable single-blade disposable.  </li>
            <li>if you want the best shave possible due to sheer awkwardness and all the touching up you have to do.    </li>
            <li>Many of us grew up shaving with blades that you had to scrape, pull, tug and grind into your face to get a barely acceptable shave.  </li>
            <li>It was good timing since the previous time I&#x27;d shaved, I&#x27;d cut my ear and lost about a pint of blood</li>
            <li>Super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many deferent methods from electric to old school straight blade</li>
            <li>The learning curve is very similar to what I experienced when I switched to a double edged safety razor for my face.</li>
            <li>I guarantee there is more money spent on the pretty packaging than in the cheap, china-made product</li>
            <li>The first pass shaved a wonderfully smooth swath, a rinse and the second went smooth.  </li>
            <li>No turning back as the Headblade is simple and very effective.  </li>
            <li>the learning curve is very fast and pretty effortless.</li>
            <li>I bought it and was apprehensive about using it at first for fear of having a head looking like chopped liver</li>
            <li>It does a \\&quot;good\\&quot; job, but not one that is stellar.  </li>
            <li>my first thought when using it was where is my bandaids</li>
            <li>/&gt;Closeness: The shave is somewhat close, but the Mach 3 most definitely shaved closer.  </li>
            <li>I shave on a daily basis and I love the Headblade.</li>
            <li>First used the Fusion Pro Glide</li>
            <li>I get exactly what I expect from it at the price I&#x27;m buying: About a year of reliable use.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used generic three blade razors with better performance.  </li>
            <li>I have never bled so much in my life!</li>
            <li>I watched the video first..</li>
            <li>It is important to keep pressure off the blade itself: I usually don&#x27;t even rest my index finger on it but just let it shave under its own weight.</li>
            <li>The first time I didn&#x27;t like it - so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot again - and I&#x27;m still not a fan.</li>
            <li>For the first use of the HB I also used their HeadSlick product.  </li>
            <li>first neck to forehead</li>
            <li>and this is for the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>this product to any one interested.</li>
            <li>but I have mastered it pretty well.      </li>
            <li>Just let it glide, and keep the wheel in gentle contact with your scalp!    </li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given it a much higher rating.</li>
            <li>My husband also reported that it gave him more irritation than a regular razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review, my first ever, in response to some of the reviews</li>
            <li>, I go over the same path more than once.  </li>
            <li>so, what is a better present than this?</li>
            <li>you receive one of these from a loved one - smile and be gracious...but don&#x27;t waste YOUR money on one of these - stick with something that will really work - Mach 3, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been sporting the Kojak look for about 15 years now and have tried many different approaches to shaving my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bad - learning curve, first week of use was rough,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still get a better shave with my regular razor.</li>
            <li>He said it works okay, but prefers a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Thats the first time that has happened.</li>
            <li>So instead of being able to swish it around in the sink you actually have to run water over it.  </li>
            <li>Quality Egg smooth head, Far from my reaches with this tool on my head.</li>
            <li>Many nicks and cuts and a nickel size gouge on the bump at the back of my head.</li>
            <li>If I could give this product a higher rating I would.</li>
            <li>This gadget is perfect for blood sacrifices, but lousy for shaving your head.</li>
            <li>And scoot back to the lab to work on a better design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of a couple of more to have in backup since I don&#x27;t see my hair growing back anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Never cut myself, but I was pretty cautious.</li>
            <li>I use the Headblade as a first pass with a dozen rinses and cleanings before using a Fusion razor with battery to &amp;#34;clean-up&amp;#34; the remaining areas.</li>
            <li>Do not rush shaving with a fresh blade and rinse very often.</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>For a quick, comfortable daily shave</li>
            <li>I Seen this product on the net and was very excited to find a store and purchase one.</li>
            <li>With most of your head, it&#x27;s not a big issue, but in certain spots (on my head, anyway), you&#x27;re going to get some nicks and cuts from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which you \\&quot;pull\\&quot; down your face, you \\&quot;push\\&quot; the Headblade - it&#x27;s more like a snowplow, or the shovel in my allegory.is thing is so smooth that you don&#x27;t really need a mirror unless you&#x27;re worried about accidentally shaving off an eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Worked great for first five minutes, then the head slick shave gel that is made by same company clogged up the blade and wouldn&#x27;t rinse out, so I tried to remove the blade to clean it, and the plastic piece snapped.  </li>
            <li>they are cheap  blades, not sharp.</li>
            <li>Optimistic because there were a lot of positive reviews</li>
            <li>It happened to me the first time when I went too fast...</li>
            <li>i was very skepitcal at first and thought what the hell for 11 bucks</li>
            <li>I just tried it for the first time, it made the save so much faster and easier.</li>
            <li>The grip and gliding action are cool.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair left in front or on top, so there is not much to worry about there, but it does take more than one pass for me to get every hair.    </li>
            <li>The gillette has a completely open design which allows hair to pass between the blades and easily wash away.  </li>
            <li>so half of my head is bald on it&#x27;s own...</li>
            <li>I shave from the front all the way down to the back of my neck and get a great shave.</li>
            <li>I am certain that had I not tried the headblade, I would not still be shaving my head.</li>
            <li>I tried shaving with this twice and managed to remove two large chunks from my scalp.  </li>
            <li>If there is one thing I have learned by using my refined Merkur 38c HD, is that more blades just equal more skin irritation and increased profits for whoever is selling this stuff to the general public.</li>
            <li>If there is one thing I have learned by using my refined Merkur 38c HD, is that more blades just equal more skin irritation and increased profits for whoever is selling this stuff to the general public.</li>
            <li>If our hair only grew in 2 directions like the company would like you to believe then the product would be fine as is.    </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the only way that I can get any razor to take it off--</li>
            <li>I recently tried these cheaper cartridges and found them to be just fine.</li>
            <li>I recently tried these cheaper cartridges and found them to be just fine.</li>
            <li>If it feels like your razor is catching or giving you little nicks then change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Headblade just be aware that you may have to use it in conjunction with another razor for the absolute closest shave.</li>
            <li>The Headblade makes shaving much quicker and much easier, doesn&#x27;t matter if you go with or against the grain it still gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It is okay, I&#x27;ve not really tried it, as I give it away as a gift.</li>
            <li>These people must be putting to much pressure or have never shaved their head before.  </li>
            <li>My advice to anybody who wants to try it: read the instructions and don&#x27;t rush</li>
            <li>The company needs to update to modern blades.      </li>
            <li>Gently resting them on your head allows you glide without much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Too much pressure causes bumps, cuts, and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Headblade is MUCH easier to use, and it makes shaving MUCH quicker.</li>
            <li>since I can&#x27;t really see where I&#x27;m shaving....</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile, I really like it.    </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t follow the instructions (there&#x27;s even a video tutorial on the HeadBlade web site), and you put too much pressure on the blade, or you do not keep the wheel against your scalp, expect to be cut.  </li>
            <li>The Headblade works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Learning to use it is a real challenge</li>
            <li>Reading the directions takes about 10 seconds, and following them is important.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this to ANYONE who wants to shave their head.</li>
            <li>It did and wonderfully fast too.</li>
            <li>I use it with Headslick cream and the whole job</li>
            <li>and there is way too much room for user error.</li>
            <li>not that much to shave),</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very ergonomic</li>
            <li>:  The shave just isn&#x27;t very close.  </li>
            <li>This is so much easier for me.  </li>
            <li>But when I go too fast, I sometimes let the blade go sideways, resulting in a cut.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift.came with one blade and said standard blade will fit it.</li>
            <li>Straight?  </li>
            <li>but I get a much closer shave with it.</li>
            <li>but i wouild like a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to buy this razor, but after reading reviews I decided to go with it.</li>
            <li>It worked OK, but not really any faster than my DE razor, and not as close a shave.</li>
            <li>Which brings me to the one thing that I really don&#x27;t like about this product, the design of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Much closer shave.</li>
            <li>You don’t have to apply much, if any, downward force.  </li>
            <li>following these steps, I have had a smooth scalp for years.  </li>
            <li>I know, the &amp;#34;newer much betterer&amp;#34; ATX has proprietary blades that I need to order from you whereas the sport uses face blades from the dollar store but</li>
            <li>But, I did not like it, and if that was the only option available to me, I would have rated the Headblade as about 1.5 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li>Which is the whole enchilada.</li>
            <li>I would really like to see who they did their test market with because I&#x27;m floored that it made it to prime time.  </li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>wear of the batch of blades I bought with the handle was amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do the job very well.</li>
            <li>This seems like a cool way to shave your head but it barely shaves any hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that its any faster overall than using my trusty Mach 3 or Fusion, but, its nice to use -- just to try something different every once in a while.  </li>
            <li>Although, Gillette and Shick guard their cartridge prices as a top secret, most industry experts put the price of one Fusion (5 blade) cartridge at 21 to 31 cents to manufacture and ship.</li>
            <li>Although, Gillette and Shick guard their cartridge prices as a top secret, most industry experts put the price of one Fusion (5 blade) cartridge at 21 to 31 cents to manufacture and ship.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t great with this at first due to my experience shaving with the Schick - I was either applying pressure or not keeping the wheel down, which is of PARAMOUNT</li>
            <li>Its not a bad product, but for my money I find the regular razors give me not only a better shave, but one where I don&#x27;t cut myself nearly as often.</li>
            <li>The Dead blade makes it quick and easy to do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, straightforward and speedy to use.</li>
            <li>I find the hair at the top of my head grows in one direction only but on the sides it grows a little from the front to the back, which makes for a challenging angle, at the nape it grows sideways, and at the point of the crown it grows in circles (cowlick!)    </li>
            <li>Other than that I am a completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not dull!</li>
            <li>Overall he didn&#x27;t think it was anything special</li>
            <li>; hesitant because the negative reviews seemed to be written much more thoughtfully than the positive ones (several positive reviews were written by spouses of Headblade users, others were in the ballpark of &#x27;headblade rulez&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a Mach 3, I decided to give the Headblade Sport a try.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend you get the Slick as it produces a nice cooling sensation on your scalp while you shave.    </li>
            <li>which you \\&quot;pull\\&quot; down your face, you \\&quot;push\\&quot; the Headblade - it&#x27;s more like a snowplow, or the shovel in my allegory.</li>
            <li>It took me less than 10 minutes the first time to get my head completely shaved...and it was SMOOTH as well!  </li>
            <li>Send a new head blade that works!</li>
            <li>The blades that come with it gunk up easily and are hard to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want your head to be clean shaven, save your $15 and buy new replacement blades for your regular razor.  </li>
            <li>the gillette razor does a better job and leaves me with less nicks than the headblade ever did.    </li>
            <li>It is quicker than using the fusion despite having less blades, and I imagine that is because the blades are more in contact with the scalp using the Headblade than they are using the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was a gift from my better half, also.</li>
            <li>It gives you more control than a typical razor does.  </li>
            <li>And the more worn the cartridge the less coating on the blades to help the hair slide off.  </li>
            <li>main problem with this system is the blade.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the shave I get from a standard razor (I use a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide) but just wanted something more ergonomic and purpose built.  </li>
            <li>I love blades with an open back</li>
            <li>But again, although the shave is decent don&#x27;t expect perfection.</li>
            <li>but it does a fairly decent job</li>
            <li>After a few months of using it, my recommendations (for coarse hair) would be getting yourself some good shaving cream, and using the 4 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>in some ways the sport is easier to use than the classic; think of it as training wheels on a bike.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower, which I HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li>Anyways, I highly recommend this product if you shave your head.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that shaves there head.</li>
            <li>Instead of shaving your noggin&#x27; in front of a sink and mirror I&#x27;d highly suggest shaving in the shower.  </li>

            <li>clean - shaving long passes on your head</li>
            <li>I love this little thing.</li>
            <li>That seems to give me a little more time.  </li>
            <li>He used it last night for the first time and it was the closest shave he has ever gotten!</li>
            <li>For the first few seonds it worked fine</li>
            <li>If you wait too long and the stubble gets too long the razor clogs very easily.</li>
            <li>If you want a really close and complete shave, you&#x27;ll probably agree, and steer away from the Headblade.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about the Headblade Sport after reading the reviews, but for me this has been a great razor.  </li>
            <li>This shaves my head so fast compared to the old style razor.  </li>
            <li>He prefers the weight of his normal razor for shaving his head now and we got rid of this.</li>
            <li>and I consistently get a closer (bare skin</li>
            <li>its really simple to use and well worth the money</li>
            <li>My wife bought me one of these, thinking it would be easier to use than a normal razor.  </li>
            <li>When doing the sides I normally hold the razor between two fingers instead of resting the razor on a finger&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any advantage over a normal razor.</li>
            <li>The main issue is that it clogs up very easy and the hair is hard to remove.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;pop\\&quot; off to be easily snapped back on) if you are unlucky enough to drop it in the sink.</li>
            <li>OK, went back to single edge disposibles no hair clogs</li>
            <li>although the instructions say to switch hands for shaving each side of your head, I stick with my right (I&#x27;m right-handed) since shaving with my left hand</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re obviously doing something right.  </li>
            <li>It is just about as important that this has the right tension as the blade being sharp enough.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is due to the old-tech two blade system used by HeadBlade, but if you&#x27;re going for the smooth, bald look this isn&#x27;t the product to get it with.</li>
            <li>In other words, with almost any of these multi-bladed cartridge claims, you are being robbed and the only thing that is surprising, is that they did not get to your flat screen, yet.</li>

            <li>Pretty cool little guy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newly bald guy...</li>
            <li>I put in a new blade once a week for the \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; factor.</li>
            <li>I put in a new blade once a week for the \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; factor.</li>
            <li>In fact, when the wheels break, I buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d put a new Mach 3 blade in and go to work.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a new way to shave.  </li>
            <li>After a while, though, it was time for new blades, and I bought Walgreens store brand triple-blade sensor blades...</li>
            <li>And Was looking for an entirely new look.</li>
            <li>EVEN WITH A NEW BLADE.   </li>
            <li>As a bald man I&#x27;m always looking for new ways to shave.</li>
            <li>Like all new things it takes time to get used to, at lest that&#x27;s what I told myself.</li>
            <li>Beware of the new ATX model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m back to my usual razor that does the job all the same (even better, actually) and for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I use the head blade daily and gently against the direction of hair growth have achieved a very close shave without any cuts.</li>
            <li>That really surprised me since the HeadBlade uses older style Atra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the Excel blades, if you are willing to buy a 20 pack for almost $40, you can get them as cheap as about $1.95 per cartridge, but usually they are in the range of $2.40.</li>
            <li>Odds are good that you&#x27;ll find something less expensive and/or better than the HeadBlade brand blades.  </li>
            <li>It makes the process very easy to use, and takes much less time than a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep the shovel blade relatively even with the dirt, it will slide across easily.</li>
            <li>I usually shave my head front-to-back at first and then apply some more shaving foam and go back-to-front on a second pass.</li>
            <li>Make sure to tilt your head when you&#x27;re doing the other side and keep the same rules in mind about not applying pressure and keeping the wheel in contact with your scalp.</li>
            <li>I usually shave my head front-to-back at first and then apply some more shaving foam and go back-to-front on a second pass.</li>
            <li>Make sure to tilt your head when you&#x27;re doing the other side and keep the same rules in mind about not applying pressure and keeping the wheel in contact with your scalp.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it the back of my head was cut.</li>
            <li>The blades are exactly what you&#x27;d find in a Mach 3 system, and they share the same problems/benefits of said system.  </li>
            <li>In this case, for me, more is not better.</li>
            <li>I have learned to check the five-star reviews to see how many other products the reviewer has actually written about.  </li>
            <li>if not better than authentic Gillette Sensor Excel</li>
            <li>if not better than authentic Gillette Sensor Excel</li>
            <li>and quadruple-blade cartridges made by HeadBlade clog too easily and don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I really have is it should weigh just a little more so that it contacts the scalp better.</li>
            <li>Normally with my Mach 3, I am able to shave my entire scalp including the tight spots around the ears in about 7 or 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>- Small, light, quicker than with a straight razor,</li>
            <li>Careful to follow the instructions on pressure-placement and technique (with the grain for first 5 uses), I got zero razorburn and absolutely zero nicks.</li>
            <li>I was quite skeptical at first, not to mention worried about shaving my own head, for fear of ending up in the ER.</li>
            <li>But going over the top and down the back, it did a good job and was probably does take a little less time in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I could do long, broad strokes with a standard razor just as easily as with the Headblade).  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get the correct version yellow and black.</li>
            <li>only place I have left to shave is my nether-region, which this thing is not even worthy to touch.</li>
            <li>product is junk, pure and simple.</li>
            <li>The all yellow version has a large finger hole and it is not adjustable.</li>
            <li>That keeps all pressure off the razor, ensuring a smooth glide and little chance for a cut.    </li>
            <li>If you prefer a precise skin tight shave then stick to the modern 3/4/5 blade traditional units on the market.</li>
            <li>Since it takes so little time, I actually keep my head shaved most of the time now.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is typically fine for a shaved face; it unfortunately is not fine when you&#x27;re shaving your head.  </li>
            <li>The novelity here is more about the little race car design (or is it a snowmobile?) than actually making shaving the noggin easier.  </li>
            <li>On the sides and the back it takes a little more work.</li>
            <li>I rinsed the blade better, and dragged the dull blade across my head...</li>
            <li>The difference between the Sport and ATX models is very similar to Coke Classic and New Coke.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are clear that you are not supposed to apply pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is clearly my Chevy, or Springfield if you will.</li>
            <li>It really works - especially with the HeadSlick shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It take 3 or 4 shaves to get completely used to the method</li>
            <li>For a really close shave I&#x27;d recommend use of both the Headblade and a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Just started shaving my head completely bald.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take a few shaves before you&#x27;re comfortable with it, but stick with it</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s going to feel strange at first.</li>

            <li>- it&#x27;s going to feel strange at first.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this razor I had used primarily a Mach 3 and more expensive electric razors to shave my head.</li>
            <li>I even got all the wild stuff around the ears.    </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t even had a nick</li>
            <li>The closest shave you can get with a clipper is 0, which is still longer than what the razor in the HeadBlade can cut through without frequently jamming.  </li>
            <li>I did that one time early on, and my shower looked like the shower scene in &amp;#34;Psycho.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The Headblade does give a much closer shave and is so simple to use.</li>
            <li>finished my shave with my old Shick Xtreme 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I still use one of my old workhorses to get around my ears.  </li>
            <li>So with that said I&#x27;m sticking with old mr. reliable,  the disposable.</li>
            <li>If I’m shaving daily it lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li>The real drawback, especially compared to Gillette and Schick, are the blades themselves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a smooth roll and the blade is cheap.</li>
            <li>The hold it let&#x27;s you have is much easier to use than using a standard angle</li>
            <li>While thats true for ordinary razors, I rarely nick myself with my Fusion while with the headblade even after 2 months of regular use nicks were the norm.  </li>
            <li>I would only recommend the HeadBlade if you&#x27;re looking for something fun rather than an upgrade from your current razor.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much in the past 6 months because I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, but I enjoyed using it the first few months I had it.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on my new look and figure it is a very inexpensive way to get rid of the grey hair.</li>
            <li>With a single pass, and I go against the grain, it takes it down to baby bottom smooth!  </li>
            <li>Which is the whole enchilada.k, you can actually buy one cartridge for as low as 60 cents, and Tri-Flexxx cartridges are actually rated higher than HB3 blades or Gillette Sensor blades.</li>
            <li>I switched to old school wet shaving a long time ago and in my experience all cartridge blades pale in comparison to using a quality razor blade like a Derby or Feather blade in a good DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well into my 2nd month using the same razor and my head is just as clean-shaven as the first day.  </li>
            <li>: The \\&quot;slicking the hair back\\&quot; motion of the Headblade is fun and novel, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really much easier than a Mach 3</li>
            <li>I bought this razor when I first shaved my head because I was led to believe it would be easier and safer than using my regular razor, but have the same result.  </li>
            <li>The only problem with this is that shaving companies have studied this in detail for several decades and what often happens is that the user incurs a much higher chance for nicking themselves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool little gadget for shaving.  </li>
            <li>: If you only want a good-enough shave (getting pretty close but not as close as you could, and leaving a few stubbly spots in the crevices), then you can shave your head pretty quickly with the Headblade--maybe five minutes or less with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dulls quickly and the pushing motion required to use the headblade is totally unnatural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, decent product if you take a few precautions first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, decent product if you take a few precautions first.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was using the head blade that for the fist time EVER I cut a pretty decent sized chunk out of my scalp, and this was after using the blade for a bit and getting used to it (which takes a few times).</li>
            <li>You can use certain 3rd party blades with the included adapter but those blades have the same problem</li>
            <li>I bought this headblade several years ago and soon put it away as I didn&#x27;t like the results as much as those I got with my traditional double-edge safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Many guys probably decide to give the little Sport model a try and then try to take long sweeping arcs over the scalp &#x27;pushing&#x27; the hair off, only to see themselves nicked and giving up on the Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Essentially, the blades get clogged (as expected) but to rinse them is much more cumbersome than with a conventional razor.  </li>
            <li>The major flaw comes in the form of how the razor deals with cut hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought the product with the tripple blades and shaved ever other day for two weeks before changing that first blade.  </li>
            <li>Upon first receiving it, the Headblade Sport appears similar to a tiny snow plow tractor, with a shovel blade up front and wheels in the back.</li>
            <li>If you buy in bulk, you can actually buy one cartridge for as low as 60 cents, and Tri-Flexxx cartridges are actually rated higher than HB3 blades or Gillette Sensor blades.</li>
            <li>did try the Headblade Sport for the first week as the company intended with a pushing motion, and was very careful to not cut myself.</li>
            <li>I was paying a higher price for a nifty looking little gizmo that for me at least, didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as a regular Fusion razor did, nor did it last as long between cartridge changes.  </li>
            <li>I guess there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but I&#x27;m not willing to sacrifice any more of my scalp to round that curve...</li>
            <li>It felt really cool to slip the little yellow race-car on my finger and start head-mowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Gillette 3 blade cartridges and the Dollar General two blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>Apparently the triple-</li>
            <li>It nearly eliminates the nicks and cuts the standard razor tends to produce.</li>
            <li>This thing mowed the stubble off of my head like a commercial zero turn mower on a week old lawn.</li>
            <li>However I also have issues with the blades needing constant rinsing and cleaning with an old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Gimmicky but to practical or useful.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last as long or cut nearly as cleanly as those other razors.</li>
            <li>Just follow the instructions, don&#x27;t push down on the blade, and you&#x27;ll do pretty well.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got to get it down to stubble with clippers first.</li>
            <li>then you are only able to shave a strip of hair HALF the width of a conventional razor!</li>
            <li>and they also seem hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>This has some old-school blade that is really hard to clean between strokes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see a problem with this product, other than price point.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Device is hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;m not limited</li>
            <li>I will point out that I still have difficulty using it on the back of my head and directly and close to the back of my ears.</li>
            <li>By the third or fourth try, it&#x27;ll be totally natural.    </li>
            <li>If you want a nice clean shave without nasty cuts at a decent price, this is NOT the razor for you.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see me trying anything different in the near future.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this razor basically because I was too lazy to go to the store to actually buy one, and it looked cool</li>
            <li>At first I used a Fusion Power razor and felt like it really did the trick; until I tried to use the same blade a second time...and found it too dull to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gives and unbelievably close shave with minimal risk of nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>This is the first blade that I have cut myself with in the past two decades, and I&#x27;m not talking just a nick but a major peel the skin off cut!  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like the headblade, but it&#x27;s just an average</li>
            <li>-No if you have full, thick hair..</li>
            <li>/&gt;blades were not sharp enough and lasted only 2 minutes of use...</li>
            <li>Then, if you want to get down baby-butt smooth, you flip it around on your finger and go back the other way, using the same gesture starting from your nape and moving up to the crown.</li>
            <li>The Headblade wouldn&#x27;t stay flat against my head and kept wobbling from side to side and wasn&#x27;t able to reach some of the tighter areas I need to shave (behind and above my ears)</li>
            <li>Big fingers might like it, but small fingers are better with the newer adjustable model (yellow and black) as pictured.</li>
            <li>As others have stated, it takes about the same time / a little more time to shave with this as a ordinary razor...</li>
            <li>, then you may really like this sporty little razor.</li>
            <li>will need a separate razor to get all the fine grain that the HeadBlade leaves behind on the back of your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>While I am feeling for rough spots and pulling my scalp tight for a close shave the Sport puts the blade right by my opposing fingers to cut those short hairs, while the ATX would be 2 inches away</li>
            <li>This is both good and bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using SensorExcel blades exclusively and the cost/performance ratio is perfect.  </li>

            <li> The best deal after searching it turns out is from Personna (a blade company out of Israel).</li>
            <li> Best way I can find to shave head.</li>

            <li> The quality of the shave is very good.</li>
            <li> Great improvement to an already great design!</li>
            <li> They works brilliantly when I take my dads Mach.</li>
            <li> There shave cream works great and the menthol cools, no razor burn anymore either.  </li>
            <li> follow that up with some headlube (a great moisturizing lotion)</li>
            <li> think the product is great, but it does have some limitation.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Their is no doubt that the Head Blade could be a great product.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be great</li>
            <li> lol.  </li>
            <li> So if Sensor Excel blades are so great, why use a HeadBlade at all?</li>
            <li> Tried it again, and have been happy with it ever since.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product but it must be used as advised.</li>
            <li> but the adapter doesn&#x27;t swivel/rock like the Atra adapter which didn&#x27;t seem to give the Trac II blade the best shot at being effective.</li>
            <li> They work great in my Trac II handle.</li>
            <li> but it may not be the great solution you are expecting.</li>
            <li> I got one of these as a gift from a friend who thought it was a great idea.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for shaving the head.</li>
            <li> Probably a great tool for some, just not us.</li>
            <li> DOES A GREAT JOB.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Now the Headblade works great, and I can&#x27;t imagine anything giving a closer shave with no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ususally go over my head twice, with great results.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was told this product was great for shaving my head</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to, but works great, even against the grain.</li>
            <li> great cut with 4 blade razors</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been that happy.</li>
            <li> great for baldness.</li>
            <li> This razor work great.</li>
            <li> Great concept but not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I never have experienced the problems some people have.  </li>
            <li> The price was great.</li>
            <li> its like running your fingers thru your hair if you had any lol.</li>

            <li> this it perfect for guy that want to go blad but scared to shave there heads, this makes it easy</li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> A word to the wise:  </li>
            <li> Good product I recommend.</li>
            <li> It cut, scraped, gouged and nicked it&#x27;s way across my scalp like a vampire in search of a good meal.    </li>
            <li> This razor, when used with a good blade, will speed up you morning headshaving chore, and it will produce a shave as close as anything you have ever used.</li>
            <li> I prefer a good gel or foam.</li>
            <li> Mach 3 was good.  </li>
            <li> The sport does the job twice as good as the ATX and three times faster.</li>
            <li> This is a really good idea.  </li>
            <li> Because, in principal, it&#x27;s a good idea.]</li>
            <li> the folks who gave this thing good reviews must know the inventor or somthing.</li>
            <li> It works good</li>
            <li> It did a good job in the front</li>
            <li> It did not give as good a shave as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and have recommended it to many of the bald, and balding men I know.</li>
            <li> Do not expect good or excellent results in the first week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not expect good or excellent results in the first week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it , took my about maybe 10 mins to shave and it was great no nicks or cuts and</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Ok!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Outstanding!</li>
            <li> Better than fine, it&#x27;s excellent and better than any face razor I&#x27;ve ever used on my head.  </li>
            <li> The sensor excel blades fit with an adapter, and I have found those to work great on the headblade.    </li>
            <li> Taking it to the shower really softens the hair and has given me the closet and best shaves without cuts.  </li>
            <li> Nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I&#x27;m nice.</li>
            <li> Its a nice gadget to have,</li>
            <li> but, I own and have used both the 3 blade and 4 blade models</li>
            <li> Was a nice concept though.   </li>
            <li> But Headshave, Nice concept.</li>
            <li> A good multi blade razor (5 blade) is easier and more versatile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice concept</li>
            <li> The Headblade Sport is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivered, very nice!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and will now have a razor that allows me to shave my head more than twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed how good this thing is and how simple it is!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving the ol&#x27; bean very easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more effective.  </li>
            <li> far I am getting the best results with Cremo shave cream, and</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing thing I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> Amazing, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> This thing is great, ignore the complaints on here they are not doing something right.  </li>
            <li> As other have mentioned, this works best with a good blade on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li> After a nice hot bath and good scrubbing to exfoliate the skin, I lathered up.</li>
            <li> Showed up super fast ,in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> BE SURE TO GET THEIR SHAVE CREAM TO THIS</li>
            <li> I decided to give the HeadBlade a try to see if it would work better than the 5 blade razor I had been using.</li>
            <li> It worked better</li>
            <li> end-all of the dome clearing world, the shaving creams, lotions, and scrubs that headblade produces are top notch all the way.  </li>
            <li> Use a butter knife you will be better off.</li>
            <li> And the razorblade HeadBlade provides is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> it just takes more time and effort.  </li>
            <li> Just let it ride your head and make sure the wheel stays in contact with your skull at all times.</li>
            <li> stuffs the blade more than shaving your face</li>
            <li> stuffs the blade more than shaving your face</li>
            <li> The fusion costs more, but it works.</li>
            <li> When going against the grain, I find it helps to keep your ring finger off the front of the HB unit and instead try to keep it on top of the ring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to repeat the warning many have already talked about in these reviews.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I love it for neatness and lubrication.</li>
            <li> I have found shaving with a hand lotion or only when your head is continuously under water, produces the best results.</li>
            <li> Using a regular razor also works best for the sideburns and neck hairline.    </li>
            <li> so you can find your favorite blade and put it on here.</li>
            <li> Better stay off from this invovative product.</li>
            <li> and i had some more razors for this one</li>
            <li> So, interesting idea</li>
            <li> Anyway, now I just bite the bullet and fork over the $10 for a set of four authentic HB3 replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> Gouged more than once.  </li>
            <li> so maybe with more practice</li>
            <li> To sum up, use your favorite razor, the one you use for your beard, on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Headblade should spend more time effort and energy in getting a better blade - like a Mach 3 blade.</li>
            <li> think I like this razor most for the way it keeps the blades on my head</li>
            <li> I love it because I am no longer called in to \\&quot;check\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Wish more stores sold these it would be easier to get refills which would make for more convenience.</li>
            <li> well, like most fathers I believe, mine is bald.</li>
            <li> It appears that most of the reviews on this product are from people who bought it for someone else as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> The Headblade&#x27;s form is more intuitive for us head shavers, it does move along your dome the way you want it to, but its form doesn&#x27;t translate as well into shaving effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> When I cut the top off and pulled the plastic apart the Headblade flew out and fell in the sink causing the blade holder to break.</li>
            <li> more like jagged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re better off trying to shave your head with a rusty steak knife.</li>
            <li> it is fun to use, and for me, it worked surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li> The Headblade with the push design does better than all of them.  </li>
            <li> Love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It is more like a gel than like a lathery cream.</li>
            <li> This newer one is even better with the wheel and rubberized finger strap.</li>
            <li> Also, four blades would make it more efficient.</li>
            <li> More design gimmick than anything else.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the newer &amp;#34;revisions&amp;#34; they made to these, they used to be better built/quality.</li>
            <li> This is a push razor, and it will do most of the work for you.  </li>
            <li> If you have gone more than a day or two between shaves then</li>
            <li> this thing is usless exept on the top of the head.</li>
            <li> When I used the Headslick with the Sport, I was able to shave faster and do so safely.</li>
            <li> In 2012, to remedy some of the problems of the Sport model, Headblade introduced their ATX model which does have a better finger holding loop and another curve for the index finger.</li>
            <li> Here on Amazon you can search for their Tri-Flexxx cartridges (which will fit the Headblade Sport and of course, the Sensor Excel (if you still own one))</li>
            <li> , I have no idea :)</li>
            <li> , I have no idea :)</li>
            <li> Then his father in law wanted one when he saw it, so bought some more.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> You just need to be more diligent with it, but I do love the sport.</li>
            <li> If you want a great, fast, thorough shave,  use the Gillette Fusion razor  with the electric mode.  </li>
            <li> The Headblade was a gadget - nothing more.</li>
            <li> my head is nice and smooth</li>
            <li> i love the headblade</li>
            <li> They love it, and being guys, like the car and the toy combination</li>
            <li> If, however, you don&#x27;t mind having visible stubble right after you shave, this may be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li> Great product I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> , I think its pretty good tool, and a novel invention.</li>
            <li> I still got a pretty good shave without the headslick</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it to avoid the blood bath!!</li>
            <li> The wheel is there to make sure the \\&quot;shovel\\&quot; glides easily across the \\&quot;dirt\\&quot; on your head.</li>
            <li> The design is innovative and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I would have hoped the blade assembly would be more suited to easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Makes shaving the head easy and safe.</li>
            <li> and I was able to find compatible replacement cartridges easily.</li>
            <li> The quality of the blade is not as good as many I&#x27;ve used (Gillette, CVS, straight edge).</li>
            <li> I believe they&#x27;re the most important part of the HeadBlade.  </li>
            <li> After visiting a lot of baldy sites and finding that most used the HB I noticed that in all cases the trick to the HB is a light touch.  </li>
            <li> To compare, I am useing the 2 blades now and find that they are not quite as comfortable as the 3 blades, but still exponentially better than the cheaper store bought ones.  </li>
            <li> I scored the Headblade Sport at Walgreen Drugstore recently, and I found that it does an incredible job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Woulda given more stars if available.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the package was supplied with an additional blade holder that works with most blades you get with disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic, tryit, love it, use</li>
            <li> This razor gives the smoothest and most stubble free results.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to relearn all the contours of your scalp and be able to hit them correctly to get a perfectly smooth dome.</li>
            <li> Once you try the one free cartridge included in the package, head here to Amazon.com or another reputable supplier and look up Tri-Flexxx if you went for the Sport model.</li>

            <li> but still he&#x27;s cool!)    </li>
            <li> It made the transition into head shaving easy.  </li>
            <li> It is very quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I can shave my head very quickly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t allow them to be easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to rinse (when you use third-party</li>
            <li> and it was easy.  </li>
            <li> You spend more time trying to clean the cartridge out</li>
            <li> getting around the ears is tricky, and it is easy to nick yourself where your ear meets with your scalp.  </li>
            <li> Many men think they can just figure things out on their own, well this is a product you really should not do that with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use (easier than a face razor)</li>
            <li> Easy to get the hang of to use.</li>
            <li> Flimsy blade mount that comes off too easily.</li>
            <li> It is not a design that allows water to flow easily through it for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Easy way to shave your head without tearing up skin.</li>
            <li> Nivea Active 3 is the perfect amount of lubricant so the razor glides over your head, but it does not clog up your razor.&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li> And so easy.</li>
            <li> For a number of years I have shaved my face in a nice hot shower using Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product, the cool marketing, the design, and even the price and color.</li>
            <li> Now the less than perfect part.</li>
            <li> and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 cartridge is a fine system for shaving your face every 1-3 days.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve learned to shave my head according to how my hair grows and this works just fine.</li>
            <li> I tried both the HB3 blades for three weeks and the Sensor Excel and both did fine.</li>
            <li> do fine that I end up replacing the shaver about every 18 months.  </li>
            <li> Once you account for cleaning up the crevices and tricky areas that the Headblade isn&#x27;t going to get on a quick pass, it&#x27;s probably not going to be any easier than using a Mach 3--in fact, you may find it to be more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The triple-blade razor that comes with it shaves incredibly close, and I didn&#x27;t have one single nick or cut.  </li>
            <li> All this multi-bladed stuff is pure silliness to be honest.</li>
            <li> All this multi-bladed stuff is pure silliness to be honest.</li>
            <li> This little dohickey is awesome!</li>
            <li> This little shaver does a great job!</li>
            <li> good for a nice clean shave of your head, Much better than the conventional blade.</li>
            <li> I will probably always use both razors unless I am in a huge hurry.</li>
            <li> Headblade made a huge mistake by introducing the ATX model.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving my head again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaves that I have received from the Headblade have been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> , aside from the fun factor, the most imporant things that one would want out of the Headblade are closeness of shave, time saved, and ease of use, here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> free sample of HeadSlick shaving cream included in packaging</li>
            <li> And if you fit the Sensor Excel blades on it, then you shouldn&#x27;t notice any leftover stubble.</li>
            <li> The blades are also cheap.  </li>
            <li> No razor is cheap, but this one carries a premium price tag.    </li>
            <li> Before you buy this product, it&#x27;s important to understand what it is and what it is not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wheels in the back of the device help to keep the blades at the correct angle for a great shave every time.</li>
            <li> I used regular Barbasol and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Obviously I can&#x27;t do it smooth in one pass</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done my head is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert at this stuff, I haven&#x27;t been shaving my head for years, but I really do enjoy this</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I think the design of the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; is great, and takes the idea of shaving out of the box, I&#x27;m utterly disapointed with the blades.</li>
            <li> Product has kept my head cut free.  </li>
            <li> The title says it all:  Well-designed but cheaply made unit.  </li>
            <li> Way better than Bic, far better than Schick, and even better than battery powered Gillette Proglide Fusion.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping he would enjoy the razor.  </li>
            <li> , so I think being so cheap</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s a@@.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s handy and fast.</li>
            <li> Buy it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I have alternated back and forth from my Gillette mach 3 turbo to see which I liked better and must say I like my mach 3 turbo much better.</li>
            <li> I can now shave my own head and the back of my neck in 4 to 10 minutes, depending on how picky I&#x27;m being, in the comfort of my own</li>
            <li> I have used them and they aren&#x27;t as good as the standard two-blade Twins you can get at most Walmart stores.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses a Headblade will not achieve superior results in the first week (and maybe, even in the first month).</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried various methods of head shaving I can safely say that Headblade is the absolute best way to get the job done right.</li>
            <li> this thing works way better than it has any right too..</li>
            <li> Ok I started shaving my head a month ago and right after the buzz cut I used the head blade Triple blade.</li>
            <li> Using oil with the Headblade and shaving in the direction that works instead of the direction they say keeps my head clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Within a month, you will probably be shaving more smoothly and faster than with your old Mach 3, Hydro or Fusion Pro Glide, and more cheaply.</li>
            <li> Within a month, you will probably be shaving more smoothly and faster than with your old Mach 3, Hydro or Fusion Pro Glide, and more cheaply.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I did not read the full directions before I began to use this thing but just did what I do by instinct</li>
            <li> I contemplated this purchase for a while, did my research and am excited to say so much better than a regular razor and so much more ergonomic!</li>
            <li> Worth purchasing the extras too!</li>
            <li> The original Headblade had lots of \\&quot;nicking\\&quot; issues.</li>
            <li> She came home so excited, tore it out of the package, and couldn&#x27;t wait for me to try</li>
            <li> Both make a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it was invented by Satan himself.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best selling point, it really only makes a marginal difference over holding a more mainstream blade (like a Gillette fusion or Schick hydro) in a similar fashion.</li>
            <li> Headblade, why would you ever think that rolling the wheels over your foam instead of going blade first was a better thing than what you had with the Sport?</li>
            <li> The Excel was perhaps marginally better, but the price is usually higher as well.</li>
            <li> I was excited upon seeing the possibilities of something aimed at guys who shaved their heads.</li>
            <li> Change the design for easier clean out.    </li>
            <li> To get a really super close smooth shave I always follow up with my Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li> There is no way to get a clean shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be able to outperform the gillette fusion, but it comes nowhere near the performance (granted the fusion costs more).  </li>
            <li> You WILL need to go over the area 2-3 times for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the product and hoped it would make things easier and provide a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Headblade makes it easy and even fun to shave your head.</li>
            <li> you will need to clean the razor after every pass.  </li>
            <li> It seems more natural since I have used it for years and it seems to do a better job of shaving with fewer strokes.</li>
            <li> Works OK but not as good as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Headblade is great, but you have to use the right shaving cream.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product it feels right its easy to use  and gets the job done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always open to a better way to shave my head more efficiently, easily, etc.</li>
            <li> Either way, you will probably not be able to tell a large difference if you were blindfolded.</li>
            <li> Very easy to shave my head smooth smooth smooth without irritation or multiple passes.</li>
            <li> The blades seem to clog up easy and are not rinsed clean very well by shaking in a water filled sink, or with running water.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> However most any modern \\&quot;stick\\&quot; will give you a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much I&#x27;m going to order their FaceBlade and get rid of my Mach 3.    </li>
            <li> The Sport (with its cool sport wheels) has solved those problems.</li>
            <li> The cool thing is this thing is compatible with tons of razor blades</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and is really cool looking.</li>
            <li> Of course, he has a full head of hair.    </li>
            <li> Saw the headblade &amp; thought it was cool.  </li>
            <li> Cool gadget.  </li>
            <li> make a similar dedicated head razor that uses blades, I&#x27;ve heard good things about it but have yet to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve ever ordered any type of $19.99 TV thingy, got it out of the box, and laughed at yourself for being ripped off by the 10 cent item you received, then you can expect to have the same reaction with Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really thought this headblade would be the easiest and most fastest way to shave.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try the Headblade Headslick shaving gel, which is much slicker than most shaving creams.</li>
            <li> I would say I can now shave my entire scalp, and do a good job in about two minutes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though I like the ATX model better, you can use the much cheaper Tri-Flexxx cartridges with the Sport.</li>
            <li> Even though I like the ATX model better, you can use the much cheaper Tri-Flexxx cartridges with the Sport.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 10 years and have even used the single blade razors you can buy one at a time from a truck stop which are much more effective than this.</li>
            <li> It is VERY easy to use, and have yet to even nick myself up more less full out scalp myself!</li>
            <li> The head Blade will give you a quick, uniform shave if you follow the instructions and take your time.  </li>
            <li> A careful shave with a good blade like a Gillette Fusion produces an incredibly smooth result.  </li>
            <li> it would give a quick shave in the morning</li>
            <li> Fairly quick shave.  </li>
            <li> Being a young and mexican and having an incredible hair per inch amount.</li>
            <li> Quick and Efficient.</li>
            <li> The damn thing took a chunk out of my head, with blood quickly covering the shower floor.  </li>
            <li> And you can now find many compatible blades at many different stores.</li>
            <li> I broke my older one after using it for better than 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 20 years now and have tried everything to get a quick, thorough shave.  </li>
            <li> they were last year&#x27;s gifts everyone enjoyed them thank you, one person&#x27;s son stole his, so I may have to get more.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve got a fair amount of hair over a certain length the hair becomes jammed in between the blades on the cartridge at which point the effectiveness of the system is cut in 1/2 or more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as fast or easy as using my tried and true method.</li>
            <li> and it comes clean right away.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t checked Amazon&#x27;s prices for bulk blades, but I&#x27;ve been buying mine at a warehouse club where they&#x27;re pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t checked Amazon&#x27;s prices for bulk blades, but I&#x27;ve been buying mine at a warehouse club where they&#x27;re pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I was pretty much instantly comfortable with using the HeadBlade.  </li>
            <li> honestly can&#x27;t see the benefit of using this product instead of any other 3 or more blade cartridge system out there on the market.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I don&#x27;t work for Headblade, and their products aren&#x27;t that cheap, but they do work and very well!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, after the first week, I just turned the adapter around and now had the HB3 three blade cartridge facing in the correct direction.</li>
            <li> It is a good product as long as you keep up with shaving your head.</li>
            <li> Once you have mastered this razor it is very quick to remove the large areas.</li>
            <li> The razor actually cuts pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This last one, I bought the finger loop is flexible, and makes it feel pretty good in the hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way nice productsafety wise but would only recommend to people who can afford to buy new blades every new use...</li>
            <li> I bet the HeadBlade would be good for somebody with limited range of motion, like if you have a rotator cuff injury, arthritis or anything like that.</li>
            <li> The first thing to remember, though, is DON&#x27;T APPLY ANY PRESSURE TO THE BLADE!</li>
            <li> The head slick shaving stuff is cool, and feels great on the skin, but I don&#x27;t think the cool factor justifies the added expense.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to Mac 3, which I used to use in the shower with no problem and most of the time no shaving cream or anything and never got one cut!</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the ATX model ever so slightly better than the Sport, but Headblade recommends the ATX be used with Headblade&#x27;s higher end bladed cartridges, which means more money for Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good way to visualize it is to think of pushing a flat-blade shovel across some loose dirt.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t rush I&#x27;m fine, because I keep it in a straight line.</li>
            <li> Great little invention.</li>
            <li> This thing is so smooth that you don&#x27;t really need a mirror unless you&#x27;re worried about accidentally shaving off an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> After that, don&#x27;t let it grow out too much, or you&#x27;ll be spending a lot of time getting your head smooth again.</li>
            <li> So I use my Mach 3 on the back which I feel gives me better control and which I feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Headblade for about three weeks and feel sure that I will soon feel comfortable using it on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> The novelty is a lot of fun, and appeals to the gadget-lover in me.  </li>
            <li> This razor is fun to use.</li>
            <li> I just make sure to steer clear of that area, as there is no hair to shave there anyway.    </li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t useful to me at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I switched from a national-brand gel-type shaving cream (the kind that starts as a gel but foams up on your skin) to a different type of shaving cream in the interim.  </li>
            <li> it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> If this helps….my head is smooth on the top, but not in the back.  </li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Just wish that the shave were closer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> it was worth a try..</li>
            <li> If Headblade completely discontinues the Sport model, I&#x27;m sure they will go out of business.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could get this kind of smoothness or quality from trying to use a regular shaving on my head.</li>
            <li> I find the original HB with the feet as opposed to the little wheels provides infinitely more control and provides a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty quick to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using Sensor blades in it right now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Sensor blades in it right now</li>
            <li> this product showed up defective right out of the box.</li>
            <li> On Amazon.com right now, you can get four HB3 cartridges for $8.20 (or $2.05 per cartridge).</li>
            <li> The first time he used it, of course not being ready for it, he cut a huge chunk out of his head.</li>
            <li> very dificult to clean</li>
            <li> After giving it a couple of tries, I threw it away and returned to the more nimble, easily manageable single-blade disposable.  </li>
            <li> if you want the best shave possible due to sheer awkwardness and all the touching up you have to do.    </li>
            <li> Many of us grew up shaving with blades that you had to scrape, pull, tug and grind into your face to get a barely acceptable shave.  </li>
            <li> It was good timing since the previous time I&#x27;d shaved, I&#x27;d cut my ear and lost about a pint of blood</li>
            <li> Super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many deferent methods from electric to old school straight blade</li>
            <li> The learning curve is very similar to what I experienced when I switched to a double edged safety razor for my face.</li>
            <li> I guarantee there is more money spent on the pretty packaging than in the cheap, china-made product</li>
            <li> The first pass shaved a wonderfully smooth swath, a rinse and the second went smooth.  </li>
            <li> No turning back as the Headblade is simple and very effective.  </li>
            <li> the learning curve is very fast and pretty effortless.</li>
            <li> I bought it and was apprehensive about using it at first for fear of having a head looking like chopped liver</li>
            <li> It does a \\&quot;good\\&quot; job, but not one that is stellar.  </li>
            <li> my first thought when using it was where is my bandaids</li>
            <li> /&gt;Closeness: The shave is somewhat close, but the Mach 3 most definitely shaved closer.  </li>
            <li> I shave on a daily basis and I love the Headblade.</li>
            <li> First used the Fusion Pro Glide</li>
            <li> I get exactly what I expect from it at the price I&#x27;m buying: About a year of reliable use.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used generic three blade razors with better performance.  </li>
            <li> I have never bled so much in my life!</li>
            <li> I watched the video first..</li>
            <li> It is important to keep pressure off the blade itself: I usually don&#x27;t even rest my index finger on it but just let it shave under its own weight.</li>
            <li> The first time I didn&#x27;t like it - so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot again - and I&#x27;m still not a fan.</li>
            <li> For the first use of the HB I also used their HeadSlick product.  </li>
            <li> first neck to forehead</li>
            <li> and this is for the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> this product to any one interested.</li>
            <li> but I have mastered it pretty well.      </li>
            <li> Just let it glide, and keep the wheel in gentle contact with your scalp!    </li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it a much higher rating.</li>
            <li> My husband also reported that it gave him more irritation than a regular razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review, my first ever, in response to some of the reviews</li>
            <li> , I go over the same path more than once.  </li>
            <li> so, what is a better present than this?</li>
            <li> you receive one of these from a loved one - smile and be gracious...but don&#x27;t waste YOUR money on one of these - stick with something that will really work - Mach 3, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sporting the Kojak look for about 15 years now and have tried many different approaches to shaving my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bad - learning curve, first week of use was rough,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still get a better shave with my regular razor.</li>
            <li> He said it works okay, but prefers a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Thats the first time that has happened.</li>
            <li> So instead of being able to swish it around in the sink you actually have to run water over it.  </li>
            <li> Quality Egg smooth head, Far from my reaches with this tool on my head.</li>
            <li> Many nicks and cuts and a nickel size gouge on the bump at the back of my head.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a higher rating I would.</li>
            <li> This gadget is perfect for blood sacrifices, but lousy for shaving your head.</li>
            <li> And scoot back to the lab to work on a better design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of a couple of more to have in backup since I don&#x27;t see my hair growing back anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Never cut myself, but I was pretty cautious.</li>
            <li> I use the Headblade as a first pass with a dozen rinses and cleanings before using a Fusion razor with battery to &amp;#34;clean-up&amp;#34; the remaining areas.</li>
            <li> Do not rush shaving with a fresh blade and rinse very often.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> For a quick, comfortable daily shave</li>
            <li> I Seen this product on the net and was very excited to find a store and purchase one.</li>
            <li> With most of your head, it&#x27;s not a big issue, but in certain spots (on my head, anyway), you&#x27;re going to get some nicks and cuts from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which you \\&quot;pull\\&quot; down your face, you \\&quot;push\\&quot; the Headblade - it&#x27;s more like a snowplow, or the shovel in my allegory.is thing is so smooth that you don&#x27;t really need a mirror unless you&#x27;re worried about accidentally shaving off an eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Worked great for first five minutes, then the head slick shave gel that is made by same company clogged up the blade and wouldn&#x27;t rinse out, so I tried to remove the blade to clean it, and the plastic piece snapped.  </li>
            <li> they are cheap  blades, not sharp.</li>
            <li> Optimistic because there were a lot of positive reviews</li>
            <li> It happened to me the first time when I went too fast...</li>
            <li> i was very skepitcal at first and thought what the hell for 11 bucks</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time, it made the save so much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> The grip and gliding action are cool.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hair left in front or on top, so there is not much to worry about there, but it does take more than one pass for me to get every hair.    </li>
            <li> The gillette has a completely open design which allows hair to pass between the blades and easily wash away.  </li>
            <li> so half of my head is bald on it&#x27;s own...</li>
            <li> I shave from the front all the way down to the back of my neck and get a great shave.</li>
            <li> I am certain that had I not tried the headblade, I would not still be shaving my head.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving with this twice and managed to remove two large chunks from my scalp.  </li>
            <li> If there is one thing I have learned by using my refined Merkur 38c HD, is that more blades just equal more skin irritation and increased profits for whoever is selling this stuff to the general public.</li>

            <li> If our hair only grew in 2 directions like the company would like you to believe then the product would be fine as is.    </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the only way that I can get any razor to take it off--</li>
            <li> I recently tried these cheaper cartridges and found them to be just fine.</li>
            <li> I recently tried these cheaper cartridges and found them to be just fine.</li>
            <li> If it feels like your razor is catching or giving you little nicks then change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Headblade just be aware that you may have to use it in conjunction with another razor for the absolute closest shave.</li>
            <li> The Headblade makes shaving much quicker and much easier, doesn&#x27;t matter if you go with or against the grain it still gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It is okay, I&#x27;ve not really tried it, as I give it away as a gift.</li>
            <li> These people must be putting to much pressure or have never shaved their head before.  </li>
            <li> My advice to anybody who wants to try it: read the instructions and don&#x27;t rush</li>
            <li> The company needs to update to modern blades.      </li>
            <li> Gently resting them on your head allows you glide without much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Too much pressure causes bumps, cuts, and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Headblade is MUCH easier to use, and it makes shaving MUCH quicker.</li>
            <li> since I can&#x27;t really see where I&#x27;m shaving....</li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile, I really like it.    </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t follow the instructions (there&#x27;s even a video tutorial on the HeadBlade web site), and you put too much pressure on the blade, or you do not keep the wheel against your scalp, expect to be cut.  </li>
            <li> The Headblade works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Learning to use it is a real challenge</li>
            <li> Reading the directions takes about 10 seconds, and following them is important.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest this to ANYONE who wants to shave their head.</li>
            <li> It did and wonderfully fast too.</li>
            <li> I use it with Headslick cream and the whole job</li>
            <li> and there is way too much room for user error.</li>
            <li> not that much to shave),</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very ergonomic</li>
            <li> :  The shave just isn&#x27;t very close.  </li>
            <li> This is so much easier for me.  </li>
            <li> But when I go too fast, I sometimes let the blade go sideways, resulting in a cut.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift.came with one blade and said standard blade will fit it.</li>
            <li> Straight?  </li>
            <li> but I get a much closer shave with it.</li>
            <li> but i wouild like a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this razor, but after reading reviews I decided to go with it.</li>
            <li> It worked OK, but not really any faster than my DE razor, and not as close a shave.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to the one thing that I really don&#x27;t like about this product, the design of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Much closer shave.</li>
            <li> You don’t have to apply much, if any, downward force.  </li>
            <li> following these steps, I have had a smooth scalp for years.  </li>
            <li> I know, the &amp;#34;newer much betterer&amp;#34; ATX has proprietary blades that I need to order from you whereas the sport uses face blades from the dollar store but</li>
            <li> But, I did not like it, and if that was the only option available to me, I would have rated the Headblade as about 1.5 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> Which is the whole enchilada.</li>
            <li> I would really like to see who they did their test market with because I&#x27;m floored that it made it to prime time.  </li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> wear of the batch of blades I bought with the handle was amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job very well.</li>
            <li> This seems like a cool way to shave your head but it barely shaves any hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that its any faster overall than using my trusty Mach 3 or Fusion, but, its nice to use -- just to try something different every once in a while.  </li>
            <li> Although, Gillette and Shick guard their cartridge prices as a top secret, most industry experts put the price of one Fusion (5 blade) cartridge at 21 to 31 cents to manufacture and ship.</li>
            <li> Although, Gillette and Shick guard their cartridge prices as a top secret, most industry experts put the price of one Fusion (5 blade) cartridge at 21 to 31 cents to manufacture and ship.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t great with this at first due to my experience shaving with the Schick - I was either applying pressure or not keeping the wheel down, which is of PARAMOUNT</li>
            <li> Its not a bad product, but for my money I find the regular razors give me not only a better shave, but one where I don&#x27;t cut myself nearly as often.</li>
            <li> The Dead blade makes it quick and easy to do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, straightforward and speedy to use.</li>
            <li> I find the hair at the top of my head grows in one direction only but on the sides it grows a little from the front to the back, which makes for a challenging angle, at the nape it grows sideways, and at the point of the crown it grows in circles (cowlick!)    </li>
            <li> Other than that I am a completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not dull!</li>
            <li> Overall he didn&#x27;t think it was anything special</li>
            <li> ; hesitant because the negative reviews seemed to be written much more thoughtfully than the positive ones (several positive reviews were written by spouses of Headblade users, others were in the ballpark of &#x27;headblade rulez&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a Mach 3, I decided to give the Headblade Sport a try.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend you get the Slick as it produces a nice cooling sensation on your scalp while you shave.    </li>
            <li> which you \\&quot;pull\\&quot; down your face, you \\&quot;push\\&quot; the Headblade - it&#x27;s more like a snowplow, or the shovel in my allegory.</li>
            <li> It took me less than 10 minutes the first time to get my head completely shaved...and it was SMOOTH as well!  </li>
            <li> Send a new head blade that works!</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it gunk up easily and are hard to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want your head to be clean shaven, save your $15 and buy new replacement blades for your regular razor.  </li>
            <li> the gillette razor does a better job and leaves me with less nicks than the headblade ever did.    </li>
            <li> It is quicker than using the fusion despite having less blades, and I imagine that is because the blades are more in contact with the scalp using the Headblade than they are using the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was a gift from my better half, also.</li>
            <li> It gives you more control than a typical razor does.  </li>
            <li> And the more worn the cartridge the less coating on the blades to help the hair slide off.  </li>
            <li> main problem with this system is the blade.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the shave I get from a standard razor (I use a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide) but just wanted something more ergonomic and purpose built.  </li>
            <li> I love blades with an open back</li>
            <li> But again, although the shave is decent don&#x27;t expect perfection.</li>
            <li> but it does a fairly decent job</li>
            <li> After a few months of using it, my recommendations (for coarse hair) would be getting yourself some good shaving cream, and using the 4 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> in some ways the sport is easier to use than the classic; think of it as training wheels on a bike.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower, which I HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> Anyways, I highly recommend this product if you shave your head.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that shaves there head.</li>
            <li> Instead of shaving your noggin&#x27; in front of a sink and mirror I&#x27;d highly suggest shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> clean - shaving long passes on your head</li>
            <li> clean - shaving long passes on your head</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.</li>
            <li> That seems to give me a little more time.  </li>
            <li> He used it last night for the first time and it was the closest shave he has ever gotten!</li>
            <li> For the first few seonds it worked fine</li>
            <li> If you wait too long and the stubble gets too long the razor clogs very easily.</li>
            <li> If you want a really close and complete shave, you&#x27;ll probably agree, and steer away from the Headblade.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the Headblade Sport after reading the reviews, but for me this has been a great razor.  </li>
            <li> This shaves my head so fast compared to the old style razor.  </li>
            <li> He prefers the weight of his normal razor for shaving his head now and we got rid of this.</li>
            <li> and I consistently get a closer (bare skin</li>
            <li> its really simple to use and well worth the money</li>
            <li> My wife bought me one of these, thinking it would be easier to use than a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> When doing the sides I normally hold the razor between two fingers instead of resting the razor on a finger&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any advantage over a normal razor.</li>
            <li> The main issue is that it clogs up very easy and the hair is hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;pop\\&quot; off to be easily snapped back on) if you are unlucky enough to drop it in the sink.</li>
            <li> OK, went back to single edge disposibles no hair clogs</li>
            <li> although the instructions say to switch hands for shaving each side of your head, I stick with my right (I&#x27;m right-handed) since shaving with my left hand</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re obviously doing something right.  </li>
            <li> It is just about as important that this has the right tension as the blade being sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is due to the old-tech two blade system used by HeadBlade, but if you&#x27;re going for the smooth, bald look this isn&#x27;t the product to get it with.</li>
            <li> In other words, with almost any of these multi-bladed cartridge claims, you are being robbed and the only thing that is surprising, is that they did not get to your flat screen, yet.</li>

            <li> Pretty cool little guy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newly bald guy...</li>
            <li> I put in a new blade once a week for the \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; factor.</li>
            <li> I put in a new blade once a week for the \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; factor.</li>
            <li> In fact, when the wheels break, I buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put a new Mach 3 blade in and go to work.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a new way to shave.  </li>
            <li> After a while, though, it was time for new blades, and I bought Walgreens store brand triple-blade sensor blades...</li>
            <li> And Was looking for an entirely new look.</li>
            <li> EVEN WITH A NEW BLADE.   </li>
            <li> As a bald man I&#x27;m always looking for new ways to shave.</li>
            <li> Like all new things it takes time to get used to, at lest that&#x27;s what I told myself.</li>
            <li> Beware of the new ATX model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m back to my usual razor that does the job all the same (even better, actually) and for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I use the head blade daily and gently against the direction of hair growth have achieved a very close shave without any cuts.</li>
            <li> That really surprised me since the HeadBlade uses older style Atra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the Excel blades, if you are willing to buy a 20 pack for almost $40, you can get them as cheap as about $1.95 per cartridge, but usually they are in the range of $2.40.</li>
            <li> Odds are good that you&#x27;ll find something less expensive and/or better than the HeadBlade brand blades.  </li>
            <li> It makes the process very easy to use, and takes much less time than a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep the shovel blade relatively even with the dirt, it will slide across easily.</li>
            <li> I usually shave my head front-to-back at first and then apply some more shaving foam and go back-to-front on a second pass.</li>
            <li> Make sure to tilt your head when you&#x27;re doing the other side and keep the same rules in mind about not applying pressure and keeping the wheel in contact with your scalp.</li>
            <li> I usually shave my head front-to-back at first and then apply some more shaving foam and go back-to-front on a second pass.</li>
            <li> Make sure to tilt your head when you&#x27;re doing the other side and keep the same rules in mind about not applying pressure and keeping the wheel in contact with your scalp.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it the back of my head was cut.</li>
            <li> The blades are exactly what you&#x27;d find in a Mach 3 system, and they share the same problems/benefits of said system.  </li>
            <li> In this case, for me, more is not better.</li>
            <li> I have learned to check the five-star reviews to see how many other products the reviewer has actually written about.  </li>
            <li> if not better than authentic Gillette Sensor Excel</li>
            <li> if not better than authentic Gillette Sensor Excel</li>
            <li> and quadruple-blade cartridges made by HeadBlade clog too easily and don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I really have is it should weigh just a little more so that it contacts the scalp better.</li>
            <li> Normally with my Mach 3, I am able to shave my entire scalp including the tight spots around the ears in about 7 or 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> - Small, light, quicker than with a straight razor,</li>
            <li> Careful to follow the instructions on pressure-placement and technique (with the grain for first 5 uses), I got zero razorburn and absolutely zero nicks.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical at first, not to mention worried about shaving my own head, for fear of ending up in the ER.</li>
            <li> But going over the top and down the back, it did a good job and was probably does take a little less time in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I could do long, broad strokes with a standard razor just as easily as with the Headblade).  </li>
            <li> Make sure you get the correct version yellow and black.</li>
            <li> only place I have left to shave is my nether-region, which this thing is not even worthy to touch.</li>
            <li> product is junk, pure and simple.</li>
            <li> The all yellow version has a large finger hole and it is not adjustable.</li>
            <li> That keeps all pressure off the razor, ensuring a smooth glide and little chance for a cut.    </li>
            <li> If you prefer a precise skin tight shave then stick to the modern 3/4/5 blade traditional units on the market.</li>
            <li> Since it takes so little time, I actually keep my head shaved most of the time now.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is typically fine for a shaved face; it unfortunately is not fine when you&#x27;re shaving your head.  </li>
            <li> The novelity here is more about the little race car design (or is it a snowmobile?) than actually making shaving the noggin easier.  </li>
            <li> On the sides and the back it takes a little more work.</li>
            <li> I rinsed the blade better, and dragged the dull blade across my head...</li>
            <li> The difference between the Sport and ATX models is very similar to Coke Classic and New Coke.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are clear that you are not supposed to apply pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is clearly my Chevy, or Springfield if you will.</li>
            <li> It really works - especially with the HeadSlick shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It take 3 or 4 shaves to get completely used to the method</li>
            <li> For a really close shave I&#x27;d recommend use of both the Headblade and a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Just started shaving my head completely bald.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a few shaves before you&#x27;re comfortable with it, but stick with it</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s going to feel strange at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a few shaves before you&#x27;re comfortable with it, but stick with it</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s going to feel strange at first.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this razor I had used primarily a Mach 3 and more expensive electric razors to shave my head.</li>
            <li> I even got all the wild stuff around the ears.    </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t even had a nick</li>
            <li> The closest shave you can get with a clipper is 0, which is still longer than what the razor in the HeadBlade can cut through without frequently jamming.  </li>
            <li> I did that one time early on, and my shower looked like the shower scene in &amp;#34;Psycho.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The Headblade does give a much closer shave and is so simple to use.</li>
            <li> finished my shave with my old Shick Xtreme 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I still use one of my old workhorses to get around my ears.  </li>
            <li> So with that said I&#x27;m sticking with old mr. reliable,  the disposable.</li>
            <li> If I’m shaving daily it lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li> The real drawback, especially compared to Gillette and Schick, are the blades themselves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a smooth roll and the blade is cheap.</li>
            <li> The hold it let&#x27;s you have is much easier to use than using a standard angle</li>
            <li> While thats true for ordinary razors, I rarely nick myself with my Fusion while with the headblade even after 2 months of regular use nicks were the norm.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend the HeadBlade if you&#x27;re looking for something fun rather than an upgrade from your current razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much in the past 6 months because I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, but I enjoyed using it the first few months I had it.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on my new look and figure it is a very inexpensive way to get rid of the grey hair.</li>
            <li> With a single pass, and I go against the grain, it takes it down to baby bottom smooth!  </li>
            <li> Which is the whole enchilada.k, you can actually buy one cartridge for as low as 60 cents, and Tri-Flexxx cartridges are actually rated higher than HB3 blades or Gillette Sensor blades.</li>
            <li> I switched to old school wet shaving a long time ago and in my experience all cartridge blades pale in comparison to using a quality razor blade like a Derby or Feather blade in a good DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well into my 2nd month using the same razor and my head is just as clean-shaven as the first day.  </li>
            <li> : The \\&quot;slicking the hair back\\&quot; motion of the Headblade is fun and novel, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really much easier than a Mach 3</li>
            <li> I bought this razor when I first shaved my head because I was led to believe it would be easier and safer than using my regular razor, but have the same result.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with this is that shaving companies have studied this in detail for several decades and what often happens is that the user incurs a much higher chance for nicking themselves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool little gadget for shaving.  </li>
            <li> : If you only want a good-enough shave (getting pretty close but not as close as you could, and leaving a few stubbly spots in the crevices), then you can shave your head pretty quickly with the Headblade--maybe five minutes or less with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dulls quickly and the pushing motion required to use the headblade is totally unnatural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, decent product if you take a few precautions first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, decent product if you take a few precautions first.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was using the head blade that for the fist time EVER I cut a pretty decent sized chunk out of my scalp, and this was after using the blade for a bit and getting used to it (which takes a few times).</li>
            <li> You can use certain 3rd party blades with the included adapter but those blades have the same problem</li>
            <li> I bought this headblade several years ago and soon put it away as I didn&#x27;t like the results as much as those I got with my traditional double-edge safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Many guys probably decide to give the little Sport model a try and then try to take long sweeping arcs over the scalp &#x27;pushing&#x27; the hair off, only to see themselves nicked and giving up on the Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Essentially, the blades get clogged (as expected) but to rinse them is much more cumbersome than with a conventional razor.  </li>
            <li> The major flaw comes in the form of how the razor deals with cut hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought the product with the tripple blades and shaved ever other day for two weeks before changing that first blade.  </li>
            <li> Upon first receiving it, the Headblade Sport appears similar to a tiny snow plow tractor, with a shovel blade up front and wheels in the back.</li>
            <li> If you buy in bulk, you can actually buy one cartridge for as low as 60 cents, and Tri-Flexxx cartridges are actually rated higher than HB3 blades or Gillette Sensor blades.</li>
            <li> did try the Headblade Sport for the first week as the company intended with a pushing motion, and was very careful to not cut myself.</li>
            <li> I was paying a higher price for a nifty looking little gizmo that for me at least, didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as a regular Fusion razor did, nor did it last as long between cartridge changes.  </li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but I&#x27;m not willing to sacrifice any more of my scalp to round that curve...</li>
            <li> It felt really cool to slip the little yellow race-car on my finger and start head-mowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Gillette 3 blade cartridges and the Dollar General two blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Apparently the triple-</li>
            <li> It nearly eliminates the nicks and cuts the standard razor tends to produce.</li>
            <li> This thing mowed the stubble off of my head like a commercial zero turn mower on a week old lawn.</li>
            <li> However I also have issues with the blades needing constant rinsing and cleaning with an old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Gimmicky but to practical or useful.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long or cut nearly as cleanly as those other razors.</li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions, don&#x27;t push down on the blade, and you&#x27;ll do pretty well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to get it down to stubble with clippers first.</li>
            <li> then you are only able to shave a strip of hair HALF the width of a conventional razor!</li>
            <li> and they also seem hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> This has some old-school blade that is really hard to clean between strokes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see a problem with this product, other than price point.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Device is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;m not limited</li>
            <li> I will point out that I still have difficulty using it on the back of my head and directly and close to the back of my ears.</li>
            <li> By the third or fourth try, it&#x27;ll be totally natural.    </li>
            <li> If you want a nice clean shave without nasty cuts at a decent price, this is NOT the razor for you.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see me trying anything different in the near future.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this razor basically because I was too lazy to go to the store to actually buy one, and it looked cool</li>
            <li> At first I used a Fusion Power razor and felt like it really did the trick; until I tried to use the same blade a second time...and found it too dull to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gives and unbelievably close shave with minimal risk of nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> This is the first blade that I have cut myself with in the past two decades, and I&#x27;m not talking just a nick but a major peel the skin off cut!  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the headblade, but it&#x27;s just an average</li>
            <li> -No if you have full, thick hair..</li>
            <li> /&gt;blades were not sharp enough and lasted only 2 minutes of use...</li>
            <li> Then, if you want to get down baby-butt smooth, you flip it around on your finger and go back the other way, using the same gesture starting from your nape and moving up to the crown.</li>
            <li> The Headblade wouldn&#x27;t stay flat against my head and kept wobbling from side to side and wasn&#x27;t able to reach some of the tighter areas I need to shave (behind and above my ears)</li>
            <li> Big fingers might like it, but small fingers are better with the newer adjustable model (yellow and black) as pictured.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, it takes about the same time / a little more time to shave with this as a ordinary razor...</li>
            <li> , then you may really like this sporty little razor.</li>
            <li> will need a separate razor to get all the fine grain that the HeadBlade leaves behind on the back of your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> While I am feeling for rough spots and pulling my scalp tight for a close shave the Sport puts the blade right by my opposing fingers to cut those short hairs, while the ATX would be 2 inches away</li>
            <li> This is both good and bad.  </li>
            <li> but this shaver just slide over your middle finger and all you do is basically run your hand over your head with minimal pressure... and in half the time of an electric shaver... and with a MUCH closer shave... not a single cut!</li>
            <li> The standard blade is bad, and the triple blades that you can buy, while better, always gave me trouble when trying to clean them out.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how this product can get the positive reviews that it did, but everyone has a different head shape and hair type.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll also do a decent job around your ears, although I still use the Fusion for a little clean-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll also do a decent job around your ears, although I still use the Fusion for a little clean-up.</li>
            <li> This is my second Headblade, the first one lasted about 5-6 years and then the hard plastic handle where your finger goes finally broke.</li>
            <li> All the other razors I have used for my head did not work nearly as well; there is no need to even put any pressure while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another aspect which struck me as a bit strange, is that the HB 3 razor blade cartridge (more on this in a bit), was turned around wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and though the design was mostly to look cool/trendy, until my third or so shave with it without a single cut.</li>
            <li> If, however, you&#x27;re looking for a tool to give you a decent (but flawed) shave fairly quickly, then you may really like this sporty little razor.ut flawed) shave fairly quickly</li>
            <li> A flat out no-brainer</li>
            <li> Once you get started, go slow for the first week until you start to learn the correct pressures and shape of your skull.</li>
            <li> Once you get started, go slow for the first week until you start to learn the correct pressures and shape of your skull.</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s less mess to worry about and the hot water will keep your stubble softer.</li>
            <li> i mean it looks like a gillette razor and a hot wheel had latenight drunken sex at a party and this was the result.</li>
            <li> Decided to try a new look where I shave my scalp every few days and was looking for something that would be faster (and hopefully cheaper) than the Mach 3</li>
            <li> so for the last few months I have been using my trusty gillette mach 3 to shave my head \\&quot;old school\\&quot; style.  </li>
            <li> It really should not be that hard.  </li>
            <li> and it seems a little gimmicky at first blush,</li>
            <li> But the blades seem to dull fast (bear in mind</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long other blades normally last, but these do seem to go quick, even with my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently, though, I got tired of cutting up my head and got it out for another try, and found it works great.  </li>
            <li> Son liked but got easily frustrated when he couldn&#x27;t replace the blade</li>
            <li> After watching my hair turn grey and thinning, and being prompted by a cancer fundraiser, I decided to permanently shave my head.</li>
            <li> If you shave your head regularly, there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn&#x27;t have this in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week of so of careful shaving it becomes second nature to use.</li>
            <li> If your hair is too long the HeadBlade will not work like it should.</li>
            <li> but it took too long and not that close.</li>
            <li> I expect that this think will wind up in a drawer or trash before long.  </li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t go too long between shaves or the blade</li>
            <li> By using the Headblade in a pulling motion (like a Gillette Fusion, Mach 3, Merkur, etc....), I found I did not need to be as worried about minor nicks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Headblades own blades are pretty terrible</li>
            <li> OK, so I decide that cutting what hair I have left with an electric clippers isn&#x27;t close enough, so I start shaving &#x27;er all the way down.  </li>
            <li> After using a regular old razor for a few months, I decided to try this out due to some rave reviews (and price).</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the shave is not a close as with some of the other razors I have tried.  </li>
            <li> One thing to watch out for that is different than other razors</li>
            <li> My husband and I reluctently purchased the headblade razor due to all of the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> I first began with the Headblade Sport, I was using generic menthol shaving cream which worked well enough but not excellently.</li>
            <li> and I cannot recommend Nivea Active 3 enough.  </li>
            <li> but once you got to the middle and back where you can&#x27;t see, it started missing spots.</li>
            <li> The single blade is not close at all.</li>
            <li> But it is a single blade, of course it will not compete with a Mach 3 or Fusion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades last me a couple of weeks on average.  </li>
            <li> I have two dark scabs on the back of my head</li>
            <li> (the exact engineering reason behind this is because of stress preceding the blades as affects skin folding).</li>
            <li> If you hold the Headblade \\&quot;up\\&quot; like a traditional razor, the blades are going to be pointing UP rather than down.</li>
            <li> If you hold the Headblade \\&quot;up\\&quot; like a traditional razor, the blades are going to be pointing UP rather than down.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a product that was designed for actually shaving your head after you&#x27;ve buzzed it on down with a 0 blade clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancee because he was starting to shave down to the skin</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for over 8 years with various types of disposable razors, usually the single or double razor varieties.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, just, but more awkward than a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> So I searched the &#x27;net until I found the HeadBlade and decided to pick one up at my local drug store along with a bottle of the Slick head-shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> As some have previously stated, the razors do not shave close enough.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to me is that the front of the razor is the same width as the blade so it can get tricky in the small areas around the ears.</li>
            <li> In my case I must shave my head about every other day with this, but if I use any other razor I can go about every third day.</li>
            <li> The blades are way too expensive ($25 for four) to be going through them that quickly.    </li>
            <li> Dulls after single use.</li>
            <li> I finally had to revert to my electric razor to cleanup the mess.</li>
            <li> hairs were stuck in the blades and were not clean after several water  cleaning also...</li>
            <li> Which means the only avenue for cleaning the blades is from the front where you will likely cut your fingers or dull the blades in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it may very well be similar to the eternal Ford vs. Chevy debate (sorry Dodge guys), or the Glock vs. Springfield armory debate.</li>
            <li> Irritation is also minimal once you get the hang of the blade, but don&#x27;t expect to just pick it up and use it like a pro.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the sport version of this product, but I doubt I&#x27;ll waste my money trying the others.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t do what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was shipped promptly and as expected.</li>
            <li> I have trouble using a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin by saying this is one of the few times I have ever lied to her, only to spare her feelings....</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening the package because it is sealed up like Fort Knox.</li>
            <li> After every stroke triple the effort was spent cleaning the hair out of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been shaving my head for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I wasted ten bucks..</li>
            <li> of my few complaints about the Sport model is the rubberized middle finger ring that helps you to hold it.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for a few years and tried just about every method and also going back to the trusty gillette...</li>
            <li> Unfotunately, it is harder to find replacement blades for the Sport model.  </li>
            <li> Can you please make one in pink for her?</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say, it works as it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> I took it real slow the first time I used it and NO CUTS.</li>
            <li> Letting the blade just glide over my head using virtually no pressure at all, I&#x27;d follow with my free hand and realized that it was actually cutting all the stubble that I could not remove any other way.  </li>
            <li> One other thing: although the instructions say to switch hands for shaving each side of your head, I stick with my right (I&#x27;m right-handed) since shaving with my left hand feels so awkward.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that the first shave with a regular razor wouldn&#x27;t have gone as well.  </li>
            <li> as some other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> So I looked to the Headblade after reading some reviews and doing other reasearch and decided to purcahse one to shave my head and leave the Fusion to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It allows me to feel with my other hand where I&#x27;ve been and where I need to go.  </li>
            <li> other thing:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head, one way or the other, for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I think this is due to the push (rather than pull) motion of this razor.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried their other products, but after reading reviews, I&#x27;ll have to.  </li>
            <li> I sharpen them every other day on my jeans.</li>
            <li> and I suspect this may have happened to some of the other &#x27;reviewers&#x27; who bought this as a present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does not get a close shave due to the blades.</li>
            <li> Sharp?  </li>
            <li> As with other razors this is sharp.  </li>
            <li> And I turned to an extreme.</li>
            <li> I have never cut myself due to any “shape” issues with my head.  </li>
            <li> I have never cut myself due to any “shape” issues with my head.  </li>
            <li> I had never cut my scalp like that before using other blades.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every other to three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Consider exploring other options on blades, however.</li>
            <li> will need to take extra care (go very slow) while shaving the back of your head.</li>
            <li> The wheels feel like they are a little loose on the axel.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> If quick and dirty is your goal, get a head blade.  </li>
            <li> The only times I have cut myself is when I used a dull blade that I knew I should have replaced, and those were only small nicks.  </li>

            <li> Same not so round wheels with sharp mold lines, same sad bent axle, and the same crap-tacular</li>
            <li> I found I use my conventional razor about as often as I use this one.  </li>
            <li> Bics seemed a little rough.  </li>
            <li> Do the other half, then rinse.  </li>
            <li> Switch the razor around and do the other direction, half the head at a time.  </li>
            <li> the razor was flimsy and not worth the effort or getting a replacement.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair grew in so fast</li>
            <li> I tried going with the direction at least 6 different times/sessions</li>
            <li> Not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> You simply need to have the wheel and the blade in contactwith your scalp and glide your hand over your head slowly.    </li>
            <li> Plus after a few tries you won&#x27;t need access to a mirror.  </li>
            <li> takes less than five minutes, which is quite a bit faster than with conventional razors.  </li>
            <li> And it is yellow and black, which at least to me, looks kinda</li>
            <li> but once you have it down shaving is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> I have to tell you, hands down-</li>
            <li> and before I knew what was happining blood was running down my neck</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the technique of using the Headblade down, but after that, I started to cruise.  </li>
            <li> Blood was running down my head like I had been mauled by an owl.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll cut yourself if you press down.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t use it correctly, meaning keeping the wheels down, you will cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> It allows the cartridge to move up and down and tilt with the shape of your head.  </li>
            <li> If you push down into your skull you will lose some skin.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> and you will start pushing down leading to a scalping.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> but the blade turn me down.</li>
            <li> Since using it the number of nicks on my scale have gone down.</li>
            <li> For him it didn&#x27;t, and that was even after clipping his hair down to use this.</li>
            <li> My mean goatee and shaved head already scare enough people.</li>
            <li> My mean goatee and shaved head already scare enough people.</li>
            <li> My wife (and other women too!)</li>
            <li> Time spent with the HeadBlade vs. the previous razor dropped in half after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> Definitely took my time for the first week, was a little painful but never had any nicks/cuts.</li>
            <li> poor design, difficult to use;  don&#x27;t push too hard, you&#x27;ll cut yourself, cause it&#x27;s unatural to \\&quot;push\\&quot; the blade over your skin, rather than \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the blades as with most other shaving blades.</li>
            <li> (slight exaggeration)</li>
            <li> Now that I have the hang of it, it takes me less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I got a billiard ball finish in less then 5 minuets</li>
            <li> I have to agree with a previous poster,</li>
            <li> I have the typical \\&quot;horseshoe haircut\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I do half my head in one direction, then rinse the blade.  </li>
            <li> The headblade is faster, closer and leaves my head less irritated.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t nicked my scalp at all previously.      </li>
            <li> Used in the shower you can shave your head in less than 2 min.</li>
            <li> About half the length of a Fusion ProGlide razor.</li>
            <li> It was too flexible and in several angles, it was difficult to maintain a proper grasp to get close cuts.</li>
            <li> i ever had in half the time.</li>
            <li> It feels odd, cumbersome, and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Seriously, based on my extensive experience.</li>
            <li> not careful, you will nick yourself behind the ears with the HeadBlade.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The HB comes with a little black plastic adapter to accept Sensor cartridges.    </li>
            <li> Alluring design, but the reality is that is does not work well in tight areas--</li>
            <li> spaces between blades are tight.</li>
            <li> Not sure how other people end up nicking themselves.</li>
            <li> so I could go a little longer without having to shave it again.  </li>
            <li> so the water can wash off all the little hairs that get stuck in between the blades.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the shave will be a little closer.  </li>
            <li> Use a little bit of shaving cream or something of the sort.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for a couple months now and it has been difficult, and painful, to find a razor that works well without tearing the top of my head off!</li>
            <li> With the grain I didn&#x27;t notice the sport really cutting very well, so I went against the grain.</li>
            <li> I have been using for close to 2 weeks and shave everyday in shower and have never even felt like i was about to cut myself.  </li>
            <li> Also shave everyday and the triple blades do not clog at all as some people have stated.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, one of my college professors recommended this razor as he also shaves his head.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this inferior product.</li>
            <li> And If I go against the grain, I might as well hover a knife over my head and take a few pokes.   </li>
            <li> I’m going to list a few tips I’ve learned over the years;&lt;br /&gt;1)  </li>
            <li> second time the thing slipped and went sideway and sliced a thin chunk of skin out of my head that I had to pull out of the blades..</li>
            <li> waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head everyday, and I have been for about five years.  </li>
            <li> It uses outdated blades, and it simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> When you remove it from the stupid vacuum plastic packaging, what first strikes you is how small it is.</li>
            <li> 30% of the reviews for this product are \\&quot;singletons\\&quot; - in other words, the \\&quot;reviewer\\&quot; only reviewed this product which seems highly unlikely and wholly suspect.  </li>
            <li> that blade spring that you use is so stiff you have to push down so hard you take chunks of skin off your scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over a two years now and thought that this might be a less awkward way to shave the old chrome dome.    </li>
            <li> My first experience with the HeadBlade was a painful bloodbath, but that&#x27;s because I pressed down too hard.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave my head every other day or every day so the stubble is not too thick.</li>
            <li> However, I hate the actual use of the headBlade as my head is not perfectly round - if it were, it&#x27;d probably be easier to use.</li>
            <li> but will when I run out of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use very little Cremo</li>
            <li> First time I blamed myself for pressing too hard and it wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> If you get past the 3 day mark the Mach 3 system begins to show its flaws.  </li>
            <li> He was not really sure it would work.</li>
            <li> (I used those in the past).    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my purchase, I have used both the Headblade with Slick nine times.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is the intention</li>
            <li> I use it once, and stopped after shaving a small portion of my head.</li>
            <li> I had seen it advertised on TV, so I was intrigued and anxious to use it.  </li>
            <li> I thought he that just what the doc order, unfortunately my head blade left me cuts and abrasions  </li>
            <li> The pushing motion vs. the pulling motion is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Yea, I did Prep work, like Cleaner Headshave, Head shed, Head Slick.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the changes, but I probably won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all with this product.</li>
            <li> The hair is trapped by the plastic housing surrounding the blades, clogging the blade, and rendering it useless within a single swipe.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced any of the problems other people have stated.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that the system that attaches the blade to the yellow plastic part prevents access to the blade from behind.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is it&#x27;s a bit difficult to shave around the ears.</li>
            <li> suck, 2 blade too close to each other, after a few shave hairs stuck in between, then it become useless.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be the first person that found these blades to be worthless.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than having to go to an appointment with blood running down your head.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than having to go to an appointment with blood running down your head.</li>
            <li> After several bad experiences with conventional razors, I gave up and settled for \\&quot;clipper-close\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product and was getting tired of shaving with a normal razor at an awkward angle so decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve been unable to shave with this device without cutting myself pretty severely.</li>
            <li> I hardly get those now.  </li>
            <li> Was hard to keep on my head and didn&#x27;t shave close.</li>
            <li> it is custom made so when it gets dull you have to order it from the company it comes with.</li>
            <li> so I use mine with Atra 2 carts which are getting hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dovo</li>
            <li> It def shave the head but it seems like the blades are too dull.</li>
            <li> This can be tricky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> will have a hard time going through all the hair.  </li>
            <li> This product was hard to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now using a Gillette Fusion, which is the closest shave (and least amount of irritation) that I&#x27;ve found for my head.  </li>
            <li> Others have complained about the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am clumsy, but for some reason the triple-blade gives me a smoother shave as well as a closer one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be late for work</li>
            <li> My advice:  Go with the Headblade brand razor blades, or at least Gillette&#x27;s blades.      </li>
            <li> After a few passes, i was cut so badly in the back of my head, and it bled for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is also the number one complaint against the Headblade Sport (or ATX) here at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I always had thick stubble.  </li>
            <li> Based of my experience, Against the grain for my thick hair &#x3D; Badbadbad.</li>
            <li> just GO SLOWLY and apply no pressure.  </li>
            <li> I will admit to being a little over zealous the first time I used it, which resulted in the worst cut I&#x27;ve ever had while shaving, but that wasn&#x27;t the fault of the Headblade; You need to take your time while learning to shave with this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving with this blade is as awkward if not more awkward as a normal razor.</li>
            <li> and I had 5 serious cuts before I stopped..</li>
            <li> The razor and the refills are ridiculously priced.</li>
            <li> The blades are simply impossible to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring the technology of the blades up to the standard of the handle, and this will become a razor, instead of a novelty.</li>
            <li> The design is making it a little difficult to shave around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do buy it do not use in the shower without a mirror or you will have a bunch of little random tufts.</li>
            <li> Fell apart on second use, nicked me badly both times I used it</li>
            <li> I hated these blades so much I thought about writing the company.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite a clutz and this typically resulted in my cutting behind my ear at least once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> the arms that hold the blade in place were weak and would not keep the blade sturdy.</li>
            <li> You do not want to push down or you will end up cutting your head.</li>
            <li> When the instructions tell you not to put any pressure on the razor while you&#x27;re shaving, they mean it!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> It would have produced the same stupid feeling I have.</li>
            <li> The head blade system itself is a stupid gimmick that actually limits your control and leverage.  </li>
            <li> This was the absolute worst purchase of my life!</li>
            <li> Being a poor college student at the time, I noted it but never tried one out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not great.  </li>
            <li> Still have to use another razor to get behind the ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> clip for holding on the blade is so brittle and thin that it just crumbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I go with the grain, The shave is poor, I run my hands against grain.</li>
            <li> But poor work is done.  </li>
            <li> It is the absolute worst.  </li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave, not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a time saver if you want a sloppy shave</li>
            <li> I use Pinaud Clubman aftershave and it didn&#x27;t sting nearly as bad as in previous shaves  </li>
            <li> still find it difficult to shave around the ears without missing a spot or cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this company is still in business, the triple blades themselves are stacked so close that after two strokes hair gets jammed between the blades and makes it unusable until you bang the hair out, over and over, literally after every stroke (breaking the stupid wheels off)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that was not the case.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.    </li>
            <li> Something is wrong here.</li>
            <li> If you feel you get your closest shave by going against the grain, be skeptical.</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because I think the blades are a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, it performs.</li>
            <li> But shaving my head with a razor made me feel uncomfortable always afraid of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> before i bleed to death i am amazed that it can cut you so severly without cutting the hair</li>
            <li> cause I was scared of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Dirty</li>
            <li> feels so awkward.</li>
            <li> Some people have said that they have problems with cutting.</li>
            <li> Quality product doesn&#x27;t feel awkward.</li>
            <li> I got it to save my head as I kept cutting my self with the razor,</li>
            <li> it is awkward to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> razor is a GIMMICKY and HORRIBLE design!</li>
            <li> That is not the head blades fault for cutting me</li>
            <li> I cannot call the headblade a bad product by any means, heck</li>
            <li> This isn’t as bad as it sounds.  </li>
            <li> I have never cut my self so bad or so painfully while shaving.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at all the 1 star reviews for the Headblade Sport.  </li>
            <li> The shaving cream is terrible and expensive.</li>
            <li> Give it a shave or two or three before giving up on it, you won’t be disappointed..  </li>
            <li> Give it a shave or two or three before giving up on it, you won’t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!  </li>
            <li> What a piece of crap design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the blades are merciless!  </li>
            <li> I now have 2 very painful chunks taken out of my head.</li>
            <li> WRONG.This thing is the worst razor i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> And my head was HORRIBLY IRRITATED!  </li>
            <li> The razor burn and irritation for terrible.  </li>
            <li> Well I cut my head worst with this.</li>
            <li> the worst shave I ever gotten!</li>
            <li> What a bad idea!!!  </li>
            <li> The longer the hair the worst this gets.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten some cuts and scratches from shaving my face and head before, but this was insane.  </li>
            <li> Either way, that thing was evil.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is okay, I&#x27;ve not really tried it, as I give it away as a gift.</li>
            <li> After watching my hair turn grey and thinning, and being prompted by a cancer fundraiser, I decided to permanently shave my head. My son has had a shaved head for years so I asked about the head blade. I bought it and was apprehensive about using it at first for fear of having a head looking like chopped liver (slight exaggeration) as some other reviewers have noted. For a number of years I have shaved my face in a nice hot shower using Gillette Mach 3. I continue the practice however now I shave my entire head. Taking it to the shower really softens the hair and has given me the closet and best shaves without cuts.  I use the head blade daily and gently against the direction of hair growth have achieved a very close shave without any cuts. I will point out that I still have difficulty using it on the back of my head and directly and close to the back of my ears. So I use my Mach 3 on the back which I feel gives me better control and which I feel comfortable with. I have been using the Headblade for about three weeks and feel sure that I will soon feel comfortable using it on the back of my head. I do use the Headslick shave cream. I am very happy with the Headblade and would recommend it to others. I get a lot of compliments on my new look and figure it is a very inexpensive way to get rid of the grey hair.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product it feels right its easy to use  and gets the job done</li>
            <li> poor design, difficult to use;  don&#x27;t push too hard, you&#x27;ll cut yourself, cause it&#x27;s unatural to \\&quot;push\\&quot; the blade over your skin, rather than \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the blades as with most other shaving blades.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used on my head. It really works - especially with the HeadSlick shaving cream. All the other razors I have used for my head did not work nearly as well; there is no need to even put any pressure while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been bald ever since I bought this. Works great!</li>
            <li> This thing is great, ignore the complaints on here they are not doing something right.  I have been using for close to 2 weeks and shave everyday in shower and have never even felt like i was about to cut myself.  These people must be putting to much pressure or have never shaved their head before.  It take 3 or 4 shaves to get completely used to the method but once you have it down shaving is a breeze.  I enjoy shaving my head again.  BE SURE TO GET THEIR SHAVE CREAM TO THIS MAY ALSO BE SOME PEOPLES PROBLEMS.  There shave cream works great and the menthol cools, no razor burn anymore either.  Also shave everyday and the triple blades do not clog at all as some people have stated.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for about 3 years now. I decided to give the HeadBlade a try to see if it would work better than the 5 blade razor I had been using. It worked better then I thought it would, and definitely took some getting used to. Time spent with the HeadBlade vs. the previous razor dropped in half after using it a few times. My advice to anybody who wants to try it: read the instructions and don&#x27;t rush</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for eight years now, 5 years and 10 months of them using a headblade.  I recently completed an interstate move and lost my headblade...so for the last few months I have been using my trusty gillette mach 3 to shave my head \\&quot;old school\\&quot; style.  I have to tell you, hands down- the gillette razor does a better job and leaves me with less nicks than the headblade ever did.    The headblade is convenient, I will give it that.  It does a \\&quot;good\\&quot; job, but not one that is stellar.  It fits easily in your hand and has a very shallow learning curve on its usage.  However, like another reviewer stated, it only accomplishes shaving in one direction, with a \\&quot;taditional\\&quot; razor- you get the added advantage of maneiverability.  That makes all the difference.    I cannot call the headblade a bad product by any means, heck I used one for years...but it just cannot compare to using a traditional method to just \\&quot;bic-it.\\&quot;  While the razor itself may not be the be-all end-all of the dome clearing world, the shaving creams, lotions, and scrubs that headblade produces are top notch all the way.  So...my advice, is to fire up the razor you already have, but swap out the shaving cream with some headslick...follow that up with some headlube (a great moisturizing lotion) and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for about 18 months now.  I have been using my Powered Fusion razor that I shave my face with but was facing a dilemna.  I shave every day for work and a Fusion blade lasts about a week.  By the mid week the blade has dulled enough that I don&#x27;t want to shave my head with it.  So I looked to the Headblade after reading some reviews and doing other reasearch and decided to purcahse one to shave my head and leave the Fusion to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is great, but it does have some limitation.&lt;br /&gt;1. The wheels feel like they are a little loose on the axel.&lt;br /&gt;2. The blades seem to clog up easy and are not rinsed clean very well by shaking in a water filled sink, or with running water.&lt;br /&gt;3. The design is making it a little difficult to shave around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaves that I have received from the Headblade have been fantastic.  It is quicker than using the fusion despite having less blades, and I imagine that is because the blades are more in contact with the scalp using the Headblade than they are using the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and will now have a razor that allows me to shave my head more than twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the Headblade sport.</li>
            <li> Their is no doubt that the Head Blade could be a great product.  2 things need to happen to make this happen.  1. The company needs to update to modern blades.      2. Change the design for easier clean out.    The head Blade will give you a quick, uniform shave if you follow the instructions and take your time.  However most any modern \\&quot;stick\\&quot; will give you a closer shave.  I shave my head daily and have done so for over 10 years.  I demand a skin close shave and the head Blade cannot deliver this type of shave.  If our hair only grew in 2 directions like the company would like you to believe then the product would be fine as is.    As we all know...this is not the case.  In order to get your dome \\&quot;skin tight\\&quot; you must shave against the grain.  For me this means nape to crown, forehead to crown, and then sides up to crown.  4 directions...not 2.  The head Blade simply is NOT designed for that type of ultra close shave.  It&#x27;s a time saver if you want a sloppy shave but it actually will cost you time if you want the best shave possible due to sheer awkwardness and all the touching up you have to do.    It is my opinion that the Head Blade company is in business to sell their gels, oils, scrubs, etc...The \\&quot;space age\\&quot; Head Blade is just the means to do so.    If quick and dirty is your goal, get a head blade.  If you prefer a precise skin tight shave then stick to the modern 3/4/5 blade traditional units on the market.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present and before using it I thought it would be great WRONG.This thing is the worst razor i have ever used. I cannot stress that enough my first thought when using it was where is my bandaids before i bleed to death i am amazed that it can cut you so severly without cutting the hair it is beyond akward to use.I have been shaving for 10 years and have even used the single blade razors you can buy one at a time from a truck stop which are much more effective than this.Use a butter knife you will be better off.</li>
            <li> If you shave your head regularly, there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn&#x27;t have this in your bathroom.  It&#x27;s such a novel concept, but something so intuitive, you wonder why you didn&#x27;t come up with it yourself.  Anyone that has trouble with it is probably putting way too much effort into learning it.  It really should not be that hard.  I just imagine myself rubbing gel through my slicked-back hair.  lol.  It allows me to feel with my other hand where I&#x27;ve been and where I need to go.  And that&#x27;s essential for the back of the head where you can&#x27;t see.  The wheels may seem to have only been added just for the sake of design but they do serve a purpose.  I believe they&#x27;re the most important part of the HeadBlade.  Gently resting them on your head allows you glide without much pressure.  Too much pressure causes bumps, cuts, and razor burn.  I hardly get those now.  And the razorblade HeadBlade provides is outstanding.  I&#x27;m well into my 2nd month using the same razor and my head is just as clean-shaven as the first day.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newly bald guy...started shaving my head a month ago.  Before having my hair buzzed off, I purchased a Headblade Sport head razor.  It made the transition into head shaving easy.  I managed to shave my pate without mishap.  I&#x27;m afraid that the first shave with a regular razor wouldn&#x27;t have gone as well.  I have since found that I can get a closer shave with a regular razor...it just takes more time and effort.  For a quick, comfortable daily shave the Headblade does the job. For a really close shave I&#x27;d recommend use of both the Headblade and a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I was both hesitant and optimistic after reading the Headblade reviews on Amazon.  Optimistic because there were a lot of positive reviews; hesitant because the negative reviews seemed to be written much more thoughtfully than the positive ones (several positive reviews were written by spouses of Headblade users, others were in the ballpark of &#x27;headblade rulez&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a Mach 3, I decided to give the Headblade Sport a try.  The novelty is a lot of fun, and appeals to the gadget-lover in me.  It felt really cool to slip the little yellow race-car on my finger and start head-mowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, aside from the fun factor, the most imporant things that one would want out of the Headblade are closeness of shave, time saved, and ease of use, here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness: The shave is somewhat close, but the Mach 3 most definitely shaved closer.  I took the Mach 3 to my head immediately after shaving thoroughly with the Headblade, and the Mach took it noticeably closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: If you only want a good-enough shave (getting pretty close but not as close as you could, and leaving a few stubbly spots in the crevices), then you can shave your head pretty quickly with the Headblade--maybe five minutes or less with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease: The \\&quot;slicking the hair back\\&quot; motion of the Headblade is fun and novel, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really much easier than a Mach 3 (I could do long, broad strokes with a standard razor just as easily as with the Headblade).  Once you account for cleaning up the crevices and tricky areas that the Headblade isn&#x27;t going to get on a quick pass, it&#x27;s probably not going to be any easier than using a Mach 3--in fact, you may find it to be more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using a Gillette Fusion, which is the closest shave (and least amount of irritation) that I&#x27;ve found for my head.  If you want a really close and complete shave, you&#x27;ll probably agree, and steer away from the Headblade.  If, however, you&#x27;re looking for a tool to give you a decent (but flawed) shave fairly quickly, then you may really like this sporty little razor.ut flawed) shave fairly quickly, then you may really like this sporty little razor.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving my head a couple of weeks ago. I shave on a daily basis and I love the Headblade. It is very quick and easy. Once I got the hang of it I can shave my head very quickly. Now the less than perfect part. To get a really super close smooth shave I always follow up with my Gillette Mach 3. I will probably always use both razors unless I am in a huge hurry. I would highly recommend Headblade just be aware that you may have to use it in conjunction with another razor for the absolute closest shave.</li>
            <li> Just started shaving my head completely bald. First used the Fusion Pro Glide cause I was scared of cutting myself. No worries there. Saw the HeadBlade and bought it on a whim. Actually got a closer shave with this than with the Fusion. That really surprised me since the HeadBlade uses older style Atra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! Shaving with it just made sense. Not sure how other people end up nicking themselves.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine mentioned this razor to me - he said he&#x27;d heard someone talking about it on Howard Stern&#x27;s show. It was good timing since the previous time I&#x27;d shaved, I&#x27;d cut my ear and lost about a pint of blood (BTW, why do razor cuts bleed for an hour? I could have had my leg removed by a runaway train and it would probably stop bleeding faster...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with this razor. I used to use 2 different razors to shave my head - a Schick Extreme 3 disposable (due to the \\&quot;flexible blade\\&quot;) for most of my head and a Gillette Fusion with the battery (the vibration leads to fewer cuts, in my experience) for small problem areas like around my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with the Schick is that you have to apply some pressure to get the blade to bend to conform to your head. With most of your head, it&#x27;s not a big issue, but in certain spots (on my head, anyway), you&#x27;re going to get some nicks and cuts from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Headblade is MUCH easier to use, and it makes shaving MUCH quicker. The first thing to remember, though, is DON&#x27;T APPLY ANY PRESSURE TO THE BLADE! Just let it ride your head and make sure the wheel stays in contact with your skull at all times. I wasn&#x27;t great with this at first due to my experience shaving with the Schick - I was either applying pressure or not keeping the wheel down, which is of PARAMOUNT importance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good way to visualize it is to think of pushing a flat-blade shovel across some loose dirt. As long as you keep the shovel blade relatively even with the dirt, it will slide across easily. However, if you raise the shovel handle, the shovel blade is going to start diving into the dirt and getting stuck and digging out gouges. The dirt, in this example, is the SKIN ON YOUR HEAD. The wheel is there to make sure the \\&quot;shovel\\&quot; glides easily across the \\&quot;dirt\\&quot; on your head.Dirty head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower, which I HIGHLY recommend - there&#x27;s less mess to worry about and the hot water will keep your stubble softer. This thing is so smooth that you don&#x27;t really need a mirror unless you&#x27;re worried about accidentally shaving off an eyebrow. I usually shave my head front-to-back at first and then apply some more shaving foam and go back-to-front on a second pass. It&#x27;ll also do a decent job around your ears, although I still use the Fusion for a little clean-up. I&#x27;ll also hold the blade up to the shower head after each pass to rinse the blades clean - shaving long passes on your head stuffs the blade more than shaving your face would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing: although the instructions say to switch hands for shaving each side of your head, I stick with my right (I&#x27;m right-handed) since shaving with my left hand feels so awkward. Make sure to tilt your head when you&#x27;re doing the other side and keep the same rules in mind about not applying pressure and keeping the wheel in contact with your scalp. It&#x27;s going to take a few shaves before you&#x27;re comfortable with it, but stick with it - it&#x27;s going to feel strange at first. By the third or fourth try, it&#x27;ll be totally natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using Sensor blades in it right now and they work just fine. I haven&#x27;t checked Amazon&#x27;s prices for bulk blades, but I&#x27;ve been buying mine at a warehouse club where they&#x27;re pretty cheap. I put in a new blade once a week for the \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; factor. There&#x27;s nothing worse than having to go to an appointment with blood running down your head. My mean goatee and shaved head already scare enough people. Adding blood is, frankly, a bit of overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: when you&#x27;re replacing the blade, it&#x27;s going to go on in the OPPOSITE direction than a regular razor&#x27;s replacement blade would. If you hold the Headblade \\&quot;up\\&quot; like a traditional razor, the blades are going to be pointing UP rather than down. Unlike a regular razor, which you \\&quot;pull\\&quot; down your face, you \\&quot;push\\&quot; the Headblade - it&#x27;s more like a snowplow, or the shovel in my allegory.is thing is so smooth that you don&#x27;t really need a mirror unless you&#x27;re worried about accidentally shaving off an eyebrow.

            <li> I bought this razor when I first shaved my head because I was led to believe it would be easier and safer than using my regular razor, but have the same result.  Unfortunately that was not the case.  There is no way to get a clean shave with this razor.  If you want your head to be clean shaven, save your $15 and buy new replacement blades for your regular razor.  If, however, you don&#x27;t mind having visible stubble right after you shave, this may be a good razor for you.</li>
            <li> did not come with the following promised items     1.Comes with extra adaptor for standard blades from Gillette and Schick.  2.A free sample of HeadSlick shaving cream included in packaging</li>
            <li> I have used the headblade for over a year. Prior to that I used a Mach3. I am certain that had I not tried the headblade, I would not still be shaving my head. It makes the process very easy to use, and takes much less time than a traditional razor. However, it is not without its faults. The standard blade is bad, and the triple blades that you can buy, while better, always gave me trouble when trying to clean them out. The sensor excel blades fit with an adapter, and I have found those to work great on the headblade.    Some people have said that they have problems with cutting. I, personally, have never cut my head. A few times I have nicked my ears when not paying close attention or going too fast.    Others have complained about the closeness of the shave. The single blade is not close at all. But it is a single blade, of course it will not compete with a Mach 3 or Fusion. The Headblade brand Triple Blade was plenty close. And if you fit the Sensor Excel blades on it, then you shouldn&#x27;t notice any leftover stubble. Irritation is also minimal once you get the hang of the blade, but don&#x27;t expect to just pick it up and use it like a pro. It does take some getting use to.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing. In fact, when the wheels break, I buy a new one. I get exactly what I expect from it at the price I&#x27;m buying: About a year of reliable use.    I&#x27;ve used Mach III&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used Fusions. I&#x27;ve used Gilette Hydro&#x27;s. This is still the best tool for taking the stubble off my dome. Just follow the instructions, don&#x27;t push down on the blade, and you&#x27;ll do pretty well. The caveat is that you can&#x27;t just expect to shave off hair! You&#x27;ve got to get it down to stubble with clippers first. After that, don&#x27;t let it grow out too much, or you&#x27;ll be spending a lot of time getting your head smooth again.</li>
            <li> The best razor for your head</li>
            <li> For all of the bragging on the company&#x27;s website about blade design, this product doesn&#x27;t deliver.    The major flaw comes in the form of how the razor deals with cut hair.  The hair is trapped by the plastic housing surrounding the blades, clogging the blade, and rendering it useless within a single swipe.  I was hoping it would be able to outperform the gillette fusion, but it comes nowhere near the performance (granted the fusion costs more).  The gillette has a completely open design which allows hair to pass between the blades and easily wash away.  I have only tried the sport version of this product, but I doubt I&#x27;ll waste my money trying the others.  I&#x27;ve used generic three blade razors with better performance.  The fusion costs more, but it works.</li>
            <li> Oh my god!!!!! I pulled this accross my head six to eight times, starting in the back of my head... and before I knew what was happining blood was running down my neck and I had 5 serious cuts before I stopped..It took one week to heal before I could use my fusion again. Horrible! Danderous, overpriced  product.</li>
            <li> this product showed up defective right out of the box. the arms that hold the blade in place were weak and would not keep the blade sturdy. the razor was flimsy and not worth the effort or getting a replacement.</li>
            <li> This little dohickey is awesome! I&#x27;ve NEVER shaved my head with a razor before (always an electric shaver)... because I was worried I&#x27;d end up with all kindda cuts in my head... since I can&#x27;t really see where I&#x27;m shaving.... but this shaver just slide over your middle finger and all you do is basically run your hand over your head with minimal pressure... and in half the time of an electric shaver... and with a MUCH closer shave... not a single cut! It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Well I now have a toy car attached to a razor blade to sit in the bottom of my bathroom drawer. It&#x27;s not as fast or easy as using my tried and true method. If you do buy it do not use in the shower without a mirror or you will have a bunch of little random tufts.</li>
            <li> This razor is fun to use. The grip and gliding action are cool. HOWEVER, the blades are merciless!  I have never bled so much in my life! My bathroom sink looked like a murder scene!  And my head was HORRIBLY IRRITATED!  This was the absolute worst purchase of my life! Don&#x27;t fall for the gimmick.  Stick with a Gillette.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.  As you shave your head the blades begin to get clogged up with hair and the design of the razor blades don&#x27;t allow them to be easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Headblade 3-4 times per week, for about a year, and there is no way I could go back to a traditional razor at this point; I&#x27;ve tried and it just feels unnatural in comparison.  I will admit to being a little over zealous the first time I used it, which resulted in the worst cut I&#x27;ve ever had while shaving, but that wasn&#x27;t the fault of the Headblade; You need to take your time while learning to shave with this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of so of careful shaving it becomes second nature to use. I can shave my entire head in the shower, without a mirror, in about 2 minutes. After that I touch up around my ears with a traditional razor.  As other have mentioned, this works best with a good blade on it. I&#x27;ve been using SensorExcel blades exclusively and the cost/performance ratio is perfect.  I should also mention that I don&#x27;t have any abnormal bumps or divots on my noggin, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t do what I expected. Gimmicky but to practical or useful. Was hard to keep on my head and didn&#x27;t shave close. I watched the video first..</li>
            <li> The HeadBlade unit coupled with a Gillette Sensor Excel cartridge is the best configuration I&#x27;ve found. The HB comes with a little black plastic adapter to accept Sensor cartridges.    So if Sensor Excel blades are so great, why use a HeadBlade at all? Well, the grip and technique are different from traditional razors. With a regular safety razor, you end up having to monkey-arm it around your head. The HB only requires to you run your hand over your head, as if brushing your hair back. Then, if you want to get down baby-butt smooth, you flip it around on your finger and go back the other way, using the same gesture starting from your nape and moving up to the crown. When going against the grain, I find it helps to keep your ring finger off the front of the HB unit and instead try to keep it on top of the ring. That keeps all pressure off the razor, ensuring a smooth glide and little chance for a cut.    I bet the HeadBlade would be good for somebody with limited range of motion, like if you have a rotator cuff injury, arthritis or anything like that. Of course, I&#x27;m not limited and I still like the HB technique. It&#x27;s a simple idea and it seems a little gimmicky at first blush, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile, I really like it.    Just remember what I said about Sensor Excel blades. You&#x27;ll definitely want to use those instead of the HB cartridges.</li>
            <li> This blade does not give you as close a shave as a regular blade because you can&#x27;t get the proper angle.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave and no matter what I did it left streaks on my head. I finally had to revert to my electric razor to cleanup the mess.</li>
            <li> I used to buzz my head using a WAHL trimmer.  Im not even going bald...I just like the look of a buzz cut.  Unfortunately my hair grew in so fast, I&#x27;d have to do this once a week.      So over the summer, I decided to start blade shaving my head so I could go a little longer without having to shave it again.  At first I used a Fusion Power razor and felt like it really did the trick; until I tried to use the same blade a second time...and found it too dull to use.  The blades are way too expensive ($25 for four) to be going through them that quickly.    So I searched the &#x27;net until I found the HeadBlade and decided to pick one up at my local drug store along with a bottle of the Slick head-shaving cream.  The next morning, I got up, turned on my fogless mirror and went at my head.    I am amazed.  This thing is probably the fastest way to shave your head.  It took me less than 10 minutes the first time to get my head completely shaved...and it was SMOOTH as well!  Now that I have the hang of it, it takes me less than 5 minutes.  Since it takes so little time, I actually keep my head shaved most of the time now.    The blades are also cheap.  You can get four of them for $8 and each one will last multiple shavings.  I also recommend you get the Slick as it produces a nice cooling sensation on your scalp while you shave.    Finally, if there is a con, it is this:  I&#x27;m going to repeat the warning many have already talked about in these reviews.  You do NOT have to put any pressure on this gadget while you glide it over your head.  It&#x27;s one of those things you just have to trust.  It is designed to work without having to put any pressure on the blade.  If you don&#x27;t follow the instructions (there&#x27;s even a video tutorial on the HeadBlade web site), and you put too much pressure on the blade, or you do not keep the wheel against your scalp, expect to be cut.  It happened to me the first time when I went too fast...You simply need to have the wheel and the blade in contactwith your scalp and glide your hand over your head slowly.    Anyways, I highly recommend this product if you shave your head.  Its the easiest and fastest way to do it.  HeadBlade has also been around since 1997...so they&#x27;re obviously doing something right.  :)</li>
            <li> The Headblade works very well for me. I have fine hair and the only way that I can get any razor to take it off--rather than just slide over--is to shave in the opposite direction from the way my hair grows. So I do that with the Headblade, using the triple-blade cartridges, and I get a close shave that is practically nick-free. Simply taking this gadget and using it as instructed does not do the trick for me at all. Fortunately, I did not read the full directions before I began to use this thing but just did what I do by instinct: shave in the back from my neck up. I don&#x27;t have much hair left in front or on top, so there is not much to worry about there, but it does take more than one pass for me to get every hair.    I once bought the double-blade refills and immediately started nicking myself all to pieces. Maybe I am clumsy, but for some reason the triple-blade gives me a smoother shave as well as a closer one. I also use shaving oil instead of Headblade&#x27;s shaving cream and I love it for neatness and lubrication. Using oil with the Headblade and shaving in the direction that works instead of the direction they say keeps my head clean and smooth. It is important to keep pressure off the blade itself: I usually don&#x27;t even rest my index finger on it but just let it shave under its own weight. The thing is balanced almost perfectly for my hair. I&#x27;ve had the sport model for about five years now and it is the handiest grooming tool I&#x27;ve yet to find. Niftier than my moustache comb!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product, the cool marketing, the design, and even the price and color. However, I hate the actual use of the headBlade as my head is not perfectly round - if it were, it&#x27;d probably be easier to use. Learning to use it is a real challenge and this is my second purchase over three years. The first time I didn&#x27;t like it - so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot again - and I&#x27;m still not a fan.</li>
            <li> Ok! I contemplated this purchase for a while, did my research and am excited to say so much better than a regular razor and so much more ergonomic! Worth purchasing the extras too! Cheaper even with shipping than my local pharmacy!</li>
            <li> A word to the wise:  When the instructions tell you not to put any pressure on the razor while you&#x27;re shaving, they mean it!  My first experience with the HeadBlade was a painful bloodbath, but that&#x27;s because I pressed down too hard.  Tried it again, and have been happy with it ever since.  Nice, close shave.  Easy to use.  Easy to rinse (when you use third-party twin-blade cartridges).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still find it difficult to shave around the ears without missing a spot or cutting myself.  I use my regular razor for that part.  That&#x27;s why I gave it four stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are newer, fancier versions of the Headblade, but I chose this one because it&#x27;s compatible with the inexpensive off-brand twin blades.  Apparently the triple- and quadruple-blade cartridges made by HeadBlade clog too easily and don&#x27;t last very long.  The off-brand cartridges work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor along with a 50-pack of aftermarket Gillette Atra/Trac II razors, which was a great deal!

            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over a two years now and thought that this might be a less awkward way to shave the old chrome dome.    I was wrong.    As some have previously stated, the razors do not shave close enough. You WILL need to go over the area 2-3 times for a clean shave. Also, I&#x27;ve been unable to shave with this device without cutting myself pretty severely. Shaving with this blade is as awkward if not more awkward as a normal razor. Lastly, had the device not been on sale at my Walgreens I would not have bought it. The razor and the refills are ridiculously priced. No razor is cheap, but this one carries a premium price tag.    If you want a nice clean shave without nasty cuts at a decent price, this is NOT the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I guess the idea here was to provide a nick-proof shave on bald heads, and that it does; however, it&#x27;s not a close shave.  A careful shave with a good blade like a Gillette Fusion produces an incredibly smooth result.  The HeadBlade manages to give you the equivalent of a two-day stubble in comparison.  Perhaps this is due to the old-tech two blade system used by HeadBlade, but if you&#x27;re going for the smooth, bald look this isn&#x27;t the product to get it with.</li>
            <li> it work very good people who shave therer head should get this to try or to use.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this razor I had used primarily a Mach 3 and more expensive electric razors to shave my head. I&#x27;m quite a clutz and this typically resulted in my cutting behind my ear at least once or twice a month. A few years ago, one of my college professors recommended this razor as he also shaves his head. Being a poor college student at the time, I noted it but never tried one out. Two weeks ago I was given this razor by a hair stylist who also recommended it.    I was skeptical and though the design was mostly to look cool/trendy, until my third or so shave with it without a single cut. As others have stated, it takes about the same time / a little more time to shave with this as a ordinary razor... you have to go over the same spots a couple of times to get all the hairs.    I have found shaving with a hand lotion or only when your head is continuously under water, produces the best results. Using a regular razor also works best for the sideburns and neck hairline.    For the low price, try it out for shaving the rounded parts of your head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head, one way or the other, for 2 years.  Nothing worked.  I always had thick stubble.  I&#x27;d put a new Mach 3 blade in and go to work.  After 15 minutes of shaving, I could still feel a 5 day shadow.  Tried electric.  Was easier but no different.  After visiting a lot of baldy sites and finding that most used the HB I noticed that in all cases the trick to the HB is a light touch.  Many of us grew up shaving with blades that you had to scrape, pull, tug and grind into your face to get a barely acceptable shave.  I believe that people who shred their heads with the HB are using this technique.    For the first use of the HB I also used their HeadSlick product.  Letting the blade just glide over my head using virtually no pressure at all, I&#x27;d follow with my free hand and realized that it was actually cutting all the stubble that I could not remove any other way.  Amazed, I just let it glide over my head, first neck to forehead, then forehead to neck.  I even got all the wild stuff around the ears.    I love this product so much I&#x27;m going to order their FaceBlade and get rid of my Mach 3.    I got a billiard ball finish in less then 5 minuets and this is for the first time I used it.  No cuts, no irritation.  This is a great product but it must be used as advised.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago, and I love it!  Reading the directions takes about 10 seconds, and following them is important.  That being siad, I go against the grain and have never felt a smoother shave.  I bought the product with the tripple blades and shaved ever other day for two weeks before changing that first blade.  When i did change it, i bought the generic 3 blade cartridges and regreted it instantly.  the razors for your face simply don&#x27;t get close enough for my head.  The razor burn and irritation for terrible.  I promply ordered a refill pack of 2 and 3 blades from head blade.  To compare, I am useing the 2 blades now and find that they are not quite as comfortable as the 3 blades, but still exponentially better than the cheaper store bought ones.  The head slick shaving stuff is cool, and feels great on the skin, but I don&#x27;t think the cool factor justifies the added expense.  A liberal application of baby oil works well for me.    In short, I like it, and would (and have recomended) this product to any one interested.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product and was getting tired of shaving with a normal razor at an awkward angle so decided to try it out. Have been using it since. Quality product doesn&#x27;t feel awkward. Downside is 3 blade razor it is custom made so when it gets dull you have to order it from the company it comes with. Good product I recommend.</li>
            <li> I had never shaved my head before using the headblade....and it was easy.  Not one cut!  I would suggest this to ANYONE who wants to shave their head. Just put it on your hand, and slide it across your head....just like you would comb it. Front to back, then Back to front.</li>
            <li> The original Headblade had lots of \\&quot;nicking\\&quot; issues. The Sport (with its cool sport wheels) has solved those problems. The wheels keep this blade from tilting or getting stuck, and then \\&quot;skipping and nicking\\&quot;.    This blade literally just glides over my scalp and there is no issues with nicks or cuts. I shave from the front all the way down to the back of my neck and get a great shave. Going around the ears takes a bit of dexterity (hence the substraction of 1 star) but I have mastered it pretty well.      I also use the Headslick shaving cream and I can shave my head in the morning in no time. The quality of the shave is very good. Unlike others, I get my shave \\&quot;Mach-3 smooth\\&quot;, with an Atra blade. Could it be the Heasdslick cream?    The biggest key with using this is to use no pressure at all. Just let it glide, and keep the wheel in gentle contact with your scalp!    This also comes with an adaptor to use a Sensor blade if you prefer that.     All in all I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely a new way to shave.  I was pretty much instantly comfortable with using the HeadBlade.  So far I haven&#x27;t even had a nick and I&#x27;ve been shaving my head every three or four days.  The cool thing is this thing is compatible with tons of razor blades so you can find your favorite blade and put it on here.</li>
            <li> For the first few seonds it worked fine but the blades were not working as intially... By the way nice productsafety wise but would only recommend to people who can afford to buy new blades every new use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blades were not sharp enough and lasted only 2 minutes of use... hairs were stuck in the blades and were not clean after several water  cleaning also...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i didnt like it at all</li>
            <li> I bought this product headblade and was trying to shave. It did not not shave. I returned and got my money back. Better stay off from this invovative product.</li>
            <li> I was just using a reglar stick razor...then i got this and i had some more razors for this one and now i have a cut on my head so when you use this BECAREFUL or you&#x27;ll be sore</li>
            <li> The first time I used it the back of my head was cut. I thought it was my inexperience with the Headblade. The second time I cut the back of my head five times! Something is wrong here.I bought a 3 blade regular razor and have been bloodless since.</li>
            <li> I got it to save my head as I kept cutting my self with the razor, Well I cut my head worst with this. I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Before you buy this product, it&#x27;s important to understand what it is and what it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HeadBlade system is a product that was designed for maintaining a shaved head.  It is NOT a product that was designed for actually shaving your head after you&#x27;ve buzzed it on down with a 0 blade clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem with this system is the blade.  The blade appears to be similar in design to the Mach 3 razor blade cartridges.  This is both good and bad.  The Mach 3 cartridge is a fine system for shaving your face every 1-3 days.  If you get past the 3 day mark the Mach 3 system begins to show its flaws.  When you&#x27;ve got a fair amount of hair over a certain length the hair becomes jammed in between the blades on the cartridge at which point the effectiveness of the system is cut in 1/2 or more.  You spend more time trying to clean the cartridge out than you do shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is typically fine for a shaved face; it unfortunately is not fine when you&#x27;re shaving your head.  The closest shave you can get with a clipper is 0, which is still longer than what the razor in the HeadBlade can cut through without frequently jamming.  What&#x27;s worse is that the system that attaches the blade to the yellow plastic part prevents access to the blade from behind.  Which means the only avenue for cleaning the blades is from the front where you will likely cut your fingers or dull the blades in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t see the benefit of using this product instead of any other 3 or more blade cartridge system out there on the market.  The blades are exactly what you&#x27;d find in a Mach 3 system, and they share the same problems/benefits of said system.  The cost of replacement is about the same, and it&#x27;s more difficult to find a \\&quot;HeadBlade\\&quot; replacement cartridge than it is to find a 3 blades disposable or cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the system came with a blade that was specifically designed to cut longer hair without jamming I would&#x27;ve given it a much higher rating.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. It arrived on time, and is really cool looking. He was not really sure it would work. It did and wonderfully fast too. Great product! Buy it for that person in your life that hates spending all that time shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it two stars for ingenuity but it didn&#x27;t work well for me. Obviously is does for some but I get the closest shave if I go against the direction my hair is growing. I tried going with the direction at least 6 different times/sessions but I kept defaulting to my Trac II thinking if I don&#x27;t hurry this up I&#x27;m going to be late for work and I wasn&#x27;t getting  a close shave anyway. I tried the adapter so I could use my Trac II blades but the adapter doesn&#x27;t swivel/rock like the Atra adapter which didn&#x27;t seem to give the Trac II blade the best shot at being effective. They work great in my Trac II handle. I tried the Headblade against the grain but it doesn&#x27;t want to go that way. The blade digs in and the wheels come up and it doesn&#x27;t flow that way. It didn&#x27;t cut me or anything but it wasn&#x27;t going to work as a shaving mode. So, interesting idea but it may not be the great solution you are expecting. If you feel you get your closest shave by going against the grain, be skeptical.</li>
            <li> I got one of these as a gift from a friend who thought it was a great idea.  Of course, he has a full head of hair.    It took me 20 minutes to stop the bleeding enough that I could drive to work.  It cut, scraped, gouged and nicked it&#x27;s way across my scalp like a vampire in search of a good meal.    I threw it in the trash and went back to my Fusion Power.</li>
            <li> I scored the Headblade Sport at Walgreen Drugstore recently, and I found that it does an incredible job.  The triple-blade razor that comes with it shaves incredibly close, and I didn&#x27;t have one single nick or cut.  After a while, though, it was time for new blades, and I bought Walgreens store brand triple-blade sensor blades...big mistake.  After changing blades, I promptly got cut in  three different places on my next use.  My advice:  Go with the Headblade brand razor blades, or at least Gillette&#x27;s blades.      I have to agree with a previous poster, getting around the ears is tricky, and it is easy to nick yourself where your ear meets with your scalp.  I just make sure to steer clear of that area, as there is no hair to shave there anyway.    It took me a while to get the technique of using the Headblade down, but after that, I started to cruise.  This razor, when used with a good blade, will speed up you morning headshaving chore, and it will produce a shave as close as anything you have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the Headblade Sport after reading the reviews, but for me this has been a great razor.  I use it with Headslick cream and the whole job takes less than five minutes, which is quite a bit faster than with conventional razors.  The only downside is that the shave is not a close as with some of the other razors I have tried.  I think this is due to the push (rather than pull) motion of this razor.  I read somewhere that Altra and Trac II cartridges are compatible with the HB Sport, so I bought a set of the CVS generic blades and gave them a shot.  I ended up scalping myself in several places!  Blood was running down my head like I had been mauled by an owl.  I&#x27;m guessing that the HB Sport blades are a bit recessed to avoid this, and that is why the shave is not as close.  Perhaps the newer HB models that use a pull motion get around this problem?  Anyway, now I just bite the bullet and fork over the $10 for a set of four authentic HB3 replacement blades.  Definitely worth it to avoid the blood bath!!</li>
            <li> The world&#x27;s best headshaving device. What else is there to say?</li>
            <li> I just got one over a year looking at one. I gives you one of the closes shaves I found on the market. I&#x27;m not a fan of there shaving creame it&#x27;s to than and slippery. I prefer a good gel or foam.</li>
            <li> For those of you who haven&#x27;t tried this razor it is a different experience. The razor in my case works well. I usually shave my head every other day or every day so the stubble is not too thick. I have had no problems with it clogging. The way you hold this razor is totally different and does take getting used to. I have not tried it with the sensor blades yet but I will in the future. One thing you must realize is that you push this razor not pull it. I have only nicked myself once in several uses, the directions state not to put pressure on the blade. The only drawback to me is that the front of the razor is the same width as the blade so it can get tricky in the small areas around the ears. Once you have mastered this razor it is very quick to remove the large areas. The enclosed coupon that was included was expired by 6 months.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the instructions very carefully. Many men think they can just figure things out on their own, well this is a product you really should not do that with. The instructions say, don&#x27;t use unless your hair only has a couple days growth -- that is the truth. If your hair is too long the HeadBlade will not work like it should. My husband also reported that it gave him more irritation than a regular razor but maybe he just has to get used to it. Overall he didn&#x27;t think it was anything special and there is way too much room for user error.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for shaving the head. It nearly eliminates the nicks and cuts the standard razor tends to produce. The wheels in the back of the device help to keep the blades at the correct angle for a great shave every time.</li>
            <li> After several bad experiences with conventional razors, I gave up and settled for \\&quot;clipper-close\\&quot;. After researching HeadBlade and reading the reviews, I went to my local retailer and bought the HeadBlade Sport, the tripleblade replacement pack and the HeadSlick menthol shave cream. After a nice hot bath and good scrubbing to exfoliate the skin, I lathered up. Careful to follow the instructions on pressure-placement and technique (with the grain for first 5 uses), I got zero razorburn and absolutely zero nicks. Also, I got a closer shave than I have ever gotten to my scalp. I think the key is to watch the instructional video on the HeadBlade site, exfoliate the scalp and rinse the blade after each stroke.&lt;br /&gt;Woulda given more stars if available.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head every nite and thought this to be the perfect gift. Bought it as a stocking stuffer for Christmas....boy was I wrong. He said to just give him a regular shaver for his need. The first time he used it, of course not being ready for it, he cut a huge chunk out of his head. Probably a great tool for some, just not us.</li>
            <li> OK, so I decide that cutting what hair I have left with an electric clippers isn&#x27;t close enough, so I start shaving &#x27;er all the way down.  I don&#x27;t do it daily, only when I want a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; look. Maybe once or twice a week.  Anyway, I used bics, mach 3&#x27;s, etc.  Bics seemed a little rough.  Gouged more than once.  Mach 3 was good.  Saw the headblade &amp; thought it was cool.  And it is.  It&#x27;s easy to use (easier than a face razor) &amp; I have yet to cut myself.  Can&#x27;t say that about the bics.  But the blades seem to dull fast (bear in mind I have the typical \\&quot;horseshoe haircut\\&quot; so half of my head is bald on it&#x27;s own...not that much to shave), and they also seem hard to clean.  Haven&#x27;t tried their other products, but after reading reviews, I&#x27;ll have to.  Try the headblade.  It&#x27;s a cool little gadget for shaving.  My wife (and other women too!) like what it does!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for about 15 years and was hoping to find an alternative to a standard razor but this isn&#x27;t it.  I actually like the shave I get from a standard razor (I use a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide) but just wanted something more ergonomic and purpose built.  The Headblade wouldn&#x27;t stay flat against my head and kept wobbling from side to side and wasn&#x27;t able to reach some of the tighter areas I need to shave (behind and above my ears) so it wasn&#x27;t useful to me at all.</li>
            <li> This is my second Headblade, the first one lasted about 5-6 years and then the hard plastic handle where your finger goes finally broke. I ordered the newer model which has an integrated rubber back and finger hold. I don&#x27;t believe this will break. Great improvement to an already great design! It was shipped promptly and as expected.</li>
            <li> Performs as promised.Super fast.Easy to get the hang of to use.Would definitely recommend to head shavers. DOES A GREAT JOB.</li>
            <li> My son couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out, even though he&#x27;d just shaved his head the day before. He loves it. Manscaping?</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I thought it would give me a closer and quicker shave in the morning.  It gave neither.  It wasn&#x27;t very ergonomic so maybe with more practice it would give a quick shave in the morning but I wasn&#x27;t planning to practice shaving all over again.  I thought that the motion of the shave would be just like running your fingers through the scalp but it ain&#x27;t so.    The blades are inferior.  I love blades with an open back so the water can wash off all the little hairs that get stuck in between the blades.  This has some old-school blade that is really hard to clean between strokes.  You can use certain 3rd party blades with the included adapter but those blades have the same problem (I used those in the past).    To sum up, use your favorite razor, the one you use for your beard, on your scalp.  It&#x27;s much more effective.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I&#x27;m nice.</li>
            <li> $9.99 at my local Walgreen. I was using a norelco to shave my head but it took too long and not that close. But shaving my head with a razor made me feel uncomfortable always afraid of cutting myself. Decided to try this. I must say its the easiest, fastest and closest way to shave your head. Took about 5 minutes and my head is smoooooth. And just a hint. You don&#x27;t need to use their shaving cream. I used regular Barbasol and it worked great. No cuts. Great product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the headblade, but it&#x27;s just an average product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Cool gadget.  Fairly quick shave.  I didn&#x27;t cut myself.  The instructions are clear that you are not supposed to apply pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The shave just isn&#x27;t very close.  It&#x27;s not bad.  It&#x27;s just not great.  Still have to use another razor to get behind the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some Gillete Atra refill cartridges which are supposed to work with the headblade.  Maybe the shave will be a little closer.  The blades that come with it gunk up easily and are hard to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Headblade should spend more time effort and energy in getting a better blade - like a Mach 3 blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review, my first ever, in response to some of the reviews I just read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about 6 months.  This is the only blade I use on my head, the only blade I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use another razor to touch up around my ears, and for my face.  I can&#x27;t really see a problem with this product, other than price point.  I have thin hair.  My blades have never been clogged like some reviewers have said. I do half my head in one direction, then rinse the blade.  Do the other half, then rinse.  Switch the razor around and do the other direction, half the head at a time.  No problems.  Obviously I can&#x27;t do it smooth in one pass, I go over the same path more than once.  I do it like I was mowing my lawn. When I&#x27;m done my head is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I like this razor most for the way it keeps the blades on my head evenly.&lt;br /&gt;And maybe because I&#x27;m not that coordinated. I have trouble using a regular razor.  This is so much easier for me.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself in quite some time.  If I don&#x27;t rush I&#x27;m fine, because I keep it in a straight line. But when I go too fast, I sometimes let the blade go sideways, resulting in a cut.  I did that one time early on, and my shower looked like the shower scene in &amp;#34;Psycho.&amp;#34; There was blood all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades last me a couple of weeks on average.  I sharpen them every other day on my jeans. That seems to give me a little more time.  I&#x27;m no expert at this stuff, I haven&#x27;t been shaving my head for years, but I really do enjoy this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I give it four stars because I think the blades are a bit expensive.  I don&#x27;t know how long other blades normally last, but these do seem to go quick, even with my thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see me trying anything different in the near future.  There are cheaper alternatives to their blades too. I DO recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a head shaver for a few years now and really like the Headblade. The design is innovative and easy to use. I find the original HB with the feet as opposed to the little wheels provides infinitely more control and provides a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the HB razor wasn&#x27;t dependent on cartridges. I switched to old school wet shaving a long time ago and in my experience all cartridge blades pale in comparison to using a quality razor blade like a Derby or Feather blade in a good DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Headblades own blades are pretty terrible so I use mine with Atra 2 carts which are getting hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dovo which is owned by Merkur (the best DE razors on the Planet)  make a similar dedicated head razor that uses blades, I&#x27;ve heard good things about it but have yet to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your just starting out with a Headblade the learning curve is very fast and pretty effortless. But again, although the shave is decent don&#x27;t expect perfection.</li>
            <li> Very easy to shave my head smooth smooth smooth without irritation or multiple passes. Follow the instructions and you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> It was a gift.came with one blade and said standard blade will fit it. It&#x27;s for shaving hole head with soap.</li>
            <li> My husband has been shaving his head for a number of years now and we just recently discovered the HeadBlade.  He loves the ease of using this versus a regular razor.  It&#x27;s got an adapter so you can use various commercial razor blades (not just the HeadBlade blades)    I love it because I am no longer called in to \\&quot;check\\&quot; the job he did.</li>
            <li> It is a good product as long as you keep up with shaving your head. If you wait too long and the stubble gets too long the razor clogs very easily. In my case I must shave my head about every other day with this, but if I use any other razor I can go about every third day. The Headblade does give a much closer shave and is so simple to use. The only complaint I really have is it should weigh just a little more so that it contacts the scalp better. Since you depend on the weight of the razor to shave. You do not want to push down or you will end up cutting your head. The Headblade makes shaving much quicker and much easier, doesn&#x27;t matter if you go with or against the grain it still gives a very close shave. Wish more stores sold these it would be easier to get refills which would make for more convenience. Great product and have recommended it to many of the bald, and balding men I know.</li>
            <li> This item and it&#x27;s associated products are an absolute waste of money. I thought that perhaps finally I found a way to make shaving my head and easier process. And it would be if this worked... it doesn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. The shaving cream is terrible and expensive. So, I wish I had just pulled 30 bucks out of my wallet and burned it. It would have produced the same stupid feeling I have. Be warned.</li>
            <li> this thing works way better than it has any right too..i mean it looks like a gillette razor and a hot wheel had latenight drunken sex at a party and this was the result. but it does a fairly decent job</li>
            <li> well, like most fathers I believe, mine is bald. and he needed an easier way to shave his bald head. so, what is a better present than this?</li>
            <li> It appears that most of the reviews on this product are from people who bought it for someone else as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine was a gift from my better half, also. She came home so excited, tore it out of the package, and couldn&#x27;t wait for me to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin by saying this is one of the few times I have ever lied to her, only to spare her feelings....and I suspect this may have happened to some of the other &#x27;reviewers&#x27; who bought this as a present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is junk, pure and simple. It uses outdated blades, and it simply doesn&#x27;t work. I guarantee there is more money spent on the pretty packaging than in the cheap, china-made product inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever ordered any type of $19.99 TV thingy, got it out of the box, and laughed at yourself for being ripped off by the 10 cent item you received, then you can expect to have the same reaction with Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you receive one of these from a loved one - smile and be gracious...but don&#x27;t waste YOUR money on one of these - stick with something that will really work - Mach 3, etc.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.  The novelity here is more about the little race car design (or is it a snowmobile?) than actually making shaving the noggin easier.  I would have hoped the blade assembly would be more suited to easy cleaning.  Essentially, the blades get clogged (as expected) but to rinse them is much more cumbersome than with a conventional razor.  I found I use my conventional razor about as often as I use this one.  I expect that this think will wind up in a drawer or trash before long.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> very dificult to clean</li>
            <li> does not get a close shave due to the blades. they are cheap  blades, not sharp.</li>
            <li> The first pass shaved a wonderfully smooth swath, a rinse and the second went smooth.  Then the third, and some stubble was left.  I rinsed the blade better, and dragged the dull blade across my head...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait...  it&#x27;s not dull! Its clogged.  The back of the blades have no way to vent, and the blade just clogs with stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished my shave with my old Shick Xtreme 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think the design of the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; is great, and takes the idea of shaving out of the box, I&#x27;m utterly disapointed with the blades. The blades are simply impossible to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring the technology of the blades up to the standard of the handle, and this will become a razor, instead of a novelty.</li>
            <li> This product truly works. I was quite skeptical at first, not to mention worried about shaving my own head, for fear of ending up in the ER. Not at all. It&#x27;s simple, straightforward and speedy to use. Just don&#x27;t apply pressure. I made that mistake only once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my purchase, I have used both the Headblade with Slick nine times. Therefore, the Headblade has paid for itself several times over. Taking into consideration that I was spending $20 per week by going to my local barber. Plus travel time, waiting room time and total cost. I can now shave my own head and the back of my neck in 4 to 10 minutes, depending on how picky I&#x27;m being, in the comfort of my own bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this product. Use a Mack 3 blade if you want to shave your head. This seems like a cool way to shave your head but it barely shaves any hair. Save your money don&#x27;t make the mistake I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this headblade several years ago and soon put it away as I didn&#x27;t like the results as much as those I got with my traditional double-edge safety razor.  Recently, though, I got tired of cutting up my head and got it out for another try, and found it works great.  What&#x27;s the difference?  I switched from a national-brand gel-type shaving cream (the kind that starts as a gel but foams up on your skin) to a different type of shaving cream in the interim.  Now the Headblade works great, and I can&#x27;t imagine anything giving a closer shave with no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am getting the best results with Cremo shave cream, and a quality brush-applied shaving soap is a close second.  I haven&#x27;t tried the brand from Headblade (Headslick) yet but will when I run out of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use very little Cremo and I have no problems with clogging the razor.  I ususally go over my head twice, with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Headblade is great, but you have to use the right shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sporting the Kojak look for about 15 years now and have tried many different approaches to shaving my head. I was intrigued by the product and hoped it would make things easier and provide a clean shave. It didn&#x27;t. The quality of the blade is not as good as many I&#x27;ve used (Gillette, CVS, straight edge). It&#x27;s a novel idea, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> The Headblade&#x27;s form is more intuitive for us head shavers, it does move along your dome the way you want it to, but its form doesn&#x27;t translate as well into shaving effectiveness.  Nor does it insulate you against cuts and nicks, proper form and pressure is still something you need to learn and use correctly.  While thats true for ordinary razors, I rarely nick myself with my Fusion while with the headblade even after 2 months of regular use nicks were the norm.  I was paying a higher price for a nifty looking little gizmo that for me at least, didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as a regular Fusion razor did, nor did it last as long between cartridge changes.  Its not a bad product, but for my money I find the regular razors give me not only a better shave, but one where I don&#x27;t cut myself nearly as often.</li>
            <li> It gets the bulk of the hair but I still have to finish the job with a hand held razor. Be careful when opening the package because it is sealed up like Fort Knox. When I cut the top off and pulled the plastic apart the Headblade flew out and fell in the sink causing the blade holder to break. Fortunately the package was supplied with an additional blade holder that works with most blades you get with disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never be going back to shaving my head with regular razors. The headblade is faster, closer and leaves my head less irritated. I highly recommend it. The only negative I can think of is it&#x27;s a bit difficult to shave around the ears.</li>
            <li> this it perfect for guy that want to go blad but scared to shave there heads, this makes it easy</li>
            <li> Remember those cheep knock-off Matchbox / Hot-Wheels cars we had as kids?  Same not so round wheels with sharp mold lines, same sad bent axle, and the same crap-tacular body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the blade.  Straight?  NOPE.  Sharp?  kinda... more like jagged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip for holding on the blade is so brittle and thin that it just crumbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off trying to shave your head with a rusty steak knife.</li>
            <li> Product has kept my head cut free.  Pretty quick to use.</li>
            <li> The title says it all:  Well-designed but cheaply made unit.  Flimsy blade mount that comes off too easily. Wheels break off (not \\&quot;pop\\&quot; off to be easily snapped back on) if you are unlucky enough to drop it in the sink. In fairness, however, you can silicone the wheels into place (they will not rotate) and use it, but you can do wheelies on your dome without risking loss of the treads.  Why bother? Get a multi-head electric shaver instead.</li>
            <li> OK, went back to single edge disposibles no hair clogs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about 20 years and decided to give this a shot, since I saw it on the store shelf, and had seen a documentary on the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give them this -- it is fun to use, and for me, it worked surprisingly well.  I can&#x27;t say that its any faster overall than using my trusty Mach 3 or Fusion, but, its nice to use -- just to try something different every once in a while.  I still use one of my old workhorses to get around my ears.  But going over the top and down the back, it did a good job and was probably does take a little less time in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I think its pretty good tool, and a novel invention.</li>
            <li> I have shaved my head off and on for the last 17 years. Sometimes just for the heck of it and sometimes for charity. Sometimes to get into a Mariners game.(Go Buhner. I know he&#x27;s retired but still he&#x27;s cool!)    Anyway, as for the actual shaving of my head, I&#x27;ve done it hundreds of times with all kinds of different razors and I have never found a product that worked as well as this does.  It works best on the top of the head.  With a single pass, and I go against the grain, it takes it down to baby bottom smooth!  On the sides and the back it takes a little more work. I find the hair at the top of my head grows in one direction only but on the sides it grows a little from the front to the back, which makes for a challenging angle, at the nape it grows sideways, and at the point of the crown it grows in circles (cowlick!)    So I&#x27;ve learned to shave my head according to how my hair grows and this works just fine. Better than fine, it&#x27;s excellent and better than any face razor I&#x27;ve ever used on my head.  Way better than Bic, far better than Schick, and even better than battery powered Gillette Proglide Fusion.  I&#x27;ve used them all, and I like my face so I don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff.  The Headblade with the push design does better than all of them.  One caveat is that I do use their triple blade and the headblade sport. I&#x27;ve not tried their double blade.    Anyway, I don&#x27;t work for Headblade, and their products aren&#x27;t that cheap, but they do work and very well!</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor basically because I was too lazy to go to the store to actually buy one, and it looked cool lol. Well with that said I will never buy a different razor to shave my head again! I have been shaving my head for a couple months now and it has been difficult, and painful, to find a razor that works well without tearing the top of my head off! Well the HeadBlade is the perfect razor for anyone who is thinking about shaving their head! It is VERY easy to use, and have yet to even nick myself up more less full out scalp myself! I would recommend this razor to ANYONE!</li>
            <li> Headblade makes it easy and even fun to shave your head. Doesn&#x27;t matter the reason why you want to shave your head, if you&#x27;re looking into Headblade I assume you&#x27;re considering it. I&#x27;ll tell you that when I tried shaving my head 2 years ago with regular razors and it didn&#x27;t quite work out so well, in fact I only kept it up for a week. But for various reasons I decided to shave my head again, this time I bought a Headblade to handle the task. As someone who has tried various methods of head shaving I can safely say that Headblade is the absolute best way to get the job done right. Piece of advice, buy the headslick too when you buy a Headblade; I didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference but it does. I still got a pretty good shave without the headslick but I get a much closer shave with it. Try it out for the summer, bald is in.</li>
            <li> Son liked but got easily frustrated when he couldn&#x27;t replace the blade</li>
            <li> I was told this product was great for shaving my head and I&#x27;ve cut a chunk out of my head every time!  I wish I could have returned it!</li>
            <li> Works OK but not as good as I had expected.  Still don&#x27;t get a close shave and you&#x27;ll cut yourself if you press down.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to, but works great, even against the grain. Would recommend the 4-blade cartridges though. I began shaving my head about 6 months ago. It is a daily chore for me, so I needed something to save me some time. After using a regular old razor for a few months, I decided to try this out due to some rave reviews (and price). Definitely took my time for the first week, was a little painful but never had any nicks/cuts. After a few months of using it, my recommendations (for coarse hair) would be getting yourself some good shaving cream, and using the 4 blade cartridges. Both make a significant difference. I also use the Headblade cream afterwards several times a week. Love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad - learning curve, first week of use was rough,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good - Small, light, quicker than with a straight razor, great cut with 4 blade razors</li>
            <li> It def shave the head but it seems like the blades are too dull. not sure if this is the intention but i wouild like a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily, and it works quite well.  I don&#x27;t recommend the blades they sell, however.  I have used them and they aren&#x27;t as good as the standard two-blade Twins you can get at most Walmart stores.</li>
            <li> Fast delivered, very nice!</li>
            <li> Fell apart on second use, nicked me badly both times I used it</li>
            <li> Still get a better shave with my regular razor. Maybe if I keep practicing with it my head shaving would improve.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this razor, but after reading reviews I decided to go with it. I use it once, and stopped after shaving a small portion of my head. If the wheels come off your head, even a tiny bit, you will get cut. I now have 2 very painful chunks taken out of my head. I have never cut my self so bad or so painfully while shaving.</li>
            <li> I had been shaving my head for over a year with a Gillette Fusion.  A colleague suggested I try this guy. While it seems to be a quicker shave on account of it feeling safer I haven&#x27;t been that happy. The shave isn&#x27;t all the close and I have nicked the back of my head each time I&#x27;ve used it.  I hadn&#x27;t nicked my scalp at all previously.      Its a nice gadget to have, but I have stopped using it. I would only recommend the HeadBlade if you&#x27;re looking for something fun rather than an upgrade from your current razor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this company is still in business, the triple blades themselves are stacked so close that after two strokes hair gets jammed between the blades and makes it unusable until you bang the hair out, over and over, literally after every stroke (breaking the stupid wheels off) I hated these blades so much I thought about writing the company.  I can&#x27;t be the first person that found these blades to be worthless.  The head blade system itself is a stupid gimmick that actually limits your control and leverage.  I only bought it because it was the only razors left in the PX...guess I now know why.</li>
            <li> This is the first blade that I have cut myself with in the past two decades, and I&#x27;m not talking just a nick but a major peel the skin off cut!  Dulls quickly and the pushing motion required to use the headblade is totally unnatural.  Mine is now in the trash.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancee because he was starting to shave down to the skin and it ended up taking a chunk out of his skin. He prefers the weight of his normal razor for shaving his head now and we got rid of this.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for over 8 years with various types of disposable razors, usually the single or double razor varieties.  Last summer a friend gave me as a \\&quot;gag\\&quot; gift this HeadBlade.  I had seen it advertised on TV, so I was intrigued and anxious to use it.  Alluring design, but the reality is that is does not work well in tight areas--i.e., around ears--and it is awkward to maneuver.  After giving it a couple of tries, I threw it away and returned to the more nimble, easily manageable single-blade disposable.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this inferior product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband after he saw it on TV. He said it works okay, but prefers a regular razor. This can be tricky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Love it. Best way for me to shave my head yet</li>
            <li> the worst shave I ever gotten! I thought he that just what the doc order, unfortunately my head blade left me cuts and abrasions  all over my head, I went to the dollar store picked up some razors and (Bam) I was back!  I wish it could have been different, but it wasn&#x27;t.  Send a new head blade that works!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me why, I couldn&#x27;t tell you but, I own and have used both the 3 blade and 4 blade models and I consistently get a closer (bare skin) shave with the 3 blade model over the 4 blade model.  In this case, for me, more is not better.</li>
            <li> great for baldness. good for a nice clean shave of your head, Much better than the conventional blade. I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> it make shaving your head a breeze. I highly recommend this product to anyone that shaves there head. its really simple to use and well worth the money</li>
            <li> I tried shaving with this twice and managed to remove two large chunks from my scalp.  I guess there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but I&#x27;m not willing to sacrifice any more of my scalp to round that curve...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my partner because he had been talking about getting one for months.  I was hoping he would enjoy the razor.  The razor actually cuts pretty good.  The main issue is that it clogs up very easy and the hair is hard to remove.  After every stroke triple the effort was spent cleaning the hair out of the razor.  After 3 strokes we both decided to just go back to clipper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me. Just didn&#x27;t get the close shave that I thought I&#x27;d get. Still had to go back over my head with a different razor to get what the cut I needed.</li>
            <li> I think it may very well be similar to the eternal Ford vs. Chevy debate (sorry Dodge guys), or the Glock vs. Springfield armory debate. What works for me, may not work for you. I bought the Headblade ATX and was using the headblade 4 blades with Barbasol cream. It worked OK, but not really any faster than my DE razor, and not as close a shave. I decided to get the Sport so I could use the adapter for the sensor blades since they are cheaper. I also picked up a bottle of HeadSlick shaving cream. It is more like a gel than like a lathery cream. I digress. The pushing motion vs. the pulling motion is unbelievable. While I am feeling for rough spots and pulling my scalp tight for a close shave the Sport puts the blade right by my opposing fingers to cut those short hairs, while the ATX would be 2 inches away and I would have to make several multiple passes with lots of pressure. That alone made a convert out of me. This review is on a thirty-six hour shave. With the grain I didn&#x27;t notice the sport really cutting very well, so I went against the grain. This thing mowed the stubble off of my head like a commercial zero turn mower on a week old lawn. I could almost hear it in the shower. Oh, I should mention, not one nick or cut anywhere. Thats the first time that has happened. I use Pinaud Clubman aftershave and it didn&#x27;t sting nearly as bad as in previous shaves  The sport does the job twice as good as the ATX and three times faster. I&#x27;ve only been shaving my head for a few weeks. This is clearly my Chevy, or Springfield if you will. A flat out no-brainer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a gillette mach 3 razor for about 3 years to shave my head....thought i would give this a try.....What a bad idea!!!  After a few passes, i was cut so badly in the back of my head, and it bled for about 10 minutes. There was actually a big chunk of skin left in the razor blade.  I will never use this product again.  In the 3 years of using a regular razor....i was never cut or nicked so severely.</li>
            <li> This is a really good idea.  It gives you more control than a typical razor does.  I have only been shaving my head for about 6 months but I wouldn&#x27;t use another razor.  As with other razors this is sharp.  So if you don&#x27;t use it correctly, meaning keeping the wheels down, you will cut yourself.  And don&#x27;t go too long between shaves or the blade will have a hard time going through all the hair.  Which brings me to the one thing that I really don&#x27;t like about this product, the design of the cartridge.  It is not a design that allows water to flow easily through it for cleaning.  So instead of being able to swish it around in the sink you actually have to run water over it.  And sometimes in multiple directions to get all the hair out.  The longer the hair the worst this gets.  And the more worn the cartridge the less coating on the blades to help the hair slide off.  One thing to watch out for that is different than other razors is the \\&quot;suspension\\&quot; on this.  It allows the cartridge to move up and down and tilt with the shape of your head.  But it is not part of the cartridge itself.  So every once in a while you have to replace it too, though how often depends on your use of the HeadBlade.  It is just about as important that this has the right tension as the blade being sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Headblade for 4 Months.  I&#x27;ve no Male Pattern Baldness, I&#x27;m 18. And Was looking for an entirely new look. And I turned to an extreme. Sue me. But. In my experience. Being a young and mexican and having an incredible hair per inch amount. This product is a No-No if you have full, thick hair.. If I go with the grain, The shave is poor, I run my hands against grain. It&#x27;s Sandpaper quality. Even with. EVEN WITH A NEW BLADE.   And If I go against the grain, I might as well hover a knife over my head and take a few pokes.   Based of my experience, Against the grain for my thick hair &#x3D; Badbadbad. With the Grain. EHH. It&#x27;s acceptable but not skin close. You rub your hand through it, feels like sandpaper.   Quick and Efficient. Quality Egg smooth head, Far from my reaches with this tool on my head. Was a nice concept though.   Ohh Yea, I did Prep work, like Cleaner Headshave, Head shed, Head Slick. They works brilliantly when I take my dads Mach. But Headshave, Nice concept. But poor work is done.  -I hope nobody comments about my Technique probably lacking. I have a Bald Barber dad, who taught me alot about shaving. And my skill wasn&#x27;t lacking, but the tools ability to work.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing thing I have ever bought.  I took it real slow the first time I used it and NO CUTS. I read the directions on how to use it(they even have a video on there website) and it was so simple to use.  This shaves my head so fast compared to the old style razor.  I know I will never go back.  Not to mention I only paid $10 for mine at Walgreens, so I think being so cheap it is worth a try. You will NOT regret it.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how this product can get the positive reviews that it did, but everyone has a different head shape and hair type.  Short and to the point, I looked like I was on the losing end of a knife fight. Many nicks and cuts and a nickel size gouge on the bump at the back of my head. If you still want to try this, have a stypic pencil on hand, you will need it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I reluctently purchased the headblade razor due to all of the mixed reviews. He used it last night for the first time and it was the closest shave he has ever gotten! It took almost no time at all the shave his entire head and it worked perfectly. JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS and it works like a CHARM!! If I could give this product a higher rating I would.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower to shave the portions that i can not see,&lt;br /&gt;the rest in front of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems at all</li>
            <li> Anyone who shaves their head should try the HeadBlade.  Used in the shower you can shave your head in less than 2 min. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s a@@.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. hair have to be very short for it to work. spaces between blades are tight.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic, tryit, love it, use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave your head, why would you use anything else .</li>
            <li> A good multi blade razor (5 blade) is easier and more versatile. Nothing wrong with the product, it performs.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me one of these, thinking it would be easier to use than a normal razor.  WRONG!!  The damn thing took a chunk out of my head, with blood quickly covering the shower floor.  I&#x27;ve gotten some cuts and scratches from shaving my face and head before, but this was insane.  I can&#x27;t remember if my wife returned it, or we just threw it away.  Either way, that thing was evil.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it was invented by Satan himself.  If you have one, remember the words, \\&quot;The power of Christ compels you!\\&quot; as you try to exorcise the demons out of it.  This gadget is perfect for blood sacrifices, but lousy for shaving your head.</li>
            <li> 30% of the reviews for this product are \\&quot;singletons\\&quot; - in other words, the \\&quot;reviewer\\&quot; only reviewed this product which seems highly unlikely and wholly suspect.  I have learned to check the five-star reviews to see how many other products the reviewer has actually written about.  Lots of padding on the Amazon.</li>
            <li> Easy way to shave your head without tearing up skin. And you can now find many compatible blades at many different stores. All in all, it&#x27;s handy and fast.</li>
            <li> I broke my older one after using it for better than 6 years.  This newer one is even better with the wheel and rubberized finger strap.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Headblade Sport Ultimate Head Shaver and started using regular shaving cream and decided to try Headslick shave cream. This is the perfect companion to the shaver. Much closer shave. This razor work great.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a GIMMICKY and HORRIBLE design! Headblade touts their usable and trademark \\&quot;wheel\\&quot; design AS \\&quot;revolutionary\\&quot;, but this is in no way easier to use than a standard razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it the way it&#x27;s designed then you are only able to shave a strip of hair HALF the width of a conventional razor! I tried to redeem this purchase by using it on my face instead, but again.. it&#x27;s too crapy for that, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only place I have left to shave is my nether-region, which this thing is not even worthy to touch. Keep your training wheels, Headblade. And scoot back to the lab to work on a better design.</li>
            <li> Great concept but not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like running a toy car on your head.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves the frontal region of your head well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It does not shave well on the back of your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;If not careful, you will nick yourself behind the ears with the HeadBlade.&lt;br /&gt;You will need a separate razor to get all the fine grain that the HeadBlade leaves behind on the back of your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;You will need to take extra care (go very slow) while shaving the back of your head. The HeadBlade does not go over skin folds or skull dents well.&lt;br /&gt;Device is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Does the job, just, but more awkward than a conventional razor. Too fiddly. Also, four blades would make it more efficient. More design gimmick than anything else. Not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I dislike the HB ATX with a passion. My HB sport was lost forever and this was the replacement. I&#x27;m thinking of a couple of more to have in backup since I don&#x27;t see my hair growing back anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the newer &amp;#34;revisions&amp;#34; they made to these, they used to be better built/quality. Not sure why the changes, but I probably won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice concept but it just just doesn&#x27;t cut it. As a bald man I&#x27;m always looking for new ways to shave. I&#x27;ve tried many deferent methods from electric to old school straight blade and I really thought this headblade would be the easiest and most fastest way to shave. Like all new things it takes time to get used to, at lest that&#x27;s what I told myself. After using it I would always have to go over my head again with my disposable razor because the headblade would never shave my head like the regular razor dose. So with that said I&#x27;m sticking with old mr. reliable,  the disposable.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Guys ask him all the time how he gets such a close shave on his head.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at all the 1 star reviews for the Headblade Sport.  I have used this razor for years and I never have experienced the problems some people have.  This razor gives the smoothest and most stubble free results.  I’m going to list a few tips I’ve learned over the years;&lt;br /&gt;1)  This is a push razor, and it will do most of the work for you.  You don’t have to apply much, if any, downward force.  It should glide over your head.  If you push down into your skull you will lose some skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) If you have gone more than a day or two between shaves then you will need to clean the razor after every pass.  This isn’t as bad as it sounds.  You just take it and hold it in a stream of water, either your shower or your sink and it comes clean right away.  If you don’t do it every pass you will not get a close shave and you will start pushing down leading to a scalping.&lt;br /&gt;3) Change your blade often.  I change my blade on my head razor twice as often as I do for my face razor if I’m going awhile between shaves.  If I’m shaving daily it lasts much longer.  If it feels like your razor is catching or giving you little nicks then change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;4) When shaving I start from the front to the back, then switch back to front.  Finally, for the sides I start at the ear and go up.  When doing the sides I normally hold the razor between two fingers instead of resting the razor on a finger&lt;br /&gt;5) Use a little bit of shaving cream or something of the sort.  I shave in the shower and I cannot recommend Nivea Active 3 enough.  It is truly a shave, body wash &amp; shampoo (but if you’re buying this razor, who cares about the shampoo).  Nivea Active 3 is the perfect amount of lubricant so the razor glides over your head, but it does not clog up your razor.&lt;br /&gt;By following these steps, I have had a smooth scalp for years.  I have never experienced any of the problems other people have stated.  If this helps….my head is smooth on the top, but not in the back.  I have never cut myself due to any “shape” issues with my head.  The only times I have cut myself is when I used a dull blade that I knew I should have replaced, and those were only small nicks.  The Headblade razor is the best razor for shaving my head and yes I used to use a regular razor to shave my head.  Give it a shave or two or three before giving up on it, you won’t be disappointed..

            <li> I&#x27;m always open to a better way to shave my head more efficiently, easily, etc. Put simply: this ain&#x27;t it. While the grip design would seem to be it&#x27;s best selling point, it really only makes a marginal difference over holding a more mainstream blade (like a Gillette fusion or Schick hydro) in a similar fashion. The real drawback, especially compared to Gillette and Schick, are the blades themselves. They don&#x27;t last as long or cut nearly as cleanly as those other razors. In fact, it was using the head blade that for the fist time EVER I cut a pretty decent sized chunk out of my scalp, and this was after using the blade for a bit and getting used to it (which takes a few times). I had never cut my scalp like that before using other blades. This product could work for some, but it&#x27;s not for me. [so why two stars and not one? Because, in principal, it&#x27;s a good idea.]</li>
            <li> in some ways the sport is easier to use than the classic; think of it as training wheels on a bike. just GO SLOWLY and apply no pressure.  it&#x27;s not a race, you want to caress the blade over your head like your bathing an infant.  applying pressure does not equal a closer shave!</li>
            <li> the folks who gave this thing good reviews must know the inventor or somthing. this thing is usless exept on the top of the head. if ur trying to shave a contour, forget it. you feel like you are going to cut your scalp.after the 3rd time trying it, i trashed it. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Used this twice and cut the back of my head open both times.. First time I blamed myself for pressing too hard and it wasn&#x27;t that bad a nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time the thing slipped and went sideway and sliced a thin chunk of skin out of my head that I had to pull out of the blades..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have two dark scabs on the back of my head and I wasted ten bucks..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to Mac 3, which I used to use in the shower with no problem and most of the time no shaving cream or anything and never got one cut!</li>
            <li> I ordered another Sport and Headblade sent me the more expensive HB4 ATX....what a POS. Headblade, why would you ever think that rolling the wheels over your foam instead of going blade first was a better thing than what you had with the Sport? What a piece of crap design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that blade spring that you use is so stiff you have to push down so hard you take chunks of skin off your scalp. Wish I could give this one a zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future send me what I order....I know, the &amp;#34;newer much betterer&amp;#34; ATX has proprietary blades that I need to order from you whereas the sport uses face blades from the dollar store but did you get that the razor is crappy? Sheesh.</li>
            <li> Decided to try a new look where I shave my scalp every few days and was looking for something that would be faster (and hopefully cheaper) than the Mach 3 I had been using. A forum I visit mentioned the Headblade Sport, so I ordered it and decided to give it a shot. Upon first receiving it, the Headblade Sport appears similar to a tiny snow plow tractor, with a shovel blade up front and wheels in the back. When you remove it from the stupid vacuum plastic packaging, what first strikes you is how small it is. About half the length of a Fusion ProGlide razor. And it is yellow and black, which at least to me, looks kinda cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect which struck me as a bit strange, is that the HB 3 razor blade cartridge (more on this in a bit), was turned around wrong. Upon reading the included instructions and watching the official Youtube video, I realized that this was done on purpose. Unlike with say the Gillette razors or a Merkur double edged safety razor, where you pull the blade over the hairs, with the Headblade Sport, the company intends for you to push the blade into your hairs to shave them off. The only problem with this is that shaving companies have studied this in detail for several decades and what often happens is that the user incurs a much higher chance for nicking themselves. This is also the number one complaint against the Headblade Sport (or ATX) here at Amazon.com. Many guys probably decide to give the little Sport model a try and then try to take long sweeping arcs over the scalp &#x27;pushing&#x27; the hair off, only to see themselves nicked and giving up on the Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the Headblade Sport for the first week as the company intended with a pushing motion, and was very careful to not cut myself. But, I did not like it, and if that was the only option available to me, I would have rated the Headblade as about 1.5 stars out of 5. Fortunately, after the first week, I just turned the adapter around and now had the HB3 three blade cartridge facing in the correct direction. By using the Headblade in a pulling motion (like a Gillette Fusion, Mach 3, Merkur, etc....), I found I did not need to be as worried about minor nicks and I could actually shave faster. (the exact engineering reason behind this is because of stress preceding the blades as affects skin folding). Normally with my Mach 3, I am able to shave my entire scalp including the tight spots around the ears in about 7 or 8 minutes. The Headblade Sport reduced that for me to about 2 or 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first began with the Headblade Sport, I was using generic menthol shaving cream which worked well enough but not excellently. Part of the reason for this is that scalp hair is different from beard hair and the coefficient of friction for the two surfaces (scalp versus face) are different. Then I decided to try the Headblade Headslick shaving gel, which is much slicker than most shaving creams. (I attribute this to the amount of propylene glycol used, but will check it biochemically later) When I used the Headslick with the Sport, I was able to shave faster and do so safely. I would say I can now shave my entire scalp, and do a good job in about two minutes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also report that there is a bit of a learning curve to using the Headblade. Part of it is muscle memory and proprioceptive relay. Anyone who uses a Headblade will not achieve superior results in the first week (and maybe, even in the first month). It takes a while to relearn all the contours of your scalp and be able to hit them correctly to get a perfectly smooth dome. The learning curve is very similar to what I experienced when I switched to a double edged safety razor for my face. I can also see how 40% of guys would try a Headblade and discard it as a trinket after only one or two shaves because it did not cut as closely as their Mach 3 or Fusion ProGlide. I felt the same way myself until week two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my few complaints about the Sport model is the rubberized middle finger ring that helps you to hold it. It was too flexible and in several angles, it was difficult to maintain a proper grasp to get close cuts. My technique did improve as the weeks passed, but the finger ring needs some redesign. In 2012, to remedy some of the problems of the Sport model, Headblade introduced their ATX model which does have a better finger holding loop and another curve for the index finger. I purchased the ATX model as well (but not until about three weeks after I already had the Sport). Overall, I like the ATX model ever so slightly better than the Sport, but Headblade recommends the ATX be used with Headblade&#x27;s higher end bladed cartridges, which means more money for Headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since we have come to the cartridges, it is time to mention your options if using the Sport or ATX model. The Sport uses what Headblade calls the HB3 cartridge or what I call a Mach 3 clone. It is a cartridge with three blades and lubricating strip. The Sport also comes with an adapter for Gillette Sensor Excel cartridges if you prefer them. (the ATX does not have an adapter for Sensor Excel cartridges and Gillette products cannot be used with it) I tried both the HB3 blades for three weeks and the Sensor Excel and both did fine. The Excel was perhaps marginally better, but the price is usually higher as well. On Amazon.com right now, you can get four HB3 cartridges for $8.20 (or $2.05 per cartridge). For the Excel blades, if you are willing to buy a 20 pack for almost $40, you can get them as cheap as about $1.95 per cartridge, but usually they are in the range of $2.40. Either way, you will probably not be able to tell a large difference if you were blindfolded. The best deal after searching it turns out is from Personna (a blade company out of Israel). Here on Amazon you can search for their Tri-Flexxx cartridges (which will fit the Headblade Sport and of course, the Sensor Excel (if you still own one)) If you buy in bulk, you can actually buy one cartridge for as low as 60 cents, and Tri-Flexxx cartridges are actually rated higher than HB3 blades or Gillette Sensor blades. Go figure. I recently tried these cheaper cartridges and found them to be just fine. Definitely equal to, if not better than authentic Gillette Sensor Excel cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the newer Headblade ATX, the company recommends their four bladed cartridge (the HB4) or their six bladed cartridge (yep, you guessed it, the HB6). Why they dont make a 27 bladed cartridge with micro scissoring blades, so that I can also use the ATX to shave my privates if needed, I have no idea :) All this multi-bladed stuff is pure silliness to be honest. If there is one thing I have learned by using my refined Merkur 38c HD, is that more blades just equal more skin irritation and increased profits for whoever is selling this stuff to the general public. Although, Gillette and Shick guard their cartridge prices as a top secret, most industry experts put the price of one Fusion (5 blade) cartridge at 21 to 31 cents to manufacture and ship. And yet, Gillette sells it for around $3.50 in the USA, $4.50 in the UK and $5.50 in Hong Kong or Singapore. In other words, with almost any of these multi-bladed cartridge claims, you are being robbed and the only thing that is surprising, is that they did not get to your flat screen, yet. You can use the HB3 with the ATX but the company does not recommend it because it interferes with their bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my recommendation for head shavers is to give the Headblade Sport a shot. Even though I like the ATX model better, you can use the much cheaper Tri-Flexxx cartridges with the Sport. Either model can be found for under $10 on Amazon if you watch for deals. Once you try the one free cartridge included in the package, head here to Amazon.com or another reputable supplier and look up Tri-Flexxx if you went for the Sport model. Then, try out some Headblade Headslick shaving gel. Unlike the blade cartridges, the Headslick gel actually works well. Once you get started, go slow for the first week until you start to learn the correct pressures and shape of your skull. Within a month, you will probably be shaving more smoothly and faster than with your old Mach 3, Hydro or Fusion Pro Glide, and more cheaply. Do not expect good or excellent results in the first week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, decent product if you take a few precautions first. I would give the Sport model 4 stars out of 5. The ATX model 4.3 stars out of 5 if using the HB3 blades, and the Sport model with Tri-Flexxx blades, about 4.8 stars out of five. Using it now with the Headslick gel and it makes my life easier. Which is the whole enchilada.k, you can actually buy one cartridge for as low as 60 cents, and Tri-Flexxx cartridges are actually rated higher than HB3 blades or Gillette Sensor blades. Go figure. I recently tried these cheaper cartridges and found them to be just fine. Definitely equal to, if not better than authentic Gillette Sensor Excel cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the newer Headblade ATX, the company recommends their four bladed cartridge (the HB4) or their six bladed cartridge (yep, you guessed it, the HB6).

            <li> This is so easy to use and it does a decent job. Just wish that the shave were closer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my son to shave is head. Then his father in law wanted one when he saw it, so bought some more. The price was great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any advantage over a normal razor. Just more expensive.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool little guy. I haven&#x27;t used it much in the past 6 months because I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, but I enjoyed using it the first few months I had it. Never cut myself, but I was pretty cautious. Still have it in case I go hairless again.</li>
            <li> suck, 2 blade too close to each other, after a few shave hairs stuck in between, then it become useless. if hair is not stuck between the blade then it would work well. love it but the blade turn me down.</li>
            <li> I Seen this product on the net and was very excited to find a store and purchase one. I have been shaving for a few years and tried just about every method and also going back to the trusty gillette...i was very skepitcal at first and thought what the hell for 11 bucks it was worth a try..my trusty gillette blades cost double that.....I AM TOTALLY AMAZED. closet cleanest shave i ever had in half the time. Very easy to use. its like running your fingers thru your hair if you had any lol. i give this ^5 and 20 thumbs up...a must have.</li>
            <li> Great product. I like the atx version, but I think the sport cuts closer. You just need to be more diligent with it, but I do love the sport. Make sure you get the correct version yellow and black. The all yellow version has a large finger hole and it is not adjustable. Big fingers might like it, but small fingers are better with the newer adjustable model (yellow and black) as pictured.</li>
            <li> Used to use a razor and switched to the Headblade.  No turning back as the Headblade is simple and very effective.  Makes shaving the ol&#x27; bean very easy.  Instead of shaving your noggin&#x27; in front of a sink and mirror I&#x27;d highly suggest shaving in the shower.  Makes rinsing the Headblade easier and you will get a closer shave.  Plus after a few tries you won&#x27;t need access to a mirror.  Buy it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 20 years now and have tried everything to get a quick, thorough shave.  I was excited upon seeing the possibilities of something aimed at guys who shaved their heads. I was extremely disappointed. It feels odd, cumbersome, and ineffective. I would really like to see who they did their test market with because I&#x27;m floored that it made it to prime time.  Seriously, based on my extensive experience. If you want a great, fast, thorough shave,  use the Gillette Fusion razor  with the electric mode.  It really works well.</li>
            <li> I agree with several of the reviews that this razor works just as advertised.  However I also have issues with the blades needing constant rinsing and cleaning with an old toothbrush.  I use the Headblade as a first pass with a dozen rinses and cleanings before using a Fusion razor with battery to &amp;#34;clean-up&amp;#34; the remaining areas.</li>
            <li> Ok I started shaving my head a month ago and right after the buzz cut I used the head blade Triple blade. Do not rush shaving with a fresh blade and rinse very often. I rushed and carved out some tear drop chunks out my scalp which bled a lot. That is not the head blades fault for cutting me I was rushing. I have alternated back and forth from my Gillette mach 3 turbo to see which I liked better and must say I like my mach 3 turbo much better. It seems more natural since I have used it for years and it seems to do a better job of shaving with fewer strokes. I shave my head every other to three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try and experiment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a smooth roll and the blade is cheap. Dulls after single use.</li>
            <li> Showed up super fast ,in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Got it for my husband and he loves it . Super happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> The Headblade Sport is the absolute best.  I have been using it for about five years.  It is easy to use and gives and unbelievably close shave with minimal risk of nicks or cuts.  Beware of the new ATX model.  It is the absolute worst.  Headblade made a huge mistake by introducing the ATX model.  Unfotunately, it is harder to find replacement blades for the Sport model.  My local retailer replaced the Sport with the ATX so the only way to get the Sport replacement blades is on line.  The difference between the Sport and ATX models is very similar to Coke Classic and New Coke.  We all know how that went.  If Headblade completely discontinues the Sport model, I&#x27;m sure they will go out of business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed how good this thing is and how simple it is! Why I didn&#x27;t think of it??</li>
            <li> If yo&#x27;re looking for a gadget to keep on your bathroom shelf - go for it. That&#x27;s what I use it for now.&lt;br /&gt;The wear of the batch of blades I bought with the handle was amazingly fast. The price of a refill - too steep.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to my usual razor that does the job all the same (even better, actually) and for a much more reasonable price. The Headblade was a gadget - nothing more.</li>
            <li> I shave my head regularly so I bought this thinking it would make it easier. It works good but Im so used to a disposable razor it doesn&#x27;t speed up the process and because of the wheels and the way it works it doesnt get a close enough shave as a disposable razor but you don&#x27;t cut yourself ever.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving the head easy and safe. Since using it the number of nicks on my scale have gone down.</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time, it made the save so much faster and easier. Not one nick on my head....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommending it to all my bald friends.</li>
            <li> This product was hard to use.  It did a good job in the front but once you got to the middle and back where you can&#x27;t see, it started missing spots.</li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave, not happy with this product. It did not give as good a shave as advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He loves it.  Took a minute to get use to, but once he got it it works great.</li>
            <li> waste of money.  I&#x27;ll stick with my trusty fusion</li>
            <li> I just got my headblade today and I love it , took my about maybe 10 mins to shave and it was great no nicks or cuts and my head is nice and smooth , I have looked at a lot  of reviews and was kinda worried that i bought this for nothing , but I was amazed how close the shave was and how close of a cut I got out of it , I will never go back to a regular razor i love the headblade</li>
            <li> Outstanding! Best way I can find to shave head. Consider exploring other options on blades, however. Odds are good that you&#x27;ll find something less expensive and/or better than the HeadBlade brand blades.  I like the Gillette 3 blade cartridges and the Dollar General two blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> This little shaver does a great job! And so easy. Just keep the wheels on your head and follow the contour of your head. No nicks or cuts. Great little invention.</li>
            <li> I watched the videos. I studied the reviews. They hid nothing. I don&#x27;t think I could get this kind of smoothness or quality from trying to use a regular shaving on my head. This is made for speed and safety.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I tried to use it.  Worked great for first five minutes, then the head slick shave gel that is made by same company clogged up the blade and wouldn&#x27;t rinse out, so I tried to remove the blade to clean it, and the plastic piece snapped.  Not pleased at all with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband. Doesn&#x27;t do the job very well. For some it might. For him it didn&#x27;t, and that was even after clipping his hair down to use this.</li>
            <li> Amazing, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is my wife loves it too and uses it to shave her legs. Can you please make one in pink for her?</li>
            <li> This is a great gift for a buddy who is into head shaving.  They love it, and being guys, like the car and the toy combination</li>
            <li> they were last year&#x27;s gifts everyone enjoyed them thank you, one person&#x27;s son stole his, so I may have to get more.</li>
            <li> I shave my head everyday, and I have been for about five years.  The Dead blade makes it quick and easy to do.  I use the AstraPlus blades in mine.  This last one, I bought the finger loop is flexible, and makes it feel pretty good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do fine that I end up replacing the shaver about every 18 months.  I end up breaking the piece that holds the blades on.  Other than that I am a completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased for my travel bag, so I don&#x27;t forget to take it with me!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help me shave my head and I have to say it does help. The hold it let&#x27;s you have is much easier to use than using a standard angle a regular razor forces you to use. It&#x27;s very comfortable and I was able to find compatible replacement cartridges easily. There&#x27;s not much else to say, it works as it&#x27;s supposed to and I use it every day.</li>
