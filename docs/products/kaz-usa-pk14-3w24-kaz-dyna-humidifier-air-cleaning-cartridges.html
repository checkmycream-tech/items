            <li> Correct product for my vaporizer. Decent price. Is made exactly like original except one side is black instead of white. I checked with manufacture and that is correct.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I ordered the Protec DyanFilter Air Cleaning Humidifier Cartridges and I have to say that I am very satisfied with the price and the product.

            <li> I bought these for my son&#x60;s humidifier.  Not a bad product but i&#x60;m going to buy  a filterless humidifier for next year, no hassle  b/c there is not any filter&#x60;s to change.</li>
            <li> Great filter for a great price! My humidifier came from my mom who lost the filter. I found these on Amazon A LOT CHEAPER than I found them in stores!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! It fits well, and it works like the original one! The price was the best part of a deal! I don&#x27;t have any complaints!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my cool mist humidifier. They are VERY efficient.  What&#x27;s great is I can pop out one to wash in the sink w/mild shampoo &amp; use another while the 1st 1 dries.When it&#x27;s time to switch, I repeat the process.  I&#x27;ve stayed with the same 2 filters,washing them weekly ( our pets kick up a lot of dust.) Very sturdy &amp; super effiecient.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>

            <li> These serve the purpose of keeping the air fresh. I would use them again if I could find a Kaz Mist Humidifier that meets my expectations better than the 4100 model--which it didn&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> I have searched when shopping  and could not find the filters for my Vicks Humidifier. Thank you for having them. There are 3 new cartridges  in the box. They look just like the cartridges that came with my new humidifier. The only difference that I notice is that the white filter is not as thick as my original one.  The cartridge fits the humidifier and I am happy to have been able to find them.</li>
            <li> I do not have complaints of any kind. The item was as advertised and arrived quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores this filter fits a particular humidifier I used when the humidity gets really low.</li>

            <li> Not really much to say about this product.  It works as I thought that it would.  Fits the humidifier that I needed it to.  So, thumbs up all around.</li>
            <li> The box was crumpled and was supposed to contain 3 filters and only contained 2.</li>
