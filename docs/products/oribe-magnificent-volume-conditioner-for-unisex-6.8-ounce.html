            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>is great!</li>
            <li>Best line of hair products I have found.</li>
            <li>Thsi is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>so this combined with the shampoo does an incredible job of volumizing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Whoever gave this product great reviews because they say it is used by the ladies of RHONJ are not telling the truth.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner for fine hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about time for me to order some more !</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this works great.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely product.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly with each product sealed up nicely.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference when using this conditioner</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and shiny looking like the hair on TV commercials.</li>
            <li>A fresh scent</li>
            <li>other oribe products are great though such as royal blowout</li>
            <li>You can easily get the same results from a 10 dollar conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and full bodied thanks to this conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I recommend any of their products really.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me and I would absolutely recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner</li>
            <li>I have very fine black hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave residue like so many other conditioners do.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li>Oribe is a high quality brand</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the price is wayyyy too high to justify the results.</li>
            <li>I use only Oribe hair care products and the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have purchased this conditioner first time from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, limp, color treated hair</li>
            <li>Silky soft hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth the money you save to buy from here, you don&#x27;t know what product you are really getting.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth the cost.</li>

            <li> but it is not available where I live</li>
            <li> It is not intensly moisturizing but does keep down the scraggly dry look especially when it gets close to trim time.  </li>
            <li> and it really does add volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to limp flat hair, this will plump up your hair.</li>
            <li> liked the smell, otherwise, waste of money :(  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> does not weight it down.</li>
            <li> it didnt yield ridiculous results (though I have yet to find a conditioner that does), but it was definitely noticeable after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is not a genuine Oribe product, beware.</li>
            <li> Takes a small amount to do wonders.</li>
            <li> Gives the illusion of a thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> weak, pointless conditioner....</li>
            <li> This conditioner is terrible, it doesn&#x27;t have the normal Oribe scent and it does not do the job like the other Oribe products that I have purchased at a salon.</li>
            <li> Terrible - left hair feeling dry and broken!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say.</li>
            <li> It is expensive so anytime I can get a break on the price or shipping</li>
            <li> was not impressed for $$$ price.</li>
            <li> I believed all the customer testimonials and order this very expensive conditioner and mousse.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very faint so nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is horrible, it does not even detangle my hair like a $5 conditioner from CVS or Walgreens does.</li>
    </ol>

The conditioner is horrible, it does not even detangle my hair like a $5 conditioner from CVS or Walgreens does. Whoever gave this product great reviews because they say it is used by the ladies of RHONJ are not telling the truth. I feel totally ripped of.</li>

            <li> Great conditioner!!! Like having the beauty parlor at home. My hair was smooth and shiny looking like the hair on TV commercials. I will always buy. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this works great. Oribe is a high quality brand so I recommend any of their products really.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. I have very fine black hair so I tried this to get some volume. it didnt yield ridiculous results (though I have yet to find a conditioner that does), but it was definitely noticeable after a few weeks. HOWEVER, the price is wayyyy too high to justify the results. You can easily get the same results from a 10 dollar conditioner. I&#x27;d say skip this and look elsewhere</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to limp flat hair, this will plump up your hair. I noticed a huge difference when using this conditioner</li>

            <li> Best line of hair products I have found. My daughter who is a hairdresser introduced me to the line but it is not available where I live so I have to order online! I have long, fine hair and this conditioner does not weight it down.</li>
            <li> Silky soft hair.  Thsi is a wonderful product. It doesn&#x27;t leave residue like so many other conditioners do.  Takes a small amount to do wonders.</li>
