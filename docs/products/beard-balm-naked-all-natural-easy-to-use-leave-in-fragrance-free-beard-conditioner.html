            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>And without a doubt amazing people making the product!</li>
            <li>It works great, smells good, and lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, great feel.</li>
            <li>It also gives it a good shine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good balm, but doesn&#x27;t have the hold/stiffness of others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>yeah, it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
            <li>I apply once a day, sometimes mornings and sometimes evenings, and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>The results have been really good, as my skin absorbs it well</li>
            <li>I was directed to get a good comb, start using argan oil shampoos and make use of beard oil.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, in good condition.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it also darkened his beard a bit as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Amish Beard balm and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Within 4 days i could notice a softer feel to the beard and it smells homely, very pleasant but not overly strong.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the ordering and shipping process.</li>
            <li>There is no added scent but you will notice a mild coconut oil scent which I think smells very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Absorbs right into the beard and leaves it feeling and looking awesome!</li>
            <li>and I love the product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My beard has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li>This product is awesomely awesome first and foremost.</li>
            <li>Conditions the skin and helps keep my beard healthy!</li>
            <li>So glad we got this!</li>
            <li>Amazing balm-</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing company.</li>
            <li>(there is a stubborn sticker over the ingredients list) but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it could bring about some kind of lady attracting odor of some sort</li>
            <li>To me it almost smells like fresh baked cookies and I have gotten many compliments on smelling so delicious.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and gives your beard a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>The company needs to add some kind of release latch or something to the can.  </li>
            <li>This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li>Great product, cool looking can</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work Beard Balm, you have a fine product.</li>
            <li>By far the best way to use the product itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect blend of hold, moisture, and natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is slightly more oily than the Honest Amish, but it absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Great natural ingredients and amazing smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using Beard Balm for a while now and love it.</li>
            <li>I love beard balm.</li>
            <li>my beard to make sure</li>
            <li>&#x3D;).</li>
            <li>Granted I am trying to modify my application techniques to see if I can go to just a thumbnail of product, but at this moment I&#x27;m having to use more than that.    </li>
            <li>Either way you wont find a better product containing better ingredients and your beard will love you for it.</li>
            <li>And the price can&#x27;t be beat :)</li>
            <li>This stuff really works great at keeping my beard (goatee, now that winter is over) in place, so</li>
            <li>But I imagine being mostly wax</li>
            <li>Top that off with my my wife&#x27;s reaction ---</li>
            <li>but I can safely say that I can already see a difference and have already had people compliment me on the softness and look.</li>
            <li>He loves it, I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was contemplating shaving, so glad I found Naked/Beard Balm and saved my beard.</li>
            <li>Just ordered 6 more cans.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s not for me....</li>
            <li>, this really helps to keep moisturized and works great on my beard too</li>
            <li>The most you&#x27;ll ever get out of it is a whiff of the coconut oil used as one of its bases.</li>
            <li>He has some curl in it and so many of the hairs stick out, poking my face when I get close.</li>
            <li>I am exceptionally pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>He is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>it is nice and soft and not annoying lol.</li>
            <li>I also notice it is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Totally love this product, keeps my beard in place and feeling soft, and the lack of scent makes my wife happy as well.  </li>
            <li>I love the original Beard Balm, so I decided to give this a shot, and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I may use the remainder of this product as a lip balm, however in that utility I would just buy cheaper available everywhere (including most of my couch cushions) burts bees.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the option of having fragrance free when I want!</li>
            <li>Not only is it perfect for those of you that couldn&#x27;t give the original Beard Balm 5 stars due to variable fragrance preferences, it&#x27;s perfect for all of us that simply love the original.</li>
            <li>Just to be clear, I think the original stuff smells great, but I also understand that it may not be appealing to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>My beard has that silky, shinny coat of a true champion, when I take it on walks to the park all the ladies rush over to bet it!  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell, it&#x27;s a unique scent that I just can&#x27;t place, but I get compliments on it all the time.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you follow them on instagram and Facebook for up to date info and some fun contests once and a while!</li>
            <li>I love the original too</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and maintain.</li>
            <li>Received beard balm very quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong and linger around all day.</li>
            <li>and he reports it&#x27;s holding strong and the beard is mighty fine</li>
            <li>Take it easy and rub it in lightly, and try to get to your &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great scent and conditions my beard like no other product (except for the original Beard Balm).</li>
            <li>anyone that found the smell of the original Beard Balm not so appealing, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that Naked&#x27;s scent is extremely mild.</li>
            <li>Naked is a great addition to the regiment.</li>
            <li>Beard Balm Naked is a great product.</li>
            <li>Firmness is precisely the way to describe the &#x27;virgin&#x27; state of the product.    </li>
            <li>As soon as he applied this balm the hairs laid smooth and his beard was softer.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t fragrance free</li>
            <li>so it is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Already used it and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Great Product, better than all other balms and oils I have tried</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this great product as it is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>No smell and very easy to use - beard looks much neater already.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant with a mix of coconut and beeswax, and fades after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>First impressions: When I first received the package of Naked by Beard Balm, I was immediately impressed with the design.</li>
            <li>The material comes about presenting itself as more of a wax with first appearance.</li>
            <li>The product itself doesn&#x27;t bring about a unique smell to it, for it smells just like bee&#x27;z wax and seems to bring about a neutral waxy smell.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a significant difference in the way my face feels.  </li>
            <li>as the original recipe and is almost odorless.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, many different uses.</li>
            <li>Great for cracked dry winter hands.</li>
            <li>jaw, where I shave the rest of the beard clean.</li>
            <li>when I refer to the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Beard Balm, just do a search for \\&quot;beard balm,\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find the original king of beard products, Beard Balm, made by the same good folks in Michigan.</li>
            <li>They stand true to the name, the balm has no smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I don&#x27;t rock a full beard, I do have a Van Dyke.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much hold but your beard will look well groomed and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;Alpha tested&amp;#34; this product  (Naked) for a couple of months now and can say that it is as good as Beard Balm...</li>
            <li>Just enough to smell good but in no way overpowering.  </li>
            <li>A couple days ago, I got my tin of Naked, the newest product from the good Beard Balm folks.</li>
            <li>love the stuff, it works just as well for my beard (and really anything else including my hands, nails, and elbows)</li>
            <li>The no fragrance is 100% true.</li>
            <li>This is hands down absolutely the best product I have ever used for lip balm, and I have tried them ALL.</li>
            <li>This is good but there is better for less.</li>
            <li>For something that&#x27;s going to be right under your nose all day, scent is important.</li>
            <li>Best of using coconut oil directly than using this, I have seen better results with raw coconut oil.</li>
            <li>And, as the product description says, it also works great in other areas.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>made my beard feel soft and smooth, but I am most looking for flyaway control/</li>
            <li>a local, I&#x27;m going to get my next order in person and see where they make this great stuff!!</li>
            <li>Unlike most post-shave balms that are alcohol-based or highly perfumed, this product does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I would go as far to say that I like it better than the original.  </li>
            <li>I love a Detroit product, since I live just a couple miles north of there.</li>
            <li>I whole heartedly support this product!!  </li>
            <li>&quot; for just about 1 week and was blown away with my first application!</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my beard!</li>
            <li>I feel that Amish has better control, likely due to being able to easily apply it more evenly.</li>
            <li>So buy a can of each, and everybody wins.</li>
            <li>One use I found not mentioned is this has the perfect blend needed to condition leather, I recently used the Naked balm to condition/break-in a new pair of leather-lined boots and belt, softened the leather just right!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves it, and I&#x27;m happy that his beard is less prickly!</li>
            <li>Amish beard balm melts into a silky smooth easily applied oil quickly, the Naked remains a waxy burts-bees carmex style viscous goop that has clumped visibly around my mustache and does not spread evenly or go as far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I ordered two tins that got out to Kalamazoo right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember though less is more :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amish has a definite menthol smell, which I find pleasant, but appreciate the value of a no fragrance item you will be putting directly beneath your nostrils.</li>
            <li>My facial hair is considerably softer and more supple, and just looks HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>Now, my beard is healthy, controlled, and smells phenomenal(Yes, it has a slight smell but it smells great and mixes very well with all the different scented beard oils I have).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps Naked just isn&#x27;t trying to be the best beard balm as it does heavily mention skin/lips/etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just started using this, the only thing I have to say is that its flicking amazing!</li>
            <li>but I am satisfied with the way it is starting to look.</li>
            <li>First, it must be stated that I have just started to grow out my beard and never have allowed it grow fully in all my post puberty stage.</li>
            <li>This is the first beard balm I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>If you have, I still recommend it, despite it being the first one I&#x27;ve tried so far.f</li>
            <li>I get better results just using regular hair conditioner when I am in the shower.</li>
            <li>Beard balm seems fantastic so far, it&#x27;s the first ever time</li>
            <li>Definitely going to order more when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Just as the original Beard Balm can be used atop your head, in the grizzle and beyond; Naked boasts unique versatility.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than many of it&#x27;s alternatives, which I am assuming is because they don&#x27;t use any essential oils.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve applied a little more, your beard will appear a bit more shiny; particularly in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is made of such pure ingredients instead of petrolatum.</li>
            <li>It melts down just at smooth and applies easily.</li>
            <li>I was trying to avoid products that have distinct smells to them, as I prefer not to mix so many different fragrances on my body (natural soaps, hair conditioner, shampoos, cologne, deodorant, and the bits of pizza that hide in your beard from time to time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve found a long term beard care product.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with this as it seemed to be the best one for my preferences: it has only a natural scent of coconut and, very slightly, a hint of honey.</li>
            <li>After about a month of using Naked, I am very pleased with the overall softness and fullness my beard has presented itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and will certainly purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Going forward I will definitely be rebuying Amish and not Naked for my beard, but it does serve the purpose and is not a bad product there are just better options on amazon</li>
            <li>Love the new Naked Beard Balm!</li>
            <li>After finally using up my first tin of beard balm (the original stuff),  I found this stuff while looking to restock.</li>
            <li>For me, personally, I typically apply Beard Balm&#x27;s original product at night and then a light oil in the morning.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the fact that it is made in Michigan, my home state, and the fact that it was fragrance free (Naked version).</li>
            <li>The amount of material that you need depends really on your thickness of beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but my wife doesn&#x27;t care for the scent as much as I do.</li>
            <li>There are no artificial fragrances added and the natural smell is almost non existent.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take too much and it feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally like the more natural look.</li>
            <li>I received both this Naked conditioner and Honest Amish Beard Balm as gifts and have compared each for a week, these are the only two beard balms I have experience with, but the difference in texture and application is night and</li>
            <li>but it literally smelt like my beard was becoming dry sticks rubbing against themselves creating mini fires on my face...</li>
            <li>Next time I will try the original scent and see what happens.</li>
            <li>Makes it much more sharp and kept looking.  </li>
            <li>I put it in and asked my wife to check out the scent of my beard; she said \\&quot;I like that one better,\\&quot; referring to Naked versus the original Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>After some mixed reviews of the original stuff&#x27;s scent, I decided I&#x27;d try this stuff out.</li>
            <li>In the future I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this stuff as my &amp;#34;daily driver&amp;#34; and toss in the original mix when I miss the manly smell of it.</li>
            <li>Like many other beard balm and oil techniques, Naked product did best after you \\&quot;melted\\&quot; the material by rubbing your hands together to get the wax into more a oil liquid base.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed to make my beard look professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else ever gets this kind of \\&quot;burning hair\\</li>
            <li>If you have, I still recommend it, despite it being the first one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>Beard is pretty soft and you don&#x27;t get a greasy feeling on your fingers if you stroke it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, and I hope Beard Balm makes this product a regular product, and not just a special edition.</li>
            <li>Possibly supernatural.</li>
            <li>It keeps my beard soft, and from becoming dry.</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t used a beard balm or oil before, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t used a beard balm or oil before, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended- have been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li>The other one had to strong of a scent</li>
            <li>, One of the secondary benefits is that its not exclusive to just his amazing beard</li>
            <li>It is definitely just a natural waxy smell... but would love to have the cookie version in the future.   </li>
            <li>I believe they make a heavy duty version which provides more hold.</li>
            <li>Ya&#x27;ll must be eating some crappy cookies, because this smells more like dried jizz than cookies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting for something to keep my beard presentable at work, and this is the first balm that has actually kept the stray hairs down, and gave me a more groomed appearance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more manageable with this balm as well, helping to tame those stray hairs that try to run away from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this new product \\&quot;Naked\\</li>
            <li>And I could not be happier with the new scent of this &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; balm.</li>
            <li>This was my first can of beard balm, so my knowledge on the matter is not vast.</li>
            <li>I have recently purchased my second can of Beard Balm - Naked and let me tell you, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>plus its all natural!</li>
            <li>Naked beard balm does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for dry lips, and it just made my lips more dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend after having enough of seeing his facial hair look super unruly.</li>
            <li>I fear that the current amount that is given will ultimately go quickly for the daily user.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a price difference but in a week I easily used twice as much naked as Amish due to the texture differences.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have any real smell to it.</li>
            <li>the container may seem small at first but as soon as you realize you only need a dab it seems like a fantastic size.</li>
            <li>The tin is sturdy and fits well into your hand for those early morning \\&quot;dips\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Your hair and face should look matte instead of shiny if you&#x27;ve applied the balm modestly.</li>
            <li>It seems to make your beard considerably softer &amp; easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>This balm will leave your beard feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>His beard is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>and makes his beard soft.</li>
            <li>So far the bf loves this product smells like men product should like nothing</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking to keep their facial hair healthy without any harsh smells.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product approximately for a month, and I can honestly say that throughout the day I can feel the difference of softness and thickness of my beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled some other ones and I really don&#x27;t like them too much.</li>
            <li>This concerns me for I have plans to continue the growth of my beard, and the current size of Naked will be ultimately depleted quickly with my application amounts.    </li>
            <li>It has very little smell, just a light wax scent.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much, or your beard will look like you have some soul glo in it!</li>
            <li>Although I prefer the original full-bodied scent of Beard Balm, because of how well it blends with my natural oils and overall manliness, Naked is a crowd-pleaser; namely, the wife digs it!  </li>
            <li>My beard is very soft and overall</li>
            <li>Major bonus points for me.</li>
            <li>- Each application use seems to have to use more than what other balms are requiring ( granted this is my first product so only going by other reviews of other products.)  </li>
            <li>The product itself is easy to apply, and only needs a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking to tame my beard ever since a hair fell out and a co-worker threw a fit that someone left a pube on the break-room table.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of trying this product, my beard was approximately 1\\&quot; in length, with good depth all the way down to natural neck beard growth.</li>
            <li>the original Beard Balm might not sound like your cup of tea, or if you tried it and didn&#x27;t like it, give Naked a shot.</li>
            <li>After applying, I generally use any remaining</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s on my fingers to spread across the bare skin on my chins/</li>
            <li>Naked felt like mostly a harder beeswax, while amish was more heavily a silky coconut oil</li>
            <li>This balm has taken my beard to the next level, so soft.</li>
            <li>As I fully expected, Beard Balm&#x27;s newest addition, Naked, is exactly what my beard thirsts for.</li>
            <li>- Slick and cool container.  </li>
            <li>These folks in Detroit have it down; made by fellow Americans with pride, this product is exactly what beadsman and beyond need.  </li>
            <li>Recently I received some of the new Naked balm to try out and it did not disappoint!  </li>
            <li>I fall into the stereotypical way of \\&quot;hipster\\&quot; social definitions and the front image kind of suited my taste in graphical design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve skipped a couple days but didn&#x27;t have the immediate dry skin I normally do when I skip using lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Naked as a supplement for that extra soft, yet Kodiak Bear effect.</li>
            <li>Though for those with less large beards, I&#x27;d recommend just spreading it across a two or three fingers on each hand to work it in that way instead.</li>
            <li>I imagine that comes down to pure personal preferences however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first tried to pull some of the material out with my forefinger, to only seem to come out with a glob of wax that just seemed to be messy.</li>
            <li>I have big meat-hooks and no long fingernails to speak of.  </li>
            <li>It seemed I was initially having to go for another application of a half of a thumb nail to really feel as if I was getting enough product throughout my beard.</li>

            <li> This was a gift for a friend who is happy with it</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> And without a doubt amazing people making the product!</li>
            <li> It works great, smells good, and lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great feel.</li>
            <li> It also gives it a good shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good balm, but doesn&#x27;t have the hold/stiffness of others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> yeah, it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
            <li> I apply once a day, sometimes mornings and sometimes evenings, and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> The results have been really good, as my skin absorbs it well</li>
            <li> I was directed to get a good comb, start using argan oil shampoos and make use of beard oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, in good condition.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it also darkened his beard a bit as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Amish Beard balm and it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Within 4 days i could notice a softer feel to the beard and it smells homely, very pleasant but not overly strong.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the ordering and shipping process.</li>
            <li> There is no added scent but you will notice a mild coconut oil scent which I think smells very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Absorbs right into the beard and leaves it feeling and looking awesome!</li>
            <li> and I love the product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My beard has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> This product is awesomely awesome first and foremost.</li>
            <li> Conditions the skin and helps keep my beard healthy!</li>
            <li> So glad we got this!</li>
            <li> Amazing balm-</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing company.</li>
            <li> (there is a stubborn sticker over the ingredients list) but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it could bring about some kind of lady attracting odor of some sort</li>
            <li> To me it almost smells like fresh baked cookies and I have gotten many compliments on smelling so delicious.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and gives your beard a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> The company needs to add some kind of release latch or something to the can.  </li>
            <li> This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> Great product, cool looking can</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work Beard Balm, you have a fine product.</li>
            <li> By far the best way to use the product itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect blend of hold, moisture, and natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is slightly more oily than the Honest Amish, but it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Great natural ingredients and amazing smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using Beard Balm for a while now and love it.</li>
            <li> I love beard balm.</li>
            <li> my beard to make sure</li>
            <li> &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> Granted I am trying to modify my application techniques to see if I can go to just a thumbnail of product, but at this moment I&#x27;m having to use more than that.    </li>
            <li> Either way you wont find a better product containing better ingredients and your beard will love you for it.</li>
            <li> And the price can&#x27;t be beat :)</li>
            <li> This stuff really works great at keeping my beard (goatee, now that winter is over) in place, so</li>
            <li> But I imagine being mostly wax</li>
            <li> Top that off with my my wife&#x27;s reaction ---</li>
            <li> but I can safely say that I can already see a difference and have already had people compliment me on the softness and look.</li>
            <li> He loves it, I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating shaving, so glad I found Naked/Beard Balm and saved my beard.</li>
            <li> Just ordered 6 more cans.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s not for me....</li>
            <li> , this really helps to keep moisturized and works great on my beard too</li>
            <li> The most you&#x27;ll ever get out of it is a whiff of the coconut oil used as one of its bases.</li>
            <li> He has some curl in it and so many of the hairs stick out, poking my face when I get close.</li>
            <li> I am exceptionally pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> He is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> it is nice and soft and not annoying lol.</li>
            <li> I also notice it is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Totally love this product, keeps my beard in place and feeling soft, and the lack of scent makes my wife happy as well.  </li>
            <li> I love the original Beard Balm, so I decided to give this a shot, and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I may use the remainder of this product as a lip balm, however in that utility I would just buy cheaper available everywhere (including most of my couch cushions) burts bees.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the option of having fragrance free when I want!</li>
            <li> Not only is it perfect for those of you that couldn&#x27;t give the original Beard Balm 5 stars due to variable fragrance preferences, it&#x27;s perfect for all of us that simply love the original.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear, I think the original stuff smells great, but I also understand that it may not be appealing to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> My beard has that silky, shinny coat of a true champion, when I take it on walks to the park all the ladies rush over to bet it!  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell, it&#x27;s a unique scent that I just can&#x27;t place, but I get compliments on it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you follow them on instagram and Facebook for up to date info and some fun contests once and a while!</li>
            <li> I love the original too</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and maintain.</li>
            <li> Received beard balm very quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong and linger around all day.</li>
            <li> and he reports it&#x27;s holding strong and the beard is mighty fine</li>
            <li> Take it easy and rub it in lightly, and try to get to your &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great scent and conditions my beard like no other product (except for the original Beard Balm).</li>
            <li> anyone that found the smell of the original Beard Balm not so appealing, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that Naked&#x27;s scent is extremely mild.</li>
            <li> Naked is a great addition to the regiment.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm Naked is a great product.</li>
            <li> Firmness is precisely the way to describe the &#x27;virgin&#x27; state of the product.    </li>
            <li> As soon as he applied this balm the hairs laid smooth and his beard was softer.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t fragrance free</li>
            <li> so it is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Already used it and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Great Product, better than all other balms and oils I have tried</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this great product as it is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> No smell and very easy to use - beard looks much neater already.</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant with a mix of coconut and beeswax, and fades after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> First impressions: When I first received the package of Naked by Beard Balm, I was immediately impressed with the design.</li>
            <li> The material comes about presenting itself as more of a wax with first appearance.</li>
            <li> The product itself doesn&#x27;t bring about a unique smell to it, for it smells just like bee&#x27;z wax and seems to bring about a neutral waxy smell.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a significant difference in the way my face feels.  </li>
            <li> as the original recipe and is almost odorless.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, many different uses.</li>
            <li> Great for cracked dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> jaw, where I shave the rest of the beard clean.</li>
            <li> when I refer to the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Beard Balm, just do a search for \\&quot;beard balm,\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find the original king of beard products, Beard Balm, made by the same good folks in Michigan.</li>
            <li> They stand true to the name, the balm has no smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t rock a full beard, I do have a Van Dyke.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much hold but your beard will look well groomed and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;Alpha tested&amp;#34; this product  (Naked) for a couple of months now and can say that it is as good as Beard Balm...</li>
            <li> Just enough to smell good but in no way overpowering.  </li>
            <li> A couple days ago, I got my tin of Naked, the newest product from the good Beard Balm folks.</li>
            <li> love the stuff, it works just as well for my beard (and really anything else including my hands, nails, and elbows)</li>
            <li> The no fragrance is 100% true.</li>
            <li> This is hands down absolutely the best product I have ever used for lip balm, and I have tried them ALL.</li>
            <li> This is good but there is better for less.</li>
            <li> For something that&#x27;s going to be right under your nose all day, scent is important.</li>
            <li> Best of using coconut oil directly than using this, I have seen better results with raw coconut oil.</li>
            <li> And, as the product description says, it also works great in other areas.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> made my beard feel soft and smooth, but I am most looking for flyaway control/</li>
            <li> a local, I&#x27;m going to get my next order in person and see where they make this great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Unlike most post-shave balms that are alcohol-based or highly perfumed, this product does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I would go as far to say that I like it better than the original.  </li>
            <li> I love a Detroit product, since I live just a couple miles north of there.</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly support this product!!  </li>
            <li> &quot; for just about 1 week and was blown away with my first application!</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my beard!</li>
            <li> I feel that Amish has better control, likely due to being able to easily apply it more evenly.</li>
            <li> So buy a can of each, and everybody wins.</li>
            <li> One use I found not mentioned is this has the perfect blend needed to condition leather, I recently used the Naked balm to condition/break-in a new pair of leather-lined boots and belt, softened the leather just right!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it, and I&#x27;m happy that his beard is less prickly!</li>
            <li> Amish beard balm melts into a silky smooth easily applied oil quickly, the Naked remains a waxy burts-bees carmex style viscous goop that has clumped visibly around my mustache and does not spread evenly or go as far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I ordered two tins that got out to Kalamazoo right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember though less is more :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amish has a definite menthol smell, which I find pleasant, but appreciate the value of a no fragrance item you will be putting directly beneath your nostrils.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is considerably softer and more supple, and just looks HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> Now, my beard is healthy, controlled, and smells phenomenal(Yes, it has a slight smell but it smells great and mixes very well with all the different scented beard oils I have).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps Naked just isn&#x27;t trying to be the best beard balm as it does heavily mention skin/lips/etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this, the only thing I have to say is that its flicking amazing!</li>
            <li> but I am satisfied with the way it is starting to look.</li>
            <li> First, it must be stated that I have just started to grow out my beard and never have allowed it grow fully in all my post puberty stage.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard balm I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> If you have, I still recommend it, despite it being the first one I&#x27;ve tried so far.f</li>
            <li> I get better results just using regular hair conditioner when I am in the shower.</li>
            <li> Beard balm seems fantastic so far, it&#x27;s the first ever time</li>
            <li> Definitely going to order more when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Just as the original Beard Balm can be used atop your head, in the grizzle and beyond; Naked boasts unique versatility.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than many of it&#x27;s alternatives, which I am assuming is because they don&#x27;t use any essential oils.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve applied a little more, your beard will appear a bit more shiny; particularly in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is made of such pure ingredients instead of petrolatum.</li>
            <li> It melts down just at smooth and applies easily.</li>
            <li> I was trying to avoid products that have distinct smells to them, as I prefer not to mix so many different fragrances on my body (natural soaps, hair conditioner, shampoos, cologne, deodorant, and the bits of pizza that hide in your beard from time to time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve found a long term beard care product.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with this as it seemed to be the best one for my preferences: it has only a natural scent of coconut and, very slightly, a hint of honey.</li>
            <li> After about a month of using Naked, I am very pleased with the overall softness and fullness my beard has presented itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and will certainly purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Going forward I will definitely be rebuying Amish and not Naked for my beard, but it does serve the purpose and is not a bad product there are just better options on amazon</li>
            <li> Love the new Naked Beard Balm!</li>
            <li> After finally using up my first tin of beard balm (the original stuff),  I found this stuff while looking to restock.</li>
            <li> For me, personally, I typically apply Beard Balm&#x27;s original product at night and then a light oil in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the fact that it is made in Michigan, my home state, and the fact that it was fragrance free (Naked version).</li>
            <li> The amount of material that you need depends really on your thickness of beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but my wife doesn&#x27;t care for the scent as much as I do.</li>
            <li> There are no artificial fragrances added and the natural smell is almost non existent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take too much and it feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally like the more natural look.</li>
            <li> I received both this Naked conditioner and Honest Amish Beard Balm as gifts and have compared each for a week, these are the only two beard balms I have experience with, but the difference in texture and application is night and</li>
            <li> but it literally smelt like my beard was becoming dry sticks rubbing against themselves creating mini fires on my face...</li>
            <li> Next time I will try the original scent and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Makes it much more sharp and kept looking.  </li>
            <li> I put it in and asked my wife to check out the scent of my beard; she said \\&quot;I like that one better,\\&quot; referring to Naked versus the original Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> After some mixed reviews of the original stuff&#x27;s scent, I decided I&#x27;d try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> In the future I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this stuff as my &amp;#34;daily driver&amp;#34; and toss in the original mix when I miss the manly smell of it.</li>
            <li> Like many other beard balm and oil techniques, Naked product did best after you \\&quot;melted\\&quot; the material by rubbing your hands together to get the wax into more a oil liquid base.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed to make my beard look professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else ever gets this kind of \\&quot;burning hair\\</li>
            <li> If you have, I still recommend it, despite it being the first one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Beard is pretty soft and you don&#x27;t get a greasy feeling on your fingers if you stroke it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, and I hope Beard Balm makes this product a regular product, and not just a special edition.</li>
            <li> Possibly supernatural.</li>
            <li> It keeps my beard soft, and from becoming dry.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t used a beard balm or oil before, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t used a beard balm or oil before, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended- have been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li> The other one had to strong of a scent</li>
            <li> , One of the secondary benefits is that its not exclusive to just his amazing beard</li>
            <li> It is definitely just a natural waxy smell... but would love to have the cookie version in the future.   </li>
            <li> I believe they make a heavy duty version which provides more hold.</li>
            <li> Ya&#x27;ll must be eating some crappy cookies, because this smells more like dried jizz than cookies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for something to keep my beard presentable at work, and this is the first balm that has actually kept the stray hairs down, and gave me a more groomed appearance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more manageable with this balm as well, helping to tame those stray hairs that try to run away from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this new product \\&quot;Naked\\</li>
            <li> And I could not be happier with the new scent of this &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; balm.</li>
            <li> This was my first can of beard balm, so my knowledge on the matter is not vast.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased my second can of Beard Balm - Naked and let me tell you, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> plus its all natural!</li>
            <li> Naked beard balm does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for dry lips, and it just made my lips more dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend after having enough of seeing his facial hair look super unruly.</li>
            <li> I fear that the current amount that is given will ultimately go quickly for the daily user.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a price difference but in a week I easily used twice as much naked as Amish due to the texture differences.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have any real smell to it.</li>
            <li> the container may seem small at first but as soon as you realize you only need a dab it seems like a fantastic size.</li>
            <li> The tin is sturdy and fits well into your hand for those early morning \\&quot;dips\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Your hair and face should look matte instead of shiny if you&#x27;ve applied the balm modestly.</li>
            <li> It seems to make your beard considerably softer &amp; easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> This balm will leave your beard feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> His beard is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> and makes his beard soft.</li>
            <li> So far the bf loves this product smells like men product should like nothing</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking to keep their facial hair healthy without any harsh smells.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product approximately for a month, and I can honestly say that throughout the day I can feel the difference of softness and thickness of my beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled some other ones and I really don&#x27;t like them too much.</li>
            <li> This concerns me for I have plans to continue the growth of my beard, and the current size of Naked will be ultimately depleted quickly with my application amounts.    </li>
            <li> It has very little smell, just a light wax scent.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much, or your beard will look like you have some soul glo in it!</li>
            <li> Although I prefer the original full-bodied scent of Beard Balm, because of how well it blends with my natural oils and overall manliness, Naked is a crowd-pleaser; namely, the wife digs it!  </li>
            <li> My beard is very soft and overall</li>
            <li> Major bonus points for me.</li>
            <li> - Each application use seems to have to use more than what other balms are requiring ( granted this is my first product so only going by other reviews of other products.)  </li>
            <li> The product itself is easy to apply, and only needs a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to tame my beard ever since a hair fell out and a co-worker threw a fit that someone left a pube on the break-room table.</li>
            <li> At the beginning of trying this product, my beard was approximately 1\\&quot; in length, with good depth all the way down to natural neck beard growth.</li>
            <li> the original Beard Balm might not sound like your cup of tea, or if you tried it and didn&#x27;t like it, give Naked a shot.</li>
            <li> After applying, I generally use any remaining</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s on my fingers to spread across the bare skin on my chins/</li>
            <li> Naked felt like mostly a harder beeswax, while amish was more heavily a silky coconut oil</li>
            <li> This balm has taken my beard to the next level, so soft.</li>
            <li> As I fully expected, Beard Balm&#x27;s newest addition, Naked, is exactly what my beard thirsts for.</li>
            <li> - Slick and cool container.  </li>
            <li> These folks in Detroit have it down; made by fellow Americans with pride, this product is exactly what beadsman and beyond need.  </li>
            <li> Recently I received some of the new Naked balm to try out and it did not disappoint!  </li>
            <li> I fall into the stereotypical way of \\&quot;hipster\\&quot; social definitions and the front image kind of suited my taste in graphical design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve skipped a couple days but didn&#x27;t have the immediate dry skin I normally do when I skip using lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Naked as a supplement for that extra soft, yet Kodiak Bear effect.</li>
            <li> Though for those with less large beards, I&#x27;d recommend just spreading it across a two or three fingers on each hand to work it in that way instead.</li>
            <li> I imagine that comes down to pure personal preferences however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first tried to pull some of the material out with my forefinger, to only seem to come out with a glob of wax that just seemed to be messy.</li>
            <li> I have big meat-hooks and no long fingernails to speak of.  </li>
            <li> It seemed I was initially having to go for another application of a half of a thumb nail to really feel as if I was getting enough product throughout my beard.</li>
            <li> Not horribly bad, but not good and the odor lasts a lot longer than I wish I did.</li>
            <li> I brush a small amount of this product into my hair after washing and it works really well</li>
            <li> and I already know that I will continue to use a beard balm for as long as I have facial hair.</li>
            <li> and just understand thatI had a really dry beard before using Naked.    </li>
            <li> I quickly found out that a thumbnail size of product was not good enough for my thickness of beard, so I would start out with a thumbnail and then go to half of a size for a second run through.    </li>
            <li> Those ones you find at your local big box stores in a value pack are not going to cut it for long, for you&#x27;ll ultimately end up seeing your beard deplete itself to nothing ( these bad quality combs do more damage to your beard</li>
            <li> The only drawback I&#x27;ve found is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but none of the other beard balms or oils did either.</li>
            <li> Before using Naked I had a very dry and \\&quot;hair burning\\&quot; smell to my beard.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be surprised how little you need.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that has highlights and am allergic to hair conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say, it&#x27;s a basic beard balm, and it does</li>
            <li> As expected, it works just as well as the regular kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also found that there is little to no left over residue left over on my clothes, pillows, etc.</li>
            <li> I am coming from the perspective of not ever using any other type of beard oil, balm, or product to increase softness, shine, or overall quality of beard.</li>
            <li> I read plenty of reviews on this Naked scent from Beard Balm, as well as several other beard balms made by other companies.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint coco-nutty smell - its very light so no worries there.  </li>
            <li> On a side not, I also use this stuff on my face to help with my dry skin during the winter months.</li>
            <li> but it can be used for dry or windburn skin.</li>
            <li> and they get dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin under my beard for years.</li>
            <li> Major waste of money.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so this will last him for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I did notice some previous reviewers saying it left them smelling like cookies.</li>
            <li> Just a little layer -- not enough to make your face look like you&#x27;re trying to produce grease to put into your hair.</li>
            <li> and I only have to use a little bit to get the job done.</li>
            <li> There is a faint scent with the Naked version, it&#x27;s not unpleasant &amp; after using the product a few times, you won&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product to any real man who has a beard and wishes to stay professional in the work place during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li> which cause rough pokey hair when reappearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on trying the heavy duty version to see if it is longer lasting for me.</li>
            <li> I find myself wrestling with the can each time and a few times now, I just gave up because I can&#x27;t get it open.  </li>
            <li> Almost three days sooner than I expected it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the way my husband looks with a beard, but hated the way it felt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bargain too as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I feel my review is critical for those just getting into the world of promoting your beard to the fullest of its capacity, and wanting to move to the next level of up keep for your luxurious facial hair.    </li>
            <li> After having some knowledge of other types of beard balm by watching Youtube reviews, I decided to instead try the thumb fingernail scrap method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing a beard on and off for about 11 years, but only within this past year did I begin using any type of balm or oil.</li>
            <li> Like any other balm, you need to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products from other companies and always come back to Beard Balm (a lot of those other products ended up in the trash, hardly used).  </li>
            <li> Especially us who have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> Then I would start to evenly \\&quot;down comb\\&quot; my beard to start shaping it the way I needed it to be.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m down to prying a screwdriver under the lid to get it opened.</li>
            <li> Not super clumpy / gloopy, but keeps my beard manageable.</li>
            <li> with beard balm a little bit</li>
            <li> Beard stays a little straighter each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I am plagued with dry skin in the cooler months and have a terrible time making sure I have lotion with me or some sort of moisturizer to apply through out the day.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s lagging and not using it everyday</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some on a few of the dryer areas of my face, as well as on my hands.</li>
            <li> it doesnt have a harsh smell or oily residue.</li>
            <li> When applying this balm, take just a little bit (and by little, I really mean LITTLE) with the tip of your finger, then spread it across your palm (it&#x27;ll turn a bit into an oil when it&#x27;s heated/pressed with your hands).</li>
            <li> It kept my beard in check during the cold winter months and helped keep my skin underneath soft as well.</li>
            <li> Start off using a small amount</li>
            <li> Organic, not too heavy, husband loves this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it</li>
            <li> and I have seen no outstanding results with my beard, lips or skin.</li>
            <li> Small amounts spread out, just like palmaide in your hair.</li>
            <li> Rocks so hard.</li>
            <li> : This balm has proved to be a skin saver during a cold, long Northeast winter.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds ridiculous, so ignore that</li>
            <li> I use this to style my hair daily, worked to moisturize my dry cracking hands and lips from this horrible Michigan weather as well.  </li>
            <li> It makes me think of a mustache wax, which I never liked!</li>
            <li> I ordered this Beard Balm to help maintain my beard from crazy curling up and it did just that.</li>
            <li> ; but you will notice a smell of oil that isn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I was worried about getting something that was waxy and would smell terrible...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It is exactly what I needed to make my beard look professional. I had a medium length beard, and I could never let it grow longer because I would look like a homeless person. Now, my beard is healthy, controlled, and smells phenomenal(Yes, it has a slight smell but it smells great and mixes very well with all the different scented beard oils I have).</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, many different uses.</li>
            <li> Odiferous and medicinal. Use vitamin e lotion for the body instead. Much less expensive. This is good but there is better for less.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend after having enough of seeing his facial hair look super unruly. Immediately noticed it looked shinier. He&#x27;s lagging and not using it everyday but I am satisfied with the way it is starting to look. I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have any real smell to it. I&#x27;ve smelled some other ones and I really don&#x27;t like them too much.</li>
            <li> I love the original Beard Balm, so I decided to give this a shot, and I am so glad I did.  I would go as far to say that I like it better than the original.  It has a scent of honey and milk when you apply it.  Highly recommend it, and I hope Beard Balm makes this product a regular product, and not just a special edition.</li>
            <li> Great natural ingredients and amazing smell.</li>
            <li> Rocks so hard. I use their regular Bread Balm as well. I use Naked as a supplement for that extra soft, yet Kodiak Bear effect. Excellent for taming, softening and keeping skin hydrated. Beard Balm does it again! Insert microphone drop here.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I use this to style my hair daily, worked to moisturize my dry cracking hands and lips from this horrible Michigan weather as well.  One use I found not mentioned is this has the perfect blend needed to condition leather, I recently used the Naked balm to condition/break-in a new pair of leather-lined boots and belt, softened the leather just right!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend who is happy with it</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd product ordered from Beard Balm.  Giving the unscented one a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using Beard Balm for a while now and love it. Naked is a great addition to the regiment. Great for cracked dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Works well.</li>
            <li> Beard Balm Naked is a great product. This was my first can of beard balm, so my knowledge on the matter is not vast. However I can tell you why I picked this product and what I thought about it. I bought this product based on the fact that it is made in Michigan, my home state, and the fact that it was fragrance free (Naked version). They stand true to the name, the balm has no smell. Major bonus points for me. I also found that there is little to no left over residue left over on my clothes, pillows, etc. when using this product. That also made bonus points for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product to any real man who has a beard and wishes to stay professional in the work place during these cold winter months. Keep up the good work Beard Balm, you have a fine product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Beard Balm to help maintain my beard from crazy curling up and it did just that. I wanted something that was odorless which is why I decided to give this can of naked a try. I was extremely happy and will definately order again.</li>
            <li> everyone should try this. It is not just for beards. I shave in places I will not mention. which cause rough pokey hair when reappearing. with beard balm a little bit and it is no longer pokey. it is nice and soft and not annoying lol. I also notice it is wonderful for dry skin. the container may seem small at first but as soon as you realize you only need a dab it seems like a fantastic size. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this, the only thing I have to say is that its flicking amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It kept my beard in check during the cold winter months and helped keep my skin underneath soft as well. It&#x27;s a bargain too as a little goes a long way. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love beard balm. It works great</li>
            <li> First, it must be stated that I have just started to grow out my beard and never have allowed it grow fully in all my post puberty stage. I am coming from the perspective of not ever using any other type of beard oil, balm, or product to increase softness, shine, or overall quality of beard. Needless to say, I feel my review is critical for those just getting into the world of promoting your beard to the fullest of its capacity, and wanting to move to the next level of up keep for your luxurious facial hair.    First impressions: When I first received the package of Naked by Beard Balm, I was immediately impressed with the design. I fall into the stereotypical way of \\&quot;hipster\\&quot; social definitions and the front image kind of suited my taste in graphical design. The tin is sturdy and fits well into your hand for those early morning \\&quot;dips\\&quot;. The material comes about presenting itself as more of a wax with first appearance. Firmness is precisely the way to describe the &#x27;virgin&#x27; state of the product.    Application:  The following technique is just what worked for me. I do not claim to be a beard enthusiast or master in the ways, but just seems to work best for me. It is key for any beard grower to invest in some sort of beard comb. Those ones you find at your local big box stores in a value pack are not going to cut it for long, for you&#x27;ll ultimately end up seeing your beard deplete itself to nothing ( these bad quality combs do more damage to your beard then you realize! )    I first tried to pull some of the material out with my forefinger, to only seem to come out with a glob of wax that just seemed to be messy. After having some knowledge of other types of beard balm by watching Youtube reviews, I decided to instead try the thumb fingernail scrap method. By far the best way to use the product itself. The amount of material that you need depends really on your thickness of beard. At the beginning of trying this product, my beard was approximately 1\\&quot; in length, with good depth all the way down to natural neck beard growth. I quickly found out that a thumbnail size of product was not good enough for my thickness of beard, so I would start out with a thumbnail and then go to half of a size for a second run through.    Like many other beard balm and oil techniques, Naked product did best after you \\&quot;melted\\&quot; the material by rubbing your hands together to get the wax into more a oil liquid base. From there applying the material throughout the beard evenly seemed to work best for me. It must be mentioned here for my only gripe with the product; the material seemed to not go to the fullest of just having a 1\\&quot; beard length. It seemed I was initially having to go for another application of a half of a thumb nail to really feel as if I was getting enough product throughout my beard. This concerns me for I have plans to continue the growth of my beard, and the current size of Naked will be ultimately depleted quickly with my application amounts.    Once applying the product evening throughout the beard, I \\&quot;up comb\\&quot; my beard to make sure all the under hairs get the material treatment as well. Then I would start to evenly \\&quot;down comb\\&quot; my beard to start shaping it the way I needed it to be. This process seems to work best for me at this moment.    Duration:    I call this part of the review &#x27;duration&#x27; for I feel it is critical of how the product holds up throughout the day of use. I have been using the product approximately for a month, and I can honestly say that throughout the day I can feel the difference of softness and thickness of my beard. Before using Naked I had a very dry and \\&quot;hair burning\\&quot; smell to my beard. This came about for I always would touch my beard. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else ever gets this kind of \\&quot;burning hair\\&quot; smell from their beards but it literally smelt like my beard was becoming dry sticks rubbing against themselves creating mini fires on my face... I know that sounds ridiculous, so ignore that and just understand thatI had a really dry beard before using Naked.    1 Month Trial:    After about a month of using Naked, I am very pleased with the overall softness and fullness my beard has presented itself. I am in the 2\\&quot; range now, with starting Naked in the 1\\&quot; length. My beard is very soft and overall the shine is pleasing. It does not over shine, so don&#x27;t expect to have to wear sunglasses when you look at yourself in the mirror.    ____________    Pros of Naked:    - Design of logo.  - Slick and cool container.  - Quality of product for daily use.  - Does what it advertises.    Cons of Naked:    - Each application use seems to have to use more than what other balms are requiring ( granted this is my first product so only going by other reviews of other products.)  - Smell. The product itself doesn&#x27;t bring about a unique smell to it, for it smells just like bee&#x27;z wax and seems to bring about a neutral waxy smell. Would be nice if it could bring about some kind of lady attracting odor of some sort &#x3D;). * I don&#x27;t find the smell to be \\&quot;delicious\\&quot; smelling or like \\&quot;baked cookies\\&quot; by any means. I try to go that route with telling my wife that it smells like baked cookies... and ultimately we both agreed it did not. It is definitely just a natural waxy smell... but would love to have the cookie version in the future.   - Amount. This goes back to the application con. I fear that the current amount that is given will ultimately go quickly for the daily user. Especially us who have a thick beard. Granted I am trying to modify my application techniques to see if I can go to just a thumbnail of product, but at this moment I&#x27;m having to use more than that.    Would I recommend this to another beard grower?    Yes. Get your Naked on.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. Remember though less is more :-)</li>
            <li> I have been a Beard Balm user for about a year and some change and I love the product!  Recently I received some of the new Naked balm to try out and it did not disappoint!  To me it almost smells like fresh baked cookies and I have gotten many compliments on smelling so delicious.  Either way you wont find a better product containing better ingredients and your beard will love you for it.</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly support this product!!  I have been using Beard Balm for a while now and buy extra tins to give to friends of mine so they will know the awesomeness of this stuff.  My beard has that silky, shinny coat of a true champion, when I take it on walks to the park all the ladies rush over to bet it!  Naked works just as well, except for my skin!  Keep up the good work guys!</li>
            <li> Seems to work as described. There truly is no scent and my unruly beard isn&#x27;t as unruly anymore. I also use the Beard Comb, Huntsmanâ„¢ Handmade Sandalwood Beard and Mustache Comb and that works great too. Next time I will try the original scent and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Love it! This is the first beard balm I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I read plenty of reviews on this Naked scent from Beard Balm, as well as several other beard balms made by other companies. I decided to go with this as it seemed to be the best one for my preferences: it has only a natural scent of coconut and, very slightly, a hint of honey. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong and linger around all day. I was trying to avoid products that have distinct smells to them, as I prefer not to mix so many different fragrances on my body (natural soaps, hair conditioner, shampoos, cologne, deodorant, and the bits of pizza that hide in your beard from time to time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days into using this stuff and I already know that I will continue to use a beard balm for as long as I have facial hair. My facial hair is considerably softer and more supple, and just looks HEALTHY. It&#x27;s a lot more manageable with this balm as well, helping to tame those stray hairs that try to run away from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t rock a full beard, I do have a Van Dyke. When applying this balm, take just a little bit (and by little, I really mean LITTLE) with the tip of your finger, then spread it across your palm (it&#x27;ll turn a bit into an oil when it&#x27;s heated/pressed with your hands). Though for those with less large beards, I&#x27;d recommend just spreading it across a two or three fingers on each hand to work it in that way instead. Work from the bottom of your beard and then up to your face, attempting to get the oil to the roots. Don&#x27;t forget the &#x27;stache. After applying, I generally use any remaining that&#x27;s on my fingers to spread across the bare skin on my chins/jaw, where I shave the rest of the beard clean. Just a little layer -- not enough to make your face look like you&#x27;re trying to produce grease to put into your hair. Your hair and face should look matte instead of shiny if you&#x27;ve applied the balm modestly. If you&#x27;ve applied a little more, your beard will appear a bit more shiny; particularly in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used a beard balm or oil before, I highly recommend this. If you have, I still recommend it, despite it being the first one I&#x27;ve tried so far.f you haven&#x27;t used a beard balm or oil before, I highly recommend this. If you have, I still recommend it, despite it being the first one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Not super clumpy / gloopy, but keeps my beard manageable. Makes it much more sharp and kept looking.  It also gives it a good shine.  I use it every day.  Be careful not to use too much, or your beard will look like you have some soul glo in it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good balm, but doesn&#x27;t have the hold/stiffness of others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! I use it everyday. Smells good and gives your beard a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase. And the price can&#x27;t be beat :)</li>
            <li> Major waste of money. This is basically just wax and instead of conditioning and softening your beard it just makes it waxy. I get better results just using regular hair conditioner when I am in the shower. Really wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted any money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. Not horribly bad, but not good and the odor lasts a lot longer than I wish I did.</li>
            <li> Totally love this product, keeps my beard in place and feeling soft, and the lack of scent makes my wife happy as well.  I would recommend this to anyone with a beard, who is thinking of growing a beard, or has a friend/family member with a beard.</li>
            <li> I am a female and I don&#x27;t have a beard. I was buying this as a hand salve for winter. I like the ingredients and hope it will be very good for my hands! Thank you! Prompt delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: This balm has proved to be a skin saver during a cold, long Northeast winter. I use it on my hands, lips, heels, elbows ... I love that it is made of such pure ingredients instead of petrolatum. Props to the manufacturer!</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased my second can of Beard Balm - Naked and let me tell you, I love this stuff.  This stuff really works great at keeping my beard (goatee, now that winter is over) in place, so it looks the same way at the end of the day as it did at the beginning.  I also love the smell, it&#x27;s a unique scent that I just can&#x27;t place, but I get compliments on it all the time.  On a side not, I also use this stuff on my face to help with my dry skin during the winter months. Great job Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff daily!  It seems to make your beard considerably softer &amp; easier to manage.  I&#x27;ve only used the Naked (unscented) one, so I cant speak to the scented version.  There is a faint scent with the Naked version, it&#x27;s not unpleasant &amp; after using the product a few times, you won&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> This balm will leave your beard feeling incredibly soft. It doesn&#x27;t have much hold but your beard will look well groomed and healthy. I believe they make a heavy duty version which provides more hold. I personally like the more natural look. There is no added scent but you will notice a mild coconut oil scent which I think smells very pleasant. Start off using a small amount you&#x27;ll be surprised how little you need.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for dry lips, and it just made my lips more dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Amazing balm- I get stopped on the streets for compliments about my beard on a daily basis! Highly recommended- have been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for something to keep my beard presentable at work, and this is the first balm that has actually kept the stray hairs down, and gave me a more groomed appearance. It has very little smell, just a light wax scent. The only drawback I&#x27;ve found is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but none of the other beard balms or oils did either. I&#x27;m planning on trying the heavy duty version to see if it is longer lasting for me.</li>
            <li> I received both this Naked conditioner and Honest Amish Beard Balm as gifts and have compared each for a week, these are the only two beard balms I have experience with, but the difference in texture and application is night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amish beard balm melts into a silky smooth easily applied oil quickly, the Naked remains a waxy burts-bees carmex style viscous goop that has clumped visibly around my mustache and does not spread evenly or go as far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the solidity of Naked I feel that Amish has better control, likely due to being able to easily apply it more evenly. Naked felt like mostly a harder beeswax, while amish was more heavily a silky coconut oil feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both made my beard feel soft and smooth, but I am most looking for flyaway control/grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a price difference but in a week I easily used twice as much naked as Amish due to the texture differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amish has a definite menthol smell, which I find pleasant, but appreciate the value of a no fragrance item you will be putting directly beneath your nostrils. I imagine that comes down to pure personal preferences however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going forward I will definitely be rebuying Amish and not Naked for my beard, but it does serve the purpose and is not a bad product there are just better options on amazon, I see why Amish is the number 1 at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps Naked just isn&#x27;t trying to be the best beard balm as it does heavily mention skin/lips/etc. I may use the remainder of this product as a lip balm, however in that utility I would just buy cheaper available everywhere (including most of my couch cushions) burts bees. But I imagine being mostly wax it will work well in that way.</li>
            <li> Been using these products for a year now. And. I. Could not be happier. My hair feels smoother and stays in place so I don&#x27;t look unruly. Also it seems my hair has started to grow out of control. I think this product has turned me into rapunzel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing a beard on and off for about 11 years, but only within this past year did I begin using any type of balm or oil. For me, personally, I typically apply Beard Balm&#x27;s original product at night and then a light oil in the morning. My beard has never looked or felt better! I&#x27;ve been using this new product \\&quot;Naked\\&quot; for just about 1 week and was blown away with my first application! It&#x27;s a perfect blend of hold, moisture, and natural fragrance. Top that off with my my wife&#x27;s reaction --- \\&quot;You smell delicious. Never shave again.\\&quot; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve found a long term beard care product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great consistency and moisture holding abilities.</li>
            <li> On time. Great price. Already used it and so far, so good. No smell and very easy to use - beard looks much neater already.</li>
            <li> Beard balm seems fantastic so far, it&#x27;s the first ever time I&#x27;ve purchased a beard balm but I can safely say that I can already see a difference and have already had people compliment me on the softness and look. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that has highlights and am allergic to hair conditioners.  I brush a small amount of this product into my hair after washing and it works really well and I have had no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This product is awesomely awesome first and foremost. Within 4 days i could notice a softer feel to the beard and it smells homely, very pleasant but not overly strong. Easy to apply and maintain. The Mister has been using it for over a month now and with him working offshore and he reports it&#x27;s holding strong and the beard is mighty fine, One of the secondary benefits is that its not exclusive to just his amazing beard but it can be used for dry or windburn skin. He loves it, I love it, it&#x27;s a win all the way around.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This balm has taken my beard to the next level, so soft. I was contemplating shaving, so glad I found Naked/Beard Balm and saved my beard. Just ordered 6 more cans.</li>
            <li> This should be considered a fundamental part of male skin care! For me, this product eliminated&lt;br /&gt;- Beard dandruff&lt;br /&gt;- Overall skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;- Unruly fly-aways&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I have successfully used the product on shaved skin; it provides an excellent post-shave balm. Unlike most post-shave balms that are alcohol-based or highly perfumed, this product does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been a Beard Balm customer for almost a year now.. I&#x27;ve tried other products from other companies and always come back to Beard Balm (a lot of those other products ended up in the trash, hardly used).  I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;Alpha tested&amp;#34; this product  (Naked) for a couple of months now and can say that it is as good as Beard Balm... it&#x27;s a great scent and conditions my beard like no other product (except for the original Beard Balm). Never thought of using it as a skin conditioner.. I shave my head bald so I may have to try it as an aftershave skin conditioner. Overall.... This is GREAT stuff!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s not for me....It makes me think of a mustache wax, which I never liked!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great feel. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on beards.  It has a very faint coco-nutty smell - its very light so no worries there.  Just enough to smell good but in no way overpowering.  The problem I do have is this darned can its in.  I can&#x27;t open the thing.  I have big meat-hooks and no long fingernails to speak of.  I find myself wrestling with the can each time and a few times now, I just gave up because I can&#x27;t get it open.  The company needs to add some kind of release latch or something to the can.  If you have arthritic hands, forget it - you&#x27;ll never get it open.  Great product, cool looking can but the can is a bear to get open.  Now I&#x27;m down to prying a screwdriver under the lid to get it opened.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;m on my second can. And I could not be happier with the new scent of this &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; balm. The other one had to strong of a scent so I am happy I tried this one. Definitely going to order more when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve only been using the balm for about a week but I have noticed a significant difference in the way my face feels.  I am plagued with dry skin in the cooler months and have a terrible time making sure I have lotion with me or some sort of moisturizer to apply through out the day.  Beard Balm has been a Godsend.  I apply once a day, sometimes mornings and sometimes evenings, and I&#x27;m good to go.  I&#x27;ve skipped a couple days but didn&#x27;t have the immediate dry skin I normally do when I skip using lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing Beard Balm again but I may try to scented one.  I enjoy the option of having fragrance free when I want!</li>
            <li> I have been a beard balm user for over a year now! Amazing product. Amazing company. And without a doubt amazing people making the product! I was given the chance to try NAKED out before others and I was blown away! I love how soft it makes my beard! Conditions the skin and helps keep my beard healthy! I&#x27;ll never go without this product!  Make sure you follow them on instagram and Facebook for up to date info and some fun contests once and a while! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  GET NAKED! ;)</li>
            <li> As I fully expected, Beard Balm&#x27;s newest addition, Naked, is exactly what my beard thirsts for. Not only is it perfect for those of you that couldn&#x27;t give the original Beard Balm 5 stars due to variable fragrance preferences, it&#x27;s perfect for all of us that simply love the original. These folks in Detroit have it down; made by fellow Americans with pride, this product is exactly what beadsman and beyond need.  This product is versatile. Just as the original Beard Balm can be used atop your head, in the grizzle and beyond; Naked boasts unique versatility. I put it in and asked my wife to check out the scent of my beard; she said \\&quot;I like that one better,\\&quot; referring to Naked versus the original Beard Balm. Although I prefer the original full-bodied scent of Beard Balm, because of how well it blends with my natural oils and overall manliness, Naked is a crowd-pleaser; namely, the wife digs it!  So buy a can of each, and everybody wins. Yes; it is that simple. If you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about when I refer to the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Beard Balm, just do a search for \\&quot;beard balm,\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find the original king of beard products, Beard Balm, made by the same good folks in Michigan.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it, and I&#x27;m happy that his beard is less prickly!</li>
            <li> I work with my hands a lot and they get dry, this really helps to keep moisturized and works great on my beard too</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say, it&#x27;s a basic beard balm, and it does it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s cheaper than many of it&#x27;s alternatives, which I am assuming is because they don&#x27;t use any essential oils. I did notice some previous reviewers saying it left them smelling like cookies. Ya&#x27;ll must be eating some crappy cookies, because this smells more like dried jizz than cookies.</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting something that was waxy and would smell terrible... this product is neither of those.  The smell is very pleasant with a mix of coconut and beeswax, and fades after a few minutes.  The product itself is easy to apply, and only needs a small amount.  My beard definitely feels softer to the touch.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and will certainly purchase it again.  Would recommend to anyone looking to keep their facial hair healthy without any harsh smells.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my man could be any sexier until he started using Beard Balm. His beard is so soft and shiny I can&#x27;t keep my hands off him. Plus I have been known to steal a lil bit of his BB for my hands and nails. I love a Detroit product, since I live just a couple miles north of there. If I could have a beard-related wish, it would be for a retail location for this product.</li>
            <li> Back in December, I wrote a review for the regular Beard Balm. Needless to say, I love the stuff. It works great, smells good, and lasts a while. A couple days ago, I got my tin of Naked, the newest product from the good Beard Balm folks. As expected, it works just as well as the regular kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that found the smell of the original Beard Balm not so appealing, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that Naked&#x27;s scent is extremely mild. The most you&#x27;ll ever get out of it is a whiff of the coconut oil used as one of its bases. It melts down just at smooth and applies easily. And, as the product description says, it also works great in other areas. I&#x27;ve used some on a few of the dryer areas of my face, as well as on my hands. The results have been really good, as my skin absorbs it well and I only have to use a little bit to get the job done. It worked well on my lips, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the original Beard Balm might not sound like your cup of tea, or if you tried it and didn&#x27;t like it, give Naked a shot.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. it doesnt have a harsh smell or oily residue. and makes his beard soft. plus its all natural! great would buy again 1000% times.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve had dry skin under my beard for years. This stuff is a bit messy to work with, but really does the trick. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> After finally using up my first tin of beard balm (the original stuff),  I found this stuff while looking to restock. After some mixed reviews of the original stuff&#x27;s scent, I decided I&#x27;d try this stuff out. Just to be clear, I think the original stuff smells great, but I also understand that it may not be appealing to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ordered two tins that got out to Kalamazoo right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the stuff, it works just as well for my beard (and really anything else including my hands, nails, and elbows) as the original recipe and is almost odorless. In the future I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this stuff as my &amp;#34;daily driver&amp;#34; and toss in the original mix when I miss the manly smell of it.</li>
            <li> Received beard balm very quickly. Almost three days sooner than I expected it. Smells great and my boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li> So far so good. Just received it.</li>
            <li> Organic, not too heavy, husband loves this!</li>
            <li> Love the new Naked Beard Balm! I love the original too but my wife doesn&#x27;t care for the scent as much as I do. Absorbs right into the beard and leaves it feeling and looking awesome!</li>
            <li> This is hands down absolutely the best product I have ever used for lip balm, and I have tried them ALL. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it (there is a stubborn sticker over the ingredients list) but it is amazing. Possibly supernatural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to tame my beard ever since a hair fell out and a co-worker threw a fit that someone left a pube on the break-room table. For obvious reasons of association, I decided not to correct her, since she&#x27;d already thrown away her lunch. I was directed to get a good comb, start using argan oil shampoos and make use of beard oil. For something that&#x27;s going to be right under your nose all day, scent is important. Its &amp;#34;scentless&amp;#34; but you will notice a smell of oil that isn&#x27;t unpleasant. My fiancÃ©e likes it. Beard is pretty soft and you don&#x27;t get a greasy feeling on your fingers if you stroke it. Beard stays a little straighter each time I use it. Take it easy and rub it in lightly, and try to get to your &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; with it. My beard itch has disappeared despite the winter time making the rest of my skin itch.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, in good condition. As promised. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have always loved the way my husband looks with a beard, but hated the way it felt. He has some curl in it and so many of the hairs stick out, poking my face when I get close. As soon as he applied this balm the hairs laid smooth and his beard was softer. Surprisingly it also darkened his beard a bit as well. A little bit goes a long way, so this will last him for quite awhile. So glad we got this! This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> Great Product, better than all other balms and oils I have tried</li>
            <li> While in my search for a beard balm that would help condition my beard but not carry an overpowering odor, I found this beard balm. I am exceptionally pleased with this product. The balm helps shape my beard and my beard(along with also applying beard oil) has softened my beard. The no fragrance is 100% true. There are no artificial fragrances added and the natural smell is almost non existent. I highly recommend this great product as it is of very high quality. I was very pleased with the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The tin of Naked was a gift for my brother-in-law for Christmas. He is pleased with it. I was very pleased with the ordering and shipping process. I would definitely recommend ordering from Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> A pleasant vanilla / coconut smell and a wonderful conditioner for my beard. I&#x27;ve also used Amish Beard balm and it&#x27;s really good. This is slightly more oily than the Honest Amish, but it absorbs well. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep my review very simple.  This balm is really terrific!  Doesn&#x27;t take too much and it feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard has never looked or felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a local, I&#x27;m going to get my next order in person and see where they make this great stuff!!</li>
            <li> So far the bf loves this product smells like men product should like nothing lol has a great texture and moisture</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t fragrance free and I have seen no outstanding results with my beard, lips or skin. I have not use it in my hair as yet. It smells like coconut oil so it is not fragrance free. Best of using coconut oil directly than using this, I have seen better results with raw coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It makes me beard smell awesome, gets rid of flakes and smooths the hair out. Like any other balm, you need to learn how to use it. Small amounts spread out, just like palmaide in your hair. Everytime I put it in I get compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. it seems to make my beard look like I never trim it with hair going in different directions. I would not recommend this product. I have had a beard for over 20 years so it&#x27;s not like I am a novice at keeping my beard under control.</li>
            <li> Naked beard balm does exactly what I need it to. It keeps my beard soft, and from becoming dry. It has helped to give my beard a fuller look and even my wife could tell the difference. Great product!!!</li>
