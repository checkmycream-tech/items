            <li>Very clean, just showered smell.</li>
            <li>I dislike musk and vanilla but love sweet smelling perfumes and this is quite lovely.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, and first time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>It has amazing staying power-unlike many high end perfumes out there.  </li>
            <li>The best brands typically release their fragrances at this concentration level.&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Toilette:</li>
            <li>So inexpensive and light and floral.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer available where I used to buy it</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and was fortunate to get at such a good price.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments and tend to wear it every day because it is not overpowering and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Paul Sebastian&#x27;s Design since it first came out and was sold in fine department stores...</li>
            <li>I get a lot of people asking what I am wearing, it is different from most items on the market and very, very sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was fine and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Great for all occasions or everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I used the top from an old bottle.  </li>
            <li>Other people say, you smell good what cologne are you wearing?</li>
            <li>Bingo, there it was and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>glad to have it back again.</li>
            <li>Very timely shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li>I have worn this since it first came out.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>But since the bottle was empty , I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement .</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for carrying this product.</li>
            <li>This is all I wear for perfume, so as usual, I was satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>much better than other sites I had ordered from</li>
            <li>I had bought the sample bottle of this at a local store a few years ago , I loved it .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this .</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For some strange reason many scents will give me an instant headache.</li>
            <li>I spray this product on my arm and can only smell something if my nose is right up on it</li>
            <li>When I first started wearing this, I could only find it at Dillards Dept Store.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased when I got the larger bottle for less than I could have bought the smaller in the store including shipping.</li>
            <li>For all of you who are familiar with the Design scent and have worn it before you will know exactly what I mean.  </li>
            <li>The scent would last a whole day.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised though that I saw it at ross for $13.00</li>
            <li>(they seem to be stocking all the young girl perfumes).  </li>
            <li>Was surprised to see it at this&lt;</li>
            <li>I am almost 40 years old and have been using it since I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long though.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I LOVED this perfume.  </li>
            <li> how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Design&amp;#34; for 10+ years and as long as I can find it, I&#x27;ll continue to wear it.  </li>
            <li> ; only problem was the top which was almost impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> Gildedlife.com:&lt;br /&gt;Perfume Extract (Extrait): The highest level of concentration, typically sold only in the top-of-the-line fragrance families such as Chanel No. 5.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other perfumes in between but ALWAYS end up coming back to it.  </li>
            <li> Concentration levels are between 15% and 40% fragrance, with 20% being typical.&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Parfum or Parfum de Toilette: The next highest level of fragrance and perfume concentration, Eau de Parfum and Parfum de Toilette are sometimes confusing because the second term includes the words “toilette” and is used by only a handful of firms.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with other perfumes changing their smell</li>
            <li> I filed a complaint with Amazon and the company who sent it to me immediately called and said he didn&#x27;t understand why it wouldn&#x27;t smell the same and that the product came from Coty.  </li>
            <li> and he purchased the product from an outlet down there</li>
            <li> At this level, fragrance concentration is between 10% and 20% with 15% being typical.  </li>
            <li> A typical Eau de Toilette is affordable for the masses.  </li>
            <li> but if you perspire a little you would smell it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to smell perfume on yourself</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I will never get tired of this sent.</li>
            <li> As usual , when all else fails , try Amazon !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible and doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I get lots of complements when wearing this fragrence.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, and first time I&#x27;ve used it.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last long though.</li>
            <li> Always my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; scent.  Great for all occasions or everyday wear.  Pricing and packaging all good via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Del was great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the perfume. I have a problem with other perfumes changing their smell whem I put them on, but not with Design by Paul Sebastian, I can always rely on it to give me that sexy aroma I smell in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for over 15 years.  I have tried other perfumes in between but ALWAYS end up coming back to it.  I always get complimented on the scent and people ask what I am wearing all the time.  It has amazing staying power-unlike many high end perfumes out there.  So inexpensive and light and floral. I always get nervous they may quit making it. It is always my go to perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Paul Sebastian&#x27;s Design since it first came out and was sold in fine department stores...probably about 30 years now. I loved the fragrance and always received great compliments on it. The scent would last a whole day.  I recently purchased a bottle from Amazon and as soon as I sprayed it on I knew it wasn&#x27;t Design.  The scent wasn&#x27;t even close...it smelled like a powder.  I filed a complaint with Amazon and the company who sent it to me immediately called and said he didn&#x27;t understand why it wouldn&#x27;t smell the same and that the product came from Coty.  For all of you who are familiar with the Design scent and have worn it before you will know exactly what I mean.  It&#x27;s hard to smell perfume on yourself but if you perspire a little you would smell it.  I spray this product on my arm and can only smell something if my nose is right up on it and it&#x27;s not the same scent. It&#x27;s horrible and doesn&#x27;t last.  I returned the product and they credited my charge with no problem at all.  Now...my husband was in North Carolina since and he purchased the product from an outlet down there and it is still a different scent.  They can&#x27;t all be knockoffs so I&#x27;m guessing that they changed the scent of the product.  I am so disappointed because I LOVED this perfume.  I will only buy it again if I can smell a sample on display.</li>
            <li> Love This!  very good.... Good buy for the price. I have been looking for this product for some time now.... glad to have it back again.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  I discovered it when I asked my sister-in-law what she was wearing and I have worn it ever since.  I get a lot of people asking what I am wearing, it is different from most items on the market and very, very sweet smelling.  I dislike musk and vanilla but love sweet smelling perfumes and this is quite lovely.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years and was out so decided to order from Amazon. I was very pleased when I got the larger bottle for less than I could have bought the smaller in the store including shipping. Product was good in every way.</li>
            <li> Very timely shipping! Got it within a couple of days. This is all I wear for perfume, so as usual, I was satisfied with this product! I get so many compliments every time I wear this. I can&#x27;t believe I found an inexpensive perfume that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Design by Paul Sebastian fin parfum spray is bringing me pleasure and joy as it is one of my all time favorite fragrances!  The packaging arrived all in tact --- although it took longer to receive than I was expecting but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  I GET MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THE  FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li> Always buy this from Amazon repeatedly. Always satisfied. I get compliments from male and females. Very pleasant aroma . Stats on lengthy amount of time. Have been using this for 5 years now. Highly recommend this .</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 15 years and constantly get compliments. Wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect!!  Love love love! Comes fully wrapped, and smells delish!  I would highly recommend this product. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The price was a great bargain! However, the perfume was not as fragrant as I recall and was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Design for over 40 years. I only purchase the parfume. You MUST know what type you are purchasing. If you once had the parfume, and then purchase the Eau de toilette, you will definitely notice a difference in both depth of fragrance and how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;From Gildedlife.com:&lt;br /&gt;Perfume Extract (Extrait): The highest level of concentration, typically sold only in the top-of-the-line fragrance families such as Chanel No. 5.  Concentration levels are between 15% and 40% fragrance, with 20% being typical.&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Parfum or Parfum de Toilette: The next highest level of fragrance and perfume concentration, Eau de Parfum and Parfum de Toilette are sometimes confusing because the second term includes the words “toilette” and is used by only a handful of firms.  At this level, fragrance concentration is between 10% and 20% with 15% being typical.  This level is also sometimes called Eau De Perfume or Millesime.  The best brands typically release their fragrances at this concentration level.&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Toilette: This is the strength of most fragrances you will find at department stores.  A typical Eau de Toilette is affordable for the masses.  Personally, we try to avoid any Eau de Toilette instead preferring Eau de Parfums.</li>
            <li> This is my absoult favorite perfume...Great price and shipped for free, reg. sales for $40.....I was surprised though that I saw it at ross for $13.00 but that was a clearance sale for end of year.</li>
            <li> I receive more compliments from strangers and friends when I wear this scent.  It actually is the only perfume I use.  I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Design&amp;#34; for 10+ years and as long as I can find it, I&#x27;ll continue to wear it.  When I first started wearing this, I could only find it at Dillards Dept Store.  After many years , I found it at CVS drugstore and then at Walgreens.  It look as though neighter drugstore carry it any longer (they seem to be stocking all the young girl perfumes).  Thank you Amazon, for letting me find my Favorite perfume!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, just as described.</li>
            <li> I love it. My favorite fragrance. I had been out of it for a while. Was surprised to see it at this&lt;br /&gt;price. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this parfum, but it does differ from the scent that I use to wear years ago.  I don&#x27;t know whether Paul Sebastian changed the formula or whether this is a knockoff.</li>
            <li> I am almost 40 years old and have been using it since I was in my 20&#x27;s. I receive so many compliments. I will never get tired of this sent. It  is the best..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. It&#x27;s light and delicious! I get many compliments and tend to wear it every day because it is not overpowering and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Came as promised and great delivery time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 15 years now.  I get many compliments on it everywhere I go.  Many of my employees have walked into my office and commented on how great my office always smells....Very clean, just showered smell.</li>
            <li> Same scent as ever.  Been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> The packaging was fine and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  The scent is wonderful.....much better than other sites I had ordered from; only problem was the top which was almost impossible to remove.  Once I got it off I used the top from an old bottle.  I have used Design for over 20 years and always receive favorable comments.</li>
            <li> My wife gets lots of compliments about Design from the kids she teaches in HS.  It&#x27;s no longer available where I used to buy it so I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like its fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume right on time and in perfect condition.  I was able to give it to my Mom in time for her Birthday!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.I love the fragrance. I have used this product for many years and was fortunate to get at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I had bought the sample bottle of this at a local store a few years ago , I loved it . But since the bottle was empty , I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement . So....... I went to Amazon ! As usual , when all else fails , try Amazon ! Bingo, there it was and at a very reasonable price. Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li> I have worn this since it first came out. Other people say, you smell good what cologne are you wearing? For some strange reason many scents will give me an instant headache. Because it smells so good most of my friends have purchased some also. I could not find it in Pittsburg, Ks. so ordered it on Amazon.com. Thank you so much for carrying this product. I would have had to drive 40 miles to Joplin, Mo. and then 40 miles back home. This was just so easy !!!!!!!!!! I will be using Amazon .com a lot in the future</li>
            <li> Husband has used Paul for men years now.  Love this for women and would like to have bath powder also.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the smell but it&#x27;s hard to find.  So glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Design by Paul Sebastian is one of my niece&#x27;s favorite parfum.  I am glad that I was able to get it for her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price I love this Parfum</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with order.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It has been a favorite for years.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li> Design By Paul Sebastian is Cologne I use.  I was very happy with my order.</li>
