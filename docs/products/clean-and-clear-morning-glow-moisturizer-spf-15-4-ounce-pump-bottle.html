            <li>If it came in a tinted variety with more SPF protection, it would be beyond perfect.</li>

            <li>It is my favorite face care product.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer and it has been discontinued which is heartbreaking.</li>
            <li>It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I opened the bottle up and get this chemical smell that is fairly strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent is extremely strong.  </li>
            <li>Light, oil free and cheaper than the fancy brands.</li>
            <li>Ever since I began using C&amp;C Morning Glow, I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments on how happy and glowing I look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the genuine product.</li>
            <li>for some light sun protection though so not all is lost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear foundation, and this product has a light diffusing property to it that makes your skin appear to glow.</li>
            <li>Great product, its the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t Break out my face.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep skin clear and moisturized   Good price       </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of very few light feeling moisturizers that also contain an SPF ... and best of all, I&#x27;m NOT allergic to it.  </li>
            <li>She called really excited and said &amp;#34;thank</li>
            <li>Overall, I was happy to be able to get it at all (and for a reasonable price), since it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>my current bottle has that pleasant scent that I associate with this product, and the moisturizer from this order has almost no scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light moisturizer that really leaves your skin glowing.</li>
            <li>What a sweet daughter.</li>
            <li>but when I explained this to the seller they issued a full refund which would make me buy from them, but just not anything I&#x27;d put on my face.</li>
            <li>It has sunscreen in it, and there is no bad odor.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it so much that when I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local pharmacy&#x27;s:</li>
            <li>Very light complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>I use this and/or another clear care moisturizer which I also love.</li>
            <li>my skin has never been so soft or healthy when I use this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love a morning moisturizer that leaves my skin glowing and looking natural.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for sun protection, adding moisture, and the beautiful glow that grabs other&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li>It is a very light lotion, and moisturizes without making your skin extra oily.</li>
            <li>Got there on time and is exactly what they said it would be.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>My favorite daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>There are so many moisturizers that aren&#x27;t half as good and cost more than double the price, not to mention not nearly as much product.</li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer extremely excited and hopeful, because I have very dry skin (especially in these winter months in colorado) and it had such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>So sure it moisturizes my dry skin</li>
            <li>I have used clean and clear (unscented) for years and did not know this particular one has perfume.  </li>
            <li>It contains a little SPF to protect your skin along with a little shimmer to give your face a wonderful glow.</li>
            <li>my skin is very oily.    </li>
            <li>and she was a very &amp;#34;HAPPY LADY&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>so much Mom</li>
            <li>I really dont like that product</li>
            <li>The expiration date was very close to the delivery date</li>
            <li>I would buy again as a last resort, but if this product were still available in stores, I would choose that first, even if it cost a little more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a little worried that the SPF won&#x27;t work by the time I get to the 3rd bottle, but it&#x27;s nice to know I won&#x27;t have to search stores for it again any time soon!</li>
            <li>it gives me that fresh look i love and have been using it for years even when i buy other moisturizers i always go back to this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been asked constantly \\&quot;Are you pregnant, because you&#x27;re glowing?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it tingles a little in the morning to wake up my skin.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Bring Back Clean and Clear Morning Glow Moisturizer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear has discontinued this product, and I want it back.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get a moisturizer for the dry area of my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer under my makeup or mixed with my foundation for the last 6 years and recently haven&#x27;t been able to find it consistently in stores.  </li>
            <li>I WANT YOU TO GO RIGHT DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL WALGREENS, CVS, OR WALMART, AND BY THE CLEAN AND CLEAR: MORNING GLOW!!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I suggest washing your face first, applying some acne cream prior to the moisturizer, then the morning glow and then your makeup.   </li>
            <li>It says oil free, but with my crazy sensitive/combination skin, I should have known better.     </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft.    </li>
            <li>Everyone who wants this discontinued product to be brought back, please go &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; the Facebook page!!  </li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin should avoid this product.  </li>
            <li>The packaging it slightly different, so I thought it might have been an older version.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I barely put any on!  </li>
            <li>I tried out Clean &amp; Clear morning glow moisturizer since it had an SPF-15 and would moisturize the dry parts of my skin while not going on heavily or greasily on the oily acne-prone parts.</li>
            <li>I would not count on the SPF 15 for protection, as sunscreen in general has been known not to work after its expiration date.</li>
            <li>Something about morning burst drives me crazy because i dont wear make up because i have really good skin</li>
            <li>I have large pores and sensitive skin that is prone to breakout with other more expensive moisturizers, but not with C&amp;C Morning Glow.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the vitamin A supplements that i started taking a month ago but read alot of reviews about vitamin A and this product and found that vitamin a is suppose to help the skin and quite a few people are saying that  clean and clear morning glow is irritating the skin.</li>

            <li> People with sensitive skin should avoid this product.  </li>
            <li> The packaging it slightly different, so I thought it might have been an older version.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I barely put any on!  </li>
            <li> I tried out Clean &amp; Clear morning glow moisturizer since it had an SPF-15 and would moisturize the dry parts of my skin while not going on heavily or greasily on the oily acne-prone parts.</li>
            <li> I would not count on the SPF 15 for protection, as sunscreen in general has been known not to work after its expiration date.</li>
            <li> Something about morning burst drives me crazy because i dont wear make up because i have really good skin</li>
            <li> I have large pores and sensitive skin that is prone to breakout with other more expensive moisturizers, but not with C&amp;C Morning Glow.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the vitamin A supplements that i started taking a month ago but read alot of reviews about vitamin A and this product and found that vitamin a is suppose to help the skin and quite a few people are saying that  clean and clear morning glow is irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this so long that I can&#x27;t recall when I started.</li>
            <li> seems like i got an old batch - a few had the smell of expired lotion - not all, but 2 of them</li>
            <li> Not sure if Clean &amp; Clear makes this lotion anymore, as I have been unable to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> It is a little gritty feeling going on, but those are the brighteners.</li>
            <li> I have been using just a little bit of the last bottle I have for months.</li>
            <li> I still had a little bit left of the one that I purchased in a store, so I compared them...</li>
            <li> I bought it few times in the last two years online.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later it turned my skin to an odd orange-ish tint.  </li>
            <li> Our skin tends to have an oily area, but get very dried out, especially on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Usually moisturizer has a really long shelf life.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have VERY SENSITIVE skin</li>
            <li> Or you can dab on a little sun screen.</li>
            <li> I did a little dance when they arrived.</li>
            <li> This is further complicated by how dry parts of my skin gets in the winter months.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my face it was very hard to rub in, and although it wasnt greasy it just sat on my skin in a white film.  </li>
            <li> IDK why it&#x27;s not available in the store.</li>
            <li> In the winter, my skin does still dry out in places, but I use this moisturizer in combination with a tinted moisturizer from Wet n&#x27; Wild: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> There is usually a bit of a shimmer to this product, too, but the one from this order was less shimmery.  </li>
            <li> I hear it&#x27;s being discontinued which makes me sad, but will definitely stock up while I can.</li>
            <li> That stuff at least didnt dry my skin out even worse that it is.</li>
            <li> Hard to find products I remain faithful to cause usually have to change things up to keep them working as thry should.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> In fact, it hardly has a scent at all.</li>
            <li> Price for me was a little steep; but I will budget it in until it&#x27;s gone!!</li>
            <li> However the last time I bough it made me break out very bad, something was different.</li>
            <li> Not a good value.</li>
            <li> And my skin has broken out every time I use it.</li>
            <li> The SPF is a definite PLUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was very disappointed to see it discontinued.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to find one that goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> so sad it&#x27;s discontinued..</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and glad I can get it online. Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Not sure if Clean &amp; Clear makes this lotion anymore, as I have been unable to find it in stores. It is a very light lotion, and moisturizes without making your skin extra oily. It has sunscreen in it, and there is no bad odor. In fact, it hardly has a scent at all. It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have used the moisturizer for years. Light, oil free and cheaper than the fancy brands. Our skin tends to have an oily area, but get very dried out, especially on the cheeks. This works for all of us.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Very light complete coverage.  Spf is a plus.  IDK why it&#x27;s not available in the store.</li>
            <li> There are so many moisturizers that aren&#x27;t half as good and cost more than double the price, not to mention not nearly as much product. I use this and/or another clear care moisturizer which I also love. If it came in a tinted variety with more SPF protection, it would be beyond perfect. If you use this (spf 15) and a spf make up you should be good for sun protection. Or you can dab on a little sun screen. Still you can&#x27;t beat it for the price and quality.  It makes my skin feel so soft.    It has a pleasant aroma.   I wash my face before I apply it b/c my skin is very oily.    It keeps it moisturized and mostly protected w/o adding any additional shine. My face looks great.  If you suffer from acne I suggest washing your face first, applying some acne cream prior to the moisturizer, then the morning glow and then your makeup.   Happy Hunting!      Pros:     More product for your money   Good quality   Helps keep skin clear and moisturized   Good price       Cons:     Could be doubled in SPF protection (15 vs 30)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for years. This year it seems to have disappeared from stores; I tried Rite Aid, Target, and CVS, and couldn&#x27;t find it on their website either. I was very glad when I found it on amazon.com. It&#x27;s a very light moisturizer that really leaves your skin glowing. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer extremely excited and hopeful, because I have very dry skin (especially in these winter months in colorado) and it had such great reviews.  I opened the bottle up and get this chemical smell that is fairly strong.  I couldnt wait to try it, so I cleansed and toned.  When I put it on my face it was very hard to rub in, and although it wasnt greasy it just sat on my skin in a white film.  I barely put any on!  A few minutes later it turned my skin to an odd orange-ish tint.  Is that the \\&quot;morning glow\\&quot;? Ive been using it for about a week and it has started to break out my skin and hasnt helped the dryness even a tad.  I regret buying this product.  I wish it had worked.</li>
            <li> me and my wife use this face moisturizer every morning and it works great. makes your skin look and feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer under my makeup or mixed with my foundation for the last 6 years and recently haven&#x27;t been able to find it consistently in stores.  I bought the 3 pack and I&#x27;m a little worried that the SPF won&#x27;t work by the time I get to the 3rd bottle, but it&#x27;s nice to know I won&#x27;t have to search stores for it again any time soon!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It brightens skin and is light and perfect for a humid climate. I got a pack of 3 and plan to get more. It is a little gritty feeling going on, but those are the brighteners.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Not greasy. Gives just a bit of glow</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore, and i have loved it for 6-7 years. Best face lotion on the market for the money.</li>
            <li> Ever since I began using C&amp;C Morning Glow, I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments on how happy and glowing I look.  I&#x27;ve been asked constantly \\&quot;Are you pregnant, because you&#x27;re glowing?, Are you seeing someone, because you&#x27;re glowing?  You look beautiful, What have you done?\\&quot; I respond \\&quot;No\\&quot; to all the above and reply,\\&quot;It must be my Morning Glow\\&quot; constantly. I receive laughs and \\&quot;Yeah Rights\\&quot; in reply.  I am not kidding.    Although compliments are nice, I use this product for its sun protection and non-clogging moisturizers.  I have large pores and sensitive skin that is prone to breakout with other more expensive moisturizers, but not with C&amp;C Morning Glow.  I love, love, love it so much that when I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local pharmacy&#x27;s: Rite Aide, CVS, Duane Reade etc., I had to search for it on-line.  I highly recommend it for sun protection, adding moisture, and the beautiful glow that grabs other&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  I was thrilled to be able to purchase it from you.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, she loves it.</li>
            <li> One of the only non-expensive moisturizers out there that has sunscreen in it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new facial moisturizer. I have combination skin so it&#x27;s difficult to find one that goes on evenly. This is further complicated by how dry parts of my skin gets in the winter months. I tried out Clean &amp; Clear morning glow moisturizer since it had an SPF-15 and would moisturize the dry parts of my skin while not going on heavily or greasily on the oily acne-prone parts. I was delighted when this moisturizer revitalized my face and neck, while protecting against sun damage. In the winter, my skin does still dry out in places, but I use this moisturizer in combination with a tinted moisturizer from Wet n&#x27; Wild: [[ASIN:B00112AH4U Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild Ultimate Sheer Tinted Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sun Kissed 183, 1 oz.]] and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderfully scented. I LOVE the dispenser!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the genuine product. The packaging it slightly different, so I thought it might have been an older version. There are no expiration dates on it. And my skin has broken out every time I use it. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> my fave moisturizer.  wish it was still being sold in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s one of very few light feeling moisturizers that also contain an SPF ... and best of all, I&#x27;m NOT allergic to it.  Sadly, I have VERY SENSITIVE skin and it seems that every time I find a product that works for me, it&#x27;s taken off the market.  That is why I bought this product through AMAZON.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this at Walmart, but as of recent I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid that place at all costs.  This product is great Oil free works perfect and skin is moist all day with much needed Sun protection.  No break outs very happy with product</li>
            <li> I have used this so long that I can&#x27;t recall when I started. I panicked when I could not find it anywhere else. I did a little dance when they arrived. Price for me was a little steep; but I will budget it in until it&#x27;s gone!! Note: my bottles exp.dt is 2015/04.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I have very sensitive skin and this is the only lotion that I can use that provides enough moisture, doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.  The SPF is a definite PLUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was very disappointed to see it discontinued.  PLEASE PLEASE bring it back!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone who wants this discontinued product to be brought back, please go &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; the Facebook page!!  &amp;#34;Bring Back Clean and Clear Morning Glow Moisturizer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bought at walmart is great product. Ran out and could no longer be found. This moisturizer did not cause break outs or leave skin oily. Great stuff. Hard to find products I remain faithful to cause usually have to change things up to keep them working as thry should.</li>
            <li> I have used this face moisturizer for years and love it! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or greasy at all. It&#x27;s light and soaks in quickly. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores so no worry about breakouts. It contains a little SPF to protect your skin along with a little shimmer to give your face a wonderful glow. Highly recommend it. I hear it&#x27;s being discontinued which makes me sad, but will definitely stock up while I can.</li>
            <li> I was initially reluctant to buy this type of product online. Ofcourse when I got my order and checked the worn off date it was from 2009. The moisturizer was expired... Never ordering again.</li>
            <li> Favorite moisturizer ever! I have been using it for years and they stopped carrying it in all my local stores and I was so upset until I found it here on Amazon. I have been using just a little bit of the last bottle I have for months. my skin has never been so soft or healthy when I use this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> seems like i got an old batch - a few had the smell of expired lotion - not all, but 2 of them</li>
            <li> This product works great, not too greasy and it includes sunscreen which is always a plus!!</li>
            <li> I have used clean and clear (unscented) for years and did not know this particular one has perfume.  Why the perfume?  Many women and all men will not use it.  The fact there is no mention of perfume  and that I bought the three pack ( now in the trash), I will give it a 1 star.</li>
            <li> I should have known that this product would make me break out.  The scent is extremely strong.  People with sensitive skin should avoid this product.  I ordered 3 bottles of this lotion based on the reviews.  I gave the lotion to my insensitive friends and they love it:)</li>
            <li> It says oil free, but with my crazy sensitive/combination skin, I should have known better.     I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer on my arms, shoulders, etc. for some light sun protection though so not all is lost.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter, she loves using this product and can not find it in stores any longer.  I had it shipped to her house and she was a very &amp;#34;HAPPY LADY&amp;#34;.  She called really excited and said &amp;#34;thank you so much Mom, I knew you loved me&amp;#34;  What a sweet daughter.</li>
            <li> I hated this product. I was excited to get a moisturizer for the dry area of my face but after a while of using it those areas started drying out like never before. At first I thought it was the vitamin A supplements that i started taking a month ago but read alot of reviews about vitamin A and this product and found that vitamin a is suppose to help the skin and quite a few people are saying that  clean and clear morning glow is irritating the skin. So sure it moisturizes my dry skin but that is after it dries it out. I really dont like that product so I am going back to Clinique. That stuff at least didnt dry my skin out even worse that it is. I am extremely disappointed. And like others have said, I does feel grainy..</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear has discontinued this product, and I want it back. It is a great day time sun screen moisturizer. I don&#x27;t wear foundation, and this product has a light diffusing property to it that makes your skin appear to glow. It is my favorite face care product.</li>
            <li> love this! Wish the company didn&#x27;t phase this out of the market</li>
            <li> Got there on time and is exactly what they said it would be.</li>
            <li> This is the only face lotion I use. Used it for 10 years now and every time I run out and use something else my face breaks out. So I know this is the best for me.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for years and never broke out (I have oily skin). When I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores I search for it online and found it on Amazon. I bought it few times in the last two years online. However the last time I bough it made me break out very bad, something was different. I called J&amp;J to see if they changed any ingredients in the moisturizer, only to learn that this cream was discontinued by the manufacturer in January 2012. So what I bought was either a copy made in China (where all copies are made) with who know what ingredients, or an expired cream.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER, IT PERSONALLY MAKE MY SKIN, GLOWY ANDF FLAWLESS!!!!!!! AFTER YOU READ THIS COMMENT I WANT YOU TO GO RIGHT DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL WALGREENS, CVS, OR WALMART, AND BY THE CLEAN AND CLEAR: MORNING GLOW!! THAT IS IF YOU WANT FLAWLESS SKIN, LIKE ME!</li>
            <li> Great product, its the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t Break out my face.  Just as described! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My favorite face moisturizer! can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore! So happy I found it online. I love the way it tingles a little in the morning to wake up my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes skin look dewy in a good way. Sometimes irritates skin, looking red. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> My favorite daily moisturizer! so sad it&#x27;s discontinued..</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Perfect product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and buy it when I can find it as I fear it&#x27;s no longer made</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only cream I have used on my face for the last 6 years.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Something about morning burst drives me crazy because i dont wear make up because i have really good skin all i do is put this on and some mascara and im all set it gives me that fresh look i love and have been using it for years even when i buy other moisturizers i always go back to this</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer and it has been discontinued which is heartbreaking. Thankfully - Amazon to the rescue!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li> I think these might be old/out-of-date products.  The packaging has changed in the 7 years or so that I&#x27;ve been using this product, and the packaging that arrived from this order was the way it used to be sold, not the newer packaging of the last several years.  I still had a little bit left of the one that I purchased in a store, so I compared them...my current bottle has that pleasant scent that I associate with this product, and the moisturizer from this order has almost no scent.  There is usually a bit of a shimmer to this product, too, but the one from this order was less shimmery.  (I have considered that it might even be fake, but I think more likely just old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I love, love, love this product in general was that it is that perfect combination of moisturizing without being greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  The product that arrived meets those essential requirements.  I would buy again as a last resort, but if this product were still available in stores, I would choose that first, even if it cost a little more.  Overall, I was happy to be able to get it at all (and for a reasonable price), since it has been discontinued.  I would not count on the SPF 15 for protection, as sunscreen in general has been known not to work after its expiration date.</li>
            <li> The expiration date was very close to the delivery date and if I had realized that I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Made my wife&#x27;s face break out in tiny read blotches. And... it should have been a red flag when the expiration date was 4/15 and I bought it in 2/15. Usually moisturizer has a really long shelf life. So...  but when I explained this to the seller they issued a full refund which would make me buy from them, but just not anything I&#x27;d put on my face.</li>
            <li> It was a 3 pack that expires in 4 months.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this at the store anymore.  Love a morning moisturizer that leaves my skin glowing and looking natural.  No oily feel that would interfere with applying foundation over it later.</li>
            <li> Three bottle pack that all expire six months from purchase.  Not a good value.</li>
            <li> I discovered that using this moisturizer has a calming effect on my skin.  I love it!</li>
