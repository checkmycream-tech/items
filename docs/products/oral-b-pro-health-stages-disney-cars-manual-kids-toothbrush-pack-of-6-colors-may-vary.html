            <li>they&#x27;re awesome brushes, and are the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; with the correct colors of the characters and Disney logos (some knockoffs out there don&#x27;t fit the bill).</li>

            <li>So that is kind of a bummer, but,</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice just in case we do.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a good size and softness, and the brush is easy to hold and maneuver around their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 7 year old.</li>
            <li>They were very attentive and I used props from the San Diego Dental Hygiene society.</li>
            <li>This is the way to buy toothbrushes for kids who love Disney.  </li>
            <li>I love the Oral-B Pro-Health Stages kids toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>and we love it.  </li>
            <li>We will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>None of these lasted for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>:) I don&#x27;t have to twist my kid&#x27;s arm to brush his teeth anymore</li>
            <li>The subscribe and save price is a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>Brush holds up well and fits mouth fine</li>
            <li>honestly, my kids really don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have had better success with TOTZ RADIUS toothbrush.</li>
            <li>He chews up his brushes pretty quick so having a box of 6 is nice.</li>
            <li>These are great toothbrushes and hold up much better than any other kids toothbrush on the market.  </li>
            <li>My son loves his toothbrush so it makes that much easier to brush his teeth :)</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are great for small mouths and have great easy to hold handles for little hands.  </li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s for older kids, but it fits his mouth just fine.  </li>
            <li>He still uses them up pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Good habits started young will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li>As far as toothbrushes go, they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The packaging for the toothbrushes say that they are recommended for ages 5-7, but children younger than that still enjoy the brushes.  </li>
            <li>Was very surprised/disappointed that of the 6 toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone for your help</li>
            <li>but since he loves Cars so much we opted for these instead of stage 2.</li>
            <li>The bristles were out of shape equally fast.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes each have a tongue cleaner, but I would be surprised if any child would be willing to use it.  </li>
            <li>Also don&#x27;t forget that they need their little teeth flossed just as much as adults do, buy a pack of flossers or even better floss their teeth yourself if they will let you.</li>
            <li>but I find myself needing to replace it more frequently than I would have expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The Disney princesses are pretty ridiculously priced, while some of the other, less popular cartoon sets are super cheap.</li>
            <li>My son got all his teeth very early so we&#x27;ve been brushing teeth for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>I saw the same exact tooth brush sold in singles at the grocery store for 4 dollars each.  </li>
            <li>My three- and five- year old kids like these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My brother-in-law is a dental hygienist and he gave my year old this tooth brush for his birthday</li>
            <li>I got these for my 4yr old boy even though it was meant for 5</li>
            <li>I did read all the reviews before ordering this for my 22 month old.</li>
            <li>Also, the bristles stay strong after multiple uses, although they probably have to be replaced every few moths.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft enough for a 4yrs old too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is very harsh on his toothbrushes so the ones meant for his age do not last him for more than a few days.</li>

            <li> The tongue scraper is useless, buy a seperate tongue scraper if your little one has bad breath, otherwise just skip it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> it&#x27;s  just something we want. thanks!</li>
            <li> These are very cute toothbrushes and each toothbrush has pictures of different cars from the Cars movies.  The toothbrushes each have a tongue cleaner, but I would be surprised if any child would be willing to use it.  The packaging for the toothbrushes say that they are recommended for ages 5-7, but children younger than that still enjoy the brushes.  They are durable and the pictures on each brush do not seem to peel off with repeated use.  Also, the bristles stay strong after multiple uses, although they probably have to be replaced every few moths.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrushes and hold up much better than any other kids toothbrush on the market.  The reason for only six stars is that this was supposed to be a package of six; the package had been torn open and taped shut (very messy, at that), and included only five instead of six toothbrushes.  I&#x27;m not sure how to contact the seller to request a refund.</li>
            <li> As far as toothbrushes go, they work just fine.  Small enough for my 2 1/2 year old learning to brush his teeth.  I ordered them because they were Oral-B and because they had characters from the movie &amp;#34;Cars&amp;#34; - which my son loves.  Was very surprised/disappointed that of the 6 toothbrushes - 3 of them had characters from the movie &amp;#34;Planes.&amp;#34;  Still a good product, just wish they would have included that in the description.</li>
            <li> Did a training class for 5 year olds and gave each one a toothbrush, floss and mouthwash. They were very attentive and I used props from the San Diego Dental Hygiene society. Thanks to everyone for your help</li>
            <li> The toothbrush definitely does the job but I find myself needing to replace it more frequently than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely not all cars characters - Planes characters mixed in as well</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re awesome brushes, and are the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; with the correct colors of the characters and Disney logos (some knockoffs out there don&#x27;t fit the bill).</li>
            <li> Perfect sized head for a toddler mouth</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 7 year old. He loves the Cars and Planes theme. These are the same toothbrushes my kids dentist gives out.</li>
            <li> My son loves his toothbrush so it makes that much easier to brush his teeth :)</li>
            <li> My three- and five- year old kids like these toothbrushes. As other reviewers have said, be prepared to get one, maybe two, style choices. We received something like five Mikes and one Sully. It was the same ratio with the Cars set. So that is kind of a bummer, but, honestly, my kids really don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the toothbrush itself is perfect for them. The bristles are a good size and softness, and the brush is easy to hold and maneuver around their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, different sets are different prices. The Disney princesses are pretty ridiculously priced, while some of the other, less popular cartoon sets are super cheap. Just be on the lookout.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes. Bristles don&#x27;t fall out. My kid loves its colors. They come in a pack of 3 so you are good for a year or so. Not sure about the tongue scraper though. Doesn&#x27;t look functional</li>
            <li> This is the way to buy toothbrushes for kids who love Disney.  I saw the same exact tooth brush sold in singles at the grocery store for 4 dollars each.  They are perfect for our kids.</li>
            <li> My son loves the characters on these toothbrushes. They are of good quality also. Our dentist even gives them out.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B Pro-Health Stages kids toothbrushes.  They are the perfect size for 4-8 year olds. For my son who LOVED the Cars movie it is great to be able to buy six at a time (at a great price) and not worry about remembering which store I bought them at when we run out.</li>
            <li> It was just what we wanted, our  boy loved it, we defenetlly recomend it to every one it made us easier to brush his theeth</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law is a dental hygienist and he gave my year old this tooth brush for his birthday and we love it.  It says it&#x27;s for older kids, but it fits his mouth just fine.  He&#x27;s now 18 months and we are still using it.  We don&#x27;t always use the tongue brush but it&#x27;s nice just in case we do.</li>
            <li> This is a good manual toothbrush. Good grip. My toddler likes it but I find it hard to maneuver the head around in her small mouth.</li>
            <li> I got these for my 4yr old boy even though it was meant for 5+ cos my boy loves Cars! It made him look forward to brushing his teeth. The brushes are soft enough for a 4yrs old too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint was there were many repetitive designs for the toothbrush sent to me. And there wasn&#x27;t any mcqueen design out of the 6!</li>
            <li> Oral B makes the best manual toothbrushes, and I am a dental hygienist so I have seen and tried a lot of brushes. My son will not use a power brush yet so I purchased these for him since he loves the Cars characters.  These are \\&quot;stage 3\\&quot; and are labeled for 5-7 year olds. My son is only 2 but since he loves Cars so much we opted for these instead of stage 2. He chews up his brushes pretty quick so having a box of 6 is nice. He still uses them up pretty quick. But the bristles don&#x27;t come out or bend as much as other brands we have tried. The tongue scraper is useless, buy a seperate tongue scraper if your little one has bad breath, otherwise just skip it. The subscribe and save price is a pretty good price. We will be buying more soon. Also don&#x27;t forget that they need their little teeth flossed just as much as adults do, buy a pack of flossers or even better floss their teeth yourself if they will let you. And don&#x27;t forget to take them for a teeth cleaning and check-up every 6 months. Good habits started young will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> I did read all the reviews before ordering this for my 22 month old. He is very harsh on his toothbrushes so the ones meant for his age do not last him for more than a few days. He loves to chew them for 3-5 minutes after mommy finishes brushing his teeth in the morning and bedtime. The rubber back/ tongue cleaner fell apart in 4 days and I practically had throw out this brush. The bristles were out of shape equally fast. None of these lasted for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;I have had better success with TOTZ RADIUS toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My son loves this and it&#x27;s a great value for the quantity. :) I don&#x27;t have to twist my kid&#x27;s arm to brush his teeth anymore he can&#x27;t wait to use these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 1 pack of these toothbrushes, and bought another pack. The brush head is not too big. Although it says for ages 5-7, I have no problem using it for my daughter ever since she was 3.</li>
            <li> Kids like the graphics. Brush holds up well and fits mouth fine</li>
            <li> My son got all his teeth very early so we&#x27;ve been brushing teeth for quite awhile.  These toothbrushes are great for small mouths and have great easy to hold handles for little hands.  And he loves Cars so even better!</li>
            <li> My son likes it .He is using two brushes per day. If I&#x27;m out of it, I will buy again.</li>
