            <li>Please come back to sell more products!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very, very oily.</li>
            <li>After the first time, my skin felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the way it goes on and keeps my dry skin moisturized too!</li>
            <li>Since it isn&#x27;t CA certified Organic, I don&#x27;t know if it really is Organic</li>
            <li>J really like it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a bit to much for me.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels very moisturized but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I waited a few days to see if I would have a breakout of some kind, Never happened.</li>
            <li>After just a few uses, my dry flaking skin on my face was feeling much better, the burning feeling was gone, and my skin looked visibly better.</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel real soft and for that price I will keep useing it.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit oily (again, it is very, very rich), so I wear it as a night cream to condition the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Its nice and thick and smears along well, without feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be very sensitive and I have not had any problems.  </li>

            <li> Since it isn&#x27;t CA certified Organic, I don&#x27;t know if it really is Organic but it smells great, feels great on my skin and keeps my face healthy so far!</li>
            <li> My mom and I both use this moisturizer and love it! I have super oily, acne prone skin and she has dry skin and this works great for the both of us. It helps balance my skin, while helping to hydrate hers. This moisturizer is packed with some great ingredients that are good for the skin and I love the fact that it is organic! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I haven&#x27;t broken out from it at all! It is a thick cream, so all you need is a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue. I highly recommend this moisturizer and will definitely purchase this again once I run out!</li>
            <li> J really like it it makes my face feel real soft and for that price I will keep useing it.</li>
            <li> Feels very nice on the face. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Truly a good product. It is very rich and perfect to protect dry skin. It is a little bit oily (again, it is very, very rich), so I wear it as a night cream to condition the skin on my face. It leaves my skin very soft and happy. I must say that I am impressed by this mixture of natural ingredients and I wonder why it is not priced higher, because it is an excellent product and it works MUCH better than very expensive creams. I would recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very very thick and creamy so defiantly a night time moisturizer. It is almost too thick; takes awhile for it to soak up. As for the sent was not fond of the cocoa butter scent. I think this would be great if you had dry skin it&#x27;s just a bit to much for me.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but too strong smell for the face. Will love it if they make one without fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love! Smells like vanilla ice cream cake! Love the way it goes on and keeps my dry skin moisturized too! Please come back to sell more products!</li>
            <li> Just got it, and love it! Gets rid of flaky skin, doesn&#x27;t feel or look oily after. A little goes a long way. Does leave a slight residue but doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> Wow, my new alternative to Amazing Face! I found you! and you are not overpriced! in fact, its the perfect price. and organic! Works great after I shave my face. I am a male and mostly Italian with olive skin. Its nice and thick and smears along well, without feeling greasy at all. I use whats left on my hands and apply it in my hair to slightly defrizz. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I started with Organic Fields of Heather deodorant. If you&#x27;ve tried that and this it&#x27;s amazing, you will think this scrub is incredible! After the first time, my skin felt so soft and smooth. As I&#x27;ve continued to use my skin continues to improve. My breakouts have reduced and fine lines have diminished. I am 38 with combo skin and a thyroid issue. I have tried so many products and this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I love this product. And I love the fact that their located in my home state! It does go on a bit oily. It takes up to an hour for it to absorb on my skin. If I wear make up before the moisturizer, I have to keep spreading the moisturizer on my face after its been applied. I like to wear it before bed as well! Great smell. It looks small, but it isn&#x27;t! Its actually quite a bit compared to other moisturizers I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Makes my face so soft and smooth, blends in well, not greasy...smells great!</li>
            <li> love it. It does the job and  smells great!! and non GMO which is poison to all of us;what we put on our skin goes in our bodies!!&lt;br /&gt;been looking for a cream like this for a long time.Please give it a try</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous trying this and would never have splurged on it at full price knowing my skin sensitivity. I tried it because it was WAY on sale. I must say, I am so impressed. After just a few uses, my dry flaking skin on my face was feeling much better, the burning feeling was gone, and my skin looked visibly better. I waited a few days to see if I would have a breakout of some kind, Never happened. It doesn&#x27;t burn or make my face red like several others that I have tried. Normally I either see no results, or bad results. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, if I can use it, you probably could too. Thank you for an amazing product and I will purchase this from you again!</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with this product.  First off, it smells great, which is really important to me.  I was searching for a vanilla face lotion when I found this.  I smell a bit more of the cocoa butter than the vanilla, but that is ok.  It goes on really smoothly and my skin feels very moisturized but not greasy.  It is a thick creamy consistency.  My skin tends to be very sensitive and I have not had any problems.  I like that there are simple organic, natural and non-GMO ingredients.  I thought that the price was very reasonable for the kind of product.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found this organic facial moisturizer. First off, I started using it last week and already I have seen a marked improvement in my skin. You don&#x27;t need much, just a little. It gives my skin a young dewy look. The natural scent of vanilla and cocoa beans are wonderful. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been marked down so low! I hope it doesn&#x27;t mean Amazon will be closing out the product because I&#x27;ve never seen this brand anywhere else. Time to stock up just in case.</li>
            <li> This smells just like vanilla coca!I love the way this mosturizer feels on my skin!</li>
            <li> Very, very oily. Dislike.</li>
            <li> This was my least favorite I  did not like the scent i used it up on my body and feet . Stick with the other scents</li>
