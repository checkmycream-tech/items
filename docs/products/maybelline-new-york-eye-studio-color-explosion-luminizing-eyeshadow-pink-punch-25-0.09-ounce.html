            <li>okay guys, this is my FAVORITE eyeshadow palette!</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors in s  small container, which is perfect for me!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best eyeshadow I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with these.</li>
            <li>Love the sparkle color at the top although its not for everyone.</li>
            <li>Love this.. being that I have pale/fair skin, i like the fact that these colors are not \\&quot;to much\\&quot; just the right shades for me!</li>
            <li>It is so pretty, an amazing color, lasts all day, and has some shimmer.</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s still very pretty :-)</li>
            <li>love the eye shadow  have other colors great</li>
            <li>ITs great, you can use the silver colour to give a bit of sparkling during the day or shinne all night long.</li>
            <li>Goes on cleanly and evenly.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am exceptionally well pleased with this Pink Punch set.</li>
            <li>the colors are gorgeous and the white at the top is pure glitter which adds the nicest sparkle to your eyes.</li>
            <li>, i am very pleased with this product, the white color is very sparkley</li>
            <li>The colors look great together especially with blue eyes.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, but they are so sparkly.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Ok product doesn&#x27;t really last pretty colors</li>
            <li>I absolutely love color, especially on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Thinking about getting more of different shades soon.</li>
            <li>The colors matched exactly what is seen here.</li>
            <li>The colors are very nice but the product became very powdery so much of it ends up as dust in the air and therefore wasted.</li>
            <li>Very small for this much money I expected more the product is not so good the links are like a light coral orange color I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li>The materials are easy to apply, last thru the day, do not run or become</li>
            <li>I love pink, so when I see something on sale</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pink most of the sale is over.  </li>
            <li>In the future, I think I&#x27;d also like to try blending in some other colors, and use this set to give me bright highlights.</li>
            <li>I have more of the pink undertones and when i wear this makeup it helps provide a glow to my face!!</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments when I wear this eye shadow (has a little sparkle to it)</li>
            <li>Especially the white, it&#x27;s all glitter.&lt;br /&gt;Which, for going out at night would work fine.</li>
            <li>Last all day and the colours are really what they look like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this eyeshadow, don&#x27;t know why I ever wanted it especially in pink</li>
            <li>I used the the bottom white, right hand pink and the mauvish color then added the purple from the Maybelline Color Explosion Purple.  </li>
            <li>Open box, supost to be new and is open box whit out spong</li>
            <li>The pink goes on dark enough to be seen with ease, but is still a light color which I adore</li>
            <li>Darker and more dramatic than I thought it would be, but I tend to apply my makeup in a more dramatic way, so others might not have that problem.</li>
            <li>However, once I weakened and actually tried Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Explosion Luminizing Eyeshadow in Pink Punch, I saw that it brightened my face a bit, and although it is has some sparkle, the look was what I could only call glittering-natural!</li>

            <li> This Pink 25 is not the same as the other pack I got.</li>
            <li> definitely compliments green eyes.</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have about this is that it is very powdery and not pressed very hard.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothered me was it&#x27;s very little.</li>
            <li> Even though it both says Pink 25, the coloring are off!</li>
            <li> will definielly buy an other one</li>
            <li> for example, i rub my shadow brush over it and lots of the product flakes and turns to powder instead of the little bit i intended.</li>
            <li> I avoided buying this product at first, because I thought that pink eye shadow would look awful on me, or that I might as well put blush on my eyelids for the same effect.</li>

            <li> The colors are pretty, but they are so sparkly. Especially the white, it&#x27;s all glitter.&lt;br /&gt;Which, for going out at night would work fine. Definitely will not be my go to for daytime though.</li>
            <li> I love pink, so when I see something on sale that&#x27;s pink most of the sale is over.  When I saw this shadow I had to have it.  The nice thing is what you see is what you get.  Anotherwords the color you see in the ad is actually the color you&#x27;ll get. Which is very nice. The only thing that bothered me was it&#x27;s very little. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> now these are great colors, the eyeshadow stays on well, i am very pleased with this product, the white color is very sparkley</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this eyeshadow, don&#x27;t know why I ever wanted it especially in pink, what was I thinking??!</li>
            <li> Darker and more dramatic than I thought it would be, but I tend to apply my makeup in a more dramatic way, so others might not have that problem. Either way, it&#x27;s still very pretty :-)</li>

            <li> A lot cheaper on here than in stores, which was great. I loved these colors, and I absolutely love the sparkles you can add. You can add them on to different looks as well.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would change about this color pack is that I would add a medium purple.  I used the the bottom white, right hand pink and the mauvish color then added the purple from the Maybelline Color Explosion Purple.  The colors look great together especially with blue eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow. It is so pretty, an amazing color, lasts all day, and has some shimmer. It blends very nicely too. Definitely the best eyeshadow I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have about this is that it is very powdery and not pressed very hard. for example, i rub my shadow brush over it and lots of the product flakes and turns to powder instead of the little bit i intended. i feel like it will go fast if used everyday.</li>
            <li> Very small for this much money I expected more the product is not so good the links are like a light coral orange color I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors.  Thank you.</li>
