            <li>but I feel like this product is perfect because its not too moisturizing and its not to drying on my skin.</li>

            <li>I have fair, medium beige skin tone and the original spackle</li>
            <li>and I went online to search for more.  </li>
            <li>if I could give it more, I would.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;ve tried many of the other competitors&#x27; primers on QVC and this one is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>

            <li>and I think you would be fine to get a drug store primer and get something that works fine.</li>

            <li>8 hours after use, my make up still feels fresh and my face doesn&#x27;t feel as oily.  </li>
            <li>I love bare minerals makeup but was thinking I would have to switch to a liquid foundation because the minerals were making my face dryer looking.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, but it&#x27;s not drying and gives me a nice matte finish on the shiny areas of my skin (eyelids and nose).</li>
            <li>Monistat is cheaper and actually feels better on the skin.</li>
            <li>Tried this product out first from a sample i got with some perfume i ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old and love it to keep my oily face at bay throughout the day and my mom loves it to keep make up looking smooth rather than finding her few wrinkles ; )</li>
            <li>REALLY DOES NOT DO WHAT IT WAS AVERTISED</li>
            <li>The Product wasn&#x27;t quite as I expected, but I use it and it seems ok.</li>
            <li>I usually use Benefit&#x27;s POREfessional primer, which works great but wouldn&#x27;t always last as I have very oily skin!  </li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t do it really).</li>
            <li>It feels very hydrating going on your skin.  </li>

            <li>The original spackle was Great stuff - left a faint \\&quot;pearl-like\\&quot; glow that really made my face come alive -</li>
            <li>Unforunately, this version doesn&#x27;t have the same punch - watered down and not so effective.  </li>
            <li>Well, this spackle is the first of such products I have ever tried, and I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li>I have used her tinted Spackle primer as well (usually in the summertime) as it gives a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It came on on time and also arrived with a free little bag thing to keep your chapsticks and stuff in.</li>
            <li>It works really well and really helps insure that my makeup is going to last all day long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice that it fills in any lines (I only have one little laugh line that I&#x27;d like to fill</li>

            <li> I live in the mountains and my skin is very dry up here. I love bare minerals makeup but was thinking I would have to switch to a liquid foundation because the minerals were making my face dryer looking. Also, cream concealer was not going on well under my eyes. It made the wrinkles worse. Forget about powder concealers. (I tried liquid foundation-what a streaky, glopy mess!) Well, this spackle is the first of such products I have ever tried, and I&#x27;m sold! It coats the under eye area and smoothes out the rest of my face so I can use the minerals again, and best of all, I can use either a cream or powder concealer under my eyes now and it looks great. Just floats on top of the spackle! Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This item was as described. The problem is.....I believe the product was not a full size......I don&#x27;t know if the product settled in the bottle when shipped but the bottle was not a full size bottle. The problem is...the product only cost 29.95....and to return the product and have it re-shipped would be costly.....I will re- think when ordering again from this seller. I don&#x27;t feel I got &amp;#34;completely&amp;#34; what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I have used every type of makeup primer out there and I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t live without this one.  I have used her tinted Spackle primer as well (usually in the summertime) as it gives a healthy glow. It goes on smooth, dries quickly and leaves a flawless finish for foundation. It&#x27;s pricey but so worth it.  I would recommend this product again and again!</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I&#x27;ve used, though I haven&#x27;t used that many. It doesn&#x27;t fill in any pores or acne scars. My makeup does last a lot longer on my oily skin though.</li>
            <li> REALLY DOES NOT DO WHAT IT WAS AVERTISED TO DO, AND THE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NOT THE ORIGNAL, IS SUPPOSE TO HELP WITH PUFFINESS, I DON&#x27;T THINK IT DOES ANYTHING, JUST FEELS GOOD GOING ON.</li>
            <li> The original spackle was Great stuff - left a faint \\&quot;pearl-like\\&quot; glow that really made my face come alive - I have fair, medium beige skin tone and the original spackle just lit me right up!  My jar finally reached empty and I went online to search for more.  Unforunately, this version doesn&#x27;t have the same punch - watered down and not so effective.  Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> The Product wasn&#x27;t quite as I expected, but I use it and it seems ok. It&#x27;s very fine and transparent.</li>
            <li> I usually use Benefit&#x27;s POREfessional primer, which works great but wouldn&#x27;t always last as I have very oily skin!  This stuff is amazing!  8 hours after use, my make up still feels fresh and my face doesn&#x27;t feel as oily.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, and she loves it.  The price was pretty good, and it arrived very fast.  She says it holds her powder makeup in place.</li>
            <li> It is the best.  I give it five stars... if I could give it more, I would.  Lasts all day.  Love it!  Ro</li>
            <li> Works well  and goes a long way.  Less drying than others I have used. The best primer I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> What was I thinking????  SPACKLE!  First, it feels awful and then it does nothing.  Where in the world did I get the idea that there was a SPACKLE for your skin that could fill wrinkles.  Think about it!!!</li>
            <li> I notice that my make-up lasts longer, especially when I start with this and finish with Model in a Bottle for Sensitive Skin. It doesn&#x27;t break me out. I don&#x27;t really notice that it fills in any lines (I only have one little laugh line that I&#x27;d like to fill and this doesn&#x27;t do it really). It does work and doesn&#x27;t break me out and that is saying plenty for a product since I have such sensitive skin. I like it and would recommend. I&#x27;m going to try the Monistat Chafing powder gel since it&#x27;s CHEAPER. I think the prices on these primers are pretty ridiculous! I&#x27;ll update when I know how the two compare.  Update: Monistat is cheaper and actually feels better on the skin. I have dry skin, but it&#x27;s not drying and gives me a nice matte finish on the shiny areas of my skin (eyelids and nose). Cheaper and better - gotta love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve tried many of the other competitors&#x27; primers on QVC and this one is the best I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;m 20 years old and love it to keep my oily face at bay throughout the day and my mom loves it to keep make up looking smooth rather than finding her few wrinkles ; ) It&#x27;s great for all ages and I&#x27;m sold on it.  It feels very hydrating going on your skin.  Not at all sticky!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  I use it all the time.  I really feel my make up comes off at night, looking just like it did when I put it on without having to freshen it up.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice product and is on my daughters wish list and she will get it for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry,this spackle is very hard to pump out of container.The pump doesn&#x27;t work well.I won&#x27;t order again with the pump.</li>
            <li> Tried this product out first from a sample i got with some perfume i ordered. liked how it was floating like silk on my face.  filled in all my potholes. HA HA. does improve the way the makeup goes on and looks. I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars once i&#x27;ve tried it longer than a day. Thank you SELLER for getting this to me quick-snap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present.  It came on on time and also arrived with a free little bag thing to keep your chapsticks and stuff in.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! It works really well and really helps insure that my makeup is going to last all day long. I do have dry skin but I feel like this product is perfect because its not too moisturizing and its not to drying on my skin. It is a little pricy and I think you would be fine to get a drug store primer and get something that works fine. This isn&#x27;t a holy grail product but it still works nicely and I do really like it!</li>
