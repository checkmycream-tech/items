            <li>but I have not found better still...</li>
            <li>I could not have chosen better products.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It is also safe for any hair extensions you may be wearing as well.</li>
            <li>The product I received sits on top of the hair - you can feel the oily coating.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>We love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love the Moroccan products and the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the product, however, did not receive it until 3-4 weeks after my estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>Simply the best!</li>
            <li>I have been in love with this shampoo ever since I tried it my salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair healthy and shiny.  </li>

            <li>I love it love it</li>
            <li>please have them more in stocküôè</li>
            <li>i love moroccan oil products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Moroccan Oil&#x27;s hair oil</li>
            <li>I also love the shine it gives to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the ease of pumping the product vs pouring.</li>
            <li>I may have to start trying this stuff out myself :)</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner...</li>
            <li>So I just use at a screw off top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many comments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks since using this product.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of having all of my favorite  Moroccanoil hair products in one travel-size pouch.  </li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the results.</li>
            <li>Learned my lesson, I will not buy MoroccanOil from anywhere but in a reputable brick-and-mortar store or salon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>and I really love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The trick is leaving the conditioner on your hair for 5 or more minutes.</li>
            <li>On this order,  I got the product made in Israel;  I like it better than the one made in Canada.</li>
            <li>Love Morrocan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner ...</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with Moroccanoil.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived OK...</li>
            <li>each pump had tape across the top and were in an unmarked box and then placed in a bubble envelope.  </li>
            <li>But i am glad i did.</li>
            <li>I love Moroccanoil products--but there&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.</li>
            <li>I have never found any shampoo and conditioner I like better</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find this 16 ounce size anywhere except online, and it is a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell, so if you want a girlfriend, wife or some other king of partner with a good, pleasant and nice smell on her hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, good quality.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo and conditioner for someone with hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the way my hair feels after each use and mostly that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
            <li>expensive but great on  your hair and smells great - good price- love pump - can&#x27;t afford to get it all the time</li>
            <li>A very good product for your hair especially if you have chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, LOVE!!! :)</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY YES!!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li>It makes my fine hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>After suing this product, almost immediately I could see and feel a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This has made a huge difference in how my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>the Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner is a fantastic compliment to their Oil.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It works great, especially when paired with the MoroccanOil Treatment.</li>
            <li>The Shampoo and conditioner have the same great smell attributed with this product line.</li>
            <li>It started when I was in my late 20s, my best friend &amp; I would go to the neighborhood drugstore every Friday &amp; buy the latest thing so our hair (80s hair-</li>
            <li>Really !!!</li>
            <li>I swim 3 to 4 time a week and with my long hair this product is great for keeping my hair conditioned...</li>
            <li>I paid a lot more the first time I got it from the salon.</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s only fair to mention that I did not contact the seller about the issue since it wasn&#x27;t that important to</li>
            <li>The Salons charge far more for just one alone so thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>BUT most importantly the two younger teenagers have very fine and curly hair</li>
            <li>sometimes it comes with the oil @ a special price, so try to look for that deal.</li>
            <li>because not only does it smell good</li>
            <li>I am a true  Moroccanoil fan...</li>
            <li>the BIG 5-0 this year) would look good when we went out on the weekend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought their products from my salon for years, so I am sure these are not the real deal.</li>
            <li>Love moroccan oil products and really like the 16 oz sizes.  </li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>This product came quickly and was resonably priced.</li>
            <li>Enter my new favorite products, Moroccan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the real thing not a fake sold at many sites.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product when out of town and my original shampoo and conditioner for keratin treated hair did not make the flight.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and manageable, love this product</li>
            <li>BUT IT&#x27;S WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>Who really thought that tossing liquid hair product in a box and scotch-taping the pump would be good enough??  </li>
            <li>It makes her hair extremely soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The product is pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It was worth it</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>They help define my curls, tame the frizz, and they smell great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is the right product.  </li>
            <li>The containers are very large so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are getting ripped off when you buy it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is truly amazing, I wish I had found it a long time ago.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells, and the perfume in the product was so strong I had to give it away.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great, but the conditioner does not seem the same as when I have purchased it from a physical salon.</li>
            <li>This line is simply wonderful and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>first time user and</li>
            <li>I bought this from Amazon via KnA Beauty (noting this as there are many sellers of this same product on Amazon).</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair was so soft, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li>but it really repairs!</li>
            <li>Would love to get my money back!</li>
            <li>Styling is much easier!</li>
            <li>I instantly feel in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I first found out about this from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>My hair gets soft, very shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li>The pumps make it a lot easier to get the most out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem (which is a curly hair problem), is that the conditioner is used up much faster than the shampoo.</li>
            <li>My love affair with this product started after a salon incident - my scalp reacted to some product used in a salon in India and i ended up with severe skin rashes, itchiness that kept me awake at nights and lost a ton of my beautiful long and very thick hair.</li>
            <li>I get compliments almost everyday about how shiny and soft my hair looks, and my hair dresser always asks how I keep it so healthy!!</li>
            <li>I personally use several of their products and i am very pleased with the quality and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We always have a doubt if they are real moroccanoil brand or any kind of similar brand, very well counterfeited, because we never see on the moroccanoil website a similar flask, special edition or other kind of information that allow a clear recognition of the origin of the product.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine blonde highlighted hair</li>
            <li>and it is hard to keep it in good shape.  </li>
            <li>When I want straight hair</li>
            <li>Really uncool.......</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t go back to cheap products after using this.</li>
            <li>Helps hair so much.</li>
            <li>When I shampooed my eyes were burning from the smell and the product didn&#x27;t even smell like the real Moroccanoil should.  </li>
            <li>No way this is real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the real stuff from Ricky&#x27;s</li>
            <li>They are not the REAL product.</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged and the combination of the product has really improved it&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>I am not losing as much hair as I was&lt;</li>
            <li>I always had very wavy &amp; course hair.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much money on shampoo and conditioner, however my friend kept insisting that I would not regret it</li>
            <li>I only use M, Moroccanoil and was delighted to see this product arrive and deliver the results I expected.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely dry, long hair that has chemical damage, this is probably a good choice for you.  </li>
            <li>and my extremely curly hair is much more manageable since I began using this product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Having read some reviews for other sellers, I can confirm to you this is the authentic Motoccanoil.</li>
            <li>Her feedback is that the product is great but a bit expensive being that girls with long hair use more shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to it from sleeping at a friend&#x27;s house a few times and I fell in love with it because of the smell at first.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and this shampoo and conditioner is great for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Even after my first use, I was amazed at how soft and shiny my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>My hair seriously stayed amazing the whole two weeks with this shampoo and conditioner; it still smelled like I just washed it!</li>
            <li>When I blow dry my hair it is silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I trained my hair and am lucky enough to wash my hair almost every two weeks.</li>
            <li>My hair color stays vibrant.</li>
            <li>when I received my shampoo and conditioner the shampoo top was not on tightly and about 1/4 of the shampoo had leaked out into the box that it was sent in.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>around, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend the product!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:</li>
            <li>Adding the prompt delivery makes me highly recommend this seller and the product.</li>
            <li>These were a gift for my  Adult Daughters,  My opinion is that these items are Way Over Priced !!  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and managable and moisturized with as much time as I spend in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It is really worth the extra cost to me.</li>
            <li>It has a chemical smell, glossy sheen (instead of creamy matte), and does not absorb into the hair as it normally would.</li>
            <li>I have fairly normal hair however in the summer</li>
            <li>Product good, but pump was broken.</li>
            <li>, your hair will be soft and shiny and looking fabulous before long!</li>
            <li>So I had to find a new bottle for it, and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>was clearly ripped off!</li>
            <li>My first purchase was white while I had used it.</li>
            <li>Although consistency is like the original formula, the bottle is different, wording &amp; font size different, and no scent at all (doesn&#x27;t smell like original).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The differentiation was (1) this, and only this shampoo did not irritate my skin (i tried going back to cheaper versions but my skin wont let me) and (2) in the longer run it significantly improved the texture of my hair and slowed the hair</li>
            <li>My hair was really dry because of all the chemical products that I used in my hair, but this is amazing, it makes my hair so soft and silky without weighing them down.</li>
            <li>I have long, frizy hair that have a tendency to get oily and and flat easily.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I decided to clean it up and still use it because I was all out of my previous purchase of this product that had been bought at the salon.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner also makes your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>The one on my shampoo gets stuck frequently and I have to hold it with both hands and  use a lot of force to pump it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Moroccanoil products before and these were not the real thing, they are mixed with something.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not as pleased with the results at least for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner has completely saved my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair loves this stuff, it leaves my relaxed hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>So, the two bottles are sitting there while I try to decide what shampoo to try next if this Moroccanoil is, in fact, the real deal.  </li>
            <li>That is until my daughter (26 years old @ that time) told me about the Morroccan Line, &amp; I have never used anything else, nor would I.</li>
            <li>and I have a sensitive nose, doesn&#x27;t even bother me.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was open and it lick some product the bottle was not complete inside the plastic bag was full of the conditioner that get out of the bottle</li>
            <li>I mean really love it.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my scalp is becoming dried out and starting to hurt after about 3 washes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost every major shampoo and conditioner on the market and this was by far the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>me, there is no other hair care out there!</li>
            <li>When I started using it everyone noticed that it appeared healthier, shinier, with more body, I am in my 50&#x27;s and my hair is colored, stiff and dry.</li>
            <li>I have very fine delicate long hair</li>
            <li>No other product works like this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, once the small bottle was gone, i went back to regular brands for over an year and discovered that I was losing more hair.</li>
            <li>For extra shiny and soft results, I shampoo, and leave the conditioner in my hair for 5-7 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Then, my hair dried super fast (I air dry), I can&#x27;t even believe how fast it dried.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is not quite heavy enough for my super dry hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I have not found better still...</li>
            <li> I could not have chosen better products.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It is also safe for any hair extensions you may be wearing as well.</li>
            <li> The product I received sits on top of the hair - you can feel the oily coating.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for--I sure learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love the Moroccan products and the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the product, however, did not receive it until 3-4 weeks after my estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Simply the best!</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this shampoo ever since I tried it my salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair healthy and shiny.  </li>

            <li> please have them more in stocküôè</li>
            <li> i love moroccan oil products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Moroccan Oil&#x27;s hair oil</li>
            <li> I also love the shine it gives to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the ease of pumping the product vs pouring.</li>
            <li> I may have to start trying this stuff out myself :)</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner...</li>
            <li> So I just use at a screw off top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many comments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks since using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having all of my favorite  Moroccanoil hair products in one travel-size pouch.  </li>
            <li> and I fell in love with the results.</li>
            <li> Learned my lesson, I will not buy MoroccanOil from anywhere but in a reputable brick-and-mortar store or salon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> and I really love the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The trick is leaving the conditioner on your hair for 5 or more minutes.</li>
            <li> On this order,  I got the product made in Israel;  I like it better than the one made in Canada.</li>
            <li> Love Morrocan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner ...</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with Moroccanoil.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived OK...</li>
            <li> each pump had tape across the top and were in an unmarked box and then placed in a bubble envelope.  </li>
            <li> But i am glad i did.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil products--but there&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.</li>
            <li> I have never found any shampoo and conditioner I like better</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find this 16 ounce size anywhere except online, and it is a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell, so if you want a girlfriend, wife or some other king of partner with a good, pleasant and nice smell on her hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, good quality.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for someone with hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the way my hair feels after each use and mostly that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
            <li> expensive but great on  your hair and smells great - good price- love pump - can&#x27;t afford to get it all the time</li>
            <li> A very good product for your hair especially if you have chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, LOVE!!! :)</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY YES!!!</li>
            <li> The conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li> It makes my fine hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> After suing this product, almost immediately I could see and feel a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in how my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> the Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner is a fantastic compliment to their Oil.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It works great, especially when paired with the MoroccanOil Treatment.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and conditioner have the same great smell attributed with this product line.</li>
            <li> It started when I was in my late 20s, my best friend &amp; I would go to the neighborhood drugstore every Friday &amp; buy the latest thing so our hair (80s hair-</li>
            <li> Really !!!</li>
            <li> I swim 3 to 4 time a week and with my long hair this product is great for keeping my hair conditioned...</li>
            <li> I paid a lot more the first time I got it from the salon.</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s only fair to mention that I did not contact the seller about the issue since it wasn&#x27;t that important to</li>
            <li> The Salons charge far more for just one alone so thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> BUT most importantly the two younger teenagers have very fine and curly hair</li>
            <li> sometimes it comes with the oil @ a special price, so try to look for that deal.</li>
            <li> because not only does it smell good</li>
            <li> I am a true  Moroccanoil fan...</li>
            <li> the BIG 5-0 this year) would look good when we went out on the weekend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought their products from my salon for years, so I am sure these are not the real deal.</li>
            <li> Love moroccan oil products and really like the 16 oz sizes.  </li>
            <li> Super product.</li>
            <li> This product came quickly and was resonably priced.</li>
            <li> Enter my new favorite products, Moroccan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the real thing not a fake sold at many sites.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product when out of town and my original shampoo and conditioner for keratin treated hair did not make the flight.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and manageable, love this product</li>
            <li> BUT IT&#x27;S WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Who really thought that tossing liquid hair product in a box and scotch-taping the pump would be good enough??  </li>
            <li> It makes her hair extremely soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The product is pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It was worth it</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> They help define my curls, tame the frizz, and they smell great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the right product.  </li>
            <li> The containers are very large so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are getting ripped off when you buy it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing, I wish I had found it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smells, and the perfume in the product was so strong I had to give it away.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great, but the conditioner does not seem the same as when I have purchased it from a physical salon.</li>
            <li> This line is simply wonderful and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> first time user and</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon via KnA Beauty (noting this as there are many sellers of this same product on Amazon).</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Plus, my hair was so soft, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li> but it really repairs!</li>
            <li> Would love to get my money back!</li>
            <li> Styling is much easier!</li>
            <li> I instantly feel in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I first found out about this from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> My hair gets soft, very shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li> The pumps make it a lot easier to get the most out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem (which is a curly hair problem), is that the conditioner is used up much faster than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> My love affair with this product started after a salon incident - my scalp reacted to some product used in a salon in India and i ended up with severe skin rashes, itchiness that kept me awake at nights and lost a ton of my beautiful long and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I get compliments almost everyday about how shiny and soft my hair looks, and my hair dresser always asks how I keep it so healthy!!</li>
            <li> I personally use several of their products and i am very pleased with the quality and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We always have a doubt if they are real moroccanoil brand or any kind of similar brand, very well counterfeited, because we never see on the moroccanoil website a similar flask, special edition or other kind of information that allow a clear recognition of the origin of the product.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine blonde highlighted hair</li>
            <li> and it is hard to keep it in good shape.  </li>
            <li> When I want straight hair</li>
            <li> Really uncool.......</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go back to cheap products after using this.</li>
            <li> Helps hair so much.</li>
            <li> When I shampooed my eyes were burning from the smell and the product didn&#x27;t even smell like the real Moroccanoil should.  </li>
            <li> No way this is real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the real stuff from Ricky&#x27;s</li>
            <li> They are not the REAL product.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged and the combination of the product has really improved it&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> I am not losing as much hair as I was&lt;</li>
            <li> I always had very wavy &amp; course hair.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much money on shampoo and conditioner, however my friend kept insisting that I would not regret it</li>
            <li> I only use M, Moroccanoil and was delighted to see this product arrive and deliver the results I expected.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry, long hair that has chemical damage, this is probably a good choice for you.  </li>
            <li> and my extremely curly hair is much more manageable since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Having read some reviews for other sellers, I can confirm to you this is the authentic Motoccanoil.</li>
            <li> Her feedback is that the product is great but a bit expensive being that girls with long hair use more shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it from sleeping at a friend&#x27;s house a few times and I fell in love with it because of the smell at first.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and this shampoo and conditioner is great for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Even after my first use, I was amazed at how soft and shiny my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> My hair seriously stayed amazing the whole two weeks with this shampoo and conditioner; it still smelled like I just washed it!</li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair it is silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I trained my hair and am lucky enough to wash my hair almost every two weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair color stays vibrant.</li>
            <li> when I received my shampoo and conditioner the shampoo top was not on tightly and about 1/4 of the shampoo had leaked out into the box that it was sent in.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> around, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend the product!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:</li>
            <li> Adding the prompt delivery makes me highly recommend this seller and the product.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my  Adult Daughters,  My opinion is that these items are Way Over Priced !!  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and managable and moisturized with as much time as I spend in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It is really worth the extra cost to me.</li>
            <li> It has a chemical smell, glossy sheen (instead of creamy matte), and does not absorb into the hair as it normally would.</li>
            <li> I have fairly normal hair however in the summer</li>
            <li> Product good, but pump was broken.</li>
            <li> , your hair will be soft and shiny and looking fabulous before long!</li>
            <li> So I had to find a new bottle for it, and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> was clearly ripped off!</li>
            <li> My first purchase was white while I had used it.</li>
            <li> Although consistency is like the original formula, the bottle is different, wording &amp; font size different, and no scent at all (doesn&#x27;t smell like original).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The differentiation was (1) this, and only this shampoo did not irritate my skin (i tried going back to cheaper versions but my skin wont let me) and (2) in the longer run it significantly improved the texture of my hair and slowed the hair</li>
            <li> My hair was really dry because of all the chemical products that I used in my hair, but this is amazing, it makes my hair so soft and silky without weighing them down.</li>
            <li> I have long, frizy hair that have a tendency to get oily and and flat easily.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I decided to clean it up and still use it because I was all out of my previous purchase of this product that had been bought at the salon.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner also makes your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> The one on my shampoo gets stuck frequently and I have to hold it with both hands and  use a lot of force to pump it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Moroccanoil products before and these were not the real thing, they are mixed with something.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not as pleased with the results at least for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner has completely saved my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff, it leaves my relaxed hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> So, the two bottles are sitting there while I try to decide what shampoo to try next if this Moroccanoil is, in fact, the real deal.  </li>
            <li> That is until my daughter (26 years old @ that time) told me about the Morroccan Line, &amp; I have never used anything else, nor would I.</li>
            <li> and I have a sensitive nose, doesn&#x27;t even bother me.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was open and it lick some product the bottle was not complete inside the plastic bag was full of the conditioner that get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I mean really love it.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my scalp is becoming dried out and starting to hurt after about 3 washes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost every major shampoo and conditioner on the market and this was by far the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> me, there is no other hair care out there!</li>
            <li> When I started using it everyone noticed that it appeared healthier, shinier, with more body, I am in my 50&#x27;s and my hair is colored, stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> I have very fine delicate long hair</li>
            <li> No other product works like this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, once the small bottle was gone, i went back to regular brands for over an year and discovered that I was losing more hair.</li>
            <li> For extra shiny and soft results, I shampoo, and leave the conditioner in my hair for 5-7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Then, my hair dried super fast (I air dry), I can&#x27;t even believe how fast it dried.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is not quite heavy enough for my super dry hair</li>
            <li> (If you have used moroccanoil moisture repair before on coarse or dry hair, you may have noticed how well it absorbs into the hair when you apply it - as if you barely put conditioner on at all.</li>
            <li> The large bottles are about the same price as I would have paid for the small bottles in the salon.</li>
            <li> use it only twice a week though because it makes it too flat otherwise.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pump bottles don&#x27;t dispense very much at a time</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick but regular hair texture</li>
            <li> The smell was entirely different and the shampoo and conditioner left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real thing or not....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive Moroccan Oil, not sure what it really was.</li>
            <li> It is a true game changer for hair care products where I am concerned.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it took a very long time to get my product from this seller.</li>
            <li> If you have dry curly hair this is the only product worh using.  </li>
            <li> After multiple colorings, sun exposure, pool exposure, and styling tools, my hair had some dry and damaged areas.  </li>
            <li> This time i gave in since all other shampoos were irritating my skin, and bought the smallest bottle available.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for a long time now</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy but frizzy hair  which has been chemically treated over the years.</li>
            <li> My friend has blonde hair, and she uses the &#x27;extra volume&#x27; because she found the regular was too heavy for her hair.</li>
            <li> Only takes a little bit to get the job done so these will last you a while.</li>
            <li> I lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> The products effect on other hair type might be different.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive however worth it!</li>
            <li> but it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Make my hair so dry because it was for repair not for hydrating.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on my dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I have thinning dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and unmanagable...</li>
            <li> Very expensive, but this price was the lowest that I have been able to find yet.</li>
            <li> Very very very dry.  </li>
            <li> : It weighs my hair down and makes it flat</li>
            <li> I tease my hair, I do different hairstyles constantly, and I see the least amount of breakage with this shampoo and conditioner compared to anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> However, I have a short bob, and find it too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> It may be expensive but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The box was crushed but the product seemed unharmed</li>
            <li> Eventually, gave in and spent a fortune on this set.</li>
            <li> (I use only a dime sized amount for my long thick hair and wash it out immediately).  </li>
            <li> I spend a fortune in getting my hair colored and this shampoo makes the color last for at least twice as long as the other shampoos</li>
            <li> Been using these for years now and every time I try anything new, no matter how expensive, I alway go back to these as do my three daughters.  </li>
            <li> I have used other kinds</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Moroccanoil shampoo/conditioner is being sold here as other reviewers have commented.</li>
            <li> Detangles and smells wonderful,doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy like other shampoos I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 years</li>
            <li> Among other things, she, again, recommended the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Ofcourse there&#x27;s the fragrance etc, but you can get that in other products.</li>
            <li> Over a period of time, i feel like the washes last longer - i usually had to wash my hair</li>
            <li> While these are expensive they work really well</li>
            <li> It is fake, not the real deal, i waisted my money</li>
            <li> At least I am not the only one with that impression.  </li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews it seems like this problem was not unique to me.</li>
            <li> After a few hours after blow drying my hair my hair becomes oily and extremely itchy..  </li>
            <li> Rinsing with cold water is another little trick to help your hair keep the nutrients from the conditioner absorbed into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I USE ALL OF THE TREATMENTS ON MY HAIR I&#x27;M ALL SO BLACK.</li>
            <li> : I mentioned my experience to my stylist, and she told me Moroccanoil isn&#x27;t supposed to be sold anywhere but a real salon, and that other places offering it usually are selling a diluted or fake version.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use it with the little bottle of oil that you leave in for a finishing touch</li>
            <li> so the little pump took some time getting use to.</li>
            <li> I just felt lazy this time, I was ordering other stuff from Amazon anyway</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> My eldest daughter has very thick and coarse hair and LOVES it.  </li>
            <li> only thing is the pump was broken on the shampoo...</li>
            <li> An added bonus is it have fatty acids and proteins that helps hair growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning it</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I prefer to pay less on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have really bad oily hair, and i have tried many expensive salon shampoos and this one is the winner.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product, my hair has broken and dry.  </li>
            <li> Usually it takes me hours</li>
            <li> I usually buy the 33 oz.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it in liter size</li>
            <li> Yeah, it is slightly expensive, but it lasts me a really long time</li>
            <li> I really recommend it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin....to start off my rant, the product came poorly wrapped and half spilled in the baggy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that for such an expensive product such little care was taken to ensure that they would arrive in tact at their destination.</li>
            <li> Filing a complaint now.</li>
            <li> Will file complaint re:</li>
            <li> I have a lot of gray in my shoulder length, fairly thick hair, which now makes my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other expensive brands like Aveda, Bumble and Bumble, and Wen</li>
            <li> Not a big deal just disappointed the product isn&#x27;t as ordered</li>
            <li> the product does not smell like the initial product purchased from the other vendor and my hair is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Bottle pump tops were both broke off and it appears the bottles were not completely full...very disappointed and will never buy again....</li>
            <li> When my shampoo and conditioner arrived, it was packaged so poorly, the pump nozzles on both had broken off.</li>
            <li> Shipping kinda sucked since both pumps were broken.</li>
            <li> The pump on my shampoo came to me broken.</li>
            <li> Plus, packaging was poor, product leaked out in the bag...</li>
            <li> The pump head on the conditioner came broken.  </li>
            <li> I just received my product and the shampoo bottle&#x27;s pump is broken.</li>
            <li> Both pumps on the bottles were broken when they arrived.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 4 stars because when I received the products the pumps were broken, so I have to pour out the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> arrived broken and was spilling out.  </li>
            <li> atleast every other day to avoid bad hair days.</li>
            <li> I ordered hydrating shampoo and condetioner they send wrong item</li>
            <li> This is wrong in the smell, consistency, etc.</li>
            <li> These products are FAKE.</li>
            <li> Unless my symptoms are due to an allergic reaction and I am an exception, I would say this is the worst product on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed that the shampoo pump was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> it was weird!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fuming mad.</li>
            <li> Horrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have absolutly nothing bad to say about any of the Moroccan oil shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> awful</li>
            <li> My hair looks terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have dry curly hair this is the only product worh using.  When I want straight hair I use the oil and if I want curly I use the lotion.  The products are the best on the market!</li>
            <li> I have used these products and they are wonderful.  leave my hair clean, shiny and they smell so good.  these products make any problem hair look much better</li>
            <li> I have a lot of gray in my shoulder length, fairly thick hair, which now makes my hair frizzy.  Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner make a big difference.  When I blow dry my hair it is silky and smooth.  It is really worth the extra cost to me.</li>
            <li> While these are expensive they work really well and my extremely curly hair is much more manageable since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> Make my hair so dry because it was for repair not for hydrating. I ordered hydrating shampoo and condetioner they send wrong item</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and manageable, love this product</li>
            <li> Now we are talking! It took me forever to finally find a 5 stair hair product! This one is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M IN LOVE WITH MOROCCANOIL. I USE ALL OF THE TREATMENTS ON MY HAIR I&#x27;M ALL SO BLACK. IT COST ALOT BUT IT&#x27;S WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell and is very moisturizing. If you have extremely dry, long hair that has chemical damage, this is probably a good choice for you.  However, I have a short bob, and find it too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> These products keep your hair looking good and feeling good. Highly recommend these products. Keeps your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Bottle pump tops were both broke off and it appears the bottles were not completely full...very disappointed and will never buy again....awful</li>
            <li> I have used other kinds but I always find myself coming back to the Morccanoil brand. I also used the Moroccanoil treatment. Great products!</li>
            <li> Love these. They help define my curls, tame the frizz, and they smell great. The pumps make it a lot easier to get the most out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem (which is a curly hair problem), is that the conditioner is used up much faster than the shampoo. Maybe make the conditioner bottle bigger?</li>
            <li> when I received my shampoo and conditioner the shampoo top was not on tightly and about 1/4 of the shampoo had leaked out into the box that it was sent in. The conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is persnickety.  It doesn&#x27;t like anything but Moroccan Oil.  I have never been able to find this 16 ounce size anywhere except online, and it is a pretty good deal.  The pump comes in handy, too.</li>
            <li> Great product.  use it only twice a week though because it makes it too flat otherwise.  I use it with the little bottle of oil that you leave in for a finishing touch</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine blonde highlighted hair and this is my favorite shampoo and conditioner! Gives you body and shine! Conditioner is not quite heavy enough for my super dry hair but I have not found better still...</li>
            <li> Just received this product.!!</li>
            <li> This product was used and also recommended by my girlfriend&#x27;s hairdresser. She is very satisfied with its results and also the price.</li>
            <li> I am a transitioning from permed hair. I purchased these because of the reviews and i ust say I did ot make a mistake.  I could not have chosen better products.  This line is simply wonderful and a little goes a long way.  I wash my hair with biotin shampoo before using these and I only need one pump of the shampoo and maybe 2-3 of the conditioner to cover all my hair as it is mid-back length.&lt;br /&gt;I intent on having these in my regular regimen.</li>
            <li> I think these products do a great job on my hair. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 from me, is because the despenser snapped off before arriving to our home. So I had to find a new bottle for it, and I don&#x27;t like that. Other than that, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Came 2 days before its delivery date and I&#x27;m fairly happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real thing or not....first time user and this dries my hair out and smells like a ton of perfume</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smells, and the perfume in the product was so strong I had to give it away.</li>
            <li> My hair was really dry because of all the chemical products that I used in my hair, but this is amazing, it makes my hair so soft and silky without weighing them down. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I swim 3 to 4 time a week and with my long hair this product is great for keeping my hair conditioned...</li>
            <li> When my shampoo and conditioner arrived, it was packaged so poorly, the pump nozzles on both had broken off. Really uncool.......</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just as described.</li>
            <li> I have absolutly nothing bad to say about any of the Moroccan oil shampoos and conditioners.  This product has been the best thing EVER for my hair.  I have very fine delicate long hair and it is hard to keep it in good shape.  When I started using this product, my hair has broken and dry.  After suing this product, almost immediately I could see and feel a huge difference.  Over a short period of time, my hair dresser was impressed with the excellent condition of my hair and how healthy it was.  My hair has never looked healthier and it feels great!  It is also safe for any hair extensions you may be wearing as well. I will never stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Moroccanoil shampoo/conditioner is being sold here as other reviewers have commented. I do want to review the product, which I got at my salon. This stuff is wonderful! It also smells really great! I use it because I like the fragrance and because it protects my hair dye job. Regular shampoos will strip the color out of your hair, necessitating quicker trips back to the salon (or box!) to refresh your color. This shampoo/conditioner also makes your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon via KnA Beauty (noting this as there are many sellers of this same product on Amazon). The shampoo is great, but the conditioner does not seem the same as when I have purchased it from a physical salon. It has a chemical smell, glossy sheen (instead of creamy matte), and does not absorb into the hair as it normally would. (If you have used moroccanoil moisture repair before on coarse or dry hair, you may have noticed how well it absorbs into the hair when you apply it - as if you barely put conditioner on at all. The product I received sits on top of the hair - you can feel the oily coating.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumps aren&#x27;t very good quality either. The one on my shampoo gets stuck frequently and I have to hold it with both hands and  use a lot of force to pump it. I bought the versions with pumps so it would be easier to use the large-size bottle, but this defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I mentioned my experience to my stylist, and she told me Moroccanoil isn&#x27;t supposed to be sold anywhere but a real salon, and that other places offering it usually are selling a diluted or fake version. You get what you pay for--I sure learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing not a fake sold at many sites.  You won&#x27;t go back to cheap products after using this.</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo and conditioner.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Love the Moroccan products and the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the product, however, did not receive it until 3-4 weeks after my estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Product is ok.&lt;br /&gt;But just for transportation purpose, the pack could have some external device to block the pump up/down movement.&lt;br /&gt;The way it is, with just an internal twist device to open/close, it opens by itselt during transportation, and outpours product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Simply the best! Shipping kinda sucked since both pumps were broken.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, so if you want a girlfriend, wife or some other king of partner with a good, pleasant and nice smell on her hair. Buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We always have a doubt if they are real moroccanoil brand or any kind of similar brand, very well counterfeited, because we never see on the moroccanoil website a similar flask, special edition or other kind of information that allow a clear recognition of the origin of the product. However, it works great anyhow.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for a long time now and it never disappoints! Great price for the set !!!! The Salons charge far more for just one alone so thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this shampoo ever since I tried it my salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that the shampoo pump was broken when I received it but It&#x27;s only fair to mention that I did not contact the seller about the issue since it wasn&#x27;t that important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good value for the quantity and quality.</li>
            <li> Very good products. They deliver on the advertised qualities.  Like the way my hair feels after I use them I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> i received this in an unmarked box and i compared it with the one at the store... It is fake, not the real deal, i waisted my money</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The pump on my shampoo came to me broken. Not a big deal just disappointed the product isn&#x27;t as ordered</li>
            <li> Where do I begin....to start off my rant, the product came poorly wrapped and half spilled in the baggy. Who really thought that tossing liquid hair product in a box and scotch-taping the pump would be good enough??  Anyway, I decided to clean it up and still use it because I was all out of my previous purchase of this product that had been bought at the salon. The pump broke. Nonetheless, I unscrewed the pump and smeared some of the shampoo onto my hands and it was an entirely different color...somewhat of a peachy shade. My first purchase was white while I had used it. When I looked at the label it had Hebrew writing on it. The smell was entirely different and the shampoo and conditioner left my hair dry and brittle. Total knockoff!  Don&#x27;t do business with this vendor!</li>
            <li> expensive but great on  your hair and smells great - good price- love pump - can&#x27;t afford to get it all the time</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells like mothballs... it was weird!</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair healthy and shiny.  It smells AMAZING!  I absolutely LOVE this product.  It&#x27;s a must buy.</li>
            <li> the Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner is a fantastic compliment to their Oil.  It leaves the hair feeling smooth and silky‚Ä¶and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Super product. Helps hair so much.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used! I was introduced to it from sleeping at a friend&#x27;s house a few times and I fell in love with it because of the smell at first. Then, my hair dried super fast (I air dry), I can&#x27;t even believe how fast it dried. Usually it takes me hours but it took maybe 30 minutes, MAYBE. Plus, my hair was so soft, silky, and smooth. My hair smelled amazing for days. I trained my hair and am lucky enough to wash my hair almost every two weeks. My hair seriously stayed amazing the whole two weeks with this shampoo and conditioner; it still smelled like I just washed it! I tease my hair, I do different hairstyles constantly, and I see the least amount of breakage with this shampoo and conditioner compared to anything I have ever used. Yeah, it is slightly expensive, but it lasts me a really long time considering I don&#x27;t wash my hair that often, but still. I recommend it to everyone. It is a MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my hair.  I have curly hair and like to straighten it, this product keeps it from drying out</li>
            <li> I love it love it please have them more in stocküôè</li>
            <li> i love moroccan oil products. a was a good price. and my skin.. your products are great for my hair</li>
            <li> I LOVE Moroccan Oil&#x27;s hair oil so I thought I would give the shampoo and conditioner a try.  I have tried almost every major shampoo and conditioner on the market and this was by far the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: I love the smell and it detangles my hair perfectly.  I also love the shine it gives to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It weighs my hair down and makes it flat (I use only a dime sized amount for my long thick hair and wash it out immediately).  After a few hours after blow drying my hair my hair becomes oily and extremely itchy..  I have also noticed that my scalp is becoming dried out and starting to hurt after about 3 washes.  After reading everyone else&#x27;s wonderful reviews its got me puzzled.  Unless my symptoms are due to an allergic reaction and I am an exception, I would say this is the worst product on the market.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was open and it lick some product the bottle was not complete inside the plastic bag was full of the conditioner that get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> .I was so grateful to find theses larger bottles with pumps.I used to be a hairdresser and I love the ease of pumping the product vs pouring.It is a good product for damaged hair</li>
            <li> This brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner are awesome!!! I really recommend it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday gift. She loves this stuff and says she will never use anything else. It makes her hair extremely soft and healthy looking. It may be expensive but it is worth the price. The containers are very large so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are getting ripped off when you buy it. I may have to start trying this stuff out myself :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the right product.  My hair looks terrible. Very very very dry.  It seems we have a problem here. At least I am not the only one with that impression.  Any way, we could get our money back?</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner...only thing is the pump was broken on the shampoo...boo!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on my dry damaged hair I heard some review this on YouTube and I figured maybe I&#x27;ll give it a try. best decision I made because not only does it smell good but it really repairs! My hair is no longer dry and brittle. An added bonus is it have fatty acids and proteins that helps hair growth. Definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Moroccanoil products before and these were not the real thing, they are mixed with something.  When I shampooed my eyes were burning from the smell and the product didn&#x27;t even smell like the real Moroccanoil should.  Plus, packaging was poor, product leaked out in the bag...</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my  Adult Daughters,  My opinion is that these items are Way Over Priced !!  Really !!! As I said, they were gifts .</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is fabulous.  The pump head on the conditioner came broken.  So I just use at a screw off top.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing! I&#x27;ve gotten many comments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks since using this product. Love the smell too! The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it took a very long time to get my product from this seller. The product itself would get five stars. Would definitely recommend to women of color.</li>
            <li> The bottles lasted me over a year and I sometimes will take two showers a day as I work out in the morning and evening during race season. I love the smell, the way my hair feels after each use and mostly that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having all of my favorite  Moroccanoil hair products in one travel-size pouch.  I am a true  Moroccanoil fan...</li>
            <li> I first used this product when out of town and my original shampoo and conditioner for keratin treated hair did not make the flight. A salon in Manhattan recommended this and I fell in love with the results. You can go much longer between keratin treatments as this had an incredible smoothing and no frizz effect. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Everything I have said about this spectacular product  is trueI - I will continue using the shampoo and conditioner for many years to come!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Moroccanoil for years! It&#x27;s a great smelling shampoo and a conditioner that really moisturizes and helps hair be more manageable! I&#x27;ve tried other expensive brands like Aveda, Bumble and Bumble, and Wen and I&#x27;m not as pleased with the results at least for my hair type. I have long, wavy but frizzy hair  which has been chemically treated over the years. I received the product within couple of days. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and service. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Product good, but pump was broken.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and works great on processed hair.  My color does not fade and it works great with a Brazilian Blowout.  Or course at Amazon prices!</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner has completely saved my hair. I will not use anything else. I get compliments almost everyday about how shiny and soft my hair looks, and my hair dresser always asks how I keep it so healthy!! You need to get both the shampoo and conditioner, and also the oil!!! It will save your hair!! (I have brown hair, and I can use the regular shampoo and conditioner. My friend has blonde hair, and she uses the &#x27;extra volume&#x27; because she found the regular was too heavy for her hair. So if you have blonde hair, get the &#x27;extra volume&#x27;!!!)</li>
            <li> im use to the larger size so the little pump took some time getting use to. with larger bottles i only needed 1-2 pumps with this i need about 4 but this stuff is amazing and very happy how well it was packed and shipped</li>
            <li> No way this is real. I&#x27;ve purchased the real stuff from Ricky&#x27;s which is 100% legit. This is wrong in the smell, consistency, etc. I&#x27;m fuming mad. Learned my lesson, I will not buy MoroccanOil from anywhere but in a reputable brick-and-mortar store or salon. I just felt lazy this time, I was ordering other stuff from Amazon anyway so I decided to add this. Filing a complaint now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I discovered it while in Egypt and would not consider using anything else. Nothing follows</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for someone with hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> A very good product for your hair especially if you have chemically treated hair.  Would purchase from this sell again!</li>
            <li> These products are FAKE. They are not the REAL product. Although consistency is like the original formula, the bottle is different, wording &amp; font size different, and no scent at all (doesn&#x27;t smell like original).&lt;br /&gt;I was clearly ripped off! Will file complaint re: the company that I received it from. Will return asap!</li>
            <li> I am in love with Moroccan oil. I have been using the shampoo/conditioner, and recently started using the oil. I love the shampoo/conditioner and the oil has been a great addition as well. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Horrible waste of money! Didn&#x27;t receive Moroccan Oil, not sure what it really was. Would love to get my money back!</li>
            <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This product came quickly and was resonably priced. I would recommend purchasing from you for any one! I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil for over a year now and I really love the product.  My hair was damaged and the combination of the product has really improved it&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I was using only the oil when drying my hair.  Now I&#x27;m using the shampoo &amp; conditioner as well.  Even my husband commented how good my hair looked.  It feels amazing and smells, well, you know, that great Moroccan oil scent.  Best buy was at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love how this stuff smells and feels! It makes my fine hair smooth and shiny. Only takes a little bit to get the job done so these will last you a while. My only complaint is that the pump bottles don&#x27;t dispense very much at a time so I have to do 5 pumps or so to get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells good and also great for oily hair. I have really bad oily hair, and i have tried many expensive salon shampoos and this one is the winner.</li>
            <li> excelent. just in time</li>
            <li> I love this product. I mean really love it. I have long thick hair. I wash my hair with the shampoo twice then condition my hair by leaving the conditioner on for 5 minute each time. My hair gets soft, very shinny and smooth. No other product works like this one. I know, I think I&#x27;ve tried them all. The trick is leaving the conditioner on your hair for 5 or more minutes.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and full - Love this product!! You only need a little bit and it smells wonderful. Totally recommend it</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this product.  I have been using it for over a year.  On this order,  I got the product made in Israel;  I like it better than the one made in Canada.</li>
            <li> the containers leaked in the carton....</li>
            <li> Love this product! You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product. I lasts a long time! My hair color stays vibrant.</li>
            <li> What a difference this product makes on your hair.  I have thinning dry hair.  This has made a huge difference in how my hair looks.  Styling is much easier!</li>
            <li> Detangles and smells wonderful,doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy like other shampoos I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 years and I won&#x27;t use any I the shampoo..</li>
            <li> Love Morrocan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner ... I won&#x27;t use anything else in my hair.  It keeps my hair soft and managable and moisturized with as much time as I spend in the sun.  The large bottles are about the same price as I would have paid for the small bottles in the salon.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells! I purchased this for my wife as a gift and she loves it! It works great, especially when paired with the MoroccanOil Treatment. It&#x27;s been placed on my list of &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34; gift items.</li>
            <li> Then only shampoo/conditioner I use now. Also use their oil. When I started using it everyone noticed that it appeared healthier, shinier, with more body, I am in my 50&#x27;s and my hair is colored, stiff and dry. This is the only product that helps keep my hair looking, acting and feeling like it belongs to a 20 something and a menopausal woman.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff, it leaves my relaxed hair so soft and manageable. But I never received this package so I bought it from Ricky&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product back on May 11, 2012.  About 1/2 is left in the bottles.  My initial purchase of this product was from another vendor in November 2011 and I fell in love with Moroccanoil.  In an effort to cut cost along with getting a larger size, I went with this vendor.  The product arrived OK...each pump had tape across the top and were in an unmarked box and then placed in a bubble envelope.  The box was crushed but the product seemed unharmed so I thought nothing of it.  For quite sometime I&#x27;ve thought it was me...the product does not smell like the initial product purchased from the other vendor and my hair is horrible.  It&#x27;s dry and unmanagable...it&#x27;s almost like I had washed it with detergent.  In frustration I recently asked a friend to give it a try and she had the same reaction...almost no smell to the product and no healthy-hair feeling you should get from Moroccanoil.  So, the two bottles are sitting there while I try to decide what shampoo to try next if this Moroccanoil is, in fact, the real deal.  Anyone have a product and vendor recommendation?</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to this product in the salon. However, i didn&#x27;t buy the product for the longest time since the skeptic in me always believed that salon products dont necessarily deserve the price tag. My love affair with this product started after a salon incident - my scalp reacted to some product used in a salon in India and i ended up with severe skin rashes, itchiness that kept me awake at nights and lost a ton of my beautiful long and very thick hair. Once i was back, i went to my stylist to get her opinion on what i should use. Among other things, she, again, recommended the shampoo. This time i gave in since all other shampoos were irritating my skin, and bought the smallest bottle available. Oh! Did i love it! Ofcourse there&#x27;s the fragrance etc, but you can get that in other products. The differentiation was (1) this, and only this shampoo did not irritate my skin (i tried going back to cheaper versions but my skin wont let me) and (2) in the longer run it significantly improved the texture of my hair and slowed the hair fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, once the small bottle was gone, i went back to regular brands for over an year and discovered that I was losing more hair. Eventually, gave in and spent a fortune on this set. But i am glad i did. I&#x27;ve been using this for an year now and here&#x27;s a list of things that will make me buy this over and over again&lt;br /&gt;- Hair texture has improved significantly&lt;br /&gt;- I am not losing as much hair as I was&lt;br /&gt;- I spend a fortune in getting my hair colored and this shampoo makes the color last for at least twice as long as the other shampoos&lt;br /&gt;- Over a period of time, i feel like the washes last longer - i usually had to wash my hair atleast every other day to avoid bad hair days. With this shampoo, i&#x27;ve regularly avoided washing hair for 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only deterrent is the price. I am constantly looking for deals. I think the best is to buy the 32 oz set.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the product!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have long, frizy hair that have a tendency to get oily and and flat easily. The products effect on other hair type might be different.</li>
            <li> I am a hair treatment junkie. It started when I was in my late 20s, my best friend &amp; I would go to the neighborhood drugstore every Friday &amp; buy the latest thing so our hair (80s hair- yes, I turned the BIG 5-0 this year) would look good when we went out on the weekend. I always had very wavy &amp; course hair. I had always wanted to wear my hair longer but my hair was \\&quot;too big\\&quot;. I tried everything over the last 28 years with varying results. That is until my daughter (26 years old @ that time) told me about the Morroccan Line, &amp; I have never used anything else, nor would I. For the 1st time in my 50 years I have shoulder length hair that is silky, shiny &amp; BEAUTIFUL, even if I do say so myself. This stuff is truly amazing, I wish I had found it a long time ago. Yes, it is a little pricey but it lasts a very long time. Also it is your hair, \\&quot;Your crowning Glory\\&quot; my hair stylist says, so to me it&#x27;s worth every penny. I usually buy the 33 oz. set and sometimes it comes with the oil @ a special price, so try to look for that deal. Would I reccommend this product????? ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY YES!!! TREAT YOURSELF-- you&#x27;ll be so happy you did!!!!</li>
            <li> I only use M, Moroccanoil and was delighted to see this product arrive and deliver the results I expected. Having read some reviews for other sellers, I can confirm to you this is the authentic Motoccanoil. Adding the prompt delivery makes me highly recommend this seller and the product.</li>
            <li> I have used the Moroccan Oil Hair Care line for going on two years.  As someone who is always on the go, I was constantly not treating my hair as well as I should.  After multiple colorings, sun exposure, pool exposure, and styling tools, my hair had some dry and damaged areas.  Enter my new favorite products, Moroccan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the addition or Argan Oil and Keratin, which is in Moroccan Oil products, your hair will be soft and shiny and looking fabulous before long! Even after my first use, I was amazed at how soft and shiny my hair looked.  It is a true game changer for hair care products where I am concerned.  For extra shiny and soft results, I shampoo, and leave the conditioner in my hair for 5-7 minutes.  Rinsing with cold water is another little trick to help your hair keep the nutrients from the conditioner absorbed into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, there is no other hair care out there!</li>
            <li> I just received my product and the shampoo bottle&#x27;s pump is broken. I don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning it and I can&#x27;t seem to find the pump to but separately anywhere. What a nuisance...</li>
            <li> Both pumps on the bottles were broken when they arrived. After reading some other reviews it seems like this problem was not unique to me. It was insufficiently packaged to protect the pumps. I&#x27;m disappointed that for such an expensive product such little care was taken to ensure that they would arrive in tact at their destination.</li>
            <li> This product was used on my hair at a salon.  I instantly feel in love with it.  It makes my hair smell so good.  The product is pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil products--but there&#x27;s a problem. THIS IS NOT MOROCCANOIL. I&#x27;ve bought their products from my salon for years, so I am sure these are not the real deal. Different texture, different consistency, different smell, different results. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Been using these for years now and every time I try anything new, no matter how expensive, I alway go back to these as do my three daughters.  The smell is heavenly but mostly the shampoo and conditioner are wonderful.  My eldest daughter has very thick and coarse hair and LOVES it.  I have pretty thick but regular hair texture and it works perfectly for me.  BUT most importantly the two younger teenagers have very fine and curly hair and this is mandatory for combing it out after their daily shower.  I usually buy it in liter size x 3.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner! Besides making my hair more manageable, it smells Wonderful and I have a sensitive nose, doesn&#x27;t even bother me. 2nd time I have bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This smells great, and also does a great job on making your hair soft as silk, and fully manageable. I first found out about this from my hairdresser. And my hair is color treated, &amp; it&#x27;s very safe for that. Very expensive, but this price was the lowest that I have been able to find yet.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Makes my hair feel healthy and smells great, too!</li>
            <li> Greatest shampoo and conditioner ever. I paid a lot more the first time I got it from the salon. It was worth it but I prefer to pay less on Amazon! I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I keep ordering it.....I have never found any shampoo and conditioner I like better so I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> good product for the hair, my wife like it.</li>
            <li> great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
            <li> Great item , at a great price</li>
            <li> one of the bottles broke during shipment</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much money on shampoo and conditioner, however my friend kept insisting that I would not regret it and I&#x27;m glad I did! I love the way it smells and leaves my hair. I didn&#x27;t give it 4 stars because when I received the products the pumps were broken, so I have to pour out the shampoo and conditioner. Other than that, LOVE!!! :)</li>
            <li> Love moroccan oil products and really like the 16 oz sizes.  You only need a small amount and this shampoo and conditioner is great for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend and she loves it. The Shampoo and conditioner have the same great smell attributed with this product line. Her feedback is that the product is great but a bit expensive being that girls with long hair use more shampoo and conditioner. I personally use several of their products and i am very pleased with the quality and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bit of a issue with shipping the product arrived broken and was spilling out.  The seller told me to just reorder but they were not specific as to what they would do to fix the situation that occurred. I don&#x27;t want to spend 95 buck to find out if they will refund my money or discount the product.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo and Conditioner! It is a bit expensive however worth it! I have fairly normal hair however in the summer it  can be frizzy depending on the humidity. This product smells wonderful and makes my hair silky and smooth! Worth the buy. The product came in a timely manner and in good shape.</li>
            <li> the product arrived on time. I does wonders for my hair!!!! I will recomend this product for anybody who has freezy hair</li>
