    <ol>
            <li>Very impressed with the quality, gentleness and still the ability to cleanse.  </li>
            <li>This soap is just perfect...</li>
            <li>Smells good!</li>
            <li>GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t read the ingredients, but what they list sounds great.</li>
            <li>Which makes me happy.</li>
            <li>And it smells great.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent and HEALTHY handsoap.  </li>
            <li>so soft and creamy,  delightful aroma,  perfect for guest bathroom</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a good smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good, but would have liked the scent to be a bit stronger.</li>
            <li>This hand soap smells great and leaves my hands feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>The soap is nice with a lovely, mellow scent!</li>
            <li>I know that I can make my own foam soap just by using this container.</li>
            <li>Nice hand soap.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell....</li>
            <li>Some reviewer had mentioned that it didn&#x27;t seem very strong and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>super citrus smell - good stuff</li>
            <li>I will always purchase this hand cleanser as it is non-drying like those in the stores and you can reuse the foaming bottle to make more foaming cleaner if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t this sound nice and healthy?  </li>
            <li>Love the citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>It has an absolutely delightful scent, but it isn&#x27;t overly perfumed and is just enough to give you that lovely whiff of a scent as you use it but not afterwards.  </li>
            <li>What more could a person want?  </li>
            <li>But this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>And heck, all it has to do is clean my face!</li>
            <li>Definitely a great bunch of natural products.</li>
            <li>Very nice, light citrus smell and rinses easily and completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is fine.</li>
            <li>So far so good,</li>
            <li>It is environmentally friendly and non-toxic.  </li>
            <li>Lathers well, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  </li>
            <li>Gets my hands clean</li>
            <li>This is not a moisturizing hand soap, but does leave you hands &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And honestly, this is completely middle-of-the-road:</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve made this our new handwash ... fresh, nice gentle ingredients.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re reusing a bottle to make your own foam soap once in a while you&#x27;re going to have to take it a part and actually wash it out because it will stick.</li>
            <li>Love the all natural formulation.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly the bottle is being depleted, given how little I use it and given that the foam doesn&#x27;t seam all that &#x27;soapy&#x27; and effective anyway.</li>
            <li>If contact and irritation occur, gently flush with water.</li>
            <li>It foams about average, it has a pleasant enough scent that doesn&#x27;t linger, and the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I think I would buy it again if it weren&#x27;t for the high cost.</li>
            <li>I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as most hand soaps are, and I wouldn&#x27;t have chosen it as hand soap if my hands got very dirty as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong</li>
            <li>So instead of buying a new one just take the parts apart and keep it going.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle enough for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing natural about this.</li>
            <li>it foams, not too much or too little.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an excellent and HEALTHY handsoap.  And you can order refill jugs to save money.  GREAT product.  Smells good!</li>
            <li> The soap is nice with a lovely, mellow scent!</li>
            <li> super citrus smell - good stuff</li>
            <li> I will always purchase this hand cleanser as it is non-drying like those in the stores and you can reuse the foaming bottle to make more foaming cleaner if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t this sound nice and healthy?  You can&#x27;t read the ingredients, but what they list sounds great. And look at all the things they&#x27;ve left out!  There&#x27;s a big however--this soap is a chemical bath. I received it today and thought others might want to know the actual ingredients from the back of the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sodium Methyl 2-Sulfolaurate, Disodium 2-Sulfolaurate,Cetyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Gluconolactone, Lauryl Lactyl Lactate, Sodium Benzoate,Natural (Jasmine &amp; Ylang Ylang) Fragrance, Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precautions: External use only. Keep this product out of reach from babies and children. Keep away from eyes. If contact and irritation occur, gently flush with water. If allergic reaction occurs cease use immediately and contact your  pediatrician or physician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this less than one star if I could.  Plus, it leaked in shipment.</li>
            <li> Usually I am not happy with foam soap. But this one is pretty good. I think I would buy it again if it weren&#x27;t for the high cost. I know that I can make my own foam soap just by using this container. So I will probably end up doing that as opposed to paying another five dollars for the small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine. It is not overbearing at all. Which makes me happy. And it&#x27;s a good smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I will note. When you&#x27;re reusing a bottle to make your own foam soap once in a while you&#x27;re going to have to take it a part and actually wash it out because it will stick. So instead of buying a new one just take the parts apart and keep it going.</li>

            <li> And it smells great.  My friends told me about it and I also got the all purpose cleaner and it cleans as well, if not better than the chemical based ones I have used for years.  Definitely a great bunch of natural products.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve made this our new handwash ... fresh, nice gentle ingredients.  Love the citrus scent.  Gets my hands clean and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to slather on a bunch of hand lotion afterward.  Love the all natural formulation.</li>
            <li> I like foaming soaps to wash my face with and I bought it for that reason. Some reviewer had mentioned that it didn&#x27;t seem very strong and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And honestly, this is completely middle-of-the-road: It foams about average, it has a pleasant enough scent that doesn&#x27;t linger, and the cost is reasonable.

            <li> All chemicals. Nothing natural about this. FALSE ADVERTISING!</li>
            <li> so soft and creamy,  delightful aroma,  perfect for guest bathroom</li>

It is environmentally friendly and non-toxic.  What more could a person want?  I&#x27;m buying it again and will use it as a staple in my house.</li>
            <li> This hand soap smells great and leaves my hands feeling very clean. I have a bottle stationed at every sink in the house.</li>
            <li> Number One Reason:  It is cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;Second Reason:  It is Vegan.&lt;br /&gt;Third Reason:  The ingredients listed.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
