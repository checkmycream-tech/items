            <li>Hauschka products on my skin for 15 years, and this is my favorite!!</li>
            <li>I buy it from amazon with a very nice discount</li>
            <li>but I knew it was good for my skin and</li>
            <li>I love this product;  can&#x27;t be without it!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing price .I</li>
            <li>There are so many chemicals in cosmetics that aren&#x27;t good for the skin.</li>
            <li>This caused more harm than good to my skin, and I wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
            <li>Look, noone is happy about getting old, but you can minimize the look of aging by taking good care of your skin.</li>
            <li>and it is very light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results from face scrubs and intensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Hauschka products</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the smell of the Day Cream in the beginning</li>
            <li>is because my husband still wishes the Hauschka prices were better .:)</li>
            <li>As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the Lavender Bath Essence to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  </li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels and looks in the morning.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I attribute this to a healthy lifestyle,  </li>
            <li>These two products are better than their eye serum.  </li>
            <li>and it works better than Dr. H.</li>
            <li>I love every product I&#x27;v tried in this line..</li>
            <li>And love your prices for these products.</li>
            <li>very clean and light serum.</li>
            <li>I was trying this out for fine eye wrinkles and forehead.</li>
            <li>I love this entire product line however this is not my favorite product of the line it does work nicely</li>
            <li>Do not buy this unless you can try it first and are 100% sure it works with your skin.</li>
            <li>At 57, I have tried more serums than I can count, from drugstore to very high end, and I have yet to find one that even comes close to Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Regenerating Serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear gel texture feels refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li>She smiled sheepishly at me and with pride she answered &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not wearing any I&#x27;m using Dr. H. &amp;#34; Since then I have never looked back.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and pure.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to put products on the top of and every little bit helps!</li>
            <li>It completely dehydrated my face, and accentuated fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Definately won&#x27;t be going back for more.</li>
            <li>Dr Hauschka&#x27;s Regenerating Serum and Regenerating Day Cream are fantastic for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable difference in the first couple days.</li>
            <li>This actually does what it says it will do and perhaps more.</li>
            <li>Most people assume that I&#x27;m 10 years younger</li>
            <li>She was in her 50s and the first thing out of my mouth was &amp;#34;Mother</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very lightweight</li>
            <li>This soothes and heals and makes my skin look much healthier than any product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line.</li>
            <li>I really like the Dr. Hasuschka products - and I like the way this feels after I put it onto my skin</li>
            <li>My skin is fair and sensitive to harsh products with chemicals.</li>
            <li>This product does help to slightly decrease fine lines, but I would not say it is worth the money to purchase it.</li>
            <li>So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF.</li>
            <li>It certainly made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>So many products say they will do this or that, and so few of them do.</li>
            <li>Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li>I used the trial packets from Whole Foods in the past and thought this investment would be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>My skin is improving and the price is way better than another organic product that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I actually developed a liking to the smell.</li>
            <li>buy mine here ,or my local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Do yourself and your skin a favor ,if not Hauschka products ,stick to natural and stay away from the Department store stuff .</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks toned.</li>
            <li>But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Hauschka products for 10 years and would never go back to high end Dept . store, overly priced, perfumed chemicals .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once a day and have observed noticeable differences in skin texture, lines around teh eyes reduced and general firming and toning.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before putting Rose cream over-the-top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really expecting &amp;#34;regeneration&amp;#34;, but it is a nice serum that makes for a smooth base for moisturizer.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not really expecting &amp;#34;regeneration&amp;#34;, but it is a nice serum that makes for a smooth base for moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin immediately went back to looking dull and older.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical since this seems ridiculously expensive but after using only 3 times I really noticed my skin felt better, it won&#x27;t erase wrinkles but it will bring a glow back</li>
            <li> It is expensive but lasts quite a while using recommended 1 pump a.m., 2 pumps p.m. and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> As soon as I use them up, I&#x27;m going back to the other products.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 59) should be treated with the Regenerating Serum and Cream, I plunked down the big bucks for those items.  </li>
            <li> The harsh chemicals in those things and the lies they sell along with them are doing nothing for your skin and simply emptying out your pocket books .</li>
            <li> Not as transformative as I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> Both are too expensive but worth a lot.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s not good for sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> does not make the skin shrink, like other serums do.</li>
            <li> And my daughter, who is 25 and battling some acne, is now using the other products, too.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m seeing as dramatic of results as I would like to see that I normally see with this line of products</li>
            <li> I expected to notice a difference in my skin after using this VERY expensive product but noticed nothing except my wallet is much lighter.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but you only use a few drops, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it leave a slightly sticky residue, I would usually put a small amount of lotion on after I let this soak it because of how it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> ( Really want to say crap)  </li>
            <li> Yes, this is an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> One bottle has lasted me three months so averaged out, it&#x27;s not too bad a deal.</li>
            <li> but I felt disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> a must have for night and day base.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> At 57, I have tried more serums than I can count, from drugstore to very high end, and I have yet to find one that even comes close to Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Regenerating Serum. It is expensive but lasts quite a while using recommended 1 pump a.m., 2 pumps p.m. and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I find that this product improves the texture of my skin. (I&#x27;m 59.) Dr. Hauschka uses a holistic approach to skin care, so the results are gradual.</li>
            <li> I expected to notice a difference in my skin after using this VERY expensive product but noticed nothing except my wallet is much lighter. Definately won&#x27;t be going back for more.</li>
            <li> very clean and light serum. does not make the skin shrink, like other serums do.</li>
            <li> a must have for night and day base.  Dr. H has no competition.</li>
            <li> This product does help to slightly decrease fine lines, but I would not say it is worth the money to purchase it. I&#x27;ve had better results from face scrubs and intensive moisturizer. It feels like it leave a slightly sticky residue, I would usually put a small amount of lotion on after I let this soak it because of how it felt on my skin. I was trying this out for fine eye wrinkles and forehead. It didn&#x27;t do anything for the forehead wrinkles, I took before and after pictures to compare. I love Dr. Hauschka products but I felt disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> This caused more harm than good to my skin, and I wasn&#x27;t able to return it. Do not buy this unless you can try it first and are 100% sure it works with your skin. I think it&#x27;s not good for sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of skin care products in my time. My skin is fair and sensitive to harsh products with chemicals. There are so many chemicals in cosmetics that aren&#x27;t good for the skin. Dr Hauschka&#x27;s Regenerating Serum and Regenerating Day Cream are fantastic for mature skin.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the smell of the Day Cream in the beginning but I knew it was good for my skin and the longer I used it I actually developed a liking to the smell. It smells clean and pure. I like the Holistic way.  Very good for the skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this entire product line however this is not my favorite product of the line it does work nicely and it is very light I use it every night before putting Rose cream over-the-top but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m seeing as dramatic of results as I would like to see that I normally see with this line of products still it is a nicer room it&#x27;s very lightweight it&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s very easy to put products on the top of and every little bit helps!</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in the first couple days.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hauschka products for 10 years and would never go back to high end Dept . store, overly priced, perfumed chemicals . The harsh chemicals in those things and the lies they sell along with them are doing nothing for your skin and simply emptying out your pocket books . This is an amazing price .I buy mine here ,or my local Whole Foods. Do yourself and your skin a favor ,if not Hauschka products ,stick to natural and stay away from the Department store stuff .( Really want to say crap)  And why I only gave it 4 stars instead of five ?is because my husband still wishes the Hauschka prices were better .:)</li>
            <li> So many products say they will do this or that, and so few of them do. This actually does what it says it will do and perhaps more. My skin is super sensitive. This soothes and heals and makes my skin look much healthier than any product I have ever tried. And trust me I&#x27;ve tried the lot of them!</li>
            <li> It is luxury and smells great. This is my second tube that I bought on amazon.  Very happy and buy again!</li>
            <li> Yes, this is an expensive product.  I&#x27;ve used it once a day and have observed noticeable differences in skin texture, lines around teh eyes reduced and general firming and toning. My skin feels soft and looks toned. One bottle has lasted me three months so averaged out, it&#x27;s not too bad a deal.</li>
            <li> This product has gotten some rave reviews- but I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience with this serum. It completely dehydrated my face, and accentuated fine lines.  Alcohol is listed as the second ingredient, so maybe that&#x27;s it. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line. So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF. As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the Lavender Bath Essence to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  Then cleaned with the cream in the morning, the milk at night.  At night, per her instructions, I only applied the Facial Toner and patted that in. In the morning, I applied the toner, then squirted a bit of Moisturizing Cream into palm and mixed that with 2 drops of the Normalizing Oil.  Within a week, people were complimenting me on my skin. I could see that it looked brighter, healthier, younger. But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine (I&#x27;m 59) should be treated with the Regenerating Serum and Cream, I plunked down the big bucks for those items.  My skin immediately went back to looking dull and older.  The serum leaves the skin feeling sticky; the cream reeks of mocha and doesn&#x27;t seem to add any moisture.  As soon as I use them up, I&#x27;m going back to the other products.  And my daughter, who is 25 and battling some acne, is now using the other products, too.  Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li> I love this product;  can&#x27;t be without it!  I have used nothing but Dr.Hauschka products on my skin for 15 years, and this is my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Not as transformative as I expected for the price.  My skin was actually irritated instead of soothed.  I used the trial packets from Whole Foods in the past and thought this investment would be worthwhile.  Don&#x27;t see any advantage.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! You can feel your face tighten up as soon as you apply.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves the complexion brilliant!</li>
            <li> I use the Regenerating at night.  It&#x27;s clear gel texture feels refreshing on my face. I love how my skin feels and looks in the morning.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my face!</li>
            <li> Look, noone is happy about getting old, but you can minimize the look of aging by taking good care of your skin. It&#x27;s like flowers outside, if you water them they bloom!</li>
            <li> Most people assume that I&#x27;m 10 years younger then my actual age and I let them believe this :)  I attribute this to a healthy lifestyle,  daily meditation and this product.</li>
            <li> Best organic serum you can get. I buy it from amazon with a very nice discount</li>
            <li> love it! It certainly made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> no problems.....excellent price!</li>
            <li> I use this with the regenerating neck and decollete cream and it outperforms anything else I&#x27;ve used.  Lasts me about 5 months. These two products are better than their eye serum.  I use Clinque for that and it works better than Dr. H. But for the neck this is the best. Both are too expensive but worth a lot.</li>
            <li> I love every product I&#x27;v tried in this line.. My skin is improving and the price is way better than another organic product that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical since this seems ridiculously expensive but after using only 3 times I really noticed my skin felt better, it won&#x27;t erase wrinkles but it will bring a glow back</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Hauschka products, and this didn&#x27;t disappoint.  I&#x27;m not really expecting &amp;#34;regeneration&amp;#34;, but it is a nice serum that makes for a smooth base for moisturizer.  I have sensitive skin, and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I&#x27;ve already re-ordered for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> My mother was walking towards me in San Francisco. I had not seen her for years. She was in her 50s and the first thing out of my mouth was &amp;#34;Mother what make-up are you wearing! (she has extensive sun damage) She smiled sheepishly at me and with pride she answered &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not wearing any I&#x27;m using Dr. H. &amp;#34; Since then I have never looked back.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product and her skin looks great! It is applied at night, after washing your face.  Expensive, but you only use a few drops, so it lasts a long time.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone. It is absolutly great!!!!!!!! And love your prices for these products. Keep up the good prices!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the Dr. Hasuschka products - and I like the way this feels after I put it onto my skin - i have always found his products to be excellent!</li>
