            <li>By far my favorite...Very Sexy Product!</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, my hair turned out wavy, full and no frizz at all.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this hair product.  </li>
            <li>Full, wavy, no</li>
            <li>Perhaps this product works better for people with straight hair?</li>
            <li>this keeps it full &amp; &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I always use it when I am gonna go to parties or cool events</li>
            <li>My hair type is fine hair that will blow out very straight, but the humidity makes it frizzy.  </li>
            <li>The seller quickly sent a replacement  and a trial sized jar...free of charge.</li>
            <li>It came quickly along with some samples.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and was hoping that I could use this product in place of others I have been using and was also hoping it would give me more defined curls.  </li>
            <li>You have to find the right amount to put on for your own personal use,</li>
            <li>When I mentioned this to them via email, they refunded me $15 right away.</li>
            <li>I am still working my way through the jar, and as much as I love the smell (and generally the results)</li>
            <li>Kusco Murphy - Beach Hair is hard to find in my area and ordering it on line was easy, quick and cost effective.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and it came quickly and was wrapped very well.</li>
            <li>Best used when your hair is clean, naturally dry with a spritz of water and used very sparingly(Teaspoon or less!).</li>
            <li>Thanks Kusco-Murphy!</li>
            <li>On its own it does not tame my curls well enough and leaves my hair looking frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I live at the beach (Destin Florida)  and love the laid back beach hair look.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine in texture, and relatively uninteresting.</li>
            <li>This did control the curl and the frizz somewhat, but not as much as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>You really do look like you were at the beach.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair so this product really compliments my hair.</li>
            <li>After going through about 3/4 of the jar my hair started to look very \\&quot;ratty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really see much benefit to using it because it isn&#x27;t that noticeable on my hair.</li>
            <li>The gel itself works very well and helps my wavy hair to look a little more polished.</li>
            <li>It gives my heavy, thick hair lift and shine and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>then lightly pat dried my hair until it was no longer dripping and then scrunched with the Beach Hair product, I air dried and then fluffed hair and separated the curls and voila, sexy beach hair!</li>
            <li>The smell is actually nice and you only need a small amount of product to do the job.</li>
            <li>Aside from the stupid cracked lid...its perfect!</li>
            <li>as far as providing body and texture.</li>
            <li>So far this still is on</li>
            <li>Bone straight and flat</li>
            <li>I love this product, the only thing is, the cap breaks, this is my third jar, and 2 previous caps broke.  </li>
            <li>My hair is sort of long, about 5 inches below chin line, I used about a quarter size amount of Kusco, so it didn&#x27;t take much to acheive the results I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell however and have been using it in my hair (either curly or straight) after it is dried and styled for a little bit of extra definition.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and live in florida, which is pretty much always a bad hair day because of the humidity.  </li>
            <li>:)) I don&#x27;t use it everyday so I don&#x27;t know about the other issues that some have had like it drying out your hair.  </li>
            <li>so I tried some other products over the last year and decided that whatever the cost, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>The sand really takes a toll on your hair and the ingredients really hold on and It can be hard to wash out.</li>
            <li>As a hairdresser, I&#x27;ve tried every product imaginable to tame by wavy, thick hair and maintain a nice beachy look (without having to actually do anything to it.)</li>
            <li>I have just about everything in the book for my ultra fine, thin hair.</li>

            <li> I have just about everything in the book for my ultra fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that actually gives me a little wave and volume and actually STAYS that way though out the day.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy (curly if scrunched) and quite frizz prone hair and finding a product to tame my tresses is quite a feat.</li>
            <li> Have tried various other miracle hair thickeners and my hair laughs them off.  </li>
            <li> This product is non-sticky once dry and adds body.  </li>
            <li> (some mentioned that you can only see it on dark hair) but its minimal</li>
            <li> I put it on while my hair is still wet and blow it dry while scrunching hair.  </li>
            <li> Fluff your hair.</li>
            <li> this does the trick mixed in with a little serum!</li>
            <li> Use on wet hair and when it dries, just untangle and fluff with fingers....or put it in before the hair dryer and continually mess it up as you dry...and again do a bit of finger fluffing before runing off, and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way</li>
            <li> I can scrunch it while blowing it dry and it will curl a little.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I got my hopes up too high for this product, but I must admit being disappointed with it despite really wanting to like it.  </li>
            <li> I used this product on wet hair and then dried it with a diffuser  </li>
            <li> but because my hair is dark, the sand bits are visible, making it look like I have dandruff!</li>
            <li> Too much product and water will make your hair crunchy and Dirty Looking.</li>
            <li> I do see the bamboo pieces in my hair which is a dirty blonde</li>
            <li> But wow, I was shocked how damaging it was.</li>
            <li> Its the answer to genetically bad hair, to bad weather, to lack of ability with self-styling, and the answer to all bad haircuts: mess it up, give it crazy interesting body and go with it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the cap cracked and it had leaked in the box.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it fails on both counts.  </li>
            <li> This product is fairly expensive</li>
            <li> avoid all bad hair days...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This did control the curl and the frizz somewhat, but not as much as I had hoped.  Has good hold, and smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my baby fine hair.  Love it and highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> daughter loves this stuff</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product. Gives u sexy Beach hair and Bed Head. All though you cant use it all the time. The sand really takes a toll on your hair and the ingredients really hold on and It can be hard to wash out. Best used when your hair is clean, naturally dry with a spritz of water and used very sparingly(Teaspoon or less!). Too much product and water will make your hair crunchy and Dirty Looking. It is also expensive so It should be saved for better days. It lasts all day! Do not try to comb threw you hair or use your fingers or your hair will turn into frizz central. Fluff your hair. By far my favorite...Very Sexy Product!</li>
            <li> I read reviews on both Amazon and MUA before purchasing and I decided to make the investment and just go for it and I am glad that I did. I have naturally wavy (curly if scrunched) and quite frizz prone hair and finding a product to tame my tresses is quite a feat. I have to say that I love this product, the reviews did not disappoint.   I shampooed with Kerastase Relax Oleo shampoo and conditioned with the Oleo mask then lightly pat dried my hair until it was no longer dripping and then scrunched with the Beach Hair product, I air dried and then fluffed hair and separated the curls and voila, sexy beach hair! I am so happy with the result and would recommend this product to anyone not wanting to flat iron ever again!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. You really do look like you were at the beach. It makes my hair very sexy and tousled looking. I have wavy hair so this product really compliments my hair. This product is not sticky at all, it feels awesome on my hair after being styled. The smell is an added bonus!! Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have just about everything in the book for my ultra fine, thin hair. I bought three different products on amazon at the same time that promised the same results. The only one that came through was the Kusco.  My hair is very fine and thin.  I live at the beach (Destin Florida)  and love the laid back beach hair look.  My hair type is fine hair that will blow out very straight, but the humidity makes it frizzy.  I can scrunch it while blowing it dry and it will curl a little.  I used this product on wet hair and then dried it with a diffuser  (FHI Heat Nano 1900). Oh my gosh, my hair turned out wavy, full and no frizz at all.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this hair product.  Overnight...I woke up the next morning and still going!! Full, wavy, no frizz hair. My hair is sort of long, about 5 inches below chin line, I used about a quarter size amount of Kusco, so it didn&#x27;t take much to acheive the results I was looking for.  Bottom line...if you want sexy beach hair, use this.  Its definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it came quickly and was wrapped very well. Unfortunately the cap cracked and it had leaked in the box. The seller quickly sent a replacement  and a trial sized jar...free of charge. The caps cracked on both of those jars as well after I unwrapped them but thankfully no spills. The seller mentioned that the caps are made out of recycled materials and are easily cracked. That is the only drawback to this product. The gel itself works very well and helps my wavy hair to look a little more polished. I do see the bamboo pieces in my hair which is a dirty blonde (some mentioned that you can only see it on dark hair) but its minimal and you can brush it out with your fingers. The smell is actually nice and you only need a small amount of product to do the job. Aside from the stupid cracked lid...its perfect!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and live in florida, which is pretty much always a bad hair day because of the humidity.  I found this product, which is sticky and smells like coconut.  I put it on while my hair is still wet and blow it dry while scrunching hair.  This is the only product I have found that actually gives me a little wave and volume and actually STAYS that way though out the day.  I have actually gone to the beach wearing this product and the beach even makes it better.  You have to find the right amount to put on for your own personal use, as too much may make it kind of goopy.  I wash my hair every day and it does come out when hair is washed.  I love this product, the only thing is, the cap breaks, this is my third jar, and 2 previous caps broke.  Thanks Kusco-Murphy!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got my hopes up too high for this product, but I must admit being disappointed with it despite really wanting to like it.  I have naturally curly hair and was hoping that I could use this product in place of others I have been using and was also hoping it would give me more defined curls.  Unfortunately it fails on both counts.  On its own it does not tame my curls well enough and leaves my hair looking frizzy.  I also find it not that easy to work with.  I love the smell however and have been using it in my hair (either curly or straight) after it is dried and styled for a little bit of extra definition.  Perhaps this product works better for people with straight hair?</li>
            <li> This stuff does work but be warned, it does damage your hair. I would not recommend using it every day like I did. After going through about 3/4 of the jar my hair started to look very \\&quot;ratty\\&quot;. I stopped using it and gave my hair some deep conditioning treatments, which greatly improved the texture. But wow, I was shocked how damaging it was.</li>
            <li> This is what ive been looking for. As a hairdresser, I&#x27;ve tried every product imaginable to tame by wavy, thick hair and maintain a nice beachy look (without having to actually do anything to it.) this does the trick mixed in with a little serum! Only downside, cracked lid. When I mentioned this to them via email, they refunded me $15 right away. Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0012YGPJS Kusco Murphy Beach Hair]]    This IS the answer....avoid all bad hair days...no matter what the reason.  Have only used the product with hair length short to moderate ( below chin length but above shoulders). My hair is fine in texture, and relatively uninteresting. This product creates so much texture, body and craziness, its flawless. Smells great, like the beach, and easy application. Use on wet hair and when it dries, just untangle and fluff with fingers....or put it in before the hair dryer and continually mess it up as you dry...and again do a bit of finger fluffing before runing off, and throughout the day. Its the answer to genetically bad hair, to bad weather, to lack of ability with self-styling, and the answer to all bad haircuts: mess it up, give it crazy interesting body and go with it!</li>
            <li> It gives my fine hair wonderful texture and I love the beachy fragrance. A little bit goes a very long way</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the strong reviews.  For my fine hair, I found it to be just okay as far as providing body and texture. It has a nice aroma. I am not overly fond of the feel of the product (goopy). Everyone&#x27;s hair and expectations of hair products are different but I prefer Philip B Maui Wowie Beach Mist.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product ever. I love it. Gives your hair great texture and hold.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews.  It works great for me.  I have fine hair that is wavy and this stuff gives it great volume and waves when used with a diffuser.  ( Wow--huge bed hair in the morning! :)) I don&#x27;t use it everyday so I don&#x27;t know about the other issues that some have had like it drying out your hair.  My hair looks full, sexy and beachy when I use this--love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now. And now beach hair is everywhere in product form. I&#x27;ve bought many others to try. So far this still is on my must have list</li>
            <li> Great-smelling hair product, but because my hair is dark, the sand bits are visible, making it look like I have dandruff! I am still working my way through the jar, and as much as I love the smell (and generally the results) I&#x27;m not keen on having dirty-looking hair.</li>
            <li> This product is fairly expensive so I tried some other products over the last year and decided that whatever the cost, it was worth it.  I love this product.  It gives my heavy, thick hair lift and shine and it smells great!  I ordered it on line from Jade Beauty Supply and saved money.  It came quickly along with some samples.  Kusco Murphy - Beach Hair is hard to find in my area and ordering it on line was easy, quick and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Have bought this for years.  Can&#x27;t find anything that compares. I have short,fine hair  &amp; this keeps it full &amp; &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have lots of baby fine mouse colored hair.  Bone straight and flat no matter what.  Zero body.  This is the only product that actually works.  Used it for years.  Have tried various other miracle hair thickeners and my hair laughs them off.  This product is non-sticky once dry and adds body.  Use it on damp hair, style, and then I add spray for all day great hold.  Yeah, I back comb too.</li>
            <li> I love it. I always use it when I am gonna go to parties or cool events coz I like having a beach hair it makes it different, but you have to wash it after the day though, coz I tried to have it on overnight and it kind a get sticky alittle bit but other than that this is a cool product best to use on summer days and for people with wavy hair :)</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product a ton but I don&#x27;t really see much benefit to using it because it isn&#x27;t that noticeable on my hair. I think it might work better on lighter hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s the only product I have found that helps with the styling look and hold I need.</li>
