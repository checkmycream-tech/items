            <li>The best ever  Great for travel and powerful for battery</li>
            <li>Still, it does a good job of cleaning in conjunction with a toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good product although sometimes I need to fill it twice.</li>
            <li>The two AA bateries lasted 40 days, at this rate Panasonic is superior.</li>
            <li>For the money, I think it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>All in all a good product.</li>
            <li>and the reviews were good</li>
            <li>The pressure is not as good as the Waterpic</li>
            <li>Good battery life, it goes on all trips with me.</li>
            <li>The battery life was amazingly good.  </li>
            <li>I loved the Waterpik handheld, rechargeable; but about once a year, the battery would no longer recharge.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>My god, it&#x27;s just that good in design.</li>
            <li>this one seemed like a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>This is not so good.</li>
            <li>It is also good for flushing out food particles that get caught in gum pockets.    </li>
            <li>I have always owned a Waterpik which is also a good product</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a good way to use this.</li>
            <li>This was a really good buy.  </li>
            <li>I received the product in good shape</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the Water Pic.  </li>
            <li>But, it does the job, was good price</li>
            <li>If you want good pressure, don&#x27;t order the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Just good for landfill now.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price of about $30.</li>
            <li>Good pressure.</li>
            <li>It is exceptionally good for a battery operated model.  </li>
            <li>I feel this product is a good value for the price paid.</li>
            <li>, that is good for traveling.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy it again, but the model was discontinued, perhaps because it was so durable and they couldn&#x27;t make a good sale out of it.</li>
            <li>I got this Oral Irrigator, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t someone make a good one of these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find this Panasonic on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a good piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>This is a good oral irrigator.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Works great, folds up nicely for travel.</li>
            <li>This is a good battery irrigator.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be good for a portable waterpik that you don&#x27;t have to plug in, but it&#x27;s just a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and chose this irrigator over the others because of the good accolades.  </li>
            <li>good value,fine products</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s plenty good for a temporary oral hygiene tool.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes itself into a portable case and has a good stream of water as well.</li>
            <li>No need to recharge hours just two AA batteries are good and working nicely&lt;</li>
            <li>The water tank leaks when i tip it over and tried to get a good angle to spray.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it does a good job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li>This appliance seems to do just as good a job as the electric water pik</li>
            <li>This is a good product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>good enough?\\&quot; way)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is a good product to buy</li>
            <li>battery lasts a good length of time.  </li>
            <li>- I bought it because I didn&#x27;t want to clutter my vanity with appliances - good price, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good design neat storage ability.</li>
            <li>This product has helped keep my gums and teeth in good shape.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Good performance as an accessory along with a ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I ordered Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A from the seller Good</li>
            <li>GOOD PRICED ITEM IN ADDITION TO BRUSHING.&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>Had it for a week on the road and loved it.</li>
            <li>It works good, I will buy again if this one breaks one day.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Well made and relatively good battery life.</li>
            <li>good purchase.</li>
            <li>and I find it to be superior to Water Pik in every category.</li>
            <li>A good buy for 30 dollar purchase.</li>
            <li>good product, cannot replace the teethbrushing</li>
            <li>A good personal,portable oral irrigator that does the job for a good price.  </li>
            <li>It is a good adjunct to the home based Water Pik I use.</li>
            <li>It does a good job</li>
            <li>The feature is that it collapses for storage, so would be a good travel unit.  </li>
            <li>Good for camping, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, good.</li>
            <li>Batteries were good.</li>
            <li>Good investment for my teeth.</li>
            <li>The stream is quite good and has two speeds</li>
            <li>Puts away well and good for travel.</li>
            <li>It is vastly superior to the WP cordless model.</li>
            <li>Compact, good size reservoir and not one (1) but two (2) speeds.   </li>
            <li>I thought this might be a good model to use when I travel, but it leaks.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job for that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>But the size does not affect the performance except in a good way.</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job and gets out stuff</li>
            <li>think I will introduce a friend to buy, share the good stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s battery operated and gives good pulses of water.</li>
            <li>A good attempt but</li>
            <li>Generally good product.</li>
            <li>My dentist has me doing the Waterpik thing, so I trust that it is a good idea.</li>
            <li>It was a good care product after brushing and flossing but just didn&#x27;t have any staying power.  </li>
            <li>Rather than feeling assaulted like they do when I floss, the irrigator makes my gums feel good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this irrigator for about a month &amp; my mouth &amp; teeth have never felt so good.</li>
            <li>Good reliable product.  </li>
            <li>This is especially true of rechargeable battery models.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would be good for traveling.</li>
            <li>I am 100% delighted with this product and the results.</li>
            <li>However, it is a good follow up to brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>It is great not having to search for a plug or deal with any kind of adapter.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning food between teeth.  </li>
            <li>For those people who are considering the Panasonic portable as their day-to-day at-home waterflosser -- it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This does a really good job.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so eager as now to write a review for when a good review is so well deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good value for money.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a great price!!!Using the bathroom is the most good, as there is water splashing.</li>
            <li>It was so good, someone stole it.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good alternative to having a unit sitting on my counter and that you can take it with you on vacation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: It does a good job cleaning the teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get out food debris that brushing may not get --seems to be a good thing to start off with as part of your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>My dentist found my gums in good health.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning after you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I wanted a well designed oral irrigator,and this one, upon 1st impression, is a good design.</li>
            <li>Its a good addition to oral care.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition; promptly, too.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, she laughed and told me she was just as hopeless until,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for my breath and</li>
            <li>apparently, good for my irrigator.</li>
            <li>It is compact, packs up nicely, and works just great.</li>
            <li>After a week of usage, I would say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Does a good job for away from home use.</li>
            <li>Good for travel.</li>
            <li>I think the amount of water it holds is sufficient for a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Plus, having blown out an AC power-supply based irrigator while traveling internationally, it&#x27;s good to never have to deal with that again.</li>
            <li>and this fits in and works as good as my stationary one at home.</li>
            <li>the water pressure feels good</li>
            <li>Two speeds, good design.</li>
            <li>The system works well and the power is good...</li>
            <li>Our teenager just got braces and my husband wisely suggested a water irrigation device.  </li>
            <li>tried once, worked good.</li>
            <li>This may be a good quality product.</li>
            <li>It is a good value</li>
            <li>Yes, there are 2 speeds which is a good option.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an inexpensive water flosser, then this is a good option.</li>
            <li>good stuff  </li>
            <li>For not that much more money, the Waterpik removes an incredible amount of material from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>If you position it correctly it does a good job cleaning inbetween your teeth</li>
            <li>The pressure was good, I even used it on the lower setting and it did its job.  </li>
            <li>function of the unit seems good, from what I can tell.  </li>
            <li>received the product yesterday, packaging was good and within 20 minutes I was using the product in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For traveling where weight is an issues this irrigator is a good solution.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit to take on trips, &amp; am completely thrilled with its intelligent engineering &amp; performance.</li>
            <li>This is good, because when traveling you can&#x27;t leave it on a charger.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good battery life.</li>
            <li>--If you like good industrial design (think iPad)</li>
            <li>I got this cordless irrigator on a sale for a good price</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>I thought this would make a good item to have on trips, but it uses up a lot of battery life and gets moldy, to boot.</li>
            <li>I used the lower speed and felt like it was doing a good job irrigating my mouth.</li>
            <li>this is a good choice</li>
            <li>Good constuction.</li>
            <li>This portable flosser is a good tool.</li>
            <li>Good for travel, haven&#x27;t used it a lot....</li>
            <li>This arrived in 2 days and has been a good product.</li>
            <li>We would recommend it to those who need a good irrigator.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good luck.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for travel because it&#x27;s light weight when folded up.</li>
            <li>The size is good and collapses well for travel.  </li>
            <li>the Panasonic is the best of the Travel irrigators currently available.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is good.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a wonderful clean feel to our mouths.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job, and even the \\&quot;low\\&quot; option is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Very good oral irrigator, easy to use, good battery life and can be used for travel.</li>
            <li>It works great, easy to use and gives great pressure.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>It is great, but make sure you put in GOOD batteries (not the $1 store type) in order to get a good result.  </li>
            <li>it is compact and easy to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li>works great, portable, easy to use, no cord!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this mini version.</li>
            <li>I have used this many times and it is a great unit.&lt;br</li>

            <li>They seem to be very pleased with using it.  </li>
            <li>Use it every day and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This did a great job, but I wish it held more water.</li>
            <li>Great product  so much better than.</li>
            <li>Great Power, just love the two power modes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the Panasonic irrigator.  </li>

            <li>But was very refreshing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great, but wanted to try this one and the results are much better in the power department, it uses two AA batteries in contrast with conair which uses 3 AA and the stream of water</li>

            <li>maybe it is better for your gums than flossing, but I tried flossing after using this and there was still some food in there!</li>
            <li>So glad I did!</li>
            <li>So convenient I love it!</li>
            <li>Sometimes the water splashes all over the place, I guess I just need to learn how to control it better!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE the ease of use, size, and aesthetically pleasing!</li>

            <li>Easy to use, works great.</li>

            <li>Just an all around great product that has created a loyal fan!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic -- while not yielding quite as powerful a waterjet as the plug-in Waterpik -- does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>Practical and pleasant, very effective in removing all the food debris and keeping mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>Amazing water pressure.</li>
            <li>It is amazing when I get done brushing my teeth then use this and realize there was still food particles caught under my gum, but with no pain in cleaning it out.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The splash is amazing.</li>
            <li>like having it - it&#x27;s amazing how it gets out</li>
            <li>Works amazing for those wearing braces.</li>
            <li>While at home a countertop WaterPik-like device works great to solve this problem, the portable WaterPik-brand irrigators are simply huge.  </li>
            <li>GREAT ONE THING DON&#x27;T USE CHEAP 99 CENT  </li>
            <li>Nice price.</li>
            <li>It is a nice compromise between travel size and reservoir size.  </li>
            <li>Handy for travel.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Panasonic models are great, you will be satisfied with them for sure.</li>
            <li>I can put it in a tote bag if I want to take it with me, and it fits nicely inside the vanity cabinet.      </li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with it</li>
            <li>handy and portable......</li>
            <li>and I liked that the engineers designed the cap to snap on and off instead of breaking off.</li>
            <li>I mix my own concoction of warm water and mouth wash even though the instructions say to use just water.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my best friend - she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen many good reviews</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>I liked the vanilla taste on her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am very much satisfied and Happy with it. :)</li>
            <li>I should have read the amazon reviews better and because of the good reviews the Panasonic got, I purchased one.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and effective alternative to flossing that&#x27;s easier on your gums.</li>
            <li>The product is handy.</li>
            <li>It effectively removes debris that one cannot get with floss and brushing, and is compact for travelling.</li>
            <li>A nice portable device...</li>
            <li>Nice not to have an additional cord on the counter.  </li>
            <li>This one has two speed/force settings, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>and it is really nice to have a unit that is compact for packing.</li>
            <li>This is a handy product.</li>
            <li>I liked this model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic water floss made it truly effective for my teeth.</li>
            <li>but it does take AA which are if you have your own set up hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li>I had tried the portable water pik but never had liked it.  </li>
            <li>When collapsed, it is a nice size to carry in your bag.</li>
            <li>got the irrigator liked it and realize it too</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled when I found the Panasonic Oral Irrigator on-line.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use good alakaline batteries on this product.</li>
            <li>Wish it had some kind of holder for the detachable spout, though.  </li>
            <li>I had to mail it in at my own cost for the warranty service.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir is perfect size and does not take up much room in hand carry.</li>
            <li>I just keep it handy where ever I drive and always have a water bottle handy as well.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if it was rechargeable but still works well as is.</li>
            <li>I found though that a 5-cent nickle does the job nicely without damage.</li>
            <li>I use it after brushing and flossing and it does get some more debris out on occasion even with good flossing.  </li>
            <li>My dentist suggested I get a \\&quot;water pik\\&quot; of some kind</li>
            <li>- Have a towel handy to wipe off everything within two feet of the sink.</li>
            <li>Did not give it 5 stars because it is not as effective as a non portable type.</li>
            <li>I researched these and found the panasonic to be recommended over the popular brand you see everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It is so handy</li>
            <li>I expect to get better battery life with the NMH batteries, to save a good bit of money by using them, and to avoid polluting the environment with used alkaline batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked it</li>
            <li>it was nice not having to have another appliance to plug in.</li>
            <li>The Oral Irrigator is comptact and handy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>Compact and effective.  </li>
            <li>A nice alternative to flossing.</li>
            <li>nice perk)..</li>
            <li>(TIP: HAVE TOWELS HANDY and HAIR IN TURBAN).  </li>
            <li>Good Luck :)</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s found his own technique to use it so that there isn&#x27;t water squirting everywhere.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact when it is folded up</li>
            <li>Compact and effective.</li>
            <li>It is nice product.</li>
            <li>It does the job nicely though.</li>
            <li>This is a nice handy effective tool.</li>
            <li>Two AA battery operated means it&#x27;s handy to take anywhere with you.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>but it is nice that it does not take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li>I find the highest pressure to be a bit much, and the lowest pressure to be perfect!</li>
            <li>I purchased one and liked it.</li>
            <li>I truly liked it.</li>
            <li>Loving Amazon, hating this product...</li>
            <li>Irrigator I liked him.</li>
            <li>a nice massage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 speeds are nice.</li>
            <li>Yes, I too would have liked a jet stream</li>
            <li>2 perfect set speeds and just simple and great to use.</li>
            <li>but so effective</li>
            <li>Nice portable unit.  </li>
            <li>include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it cleaned</li>
            <li>Comes in handy when traveling and camping.  </li>
            <li>good  that I expected,Panasonic always my favorite brand</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was compact and did the job.</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that it ran on batteries and didn&#x27;t need a charger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s collapsable for travel</li>
            <li>Folds up nice and compact for traveling.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels nice after I use it.</li>
            <li>Fill it up with warm water and wham.</li>
            <li>It must be popular, because the price jumped about $8 since I purchased it a week ago.</li>
            <li>but it is stiill effective.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact for travel.  </li>
            <li>I used one for many years and then stopped, I don&#x27;t know why because I loved it.  </li>
            <li>nice, works and cleans my teeth</li>
            <li>Handy for travel.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely on the counter with all the cosmetic items we women collect.</li>
            <li>It packs nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice that it uses batteries</li>
            <li>Love this product and good value.</li>
            <li>weight handy, and portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>own this water flosser.</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as string based (polytetrafluoroethylene or nylon) flossing.</li>
            <li>Batteries were tested in a flashlight, still effective.</li>
            <li>I liked this product but it died three months after purchase.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and very easy to use, always handy with out taking up a lot of cainet space.</li>
            <li>Had the original Panasonic (EW1270AC) since 2005 and still running great (6 years, used every day).</li>
            <li>I need this kind of device when traveling - you simply can&#x27;t fly anywhere with a full Water-Pik unit in tow.  </li>
            <li>This is a great tool to keep teeth and gums squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>As a dentist would probably tell you, it works best when you floss first but is better</li>
            <li>This is a great appliance for keeping your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>A great tool for keeping your teeth and mouth clean.</li>
            <li>This does a great job when you are wearing braces to thoroughly clean stuff in between braces and teeth.  </li>
            <li>I use 1/2 water 1/4 peroxide 1/4 mouth wash for a GREAT clean.</li>
            <li>My main one is a Water Pic--and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, this irrigator does a great job of getting stuck items out of your teeth and leaving your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for people with or without braces because it works awesome.</li>
            <li>A wonderful piece of devise, highly recommendede</li>
            <li>NICE PRESSURE, GOOD DESIGN, EASY TO FILL</li>
            <li>Got a great price on a &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34; special, but I would be happy to pay full price for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it has a handy size suitable for travel and that it is battery run.</li>
            <li>Use normal batteries and not rechargeable, and it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The best thing that I like about this product is they use a normal AA battery so that you won&#x27;t run out of battery.</li>

            <li>The amount of water it holds is good, and it is easy to fill.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is lightening fast and customer service is awesome!  :)</li>
            <li>However, after going through batteries quickly, I switched to rechargeable batteries and they work great.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job and travels easily.</li>
            <li>THis one is easy to use and has good water pressure.  </li>
            <li>Of course, having a combination is also good, but the stuffs between the teeth are easily removed with this irrigator.</li>
            <li>She also wasn&#x27;t super happy to hear I was using a water pik type cleaner either.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good product, but water jet not as strong.</li>
            <li>Good quality, no service needed, batts last forever... and priced perfectly.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel, holds just enough water to do a good job.  </li>

            <li>Momentum is very strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This oral flosser is portable, very easy to use without even reviewing the operation manual.</li>
            <li>It is very strong, the battery that came with it is manufactured by Panasonic as well, it is disposable battery, and the manual recommends no rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is compact and is very easy to operate.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Makes me feel so clean, I now feel uneasy when I don&#x27;t get to use it :p</li>
            <li>Excellent for keeping your mouth fresh and clean while traveling.</li>
            <li>Great product my mouth has never felt so clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like water picking this is great - easy to use &amp; easy to take with you if you travel</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s attractive (for a water pick), easy to use and easy to fill/empty.</li>
            <li>Best of all my mouth feels really clean and wonderfully fresh.</li>
            <li>Works really well and size is very good for travel.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use (once you get used to the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34;)....and is easily stored!</li>
            <li>just before we went on vacation,, and it worked great (not as good as my home unit, but a whole lot better than none)   </li>
            <li>But we liked the portability of being able to take them on vacations.  </li>
            <li>and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Great product but a bit too powerful for a person that has a lot</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li>It is cute and handy.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it more than I and it is effective for her.</li>
            <li>I love size, fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was really good and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Much better than the kind with rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>Compact, light, ease of use, good reach to all corners.  </li>
            <li>This inexpensive contraption fixed up that issue perfectly.  </li>
            <li>More amazing, it can be collapsed for packing.</li>
            <li>Works very well though great for when you get food stuck in your teeth and a good substitute to brushing your teeth many times a day.</li>
            <li>I liked being able to travel with it....</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that just turned out to be a great success.</li>
            <li>This thing is great and fun to use.</li>
            <li>I own a Waterpik plug-in flosser which I love.  </li>
            <li>So far, it has been about 9 months and it is running flawlessly.</li>
            <li>perfect for travel and everyday use; received in good condition!&lt;br /&gt;excellent device for oral care and good hygiene.</li>

            <li>We didn&#x27;t want a counter top unit, so this was the next best thing that offered good performance and travel options.  </li>
            <li>is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic one operates and is just as effective as the Waterpik accept that the Panasonic is more portable.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would be effective and safe space.  </li>
            <li>BUT HONESTLY THOUGHT IT HAD MORE POWER TO THE PRESSURE PULSES</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, just turn to the first speed that has effective clearing.</li>
            <li>I loved it, It was very useful.</li>

            <li>With this product, it makes it so easy!</li>
            <li>This thing is strong!</li>
            <li>That thing is strong!</li>
            <li>It feels very good, just started to use, gum bleeding, after a few times, if you just eat immediately after the use of the effect is very good</li>
            <li>It is the  best water pick  by  far than  many others and  </li>

            <li>and they do a good job - and most importantly</li>
            <li>I am okay with this as filling it up is very easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to store, looks great on sink vanity, full power, better than my old electric, perfect for travel.</li>

            <li>I was skeptics at first, but this thing is great.</li>
            <li>Works great exactly as described</li>
            <li>To be fair, I always use the electric unit at 10 -- full blast -- because my gums are used to that setting and don&#x27;t bleed.  </li>
            <li>Good size for traveling; good water pressure; good tank size - just enough water if I hurry.</li>
            <li>how well I liked this, it is strong, but not too strong!</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable when using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping that the item might be more compact to make it more suitable for travel.</li>
            <li>Stream of water is strong and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cordless, compact, easy to use and as effective as the ones with cord.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and a nice finish after brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll strongly recommend this to anyone who have yet to own one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice, easy to use irrigator.</li>
            <li>I got it for travel and find it effective and easy to transport.  </li>
            <li>Nice travel size and easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is easy to fill &amp; telescopes into its own reservoir for compact carry.</li>
            <li>The oral irrigator has very good water pressure and less bulky than others I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s compact and great for travel.</li>
            <li>2 is good, but one more a bit higher would be nice</li>
            <li>I take much better care of my teeth and gums because this Panasonic product is so handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and price, super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>That said, if you just want a gentle rinse, this is a good product and certainly better than not having one when traveling!</li>
            <li>Great size, sufficiently large reservoir, and plenty of power.  </li>
            <li>I took this new flosser on a trip and loved it!  </li>
            <li>I have braces &amp; can&#x27;t live without a good water flosser!</li>
            <li>I have three new dental implants and my dentist told me this is the best thing to do for them to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels a lot better and my hygienist likes the results.</li>
            <li>......Already like this much better.  </li>
            <li>I take it when I travel as it is better than nothing, but for at home, use an electric one.</li>
            <li>This seems to do a great job and not take much space.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>If you are prepared for these limitations, the Oral Irrigator is much better than having nothing and will do its intended job.</li>
            <li>Their dentist recommended I purchase one because their gums weren&#x27;t as healthy as they could have been.  </li>
            <li>He is still using it once or twice a week, which I figure is better than not at all.  </li>
            <li>+ year oral irrigators (mostly corded waterpiks).   </li>
            <li>I have been quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>For ease of use, I like it even better than the full-size</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conversely, this Panasonic is much better designed and is perfect for portable use - and it uses regular batteries</li>
            <li>/&gt;After many years they break.&lt;br /&gt;New</li>
            <li>satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see particles of food removed by using the product, even after flossing and brushing.  </li>
            <li>I really love this Panasonic oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li>Considering the hand held capability there really isn&#x27;t much better</li>
            <li>Much better than the leading brand or any of the others.  </li>
            <li>A push-button would have been a much better control.  </li>
            <li>I have taken three (3) business trips of 5 days or more and could not be happier with the functionality and reliability of the product.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome, I just bought my second unit.</li>
            <li>I love having this as a back-up.  </li>
            <li>I heard that this was better than flossing</li>
            <li>I have been using an oral irrigator type product for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I purchased the Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.  </li>
            <li>, I can spit with more force that WaterPik portable.  </li>
            <li>If it lasts, it will be one of my better purchases.</li>
            <li>Stream is actually more forceful than the waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Works better than a waterpik. Portable.</li>
            <li>I find this is a better choice.</li>
            <li>the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A has preformed very well and I am completely happy with it.</li>
            <li>Pressure is perfect and dont worry about the batteries I have been using it for 2 weeks, once a day, and still using the same ones.</li>
            <li>I fly every week for business and this takes up too much room in my luggage.</li>
            <li>We use them every day and it works so much better than even flossing......</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed my mouth with better taste because of it.</li>
            <li>This product is better than Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is okay after week and + usage.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>If the mouth piece was on a 12 to 18 inch tube it would be much better.</li>
            <li>I travel and love the way it slids together for packing.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a more convenient sized version.</li>
            <li>For a $25 truly portable oral irrigator, I don&#x27;t think you can ask for much more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Most of my teeth are 4 - 7 mm.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I made the decision to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>Planning to buy more.</li>
            <li>so glad that  I purchased  the Oral Irrigator  by Panasonic.</li>
            <li>.I am so glad I checked out Amazon,</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>It is very portable and great for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this teeth cleaning device.</li>
            <li>I love that it is portable.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied and would buy again.</li>
            <li>With practice I&#x27;ve gotten better at handling the power switch, though I still accidentally spray a stray stream of water around the bathroom once in a while.</li>
            <li>My gums feel much better.</li>
            <li>Saw this and decided to try it because it is much more compact and easier to handle when traveling.</li>
            <li>This is quite an ingenious design.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the waterpick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this is an item what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design.</li>
            <li>Tends to make it more drippy.  </li>
            <li>I decided I needed more voltage.</li>
            <li>After just two weeks gums are healthier just &amp;#34;feel&#x27;&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li>A friend told me about this, and I have thanked him many times.</li>
            <li>I buy this for my father, and he love it.    </li>
            <li>Does the job but not put together any better than you can expect based on price</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>but like that I&#x27;ll be able to.</li>
            <li>I also have a waterpick and this unit is so much more practical.</li>
            <li>Love the design.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik had a cumbersome shape and there were many issues with the rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazons great customer service</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I could safely say ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to wait until tomorrow to call the number and spend even more time on this.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it is portable and uses batteries.</li>
            <li>Beats Water pik many times over.</li>
            <li>It is even better than what I have.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this unit for when I am on the road.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>this is ok for me because I take my shower at night and then put on my robe and then brush my teeth / floss.  </li>
            <li>But now after a couple of weeks of using it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all any more.  </li>
            <li>Namely, it holds a respectable amount of water, shoots said water into one&#x27;s mouth, and in the process dislodges food particles.  </li>
            <li>So what more could one want in an oral irrigator?  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, the produce is better than nothing, but needs improvement.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now sure that my 8-year-old son wouldn&#x27;t love holding it in his hand.</li>
            <li>So pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I guess I should read product descriptions more closely.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure of these portable models but after reading many reviews, this model stood out to me the most.</li>
            <li>The AA battery operated Panasonic Oral Irrigator works better than the rechargeable Waterpik that I used to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light-weight, very portable, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Have not used a waterpik type device in decades but decided to do a better job with the teeth and this thing seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more</li>
            <li>The water pik before that lasted more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this may lessen the life of the product, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues yet.  </li>
            <li>But regardless love it.</li>
            <li>Panasonic was rated better than the WaterPik one.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and it is a lot more portable.</li>
            <li>Just want to say I love the Panasonic Oral Irrigator.</li>
            <li>This brand uses AA batteries so if I do have a battery problem I am able to replace them.  </li>
            <li>However, there is nothing to keep the top up, so when you&#x27;re trying to use it</li>
            <li>This is a much better way to go.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t floss, this is better than nothing, but otherwise, save your money and look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the speed of delivery.   </li>
            <li>This Panasonic unit works as well as those and is more portable.</li>
            <li>Might be ok to travel  with</li>
            <li>I recently bought one for myself since I was so impressed.</li>
            <li>It looks more &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I really love this cleaning machine.</li>
            <li>The tip should be replaced after one year to continue get the most efficient water flow.  </li>
            <li>Able to floss and brush out anything stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting a much better product.</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve used waterpix portables.  </li>
            <li>Love the self-storage for the tip, and the included travel case.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strength of the jet is satisfying.</li>
            <li>more than recharging...</li>
            <li>top version that I have .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the battery life.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ideal for the frequent traveler.</li>
            <li>I think the latch for the water is not as secure as I would have liked</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this product.  </li>
            <li>Not being able to adjust the stream type is a flaw here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m love my Sonicare, but we camp a lot</li>
            <li>I have used it in my travels and really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on battery life yet, but will update when appropriate.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the price was great!  </li>
            <li>Much better than another brand I had</li>
            <li>I love it way better than the others.</li>
            <li>Love this water pick.  </li>
            <li>Love how portable this is.  </li>
            <li>but ok once you get use to it...</li>
            <li>I read reviews and love Panasonic product</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li>This one is nicer and better.  </li>
            <li>Love this ....</li>
            <li>It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure what I was getting with this product</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a winner, even better than the one I have at home which needs to be recharged by electricity.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am sooo pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>would love to recommend all of you</li>
            <li>My teeth make you healthy items.</li>
            <li>I love that it operates on batteries too.</li>
            <li>Wish it is a better product.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>really satisfying products.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Now I keep it for travel only as it&#x27;s the best for that.</li>
            <li>Much better than the rechargeable unit sold in Wallmart which is now gathering dust.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m coming from a waterpick counter top model 110v.  </li>
            <li>It has two speeds just in case you have sensitivity or need more power.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many kinds / brands of electric brushes before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been washing off the wand part with soap periodically, and leaving it out on the counter more, and that takes care of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know about battery life, but has two kinds of batteries, so might be more costly to replace.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>so I was ghlad to be able to take this thing on the road with me.</li>
            <li>I love this oral waterpik.</li>
            <li>I hope it power more.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Waterpik travel</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I purchased an extra one to pack for my son when he&#x27;s starts college this year, should be perfect for when he has to share a bathroom.</li>
            <li>The battery function is much more durable and practical the the ac units.  </li>
            <li>This is OK for lightweight packing but it doesn&#x27;t come close to my Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I always bring spares if I&#x27;ll be away for a week or more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this great product</li>
            <li>it would be better, if it was rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is even better than waterpik in my opinion as it is portable</li>
            <li>Could use more storage.</li>
            <li>This is just okay...</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a more well known waterpik option.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow instructions for when not in use.</li>
            <li>I have to fill it twice, but that is OK.</li>
            <li>The slot in the top of the battery compartment is shaped to take the edge of a quarter coin for opening and closing (not noted in the instructions).  </li>
            <li>so you would have to order more if more than one person is going to use it</li>
            <li>wish it had more settings</li>
            <li>Cleans mouth better than flossing and brushing alone.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job, but it was a real pain to use and an eye sore to boot.</li>
            <li>I leave the cap open and don&#x27;t compact it so the water doesn&#x27;t stagnate, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to sanitize it so it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual or mold or what have you.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say buy it if you need to use it in lieu of flossing, but flossing is probably still best.</li>
            <li>Works even better than my plug-in water-flosser.  </li>
            <li>I will put more updates if people find this helpful.</li>
            <li>Think this is easier than flossing and cleans better.</li>
            <li>and I love it for so many reasons.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a better system.  </li>
            <li>The reviews for this Panasonic unit were better than others for sale, and I ordered it for that reason.</li>
            <li>Nozzle dosen&#x27;t work for more than 1 week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I do brush them well every day, which I&#x27;m sure also helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Way better than WaterPik.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>but I wished there was more water pressure.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it and we will wait for</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this one as it really is portable - which is great for someone like me who travels a lot for work.</li>
            <li>It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design.</li>
            <li>I mix mouthwash in with the water and it is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>I would suggest making sure</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>interesting device,</li>
            <li>mostly seeds from toast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking to try the -A model and see if it is any better.  </li>
            <li>, I just think it takes all kinds of practice - - then maybe it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>and I accidentally sprayed myself in the face, and have sprayed my bathroom mirror more than once.</li>
            <li>I love to use mouthwash with it</li>
            <li>so I have to do more than floss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using same model for years and my dentist says it does a excellent job</li>
            <li>I investigated the reviews, and this product received better reviews.  </li>
            <li>With two water pressure settings I have never needed anything more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>its okay, still works,</li>
            <li>Wish I could say I love it.</li>
            <li>I do love the idea</li>
            <li>Better than the water pik portable.</li>
            <li>I love my Panasonic water pick, and when I travel, it always is packed and usEd</li>
            <li>I am  :-)</li>
            <li>Many people seemed to like this waterpik over others.</li>
            <li>Feels better than the Philips Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really love this.  </li>
            <li>able to get rid of the plague in between my teeth</li>
            <li>Glad to see than dentists are recommending the use of these again.  </li>
            <li>At that time I need to charge it more and more often until I gave up on it and purchased the Panasonic Ew-DJ10-A.  Since the batteries are replaceable</li>
            <li>People who are complaining about the unit growing mold must not know that the reservoir pulls off of the top part.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the rechargeable one I had.  </li>
            <li>I just love this thing.</li>
            <li>Love, going to buy another for the downstairs bathroom.</li>
            <li>I feel like there could be an additional level added onto it with a bit more power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Completely satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure why I purchased this.</li>
            <li>but I can say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am definitely pleased with this and would purchase another</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is an okay irrigator.</li>
            <li>would love a travel size irrigator, however, I don&#x27;t like the hassle of buying/changing batteries.</li>
            <li>It is also more portable as it is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda satisfy :-)</li>
            <li>You can brush your teeth, floss, rinse and then use this tool to remove quite a bit more food stuffs.</li>
            <li>Not quite as forceful as a sink top model.</li>
            <li>I think it cleans better than my water pik i have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the need to use throwaway batteries, I&#x27;m satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>Love that it folds up</li>
            <li>I think push on off button is better to use it.</li>
            <li>This model seems much better built, becomes compact for traveling (even protecting the tip) and runs on rechargeable or alkaline batteries, which can be purchased anywhere.</li>
            <li>Much better design than competitor.  </li>
            <li>Wish the reservoir held a bit more water</li>
            <li>and I think my dentist will be pleased.</li>
            <li>, I have been satisfied using just water and swishing with mouthwash</li>
            <li>But I was able to use the highest pressure immediately (maybe because I floss and use an electric brush.)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Much better than any others on the market.</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure the Panasonic nozzle is in your mouth before you turn it on because it does not have a control switch like the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>Lighter and more portable because there is no power cord to carry around for re-charging.</li>
            <li>many years ago.</li>
            <li>For lots of people it&#x27;s ok, however I do need a tougher one</li>
            <li>I was not that pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>and I love the size.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than flossing.</li>
            <li>Top section stores in the water tank, along with the jet&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>so I was really glad to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and have recommended it to many of my family and friends.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and when it gives out I purchase another.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At 60, more pockets in the teeth I guess, but even after flossing, rinsing and brushing, specks of food still get washed out.</li>
            <li>I hope to never havve anything more than x-rays from a dentist ever again because of the care I now give my teeth.</li>
            <li>i make it every day,i believe my tooth well better</li>
            <li>Going to look for a better brand</li>
            <li>it is cheap and effective device that I use often.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Water filling hole should have been at the top of bottom tank so that, even if the lid damaged, you can still use the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And when I had to travel I realized I have to get something more portable.</li>
            <li>It becomes very compact when collapsed, so it is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>The speed of irrigation of water could have been more aggresive, but ok for beginners.</li>
            <li>(the water-floss tools are so much better), so I was looking into a portable-type water flosser.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik Waterflosser is top notch as a plug-in model-- but too bulky for travel.  </li>
            <li>and it is OK to use.</li>
            <li>It gets water all over when my husband uses it in the sink, but if it is used in the shower it is OK.</li>
            <li>Worked okay for about a year, then just stopped.</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>He was raving about it, I checked the price which was okay and decided to order one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It,s,okay .I am glad I purchased it , I have to fill  it twice before I am finished</li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning, powerful for size.</li>
            <li>While these irrigators do not last forever, I am very happy with the results and was pleased to find one to replace mine.</li>
            <li>My gums never bleed any more.</li>
            <li>, the mirror has been sprayed more than once.</li>
            <li>Use and is not used any more once</li>
            <li>This is a great product!We use the whole family.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>suppose it&#x27;s better than nothing, and it *is*</li>
            <li>I tried once and it more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>and I love how well it cleans my teeth and mouth</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use it without batteries and the top seemed to be glued on.</li>
            <li>Nothing: screwdriver, paring knife, butter knife, banging it--nothing could budge that top.</li>
            <li>Not the best I would buy a different model.</li>
            <li>It is better than nothing, but I will try to find something else.  </li>
            <li>Much better than using the floss, and also more efficient.</li>
            <li>The unit died on me for reasons that affect many others if you read the reviews.  </li>
            <li>To many return trips and no longevity.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, some are just better.</li>
            <li>I traveled most of this summer including overseas.</li>
            <li>After using this product  for couple of months visited my dentist&#x27;s office and hygienist was impressed with overall improvement!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pressure seems comparable to the Waterpik \\&quot;portable\\&quot; which is much more bulky and had a plug in adapter.</li>
            <li>the Panasonic has stronger jets, looks better and it&#x27;s easier to carry around.</li>
            <li>What I particularly love about this unit is that it comes apart.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I am between love and like.  </li>
            <li>Things I love about this product, because&lt;br /&gt;it is collapsible</li>
            <li>I love that it collapses into itself &amp; self stores the tip.  </li>
            <li>I took it on the road and was able to use the batteries about 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li>, I ended up buying another two for my granddaughters as they love using it.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you are able to identify your nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that I will be able to take it with me on trips.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this one.  </li>
            <li>I bought a waterpik which does a more thorough job with more water power.  </li>
            <li>so maybe others will see better results?</li>
            <li>I would click &#x27;5 stars&#x27; except that I think it needs to hold more water; maybe another ounce?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The force of the water is much greater than our plug-in water pik.</li>
            <li>It is the best I have ever had for a portable device, but nothing beats the larger version.</li>
            <li>My gums have not bled or even been sore from Day One of using it, and the pressure doesn&#x27;t seem to be any greater than just a vigorous swish and rinse.  </li>
            <li>Away from home though, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a much better one than this Panasonic unit.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is light, handy.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought it could be.  </li>
            <li>but it sure does the job.</li>
            <li>but my wife and I used this device on our many road trips.  </li>
            <li>I guess they will get stronger over time :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Yes, I did that! :))</li>
            <li>Sometimes simpler is really better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the collapsible and portable design.</li>
            <li>This is good.. and it is easy to clean, etc..</li>
            <li>To get more, you have to order them..</li>
            <li>It puts out a stream of water with force rivaling the top of the line non-portable Waterpik</li>
            <li>I like it better than the Water Pik portable</li>
            <li>much better than oral-B...great for travelling</li>
            <li>and you can put a bit more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Love to be able to travel with my water flosser.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>love its portability and size.  </li>
            <li>Of course it could have had more power, all guys want more  power.</li>
            <li>All in all, I prefer this one much more.</li>
            <li>I used my WaterPik as a confident replacement for flossing when I didn&#x27;t have time for both.  </li>
            <li>but there have been many times that it would start collapsing while I was using it.  </li>
            <li>I have one and love using it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to drain all the water out at the end of your teeth cleaning so it doesn&#x27;t drip in your luggage.</li>
            <li>and I think you would be pleased with it.</li>
            <li>They seem to always improve on the model, and my mouth and teeth love the experience.</li>
            <li>The power button is conveniently located at the side, and I am able to use it without looking.</li>
            <li>and the tip should be longer but is designed  to fit in the flosser when not in use which does compact nicely for travel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I chucked the thing, and I&#x27;m going to have to find a more &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; water flosser.</li>
            <li>not a terrible product or anything but just not for me.</li>
            <li>Would like more settings.</li>
            <li>It does uses a lot of batteries, but I like it better than the electric noisy units.</li>
            <li>I guess it would be better than nothing for travel</li>
            <li>OK by me.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I wish I didnt have to buy more batteries</li>
            <li>It gets out more debris than flossing.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li>personally, i love the color :).</li>
            <li>I have dental implants and water flossing is a must to keep them healthy.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I made the purchase as I love the fact that it is battery operated.</li>
            <li>I love that it can use AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially enjoy that it is cordless!</li>
            <li>, Panasonic is an reliable brand, hope this one is better.</li>
            <li>I had a water pic for years,but this is simply the best.</li>
            <li>Compared it to Water-pic: holds more water, sturdier.</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product but water gets sprayed everywhere</li>
            <li>and since I love my oral irrigator I have at home, I knew I would miss it.  </li>
            <li>But I still love it.</li>
            <li>This Oral Irrigator was recommended to me by my oral hygenist, and I guess I need to read the descriptions better</li>
            <li>(okay the 6 more words required.)</li>
            <li>No yucky spatter all over the bathroom mirror and sink :)</li>
            <li>Works as well as a sink top model.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will admit i don&#x27;t love to floss</li>
            <li>l love this flosser.  </li>
            <li>This unit is better than my waterpik</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m used to more rounded ends.</li>
            <li>Love the portability and the price.</li>
            <li>It is more compact, better looking, it performs better than Waterpik&#x27;s product, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with the wires, the plug and the ineffective rechargeable unit.  </li>
            <li>Returned it and purchased the Toilettree one, much better.</li>
            <li>I was worried than when I travel I won&#x27;t be able to use my water-pik.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now and am very happy that after extensive research I picked this one to buy.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I just returned from a trip and enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>Vigorous flossing does more damage.</li>
            <li>Hoping it stays this way because I really am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Blow water pick  away easily, better design and build with quality material.</li>
            <li>Never again; I&#x27;ll pay a bit more and buy at Target.</li>
            <li>If it helps keep my gums and teeth healthy</li>
            <li>No cords is even better.</li>
            <li>A charged set of batteries lasts more than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when theyre healthy again they will not bleed when squirted so</li>
            <li>I love this panasonic</li>
            <li>This functions better than the portable name-brand that has just died because it would not hold a charge anymore -- nor would it work plugged in.</li>
            <li>and it helps to keep my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>Better than the ones which are electric.  </li>
            <li>So much more convenient to use with batteries.  </li>
            <li>I always love the  way it makes my teeth and mouth feel.</li>
            <li>This is a great Product and very Portable as well.</li>
            <li>So, a combination of both is better for oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GOING TO GIVE IT SOME MORE TIME</li>
            <li>OK ....</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>You would think Panasonic could do better on the quality part.</li>
            <li>BETTER THAN THE ORAL B ONE I HAD</li>
            <li>The plug in ones are definitely better to the point of pain on a 10.</li>
            <li>This is my second one and am very happy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to set up, and the irrigator tip is easy to insert.  </li>
            <li>Waterpik I already have, and I must say that the two speeds are &#x27;very strong&#x27; and &#x27;blast the gunk off stuff strong&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Very useful and handy in cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>Very good, have more quality, it is suitable to go out with the usualVery good, have more quality, it is suitable to go out with the usual</li>
            <li>A very nice and very portable unit.  </li>
            <li>works ok could be more powerful, easy to use, nice size for travel, the way it folds up is a nice size</li>
            <li>So, great super product that dies really quickly - you decide if that is what you want to buy?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for two days, twice a day every day, but I love everything about it!!!  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful and works well!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad - just fill it once more!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad - just fill it once more!</li>
            <li>An oral irrigator is a great aid to periodontal health, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this one in the short time I&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
            <li>It works great as long as you keep good batteries in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great option for anyone in the market, but particularly for those who travel or want to use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Tip allows you to get between teeth and clean close to gums&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap and cost effective</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Toilet Tree is still the best cordless  flosser, but doesn&#x27;t collapse for travel.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s kinda yucky, it feels good seeing food particles trapped in between teeth and gums getting flushed out so easily with this wonderful irrigator.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, great power, and convenience.</li>
            <li>Works perfect, batteries last enough, good quality materials and good water pressure modes.</li>
            <li>At the end of the week, I take the used NiZn/NiMH battery pair home and recharge them (each in their own chargers, I have to use the special charger that came with the NiZN for the NiZN battery).    </li>
            <li>Easy to use, very portable - great for trips</li>
            <li>If you like it strong as in number 10 on your plug in water pik, then this is more like number 4 at the most.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;design-wise, this irrigator was truly portable, where the nozzle came off easily and fit nicely inside the casing when not in use.</li>
            <li>The stream is not as strong as I like it to be for daily use, but for a battery-powered travel irrigator, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel very clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>It does the job and makes your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>I have dental implants and it keeps the space between the teeth and gums very clean.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have a very clean mouth when I&#x27;ve finished using it.  </li>
            <li>It very light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Being powered by normal batteries is a great plus for travelling (no need to bring chargers)</li>
            <li>This is the best water pick type product I have come accross in a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s design is pretty good.</li>
            <li>If your willing to put up with filling twice and replacing (2) AA&#x27;s after about forty uses then this will be a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This might be a good thing if you&#x27;re concerned about damage from the higher pressure Waterpick.</li>
            <li>but considering the price, two years was a pretty good</li>
            <li>Pretty good product, does the job.</li>
            <li>The replacement was not expensive and proved to be a good means to keep on with use of the product without having to buy new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I used to own the &#x27;waterpik&#x27; model which I also liked but this one is comparable but more compact and the design more clever for travels.</li>
            <li>Easy, Easy, Easy!</li>
            <li>Did an excellent job most of the time with one filling, but occasionally needed two fillings after a rich grainy dinner.</li>
            <li>I am sure over time I will become faster and more accurate.</li>
            <li>That plug part could be designed better, it comes out of it&#x27;s hinges too easily</li>
            <li>I can do a very quick rinse with one filling, but for morning and before bed I go ahead and refill it a couple more times which takes a couple of seconds and is not a problem for me.    </li>
            <li>Top notch and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I wish one could control the speed rate of irrigation flow more easily than&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth better than flossing, collapses for easy storage and traveling.  </li>
            <li>Being able to easily pack</li>
            <li>I love that this is so easy to get out and use, and that it is water proof.  </li>
            <li>Another reason I love it is because it is so easily portable.  </li>
            <li>Most of all it was easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, dries well (better than reviews suggest),</li>
            <li>And I love the fact that I can take it on trips easily.</li>
            <li>easy to use - no electrical cord like on most</li>
            <li>most users mentioned it must be filled with the water more than twice while flossing.</li>
            <li>So, this is perfect for me, as it works very well and does not require much space.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use our counter-top Waterpik these days because the Panasonic Oral Irrigator is simply more convenient and just as effective in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will get more comfortable as I use it</li>
            <li>This unit is battery powered and produces a very strong pulse to clean between the teeth quite well.  </li>
            <li>Great time-saver--don&#x27;t have to floss nearly as often!</li>
            <li>Works great so far!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best; Battery-driven, Stays strong  a long time, the Exchange nozzle doesn&#x27;t fall out during use.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic oral irrigator was exactly what I was looking for: something that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, is easy to use, and does a good job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This one works just as good as the higher priced ones and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Both are using this often, and glad it works fine.</li>
            <li>(I do have cleaner mirrors now having to clean them after use of the flosser!)</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of Waterpiks over the years and the latest one I got is fine at home.  </li>
            <li>And no need to worry about food on my braces because it will clean them all!</li>
            <li>Good for travel when you can&#x27;t or do not wish to carry the large Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I own two but the first one still hasnt worn out yet!  </li>
            <li>we love being able to clean our teeth inside the shower.</li>
            <li>I leave it there for 24 hours and then am able to clean it and make sure any accumulated crud comes out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to refill, but my favorite aspect is using rechargeable AA batteries.</li>
            <li>I have used three times, this portable water flossing is very convenient, very clean , the most important is that it allows me to develop good habits.</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower is another HUGE plus.</li>
            <li>My old unit was great until the on-off switch stopped working.</li>
            <li>But most importantly, it clears out food particles that brushing and flossing miss.</li>
            <li>Oral health is important and the easier the equipment, the better.</li>
            <li>the water tank is perfect for that one use (and you&#x27;re supposed to empty it after every</li>
            <li>If anyone finds a better model, I would enjoy hearing about it</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy the dentists chair, by all means get one for everyone in your family and coerce, bribe, and threaten them to use it as this thing cleans better then any toothbrush could ever do.</li>
            <li>and cheap product from panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could have included more nozzles though.</li>
            <li>Just got adult braces and travel often, so this was a great find.</li>
            <li>Great product, bought 5 so far for myself and family members!&lt;br /&gt;Hmmmm...</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s a great buy for my money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic Irrigator for a month and so far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It would then be better to opt for the lower setting so as to get comfortable with the irrigator.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has plenty of force and a thoughtful, elegant design.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice addition to the oral hygiene arsenal, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the perfect one.</li>
            <li>It is light enough for travel, I also take it to work,  and the water pressure is good - feels as good as when I use my electric water-pik.</li>
            <li>This does exactly the job it needs to and I am very glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>For what it is it works welll but can&#x27;t help but feel that a more powerful model with a greater water capacity would be better.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>SO FAR GREAT.......</li>
            <li>using panasonic now for a month, know why i loved it so much before.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic has just as good jet power, and is very convenient to use, being that it is cordless.</li>
            <li>Works very well on batteries and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>I keep another pair of NiZn/NiMH batteries ready to go, so I&#x27;m never without good power.</li>
            <li>It worked very well, had good pressure, and held a sufficient amount of water.</li>
            <li>good quality, reasonable price...</li>
            <li>Thank you for good item and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact but way too powerful, even on the lower setting.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of forceful when the batteries are fresh but there is a lower speed you can use then.  </li>
            <li>is powerful and nice to handle</li>
            <li>Loved it so much, that had to get it as a gift for others and everyone loves it.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much I&#x27;d bring it with me during training and workshops</li>
            <li>Nice unit and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It really does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic Oral Irrigator was a good buy for me, as it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room on the vanity as the tank variety with a hose.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very useful, if the power of the water is stronger, it will be better.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s light and easy to travel and store.</li>
            <li>It does an adequate cleaning job (which is the most important point!).</li>
            <li>Very compact, easy to use and does a good job</li>

            <li>Fits in hand nicely, switch is in just the right spot.</li>
            <li>I bought a Waterpik in order to clean under it and it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this although I can&#x27;t compare it to the original Waterpik since I haven&#x27;t used that appliance in so many years.</li>
            <li>But I agree with other reviewers that this is the best out there.</li>
            <li>Mouth odor and gives a significant contribution to the gums healthy.</li>
            <li>but true!)</li>
            <li>The freedom of not having a water line, tank, and AC cord make this model more user friendly.  </li>

            <li>Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The water jet is quite strong, I would say as strong as my home water pick.  </li>
            <li>Although the pressure of the water is not as strong as Waterpik, it is portable and wireless.</li>
            <li>I am used to the WaterPik&#x27;s strong pressure.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>The spray is strong and when you are done I have to run the rest of the water in the shower or you will have water everywhere.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as the plug in but gets job done</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest you do not purchase this device.  </li>
            <li>The pulsating was not as strong as I had had with my WaterPik.</li>
            <li>Flossing was never my strong point</li>
            <li>I like this but the stream that comes out shoots way to strongly.  </li>
            <li>Water pressure is not that strong as those countertop models but that should be understood because it just uses 2 AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong on lithium batteries.</li>
            <li>Two settings for water jet are not too strong.</li>
            <li>Strong product that I keep in the shower.</li>
            <li>strong flow...works well</li>
            <li>The batteries that came with it are still going strong and I have used it at leat twice a day on a twelve day trip</li>
            <li>I changed the batteries out in about 2-3 weeks to keep the power strong.</li>
            <li>Regular batteries, good  power and closes up nicely to a travel size.  .</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this waterpik.</li>
            <li>Well it wasn&#x27;t in my mouth all the way or a good angle, and my left ear got a nice irrigation.  </li>
            <li>It provides strong bursts of water into hard-to-reach spots, &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any problems with gum irritation.</li>
            <li>The water pressure is not so strong as that of the waterpik.</li>
            <li>Strong jet&lt;br</li>
            <li>The power is not as strong as the one I used to have</li>
            <li>using it, I stand over the sink, but the water splashback is so strong it hits my mirror, goes running everywhere...</li>
            <li>Not as strong a power washer as home, plug in wall, tank unit, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>scared it&#x27;d be too strong for my gums.</li>
            <li>I think two is a lil strong for my liking...</li>
            <li>Seems decently sealed - a good thing since the used mouth rinse runs all over it.</li>
            <li>I have done damage to myself with water piks that plug in because the water pressure can be so strong.</li>
            <li>If alkaline batteries are too strong for you, start out with rechargeable batteries until your gums get healthier.</li>
            <li>This is not as strong as a plug in irrigator</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic every night for about 2 weeks now on the 1st set of AA batteries .... still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Not a substitute for floss and not as strong a flow as the waterpik</li>
            <li>They need some strong competition in this niche market.</li>
            <li>The size of the water tank and the pressure of the pulses are perfect for cleaning with a single fill in my experience and it&#x27;s easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>and I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>he recommended I floss more and he ordered some special mouth wash.</li>
            <li>One full tank is perfect for single use.</li>
            <li>compact/fast and outlasts any other product in it&#x27;s catagory, Try It You&#x27;ll Love It!!!</li>
            <li>Works fine and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I opened my mouth and gave the bathroom mirror a nice wash.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s collapsible and pretty handy.</li>
            <li>Not bad for its price, but needs more capacity of water for 1 time usage, I think.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>If you lean forward over the sink and cup your hand over the top of  your mouth you can use it easily and quickly if you don&#x27;t have the time or desire to use it while showering.</li>
            <li>It is easy to store, easy to use, and a comfortable size.  </li>
            <li>This waterpik is perfect for people who have braces it helps keeping your hardware a little bit more clean.</li>
            <li>you must or preferably use during shower, tend to splash a lot due to its power, for traveling it&#x27;s the best thing you can own, really helpful.</li>
            <li>this company (Good As New Electronics) refused because they claim the box is opened.  </li>
            <li>this review will help anyone intend to order this product at Good As New Electronics.</li>
            <li>This works just fine.</li>
            <li>Have used this for a while now, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Waterpik WP100 for years and it has been fine, but it doesn&#x27;t travel well.  </li>
            <li>Product delivers as advertised, and is easy to hold comfortably.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be replacing my electric model, but this will work out fine for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 weeks now and batteries are still working fine.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s cheap considering its nice function.</li>
            <li>Despite all of my high-voltage experiments with this irrigator, it has held up and continues to run fine.    </li>
            <li>use rechargeable battery, even though the doc says not too, and that still works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used it for about 6 weeks and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>It does take some getting used to, but once I did, which took about one or two uses,, it was fine.  </li>
            <li>It is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for since my gums have started bleeding more and more.</li>
            <li>I like this one because it does have 2 settings which are just fine for me..</li>
            <li>I tested it and it worked fine with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked fine for about a month and then went belly up.  </li>
            <li>As a portable travel device, it is fine.</li>
            <li>works fine, wish a bit cheaper</li>
            <li>and it is working just fine.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but the door to the tank keeps coming off  </li>
            <li>First oral irrigator I have used (so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others), but the product seems great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, light, and easily packable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fine irrigator.</li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>I think this might deter me but in the shower it is fine</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Deal of the Day for about $26, and for the most part, have been pretty satisfied with the performance of Panasonic&#x27;s version of the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine...</li>
            <li>It works fine .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working fine though.</li>
            <li>Does the job, light weight and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>still works fine, had it 3yrs.</li>
            <li>When I returned home the gasket worked and the item did not leak, it was fine.</li>
            <li>Had this for two and a half years now, still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I immediately ignored the recommendation not to use rechargeable batteries, and it works fine, so that is an option too.  </li>
            <li>They worked fine for around six months, and then gave out.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not as strong as my electric WaterPik and the reservoir must be filled a couple of times per use, it&#x27;s compact and convenient for travel, which is just what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>Love it - amazing how much is left after brushing - very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Much more power, easier to clean, more convienient, priced right.</li>
            <li>Because the tank is hosted within the handheld, it will take a few uses before becoming accustomed to holding it comfortably and learning how to best maneuver it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very powerful though and easy to fill.</li>
            <li>EASY to use and very powerful just like my corded model from another manufacturer that I have used for years.</li>
            <li>It really is very powerful and easy to use, once I got the batteries in.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the water steam is very powerful.</li>
            <li>It does the same thing and is great when travelling, as it fits easily into your toiletry case.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use - easy to clean.</li>
            <li>As far as the power goes I thought it had a good strong flow at times that too varied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, effective, and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>They should work just fine for you too if you can make them fit.</li>
            <li>Fully waterproof, good for use in the shower (may be a good place to use this as you can make a mess with the water pouring out of your mouth over the sink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The irrigators can remove large stuff stuck between teeth, but are not as effective at removing food that sits below the gum line.</li>
            <li>The tank holds a large amount of water, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use , very convenient !</li>
            <li>I have had Braun and Waterpik oral irrigators over the years and this little beauty is the best of all.</li>
            <li>Pushed out a corn-on-the-cob fragment AFTER brushing, flossing, and gum stimulating the very first evening!</li>
            <li>This irrigator was just what I expected and it did a very good job.</li>
            <li>I feel tempted to update to this model even though my original keeps on going strong.</li>
            <li>Fair stream, ok for trip, best outside or in tup water leaks a little, have to move along or refill.</li>
            <li>Very good, worthy of promotion, especially have tooth decay teeth clean</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan.  </li>
            <li>a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want a huge unit taking up a lot of space and know myself, if this wasn&#x27;t out, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Product was as described and reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li>(Make sure you get the kind that don&#x27;t self-discharge; they&#x27;ll be marked as \\&quot;pre-charged\\&quot; on the shelf.)  </li>
            <li>It has been a huge hit.</li>
            <li>It works awesome, even for a 9 year old to clear food, etc.  </li>
            <li>Not for everyday use but, as a travel accessory, perfect!</li>
            <li>An experienced user may have different feelings</li>
            <li>More powerful than I thought</li>
            <li>Pansonic is just as described; works beautifully; is light weight; and I will even feel comfortable taking it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband as the model I was using is no longer available.</li>
            <li>great initially</li>
            <li>This time round, I started to shop in Amazon which provides an excellent source of reviews by users.</li>
            <li>I never realized how important flossing is until I used this item.</li>
            <li>If you love your smile and care for your teeth than you need to invest in this Panasonic Oral Irrigatior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by Suheiwa</li>
            <li>This goes neatly into a drawer and is easy to clean, so that&#x27;s a winner.  </li>
            <li>Light and water proof.</li>
            <li>liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>IT IS FABULOUS ---</li>
            <li>It is fantastic for traveling.</li>
            <li>--you need a sink close by for the mouth drainage--but it is compact and could easily fit in a shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>However, it is important to me to have an oral irrigator which does a thorough job.</li>
            <li>and you always have one hand free to turn the spray on/off/up/down as you need to.</li>
            <li>Gum health is so important</li>
            <li>This is a great product, will drain out any left overs from between the Gums.</li>
            <li>I prefer the battery operated ones since I used it primarily out of the country.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use fresh batteries if you are going to used it twice a day for a week or so.  </li>
            <li>This one fit the bill well.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to work like your more powerful machine though.  </li>
            <li>This item is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this product today</li>
            <li>It works for me and that is what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>the water jet actually made my gum blood one time (there is a slower speed setting, great.)</li>
            <li>can comfortably given this 3.5-to-4 stars for a travel unit.</li>
            <li>But it stopped fuctioning after 3 months of light use.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir is easy to clean and fill.  </li>
            <li>Simple, efficient and great design.</li>
            <li>i can‘t wash my tooth smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have had another irrigator made by Waterpik that is much more powerful.  </li>
            <li>was (although they were quite happy to let me fill their pockets, one periodontist charged me $1000 for essentially doing nothing.)  </li>
            <li>But being a tad cheap, I bought  a Battery and Charger Set (4 batteries) along with it.</li>
            <li>Can be stored in the shower and used there as well keeping the bathroom mirror spot free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much yuck gets lodged between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Great for travel - compact in size but still close to the power of my big Water Pik model with 10 settings that I have for home use.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this irrigator after reading all the reviews on all of the irrigators available.  </li>
            <li>By the way, it is easy to disassemble to clean every so often.</li>
            <li>Has amazing power and seems to be built very well.  </li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to holding the bulky machine but after some use, I felt comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>It gets used several times a day, EVERY day, and works great.  </li>
            <li>both stopped working just after the available return date for a credit.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Maybe they will send me a free replacement?</li>
            <li>It has been great for my personal use.</li>
            <li>I use the lower pressure setting because it has such great pressure.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that it&#x27;s battery operated.</li>
            <li>I use a more powerful, plugged in WaterPik, to rinse out the gunk between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is too bulky to comfortably handle in-use.</li>
            <li>Light weight,easy to use, reliable.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I really enjoy using my Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ll enjoy this a lot when I travel.  </li>
            <li>Amazing how much debris that it removes over brushing.</li>
            <li>There was no portable version of an irrigator available in Australia</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold when using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap enough!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so this thing is great, but still think flossing is necessary (though maybe not every night??).</li>
            <li>It of course does a fantastic job in the irrigation department.  </li>
            <li>We have had this for a few years and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li>Fantastic irrigator.  </li>
            <li>and I am free of any gum disease, and all my pockets are 3mm now.</li>
            <li>and I am free of any gum disease, and all my pockets are 3mm now.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase &amp; would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>But I would recommend the more powerful plug-in flossers for day-to day.  </li>
            <li>Way more fun than flossing.</li>
            <li>It works so well that my orthodontists thinks I am doing a great job flossing daily.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness Amazon has such a great return policy.</li>
            <li>Unit is compact and light weight.</li>
            <li>Works well for me; irrigates and removes debris; water capacity just enough water to do the job;cordless and portable; great for travel.</li>
            <li>B003OC74SW Replacement nozzles]] are available, so the irrigator can be shared.  </li>
            <li>Great irrigator, replaces an identical one used intensively for several years.</li>
            <li>My mouth definitely feels cleaner after using it, and my dentist seems to be happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have confirmed it was before the order was processed to ship, and what they told me was just return it when I receive it.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and effective for travel.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for travel and everyday use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s comfortable to use and</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of using this thing, I still don&#x27;t have a comfortable way of using this product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and carry in your bag.</li>
            <li>Compacts to fit in travel toiletries bag.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job of getting &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out from between teeth and in the gums.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still using my Panasonic because it does a fantastic job</li>
            <li>I liked this so much for travel that I used it for every day.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t fit in your hand well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s portability is also an indispensable feature if you&#x27;re on the road all the time.</li>
            <li>&quot; the 350W could almost fit in palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are a couple available with separate reservoirs.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I each took one of these to Europe with us recently and they worked great.</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit because it was small,relatively light weight and used replaceable batteries.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The stench was absolutely nauseating, and I had to spend 5 minutes scrubbing the outside and the inside of the product as best</li>
            <li>Panasonic offers a superior product.    </li>
            <li>Have used others with more complex systems and like the battery system best.  </li>
            <li>So far so good and hoping my dentist will see the  results.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nicely portable, decent price.  </li>
            <li>We recently took it on a trip and we couldn&#x27;t be more delighted with it.</li>
            <li>This is far superior to the Waterpik that you have to plug in.  </li>
            <li>A great product if you are a frequent traveller and need a powerful irrigator.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygenist was also impressed, and said I wouldn&#x27;t really benefit from flossing extra.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik is better as a home model (but not by much), and it, of course, holds a lot more water than any portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>far superior to flossing.</li>
            <li>great product, my wife and myself love it, small but does better job that the big one I had, plus beautiful price.</li>
            <li>At home, I&#x27;d still recommend a good plug in unit with a larger water supply and a bit more power.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Good pressure option for those who are sensitive</li>
            <li>This is a really great device and is very powerful for only running on 2 batteries (included in box).  </li>
            <li>Tis is a very useful tool to keep it clean and is easy for her to use.  </li>
            <li>The flosser is pretty strong!</li>
            <li>I use a counter top Water Pic, but I&#x27;m sure there are other good units to be had.</li>
            <li>I would like the water capacity to be greater; but it is the right size for travel.</li>
            <li>To top it all off, the water reservoir leaks, should you not use the irrigator right away.</li>
            <li>This is the single best option, other brands can&#x27;t compete (specially in the battery section)&lt;br /&gt;Great flow and battery life also, great price!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li>I have had the original WaterPik, which plugs into the wall, and it is much more useful.    </li>
            <li>I love the amount of water the pick holds, just enough to get a good clean.</li>
            <li>It travels really well!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, very nice design</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is also very powerful.</li>
            <li>Very useful appliance for teeth and gums hygienе and protection</li>
            <li>Very useful product.</li>
            <li>Wish the reservoir was a bit bigger, but it&#x27;s wonderful to have this in a handheld version without the bulky bin and tubes like some of the older models.  </li>
            <li>Both the old and new have some great features: A powerful motorized pump and a nicely sized water resevoir you can collapse for travel.</li>
            <li>but smooth is easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Compact, portable and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>You can buy replacement probe tips, and these are quick and easy to change.  </li>
            <li>Not as strong as I would have like but adequate for a battery powered item.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use and quickly rinses out all of the food particles between my teeth.</li>
            <li>is that the pressure isn&#x27;t super strong.</li>
            <li>With the two speed settings, it is easy for my 7 and 9 year old to use and sure helps them do a better job than just brushing alone.  </li>
            <li>Quick to set up and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Refill is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>do wish that the power stayed super strong throughout the battery life</li>
            <li>Excellent little machine!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to set up and ready to use.</li>
            <li>It does run out of water fast, but is very easily refilled.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that you can pull the reservoir off and clean it and its most important to let it completely dry out between use.</li>
            <li>I put warm water in it and use the high power.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very fresh and clean after using this every morning.</li>
            <li>It  folds up very well to pack for a trip, with the jet piece easily removed and stored safely in the unit.</li>
            <li>It feels really good on your teeth, portable and easy to store even if you have a tiny bathroom.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, however, I am so appreciative to those before me who gave positive reviews which led me to buy this product, that I feel compelled to pay it forward for those who may be considering this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted a water flosser for years, and I was so excited to get this one.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this water pik when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>This model is easy to use, clean and store, and really cleans my mouth and gums on top of brushing.  </li>
            <li>May be this issue is unique to me</li>
            <li>I have used a original &amp;#34;Water Pick&amp;#34; years ago, but never like it.  </li>
            <li>ON/Off switch is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I filled it full of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>and I love that it does fold up pretty compactly.</li>
            <li>I was a able to return it and get another WaterPik when the first one would no longer work after 6 months.      </li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t lose and it&#x27;s quality is even better than those in a higher price range.  </li>
            <li>Powerful!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get it,</li>
            <li>Original Panasonic portable oral irrigator purchased solely for travel purposes from Amazon March 23, 2012.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small size is simply perfect for traveling or when one&#x27;s away from the house.    </li>
            <li>My original one \\&quot;died\\&quot; and</li>
            <li>And, my dental hygenist was always impressed at the small amount of plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li>That is why I then ordered replacement tips for my WaterPik(the original reason for my shopping for an oral irrigator</li>
            <li>Still working great after a long time.  </li>
            <li>have successfully introduced this gadget to 9 of my other friends who love it after they tried using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After this product was opened and found with inferior quality, it was repackaged in the original box and never been used.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost!  </li>
            <li>I tried the original Water Pic some years ago and gave it away.  </li>
            <li>Leave a comment if you have a question about it that maybe I can help, and like it if you find it useful!</li>
            <li>this is the best option, I used Waterpik and it didnt last more than 6 months, plus Panasonic is smaller to travel with.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product in preparation with plans to begin wearing braces.  </li>
            <li>She uses it once or twice a day, and the original batteries are still working.  </li>
            <li>I would, however, recommend the original non-portable WaterPik that uses an electric wall socket for power.</li>
            <li>Panasonic products have never disappointed.</li>
            <li>First Dental Check up confirmed my review!</li>
            <li>Was excited to find this product on line.</li>
            <li>Filler cap fits tighter, doesn&#x27;t fall off like original cap.</li>
            <li>I had used my first Panasonic Irrigator for 2 years and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Portable and travel friendly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend because its fun and it works!</li>
            <li>I need something with more consistent quality.</li>
            <li>the way its WAY better than the oral B irrigator, and the ora-jet which I bought first at CVS.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as a regular counter top model, but has a fairly good pressure.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested in keeping their gums and teeth healthy</li>
            <li>Once extended, the nozzle and water reservoir become accessible.  </li>
            <li>Was able to get some sticky smores out after a girl scouts outing pretty easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And after weeks of use, still using original batteries.  </li>
            <li>I originally got this for travel use</li>
            <li>Def worth it!</li>
            <li>My gum was swollen because my braces were tightened and since I started using this a week ago I have already noticed significant improvement.</li>
            <li>This irrigator is best when you can&#x27;t floss yet because of time constraints (or you&#x27;re just being lazy like me).</li>
            <li>Need to reread original documents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for about a month, using it nightly, and I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY !</li>
            <li>OTHERWISE WORTH EVERY PENNY  !  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean, as it comes apart very easily, and it has a very short water circuit (with the Waterpik</li>
            <li>/&gt;The $35.00 Panasonic unit holds more water, has a more efficient, 2-speed sprayer, and is easier to clean &amp; dry between use, since the spray tip is very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>User friendly and my teeth feel clean after using.</li>
            <li>even on the lowest setting, This is my first oral irrigator and so far its pretty good!</li>
            <li>(yes, I put in new batteries) and were no longer effective.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it now works like new.</li>
            <li>After brushing and flossing it still finds food particles to clean out.</li>
            <li>You can pry off the switch and clean under it.  </li>
            <li>I still do not  know how to clean inside of lower part of the mouth as I can&#x27;t adjust the nozzle to keep water in side the mouth.</li>
            <li>Since this product has arrived my teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>Mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, powerful and uses AA sized batteries so you don&#x27;t have to keep charging it or have yet another charger plugged into your wall.</li>
            <li>I use the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser at home to clean my teeth, but for cleaning my teeth at work after lunch, or for those times when I&#x27;m travelling, this Panasonic Oral Irrigator can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I may need to spring for a costlier Water-Pik to clean teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Needed a travel water jet device to help clean my teeth while traveling.</li>
            <li>Water tank size is ample for me clean all my teeth.</li>
            <li>pleased I got this, as it comes in really handy for dislodging dinner bits and such.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, powerful enough for my braces!</li>
            <li>so that when I realized I was going on a week-long trip, I didn&#x27;t want to be without SOMEthing to clean out the gunk.</li>
            <li>He uses it to help clean around his braces.</li>
            <li>So I went cordless, yes battery operated, but I take it with me on my travels and my oral health has improved and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>You are supposed to clean from the bottom of the tooth up</li>
            <li>I really love the idea of this, and it&#x27;s clear that it is a winner for most people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is plenty powerful (two flow rates to choose from), fits easily into your hand during use,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Originally, I wanted something to help clean around my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t know what clean teeth are until you have tried this.</li>
            <li>This is powerful and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and now I need to clean my mouth after every meal and snack.</li>
            <li>I clean inside the cylinder periodically by using hypochloride bleach(Chlorox).Don&#x27;t seem to hurt it.</li>
            <li>So far this works better and is more convenient than the 2 Water Pik products I bought.</li>
            <li>This product is inadequate to clean gums and between teeth amd</li>
            <li>I clean it out by swishing detergent and running it with detergent in it, and then desinfecting it with diluted Listerine about once a week.</li>
            <li>Can be taken apart to clean it.</li>
            <li>It would be worth the cost if it were just a bit more powerful</li>
            <li>wish that is lasted longer and that I knew of a way to clean out the grime.  </li>
            <li>Mouth never feels clean.</li>
            <li>easey to store and clean.</li>
            <li>Plenty powerful for travel and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>it help me to keep tooth clean and shine</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>(I do, of course use super-floss to clean implant posts and under bridges)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be prepared to clean your sink and mirror area with each use.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll get the Waterpik traveller&#x27;s one, and use this to clean the grout in my bathroom?</li>
            <li>case.&lt;br /&gt;There is not way to totally clean all the mold out the grown inside the water tank because you cannot take it apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li>dont feel clean with out it.</li>
            <li>I bought this on my dentist&#x27;s reccomendation to buy some type of oral irrigator to clean around my braces.  </li>
            <li>Clean it in your bathtub or shower stall, so it doesn&#x27;t spray all over your sink/counter/mirror.</li>
            <li>You can clean the inside out.  </li>
            <li>I do like the compact size, and the force of the water flow does clean.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands of water flossers, and this is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>We purchased a water pik type of product at the suggestion of the orthodontist to help us keep her teeth and the palate expander clean.  </li>
            <li>This was my 3rd try for a travel oral irrigator - by far the best yet.  </li>
            <li>I can now keep my teeth and gums clean always.</li>
            <li>It is also easier to clean and store.</li>
            <li>I have braces on my upper teeth, so good cleaning is really important to me.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t clean my teeth without it.</li>
            <li>On speed 2 it works well to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth clean at work.</li>
            <li>that it can really clean up the teeth/</li>
            <li>Do not use to clean your ears.</li>
            <li>with this irrigator, I got clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t figured out how to clean the tank and don&#x27;t want  to be forcing mold spores into my gums.</li>
            <li>your mouth and teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really clean like I thought it should.</li>
            <li>You can also soak the Jet Pick in Peroxide overnight to clean it out and help keep mold from growing in there.  </li>
            <li>Tips: keep it clean always.</li>
            <li>It is a must for dental hygiene and keeping your gums clean.</li>
            <li>I clean all the crevices with toothpicks and Q-tips.</li>
            <li>The speed on \\&quot;2\\&quot; is quite strong (with fresh batteries).  </li>
            <li>Keep the batteries fresh, carry extras to keep the power strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks its still working nicely on the 2 batteries , good pressure and flow .&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 speeds and the high speed with a fairly new battery gives you a great amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li>BUT, it can&#x27;t be taken apart to clean inside, so a lot of gunk gets deposited inside and is quite visible through the clear plastic, it feels most unsanitary to me!  </li>
            <li>Decided to get this oral irrigator after looking at all the positive reviews on Amazon and glad that it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>read many positive reviews of this product before I purchased and it met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li>Although I liked the fact that the plug in models are more convenient as far as not having to worry about changing batteries and power is always consistent.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all, I&#x27;m okay with it because I feel it is much more sanitary than most irrigators with the long, coiled tube.  </li>
            <li>My old Water Pik was much better!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really easy to travel with as the nozzle fits quite nicely into its own little space.  </li>
            <li>Although only about 2/3 as powerful as a plug-in, it still does a very nice job.  </li>
            <li>With the lower pressure of the spray comes the added problem that it appears to clog very easily, from what, I do not know but requires significant &amp;#34;due diligence&amp;#34;  to be sure it will operate with out problems when you next use it.  </li>
            <li>The product is designed well and easy to understand right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s so easy to use and the price is right.</li>
            <li>strong stream, and size is just right.  </li>
            <li>I use Sanyo, but I am sure there are other good solutions.</li>
            <li>It is a lot easier to use and keep clean, than the full size water pik.</li>
            <li>Other wise it is OK.  </li>
            <li>I originally owned a waterpik thinking that for such a pricy product, it had to be good.  </li>
            <li>I take a cheese grater with a turn handle and insert the bar of Dove soap into the grater, then turn the handle many times to produce soap bits that land in a large,  microwaveable measuring cup.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, if they made the unit to hold more water, it would become too large for travel.  </li>
            <li>Much more convienient than taking the large irrigator system.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require special batteries (it uses 2 AA batteries).  </li>
            <li>I got this for my husband who had just got his braces and was having issues using the special floss from his orthodontist.</li>
            <li>I went in to the bathtub and after a very wet struggle with the device, I didn&#x27;t see anything better than a good floss could achieve.</li>
            <li>An incredible little machine.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A is very efficient with two pulse strengths, looooong battery life, easy to fill, easy to collapse for storage or travel.  </li>
            <li>An good device to clean my teeth regularly toghther with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The device does a very good job of cleaning out trapped food in bridgework and between teeth.  </li>
            <li>The power is pretty impressive for a little battery powered machine.  </li>
            <li>It was a little more powerful the I thought it was going to be but workes great at cleaning my sons braces after he eats.</li>
            <li>Water pressure is adequate for me as of now, and I am surprised how can any one want more pressure on their teeth!</li>
            <li>More pressure and capacity would be nice, but are not possible with a highly portable unit running two AA batteries - I am satisfied with the compromises made in this product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product,after 2sec of use-mouth full of water but nothing cleanse up,and need to fill with water so many times to finish whole mouth</li>
            <li>I can use the more powerful speed as well as the lower for more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really great stuff, but I still not really used to it.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic Oral Irrigator is a great device for making sure you get all the small food particles out of your teeth.</li>
            <li>Good basic irrigator/losser.</li>
            <li>but, that said, it is definitely good enough.</li>
            <li>The true test will be if the results are what the dentist is looking for.  </li>
            <li>This waterpick is so much better than the one I had used befor that I paid almost twice as much as for this one.</li>
            <li>No ugly cord laying on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>It seems to work as well as the full size pic.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye dentists :-)</li>
            <li>She loved it, as it got a lot of the gunk out of the braces and was also quite compact (relatively speaking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;During my last visit to the dentist&#x27;s office, she said I was doing a good job flossing.  </li>
            <li>B0027LSEPS Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A]]I purchased this because I don&#x27;t have the counter space for a full sized product.</li>
            <li>It works well but is bulky because you have to hold the whole thing instead of just the tip when using the counter top type.</li>
            <li>It does such a good job cleaning that I don&#x27;t need to floss any longer.</li>
            <li>Good quality, low price</li>
            <li>and I will water floss as long as I have my own teeth!</li>
            <li>Overall, it does a good job.</li>
            <li>I would pour in a lid full of listrine for every time I use it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has been tremendously helpful in keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li>I was looking good Oral irrigator which is not too big to handle.  </li>
            <li>Currently I am using water picks, not as good as favorably portable items.</li>
            <li>It is good while it is last, but it can stop working anytime.  </li>
            <li>In six months, it&#x27;s full of mold.</li>
            <li>of course it&#x27;s a good product - it&#x27;s japanese.</li>
            <li>The tank holds just enough water for one good flossing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good enough value for the money, but that&#x27;s about all I can say about it.</li>
            <li>I basically full.</li>
            <li>water tank is good enough for one use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit works good with my rechargeable enloops and the pressure seems to be the same as the included alkaline AA batteries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original Review: For years I have thought that a portable water pick would be a good idea, but never thought until recently to see if one existed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this device.</li>
            <li>After using an electricity powered water irrigator, was pleasantly surprised to find that this portable battery-operated irrigator does an equally effective job.</li>
            <li>A good product, given the current options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fits well in the hand hold just enough water and has good pressure.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic has made good electronics for years and this one is no different.   </li>
            <li>This works really well and love that I can take it when traveling.</li>
            <li>Panasonic Oral Irrigator is the closest I&#x27;ve found to a full size</li>
            <li>This unit has a nifty motor that pumps at a powerful but comfortable rate.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is good, but the durability leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li>For a travel product, Panasonic seems to have hit a sweet spot.</li>
            <li>If you like the Waterpik Waterflosser, you will likely consider the Panasonic portable as a good temporary alternative.  </li>
            <li>I would not have bought it at full price.</li>
            <li>Just be ready to turn it off because it holds more water than your mouth can, so if you&#x27;re not paying attention, something is in for a shower.  </li>
            <li>Pressure is equivalent to &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; on my full size water pic (scale goes up to 10).  </li>
            <li>I have to refill 3 times for a full rinse.  </li>
            <li>Good for occasional use on a trip.</li>
            <li>This product arrived today and it might be a good thing, but the battery cover will turn to the open position but there seems to be no way to pull it out and insert battery.</li>
            <li>with the tank full it runs for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the bigger 110 v water Pik</li>
            <li>good but pain to refill constantly</li>
            <li>not as good as a regular water pic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice improvement over the old model</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase, usage wise is quite good&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning this and ordering a full size plug in waterpick.</li>
            <li>I feel using preassure nr 1 is good enough for anyone and</li>
            <li>I have own two of this waterfloss so far.</li>
            <li>But later on it was so good</li>
            <li>I could give it a better rating, but the mold build up is a real show stopper</li>
            <li>The Panasonic does only a fair job of irrigating the teeth and gum line.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I&#x27;m guessing this rarely happens: one of the times I filled it</li>
            <li>simple and good item.</li>
            <li>But the real improvement comes in the two speed  feature that can be made more gentler while operating than it&#x27;s predecessors.  </li>
            <li>If I were traveling for a longer period, I would schlep my full size model.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Fill with a mixture of mouthwash and water - really makes your mouth feel more refreshed and cleaner than just brushing, flossing and gargling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the kick that</li>
            <li>It was good for a short trip, but I didn&#x27;t have the smallest temptation to replace the full size water-pik with this after I returned home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal though.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a portable.  </li>
            <li>Not bad still getting use to it I guess.</li>
            <li>not bad for the price</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a deal of the day, not bad at the price I got it at..</li>
            <li>This little battery-operated device is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Works great; easy to use with a little practice</li>
            <li>Easy to use, lightweight and gets in between tough teeth perfectly.</li>
            <li>It has good power with a new battery and cleans between teeth really well.</li>
            <li>I find that the higher speed works better for me in getting the right water pressure.  </li>
            <li>The actual device is nicely made, easy to use, compact ...</li>
            <li>Super good for travel as well, could pack the upper part into the machine.</li>
            <li>Spray is barely strong enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to use at work to clean my throat, the pulse action is VERY strong, if that is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>The reservoir is large enough for a good clean, and is easy to refill.  </li>
            <li>it has strong jet and does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was easy to use and did not take up a lot of space and this product does that exactly.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to control for her (besides the switch).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m pressed on time at work, I may use this as a quick consolatory replacement for a full floss.</li>
            <li>For the most part, the reservoir has been sufficient for me to clean my entire mouth, but if I have had to refill a time or two after eating a meal that leaves more particles between my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is high quality and most of all it works as good as any similar device.</li>
            <li>Works great, just as other reviews state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading other reviews and was squally happy.  </li>
            <li>My irrigator has been great and other than accidentally spraying myself a couple of times, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other wiseworks great.</li>
            <li>And now Panasonic has come out with a new model that, if anything, is better than the original.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be pleased if my new one performs as well for 15 months!</li>
            <li>Bought this product hoping it would help me keep a clean fresh mouth.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean and disinfect without success.</li>
            <li>It does make your mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try to clean my kid&#x27;s tooth , but I cannot even clean my own tooth without massive splashing.</li>
            <li>this thing is seriously the best i have had.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be lucky to get one year of use, before it quits entirely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The collapsible (for travel) water reservoir is completely adequate.  </li>
            <li>Rechargable battery wore out too quickly.</li>
            <li>I kind of like chicken bullion the best</li>
            <li>and I found it to be much better than the older version.</li>
            <li>knowing nothing is left inside to be later spitted in someones face ..is priceless!</li>
            <li>The water pressure is adequate</li>
            <li>Water runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>The size of the water tank is adequate.</li>
            <li>It will take awhile to learn how to use this item as it sprays water quickly all over the place.  </li>
            <li>My lucky family members are all getting one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>But refilling is quick and painless.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, I do tried all kind of flossers, water picks over the last decade and this one is travellers,&lt;br /&gt;Workers dream, can not be better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Broke really quickly.</li>
            <li>It is an adequate alternative to flossing.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be better than the older version (Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator).</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to purchase rechargeable batteries for it since it goes through them quickly.</li>
            <li>It collapses into a super compact size for travel.  </li>
            <li>yet after many, many daily uses.</li>
            <li>This had more power than the older  model my wife uses.  </li>
            <li>This is a tremendous value.</li>
            <li>Oh, it has a low/high water pressure switch and adequate instructions and pictures...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really hoping Santa brings me a more powerful RECHARGEABLE oral irrigator this Christmas.</li>
            <li>Overall, pleased with the purchase, and even my husband who doesn&#x27;t have braces has started using it, because it is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>and only has good power with fresh batteries..</li>
            <li>OEM batteries died to quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; does such an excellent job that I might use it at home on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It seems to have adequate pressure for my needs</li>
            <li>Since our bathroom isn&#x27;t big enough for the plug-in water pic, this is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>but it is faster if you want a quick rinse of something stuck between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I use peroxide allowing it to remain awguke to remove mild dew that forms inside.  </li>
            <li>The amount of water it holds is adequate for me.</li>
            <li>&gt;♦ Has a steady stream, but more of a pulsing</li>
            <li>The fact that it folded was a selling point because I&#x27;m short on bathroom space and it fit nicely on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the older model.</li>
            <li>is a bit more powerfull than my older conair with the option to go stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is convenient to use and does an adequate job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s size, this tank runs out of water quickly.  </li>
            <li>The water reservoir capacity is adequate -</li>
            <li>--Cleans quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Mainly because my mouth feels better than ever.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Since the rechargeable irrigators only work with 120 current, these were a perfect answer to traveling abroad with an irrigator.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it much right now, as it is not travel season, but it still has the original batteries in it and they are still working..</li>
            <li>I use the &#x27;high&#x27; mostly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for people with braces :)</li>
            <li>I use the &#x27;high&#x27; mostly.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended getting this unit along with a rechargeable toothbrush and Glide Oral B Health Pro for a healthy smile.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Small, portable, does a very good job considering its size.</li>
            <li>Very good for small size.  </li>
            <li>My teeth really feel clean now!</li>
            <li>It can even replace the stationary version, because thanks to the right size of its tank, you don&#x27;t have to refill it many times during one use.</li>
            <li>- something very important when new babies are in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up as a replacement</li>
            <li>I bought the Panasonic Oral Irrigator because of other reviews and also the price was very nice.  </li>
            <li>It works very well - easy to use and light weight and effective -  but do not get any water in the battery compartment or the unit will die an instant death!  </li>
            <li>The power is just right for the gum so that water pressure clean the space between teeth and massage gum.</li>
            <li>Holds just the right amount of water to irrigate and clean between  your teeth.</li>
            <li>Two great things about this unit, in addition to the fact that it&#x27;s powerful enough at the high speed to clean between my teeth perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, I notice my gums are stronger, because - instead of being able to fit 4 strand of dental floss between some teeth, I can only fit 2 strands.  </li>
            <li>I know since I purchased this item there are now better travel oral irrigators that are probably much nicer than this one; however, I was so pleased with mine that I ordered an additional four to give to my adult children.  </li>
            <li>that having this batter-operated water irrigator fit exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this unit.  </li>
            <li>I expected the stream from the irrigator to be a lot stronger and more precise, more like what the dentist offices have.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I listened to my dentist, because although there is a bit of a learning curve if you&#x27;ve brushed and flossed most of your life, the effort is worth it.</li>
            <li>Portable and looks very elegant, and can be carry everywhere, it can be smaller too by inserting the irrigator into the tank.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the other buyers are talking about, but this product works great, and it&#x27;s really powerful too.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it, especially in comparison with a competing product.  </li>
            <li>Overall it might be worth contemplating paying more money upfront for a more durable product than dealing with the frustration and expense of replacing this one.</li>
            <li>This is my very first oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li>compared with other brands, this entry level irrigator is cheap and as good as the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use with 2 power modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fill the water tank with cool (not cold</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as a full size water pic, but it gets the job done for me.</li>
            <li>I owned a Waterpic and I never knew when it was time to recharge, and if you wait too long, it isn&#x27;t good for the battery, so after under a year, the thing died.  </li>
            <li>it as powerful as the corded full size waterpic?</li>
            <li>I expect to run it on rechargeables for a good long time, as well.</li>
            <li>Smart and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Uses up capacity quickly so work fast!!</li>
            <li>It is more powerful than older Panasonic model it replaced - the  two speeds help a lot.</li>
            <li>nothing like a clean fresh mouth taste &amp; SMILE...</li>
            <li>Overall, the Panasonic irrigators are an effective tool for keeping teeth clean and I will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li>Great water pick to clean between teeth, a bit messy a times.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great, but once it wears down the water stream becomes noticeably weaker.</li>
            <li>It works great and collapses down for travel and storage</li>
            <li>Larger reservoir than older models is great.  </li>
            <li>And while it&#x27;s not ultra compact, it is certainly compact enough to keep handy while on the go!</li>
            <li>wow, with 2 AA batteries, the oral irrigator pumped out apretty strong jet of water and that was at the lower of the two speeds!  </li>
            <li>A larger electric irrigator would hold more water and possibly be even more effective.</li>
            <li>I liked this so much I purchased one for my daughter, and highly recommended to friends that travel.</li>
            <li>But she thought that using this device along with flossing, brushing with Sonicare and then using a good mouthwash (Listerine) was a good routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that you can open the device for cleaning by very gently pulling the upper housing from the lower tank.  </li>
            <li>It has more power with new batteries.</li>
            <li>This new one is even better.</li>
            <li>Love it...........couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I really love my new water pick.</li>
            <li>Over all it is a nice product, very clean, works just like other reviews described that I read before I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit about a year ago and was quite happy with it until I noticed black stuff growing in the seams at the bottom of the tank.  </li>
            <li>aside from slight design flaw and rechargeable battery problems, i was quite happy with this item.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic version seems to work very well, is a lot quieter in operation, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic oral irrigator is very good,and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Strong construction,  very powerfull.    </li>
            <li>It is not as strong as   my electric water pic but very satisfactory  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very portable.</li>
            <li>It has a powerful stream, just as powerful as my full size WaterPik that I have at home.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does not take up much space.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic is very compact - the perfect size for a small bathroom or traveling.  </li>
            <li>It is very portable and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery easy to use.</li>
            <li>I preferred older models, where the water was filled from a flap at the top, which was much easier to fill without spilling.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to use than the Waterpik because you don’t have the tubing to deal with and it store easily in the medicine cabinet instead of taking up space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>This is a very compact and easy to use device.  </li>
            <li>The size is very convenient and packs away easy.</li>
            <li>The item works very well, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easily transportable and cleans between the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it my gums bled and it hurt!  </li>
            <li>This is a great because you don&#x27;t have to mess with a cord.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and love it!  </li>
            <li>addictive better than flossing!</li>
            <li>I use it daily &amp; love the results!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>, to my surprise was much bigger than I thought it would be, but I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Great for traveling-- can&#x27;t live without my waterpik on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Not only the pressure is greater than my Waterpick, but also easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>The power of the water is strong enough, for sure</li>
            <li>I love the low hassle and easy storability of the unit.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not as powerful as the counter-top models but really, how strong does the water stream need to be?  </li>
            <li>Nice travel size and for home use, stores away easily in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries have lasted longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have had counter top water picks of all brands , most do the job they are supposed to do, with a few of higher price doing a bit better ...</li>
            <li>Kind of splashes unless you&#x27;re careful how you hold it but easy to carry and powerful for a portable.</li>
            <li>No amount of rinsing with hot water, alcohol, or hydrogen peroxide would clean it.  </li>
            <li>I actually have fun with oral care now--I&#x27;m even flossing more!</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I get an irrigator, but I just don&#x27;t have a large area available on the bathroom counter, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to get a better clean at home.</li>
            <li>This is a great little gadget.</li>
            <li>Great little item</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something not so great, it can leak a little bit.</li>
            <li>It does a great job in a little time and stimulating your gums(you even can feel it afterwards)  </li>
            <li>Simple to use, but may not have the fine adjustment capability as a table top model.  </li>
            <li>I received this pretty quickly for Super Saver Shipping.  </li>
            <li>To do a very good job with the Panasonic you must refill its tank at least 2 times.</li>
            <li>loved it since could use in shower, totally portable (runs on AA), large reservoir</li>
            <li>He reported that although the Panasonic Oral Irrigator didn&#x27;t do as thorough a job as his large one, it did a good enough job to keep his teeth from hurting after every meal eaten on the road.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a way to separate the blue portion for a full clean of the product.</li>
            <li>Has a powerful stream that takes a little getting used to, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Well, a little more power would be nice.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Oral Irrigattor and had high hopes as most reviewers recommended the product .</li>
            <li>This is very nice, water pressure is strong enough, Compact enough to carry around anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would buy for everyday use, but its great for travel.  </li>
            <li>For a cheap, portable oral irrigator, you really can&#x27;t beat this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing and deep cleaning water flosser!!</li>
            <li>I use this brand for many years and appear to be the most trouble free.</li>
            <li>well-designed re on-off button placement, hand fit, weight, reasonable cost, etc.  </li>
            <li>Just enough water pressure, which is amazing for a battery operated device.</li>
            <li>I suspected this model would not be as powerful as the rechargeable version</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far I love it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as powerful as my Water Pik that I plug in at home.  </li>
            <li>or so it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>They works nicely, but they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Really powerful water-jet.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost for convenience.</li>
            <li>Nice personal Oral Irrigator.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying for someone like me who relies on an oral irrigator to keep gums in shape.  </li>
            <li>the go.\\&quot;  Mine worked flawlessly and efficiently for about 15 months, then the water pressure gradually decreased to a level that was ineffective.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful as some of the bulky water flossers out there but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>They have braces powerful and gets all the stuff out of the braces</li>
            <li>That made the irrigator too powerful, and I felt like my gums were being laser-cut away.</li>
            <li>I would not find it effective for everyday use, but I guess it is OK for my purpose.</li>
            <li>It is just as powerful as the electric one I had</li>
            <li>This purchase replaced another line-powered device which was not so useful.</li>
            <li>I have a small bathroom and this is the perfect size to keep in the drawer and no clumsy cord to fumble with.  </li>
            <li>so much better than the  Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser (WP-440)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bigger water tank, and 2 speeds are nice features to have.</li>
            <li>For crowns, braces, and/or bridges, an oral irrigator of some kind is essential to remove all the gunk stuck between and around them.</li>
            <li>The product is useful, but not as useful as it should be.</li>
            <li>Before it broke I liked it well enough.</li>
            <li>It delivers a much more powerful stream and unlike the Water-Pik does not require frequent recharging.</li>
            <li>Nice portable charger that is powerful enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>After one day of trying to find a benefit in using it, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Definatly worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money, just know that it doesn&#x27;t pulse-out water as forceful as some countertop units.</li>
            <li>Works well and seems almost as effective as traditional flossing.</li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Surprised to see so many bits stuck even after brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth prices paid.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I recently got braces and really liked having this portable one to take with me to work.</li>
            <li>Too powerful of a stream on the lowest setting</li>
            <li>useful</li>
            <li>so I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>Works as it should - lightweight and yet powerful..</li>
            <li>I must admit so far I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The unit is nice to be portable and worked well initially.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found this useful.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic model offers a much better product.</li>
            <li>I hesitated to buy this based on the price, certainly it can&#x27;t be worth it, but I read the reviews and took a chance.  </li>
            <li>battery-run is not too powerful.  </li>
            <li>Worth the effort for your dental health.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>As long as it keeps running for me for a couple years I will be very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It is surprisingly powerful for a portable battery powered unit.</li>
            <li>I wish it could be more clear but the file size has to be under 100 MB.    </li>
            <li>I bought that for my mom, and I feel that is not as powerful as this one.  </li>
            <li>It could have a pulsating speed option but so far I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had so much fun.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely spend time to write reviews for products</li>
            <li>Really works well... use warm water for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Powerful, portable and energy efficient.</li>
            <li>Was worth the price.</li>
            <li>This water flosser has truly made it worth my while.</li>
            <li>Compact, well designed and powerful.  </li>
            <li>WAY too powerful to use-HURTS to use</li>
            <li>This product does not perform nearly as well as my Waterpik but is OK for travel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The design is very well thought out and you can disassemble and reassemble quickly to either take on trips or to clean periodically with a vinegar solution, which works well.</li>
            <li>For under $30, even if it has to be replaced in a year, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>useful while traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well with fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li>this was worth a try in that it is rather inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Better than using the old flossing string.</li>
            <li>useful as additional dental appliance</li>
            <li>Manual floss is better by far excoet for the strands breaking all the time.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out there was so much more crud/leftover food bits in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is powerful flosser.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have rarely gone a night without using it because it leaves my mouth feeling so</li>
            <li>However, in comparison, I find the Panasonic Oral Irrigator to offer the same water irrigation speed as the WaterPik and to be equally effective with mouth/teeth irrigation.  </li>
            <li>This product uses AA batteries which can be replaced and this product works far better.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll have to reorder only the $8 replacement package and either pay the shipping or wait until I need something else that totals more than $25 to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>It is quite comparable and useful for travel.</li>
            <li>The oral irrigator has two different settings which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>this well designed, compactable, nesting and powerful</li>
            <li>Much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Fresh breath is everything</li>
            <li>It is not so powerful as to blast your mouth, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does lose power as the batteries weaken, but the durability and longevity of this item makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li>in with your fresh water.</li>
            <li>It turned out that my aggressive brushing was hurting, not helping my innocent and sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>When I saw this, I decided that it was worth try.</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill, easy to use, and easy to empty.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as a plugin unit, but the mobility is really useful.</li>
            <li>I like to feel fresh after using this irrigator.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, this is much more convenient than flossing, but will update review after I see my dentist again in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>There is definitely enough pressure for the tool to work effectively.</li>
            <li>I have not used it yet for travel, but it will take a bit more luggage space than the old one did.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of bulky to hold when you actually flossing</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I would like, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>Not even worth one star.  </li>
            <li>love it, but have to refill water frequently</li>
            <li>It is better than nothing when you are on the road somewhere or far away from home.</li>
            <li>I do change the batteries monthly but its worth it.</li>
            <li>For someone who doesn&#x27;t floss (weird phobia of mine, can&#x27;t take the sound or feeling), this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and holds plenty of water.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was great about taking it back, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.</li>
            <li>Worth it if you travel a lot and don&#x27;t want to miss.</li>
            <li>And, like many products offered to the U.S. Consumer, it can&#x27;t be fixed or recycled, so it will end up in a landfill.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as the the plug-in model I keep at home, but it will suffice for a one or two week trip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very powerful, has a decent sized reservior, and does the job!  </li>
            <li>I find the high speed is more than adequate - after all, you don&#x27;t want to blast your teeth and gums too much.</li>
            <li>Power setting on high easily removes food from between teeth.  </li>
            <li>very useful water floss, comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I first purchased this item, I have realized I need to check to make sure my batteries are new and work well.</li>
            <li>Very powerful irragator that worked very well cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>Every now and then when I put in the water, I add a little fluoride for a more refreshing, dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Really good for those who travel a lot, small size and easy use.</li>
            <li>At first it has this plastic pipe feel out of the box , fairly large but works fine .</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product and really makes your mouth feel fresh and clean by removing all debri.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like flossing this is a great alternative and your gums will thank you (try adding a couple of drop of oregano oil to the plain water)...</li>
            <li>Especially, good for foreign travel because you don&#x27;t have to work about the  current.</li>
            <li>My dentist tells me that a consequence of that is that keeping the mouth clean is both harder to do and more important than before.</li>
            <li>reduce my rating to 3 stars because I discovered and bought a Redi-Breeze irrigator (from Amazon) that fastens to the faucet, that does a better job, not requiring battery changes, not subject to performance fall-off as the batteries decline, nor filling a reservoir or cleaning the unit.  </li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel so clean, and does a great job of getting in the hard to reach areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Big healthy smile!</li>
            <li>Have  2 other oral irrigators, Shower Breese oral irrigator that I use most every day as it&#x27;s most convenient,</li>
            <li>Great if you have bridges and hard to clean spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li>There maybe other good products in the market, but with this price I think this one really worth it.</li>
            <li>Batteries wear out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, runs through batteries pretty quickly, so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I have an older plug-in waterpik model and this works with as much power as that one, but much more convenient.  </li>
            <li>Brushed my teeth and flossed, but the Panasonic Oral Irrigator still removed more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and made my teeth and gums feel amazingly clean.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of trying different techniques I am able to clean all of my teeth on both sides of the gums with one reservoir of water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with this for a trip, but wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with it for the long term.</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s possible to clean it with bleach or something,</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean the tank regularly too.</li>
            <li>Well, unless you are trying to unglue your gums or dislocate your teeth or clean your bathroom with it, this is more than enough.</li>
            <li>Well, unless you are trying to unglue your gums or dislocate your teeth or clean your bathroom with it, this is more than enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic is easy to use, strong jet power and batteries have lasted for 3-4 weeks based on daily use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip</li>
            <li>Not to strong to hurt your gums but strong enough to get food out and massage the gums.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good for travel, but possibly not for your main product.</li>
            <li>compact ( I am a small woman) and length wise is no larger than the palm of my hand, width wise</li>
            <li>It is far more effective than floss and cheaper in the long term.</li>
            <li>The fact that the batteries are just driving a small motor using a good bit of current made this product a good candidate for MiMH batteries.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect and saw this pretty cheap as a daily deal.  </li>
            <li>I decided the price was right</li>
            <li>Also the price is right.</li>
            <li>The right size for just about anyone.  </li>
            <li>Water cartridge is the right size.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>She noticed right away and squirted me with it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Amazon is sending a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>and I could feel that it was getting right into the problem areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably right there in front of you...in the faucet.</li>
            <li>However the pressure is non-existant now and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work right.</li>
            <li>The right way is to replace them after you use up 30-40 tanks of water.</li>
            <li>Right now I have three of the EW-DJ10 units on hand and two of them work sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Price was also right.</li>
            <li>Serves its purpose just right</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this one has been the right solution for me.</li>
            <li>Price was right, too.  </li>
            <li>I like this water pic because it is portable, inexpensive, cordless, and has the right amount of water pressure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To extend the life of this Panasonic unit by 2 or 3 times, pull it apart right away after each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if it was more of a purse size, but considering what it does I bet this is as small as you can get it.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first few weeks</li>
            <li>Good fit for small spaces around the sink.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to clean than the WaterPik.</li>
            <li>nice to get that strong power stream back which the old one lost over time.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean very well.</li>
            <li>It takes 2 fillings to clean whole mouth.</li>
            <li>love it have stock in batteries but for me this is the only way to go fast easy</li>
            <li>I recommend this oral irrigator over WaterPik as is much easier to use, transport, clean, etc.  </li>
            <li>The water capacity it sufficient for me to clean my whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This hand held tank is much easier to use and clean.</li>
            <li>really like how clean everything feels after I use this.</li>
            <li>and it really gets my mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little teeth cleaner!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to fill with water and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and after 5 months is still running on the same batteries.</li>
            <li>This water pick is very easy to use and to fill, and I just keep it on the vanity next to tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>A better design would have been a button like most blenders have that must be held down to keep the power on.</li>
            <li>; I sure hope I can return these as well as I have no other use for the 48 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve really liked our Panasonic &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; for several years, but this replacement doesn&#x27;t seem as good as our old blue one.</li>
            <li>After trying 3 different water picks, I decided to try one last time to find one that was compact (great for travel), easy to hold, and had more than one speed ( the low is more than enough pressure for my mouth.)</li>
            <li>very little power, doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great how it collapses with storage for the tip it take up very little space.</li>
            <li>its not at all easy to move with wet hands...which they are sure to be.  </li>
            <li>$30 for five years of outstanding daily service in my view is worthy of re-purchase.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to purchase this while it was on sale, but if I&#x27;d known how much I&#x27;d love this</li>
            <li>I find the lower pressure setting is strong enough for me, but there is always the higher setting for a more intense cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, with a new set of 2 AA&#x27;s it works fine.</li>
            <li>Great product, powerful and does a great job, small enough to easily pack down for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am so glad since the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A is by far the best!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light, compact, easy to fill and empty and clean, batteries</li>
            <li>Pretty bulky but for the freedom from a hose and electric cord it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Great for travelling and small counter.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic waterjet is battery powered and would be great for travel or for a small bathroom.  </li>
            <li>gives plenty of pressure and about one full does the whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use and travel!</li>
            <li>I think the two choices of speed are wonderful - I only use the low setting though because I have sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to let this dry out completely before re-use, and clean periodically with vinegar to avoid bacteria build-up.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Water Flosser is strong enough to get most of the food particles from between my teeth and easy to use, especially to fill it with water.</li>
            <li>It can easily be stored, easily rinsed out, and I can add a bit of Listerine mouthwash (to kill the bacteria) as long as I rinse it out before storing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but would like a little more pressure with the irrigation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now had two of these little devices and they are awesome to use prior to brushing with my oral B electric</li>
            <li>highly recommend it to everyone, your oral health will improve as well as your smile!</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist for a formal report on the health of their gums, but I can see that their teeth are clean without that white film they tend to miss when they just brush and in between their teeth is nice and clean like they flossed.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product so much, I bought this second one.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s strong enough to clean all things on the teeth and between the gum and teeth.</li>
            <li>&quot; and \\&quot;Weak\\&quot; - the most powerful of which is about the same as my AC -powered home unit set on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li>The size was perfect for traveling and it did its job; would not use for everyday as needs to be refilled in order to floss entire mouth.</li>
            <li>I also get occasional tonsil stones, and this device is great for getting back in the throat to wash them out as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>Overall great product that has worked well over the last month.</li>
            <li>While not like the more powerful water jet machines this one did the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; on my recent trip.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might be a fluke, and since I was, overall, happy with the product&#x27;s performance, I ordered a replacement one for myself, which duly broke within the same time-frame.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have space for a larger  irrigator that may be more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I refill the tank twice each use and the tip rotates making it easy to direct.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as the countertop models unless you aim the stream directly into the gumline.</li>
            <li>It is nice and compact for travel, and holds enough water for my whole mouth, when used on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>As  the recommended brushing time is 2 minutes - using an Oral Irrigator shouldn&#x27;t  take 2 more additional minutes because the mouth(or the gums) don&#x27;t naturally need so much work on them.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The reservoir is adequate for one person, depending on how much irrigation you need/want.</li>
            <li>As for the workings, I loved the pick, but it lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a compact, easy to use dental irrigator.</li>
            <li>Bought this one for a back up and haven&#x27;t had to use it because the first one I bought is still going strong!</li>
            <li>Time will tell how long the NiZn batteries will last, but so far they are the best match with this oral irrigator.    </li>
            <li>Sure enough, the Panasonic&#x27;s little irrigator isn&#x27;t the most aesthetically appealing product in the world, but it gets the job done.    </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and would recommend it especially for traveling.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty powerful - better than simply flossing!</li>
            <li>as mentioned, I&#x27;ve been impressed with the power of the stream, so I won&#x27;t be too surprised if the batteries don&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li>jet of water is pretty powerful, and does a good job of blasting out trapped particles.  </li>
            <li>I always ended up spraying water everywhere, it made a mess of the bathroom sink area, and it didn&#x27;t feel like a comparable alternative to good ol&#x27; fashioned flossing.  </li>
            <li>At the second speed, it is also just right for clearing of more &#x27;stubborn&#x27; debris.</li>
            <li>This is a highly effective way to get loose particles out of the spaces between my crowded teeth.  </li>
            <li>From my point of view the older model was better - you were able to store the nozzle inside of irigator body and save the space, which is not possible with new model.</li>
            <li>runs out of water very fast</li>
            <li>I like th i s product very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Glory hallelujah, my problems were solved and at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>The top slides down into the reservoir making it compact and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>However, it should be OK for my daughter, who is only 6.3 feet height, because it is just right with me, who is not too much higher</li>
            <li>This is fine for a portable irrigator - easy to use, though not especially powerful.  </li>
            <li>So far, the water irrigator is working fine.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is battery operated and not quite as powerful but certainly helpful when on the road.  </li>
            <li>Much better than old (and new ones too!)</li>
            <li>but this is no big deal as it fills quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to finally find exactly what I need and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I also run the blue part and the nozzle through the dishwasher (top rack)</li>
            <li>i use rechargeable battery w/ downside needing to open compartment more risking corrosion.</li>
            <li>It collapses smaller, has more power, uses batteries.</li>
            <li>My first water pic.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t do that with more traditional pic.</li>
            <li>At first, the unit looks  bulky.  </li>
            <li>However, one must understand that the reservoir volume is necessary, on top of the motor and the batteries.  </li>
            <li>After seeing my first one, my wife also wanted one.  </li>
            <li>My son (17) used it every day at first, but then tapered off a bit.  </li>
            <li>Now my husband wants one!  </li>
            <li>So be aware of that.    </li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare as this is my first oral water pik device.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall pleased with the Panasonic units</li>
            <li>It is so powerful and really gets the food out from my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Just to be on the safe side, I will travel with extra batteries!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Occasionally I use about one third mouthwash with the filling water for a refreshing mouthwash.</li>
            <li>worth the very affordable price.</li>
            <li>how much stuff!  </li>
            <li>This led me to purchase my first cordless waterpik in Oct 09.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the batteries but not the case.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described in the ad.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen how it works, but the first time I used it I had a funny taste in my mouth which I think was the gunk between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Being battery operated is more convenient because I only have one power socket in the bathroom which is in use.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the bottom of the filter was clogged.  </li>
            <li>First time use of an oral irrigator, and bought 5 for family.</li>
            <li>Would do much better flossing with regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>I just replaced the battery for the first time.  </li>
            <li>My first thought on turning it on was, \\&quot;Yikes</li>
            <li>I am married to a dentist and he likes it too.</li>
            <li>First one is still going after 10 years</li>
            <li>Totally pleased with this product, and, as usual, pleased with the delivery from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have purchased 3 or 4 of this product, but at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>Returned unit under warranty coverage to Panasonic Exchange Center in McAllen TX on November 29, 2012 (shipping at my own expense).</li>
            <li>first one broke</li>
            <li>However, I lost the hinge door on my first two units about a year.</li>
            <li>This was my first water pick-like device</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I decided to buy this Panasonic portable water pick, keeping in mind that it has a disadvantage of being &#x27;bulky&#x27;, especially for my kids.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind this, because I&#x27;ve already ordered a WaterPick WP100 for them, as they are now a bit more grown up and stay on a different floor in our house.      </li>
            <li>It became ~1.5 times higher, which is 8.5 inches.</li>
            <li>Most everything was double this price.  </li>
            <li>But even if you need to reload more water, its a very simple thing to do.</li>
            <li>This is my first \\&quot;oral irrigator\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The on/off switch on the first intermittantly stayed on, so after a couple of years I bought another one.  </li>
            <li>Found this product a couple of years ago after having  problems with Water-Pik rechargeable batteries not lasting more than a year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know more after the next trip to the dentist, but for now the irrigator seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li>Over the years I enjoyed using different Waterpik irrigaters.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the only sure way to make sure the unit is DRY and CLEAN, which prevents mold/bacterial growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After eating I ran to this thing to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I received it in the mail yesterday and used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>If you use a dental irrigation device at home, such as the WaterPik, you will love this product.  </li>
            <li>My first one is still working after 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I have a larger vanity top irrigator.  </li>
            <li>But omg with this water pick after the first time use, my pain is gone.</li>
            <li>Very portable slides in to itself for travel worth the money.</li>
            <li>The motor doesn&#x27;t pump like it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>I have used the water pik table top version for past 25 years or more, and always missed it when I went on vacations.  </li>
            <li>The reason for buying another one was because I lost the first one in a move.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a battery powered irrigator but this thing is terrific.  </li>
            <li>Hoping for a lot better check up on my next dental visit.</li>
            <li>The first one just stopped working.  </li>
            <li>This is the first oral irrigator I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li>I soaked my bathroom the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>I feel like Im forcing a water hose in my mouth and more water sprays outside of my mouth than in it.</li>
            <li>#34;this is the first I&#x27;ve heard about a mold problem, Sorry!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with the product.</li>
            <li>IN IT, BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER, AND OPERATE THE IRRIGATOR BETTER.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that sometimes you need to fill it with water more than once during a cleaning, but this is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>The first one quit working in 5 months</li>
            <li>This is the 10th unit I have gotten in since I bought the first one for myself in July 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in on this and really like it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So much better than one of those big things that sit on the sink and take up room.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I sent it back because for the money I paid...just a bit more with it</li>
            <li>When I first started, I had to refill it once.</li>
            <li>Very compact!</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I am biased towards Panasonic products but the quality of this dental appliance is quickly evident.</li>
            <li>Our last WaterPic has the water refill opening on top, so when someone used the pick, their &amp;#34;mouth backwash&amp;#34; accumulated around the opening, some of it under the cover</li>
            <li>but I like my regular size water pic better.  </li>
            <li>The thread is better for regular flossing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The first 4 or 5 days were a scream-</li>
            <li>so I have to heat the water up first before using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wish it held more fluid in the chamber</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using a water pick</li>
            <li>But be ready for water to splash everywhere!</li>
            <li>I had a cordless, rechargeable unit from a competitor (you know, the famous name one) prior to purchasing this one.</li>
            <li>This one is not quite as powerful nor does it hold as much water.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 2 + years.  </li>
            <li>Still using the first one for over one year now.</li>
            <li>I would love to get my money back!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an oral irrigator for years and have tried many different models.  </li>
            <li>Ok, it didn&#x27;t cost a fortune, but I did expect it to last a bit longer.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I purchased ....because I love this item.</li>
            <li>I use it about 3 times a week and haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet, which is pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this in addition to flossing and find that it gets to the back teeth better than you ever could manually.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it ended up all over my mirror and the walls.</li>
            <li>You Must make sure to leave the cap open when not in use or you can get mildew buildup in there.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what its advertising says about it.</li>
            <li>Then to put the batteries in place you need something with width because you need to turn this nickle size white plastic screw on top to the word &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I used luke water as suggested, so as not to have a first time shock.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Be aware of the location of the switch where it is before flossing.  </li>
            <li>If you want it for home only, you might be better with something you plug in; for travel/home use, don&#x27;t bother trying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally decided on this one &amp; I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s convenient, the tank is the appropriate size to use on my entire mouth without refilling.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Then you put the nozzle in your mouth (first, lest you want to squirt up the mirror) and turn it on.</li>
            <li>This worked well for the first couple months, but then it started leaking out the side during use.  </li>
            <li>The only improvement that I suggest is a more contoured shape.</li>
            <li>It does have many pros, such as:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>It is definitely better than not using one at all, but only if portable is all you can find room for; as in traveling and living out of a suitcase.</li>
            <li>The best thing about the product is the fact that it is small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li>the first version of this irrigator for years.</li>
            <li>first one lasted two years, then stopped working</li>
            <li>When you are talking portable, size matters, and bigger isn&#x27;t better.  </li>
            <li>This is my first oral irrigator</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s low pressure output that it is in the cabinet more permanently.  </li>
            <li>But, for short term use, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I still continue to employ most of the above techniques, and this Panasonic is an integral part of</li>
            <li>I still continue to employ most of the above techniques, and this Panasonic is an integral part of</li>
            <li>very deep cleaning sensation, Love it.</li>
            <li>First I used floss after every meal and then used an interdental brush but both seem to exacerbate the pain - they were just too abrasive since I have to do it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though on first use, panicked and pulled it out of my mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Might want to practice without batteries first.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say this was 100% the cause, but it seems like a logical possibility for the unit not turning on anymore.</li>
            <li>After trying for several hours to remove the top of the battery well, I gave up.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Probably would pay more for somthing nicer unless your useing this for vacations or away from the house only...</li>
            <li>Next time I would purchase something more environmentally-and financially-friendly.</li>
            <li>The instructions need to be clearer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the answerer, keep turning the cap AFTER you are pointed to the open position and it will come up and be able pulled out.</li>
            <li>It is a lot better than waterpick 360 in which the battery can not hold a charge after only 6 months..</li>
            <li>I lost the first one and replaced it.</li>
            <li>my first water flosser.</li>
            <li>first of these type of devices i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>However I would like it more if it had a bigger tank.</li>
            <li>product does exactly that which is mentioned in the product description</li>
            <li>It would be a mistake to stop using the product when bleeding is evident.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, the unit is compact and powerful and it gets out stuff you didn&#x27;t know was stuck in there.  </li>
            <li>I use this for the first time, blood came out from the gums.</li>
            <li>Make sure to take the batteries out and put the battery cover back on so no water gets inside the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li>The batteries last too, I quite often have to refill the water tank  as I require more time -</li>
            <li>This is my first water irrigation item.  </li>
            <li>—I keep it near a window for air and light.</li>
            <li>I bought practically the first one made and took it abroad.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is NOt the regular bulky thing you would need to leave at your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>This product worked OK but had a short battery life.  </li>
            <li>But is enough to do my top teeth refill and do the lower teeth.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try an oral irrigator but wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it so this seemed a relatively inexpensive entry into the field.</li>
            <li>Keep your mouth slightly open so water has a way to go, you would not be able to hold the whole tank contents in your mouth!</li>
            <li>Make sure you fully extend the water tank, or it might collapse when water gets low.</li>
            <li>and I have used it several times without being able to get all the way around my mouth,</li>
            <li>went ok after the 2nd time - using not the highest preassure, but nr 1, it is still feeling like the job is done in a minute!</li>
            <li>one suggestion is if you got a power toothbrush, this thing is not necessary for most people</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m up to the higher setting.</li>
            <li>However on my first trip the gasket broke and leaked</li>
            <li>so I could not use it on my first trip.</li>
            <li>Bought this one for a friend because I have used the first one for over a year.  </li>
            <li>I have learned that a water-pic treatment daily will save many dental bills, &amp; promote oral health.  </li>
            <li>I have been a fan of PANASONIC quality since I first used their radios in the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Shot water in my eyes first time.</li>
            <li>First off let me say I&#x27;ve owned a Waterpik home unit for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>(I only use the #1 setting most of the time anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expect it to last many years.</li>
            <li>Bought this a year back and stocked up one more and introduced it to my cousin.</li>
            <li>It actually work better than the waterpik portable one.</li>
            <li>Way better than a big clunky &amp;#34;Waterpic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase but being able to replace batteries rather than the entire unit sold me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s inexpensive, portable, lightweight and works pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s room in the device to potentially store more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, as it is my first irrigator.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it was supposed to do</li>
            <li>but i may buy another in hopes that the death of the first one was a fluke.</li>
            <li>I floss and brush my teeth everyday and think I do a really good job of it, until I use my oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li>have been using mine for a little over 2 years and it is like new and with great results.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the collapsible design which makes the device very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>and i have to clean it after my job with this is done, still running on original batteries after two weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, easy to store and works extremely well for my problems with my gums.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic always has high quality products and I think this is worthy of the brand.</li>
            <li>I DO rinse the unit out with clean water and turn it on to clean the inside with the water only.</li>
            <li>Cons: recommended only for water (no mixture of mouthwash, as is recommended by my hygienist), it is not as easy to turn on/off and is not as powerful.</li>
            <li>Strong flow only when batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li>Yes, the initial battery is wicked powerful, and the replacements that I am using are not as strong.  </li>
            <li>Low speed is great for beginners, and high speed is more than powerful enough for long time users.</li>
            <li>This is simple to use and I am sure just as effective as the other &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>We finally wore out our original Panasonic Oral Irrigator and this one works much better with NiMH rechargeable batteries than the old one.</li>
            <li>The new one has dual speeds (very nice for sensitive gums) and the batteries last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Right after a battery change it has a lot of power, as the month goes on, not so much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold much water but for me, it&#x27;s just about right.  </li>
            <li>This new model as a slightly larger water holding capacity than it&#x27;s predecessor, although both are adequate for most days.  </li>
            <li>The water pressure in the first one came out right, the 3rd one is too strong.  </li>
            <li>However, First  issue is water reservoir which  doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to clean a full mouth.</li>
            <li>if not better performance, and a nice upgrade to the original.</li>
            <li>This is weak, but perfect for cleaning sensitive pockets away from home.  </li>
            <li>I laughed at myself, thinking I had to get used to it,  but it really did make a mess.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t honestly feel it is making any great difference to my oral hygiene which is disappointing as I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>Tried the rechargable PowerGenix AA batteries and like the extra power boost from the batteries slighly higher voltage and significantly lower interal inpedance (lets the battery source higher current for more powerful operation).</li>
            <li>When I floss after that, I feel very clean and only minimum flossing is needed.</li>
            <li>It works on batteries which last a long time and is great for travelling as well as it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Why buy any other kind, including plug-in?   </li>
            <li>This Oral Irrigator is just as good as the last one I bought, exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>a bit lighter than the other brand but still effective.</li>
            <li>Due to these issues, I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective oral irrigation product.</li>
            <li>Have used it twice and its good so far except for the initial gum bleeding which has mentioned to be normal.</li>
            <li>Way more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li>Much more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li>Was more powerful than I expected</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I thought it would be, but does a decent job conveniently.</li>
            <li>After root scaling and planing for early periodontal disease,  I&#x27;d try anything to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Use an old toothbrush and some Peroxide to clean or wipe off any mold you see.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately there does not seem to be a good alternative, so it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the chores of flossing and has been constantly reminded by my dentist to make such good habit for dental health reasons.</li>
            <li>So - it doesnt hold a lot of fluid, but the pressure is good and its so convenient that I use it daily -</li>
            <li>BUT, this one works well, holds more water and has enough water pressure to really irrigate between teeth.  </li>
            <li>However not taking into account the braces, regular in between the teeth flossing, it does a good job, but I can&#x27;t compare it to a regular floss with a thread.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved it so much, I purchased another within a few days so he could have one with him at all times.</li>
            <li>Loved it enough I bought a second.</li>
            <li>and my teeth are super clean and white.</li>
            <li>This is the most poorly designed product I own.</li>
            <li>can start quickly , even if the unit looks clean on the outside .Thankfully</li>
            <li>Very affordable - actually was free when you shop with your amazon card points!</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve on how to make sure you get to all your teeth without spraying the whole bathroom, but it is possible.</li>
            <li>It even takes popcorn  hulls out of my gum line and when I mix a little mouthwash with the water it is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have used this device for a little over one month, an I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>It does not hold very much water and has 2 speeds - \\&quot;Very</li>
            <li>The unit has a powerful jet at the high setting, which I use almost all the time.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for back of the mouth (2nd &amp; 3rd molars) where a normal tooth brush would not reach.</li>
            <li>The high is too powerful for my preference.</li>
            <li>Somewhere I saw that this unt had a very high pulse rate, so that interested</li>
            <li>With Panasonic, the water is just right for normal cleaning when I turn it on, at the first speed.</li>
            <li>This item is very elegant, Panasonic is a very trustworthy company from my previous experience.</li>
            <li>I knew that it would be a novelty at first, but hoped it was easy enough that they would continue.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s small and compact and fits easily out of sight in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>It has 2 speed settings, although I find the first setting to be strong enough.</li>
            <li>They are too low and should be higher for easy access.  </li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s not as powerful as my 110 volt home unit, its power using 2 AA batteries is quite nice for cleaning between my teeth in lieu of using dental floss, which is not nearly as easy.</li>
            <li>This had the highest number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can use it in the shower so there is really NO mess to clean up</li>
            <li>I like it better than other irrigators I have owned  because I does as good a job at cleaning and spews less water around than they do.</li>
            <li>I love that it compacts down to a smaller size, and it is very easy to fill up with water.</li>
            <li>so first I tried the single speed Panasonic Oral Irrigator which was OK.</li>
            <li>I bought one and liked it so much I&#x27;m buying one as a gift for other people.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this teeth cleaner and we rush to see who can use it first in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve checked the tube, nozzle, and everything I can reasonably access, but no solution is evident.</li>
            <li>The first one began leaking water into the battery chamber and that really reduced battery life.  </li>
            <li>However, this is my first water flosser, so I don&#x27;t have much experience</li>
            <li>I used one with a charger a long cord for more than two years.</li>
            <li>The pressure is pretty intense for my gums.  </li>
            <li>I use it while in the shower but not directly under the spray, but I am sure it&#x27;s water proof.</li>
            <li>In the long run it is probably more costly to operate than one that is chraged electrically.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s compact design allows me to conveniently carry it in my backpack pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>So this is pretty much a lifeline for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WaterPik battery life dropped off pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>The design of this thing does make me think it&#x27;s going into my travel bag, and I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a different product with a larger tank, and more comfortable wand-type sprayer.</li>
            <li>and I begins to develop the good habit of \\&quot;flushing\\&quot; the food debris around my gum before the usual brushing every night.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir is so small, it has emptied out after 30-40 seconds - meaning that for a good irrigation job, you end up refilling it four or five times.</li>
            <li>than that small problem I found it good value for the amount of money paid</li>
            <li>it is not so powerful as normal stationary irrigator</li>
            <li>it uses AA batteries and a small amount of water to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Small, convenient and does a good job cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as powerful as the plug in kind.  </li>
            <li>I then drained three entire reservoirs worth of soapy water to try and clean out and rinse the tube inside, and even THEN, it still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>But I use it on the 2nd setting and my mouth feels really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit provides a good clean even though the tip is a poor angle for irrigating underneath the ceramic plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when he went over certain spots; it was the first time I was ready to run out of his office!&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m surprised most with this product is that its pulsated stream of water was just of the right size and power, the same like of the Braun-Oral B I used before.</li>
            <li>I will sometimes add a little mouthwash and really warm or slightly hot water when I have gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>I personally like the high power setting because it cleans between the teeth better.  </li>
            <li>After the battery level dropped more I switched to the High which was about what the Low was before.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a good product and for the price you got a cordless pitiable product that is damn near as powerful as a much more expensive one.</li>
            <li>Good pressure, but it is not a substitute for flossing!&lt;br /&gt;Throw a little mouthwash in the tank with water for an extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Originally bought it for travel, but found I used it more than the big-tank model that was way more expensive.</li>
            <li>Wow! was my first word after having tried out this miniature size water-cleaning device!....</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to fill, easy to empty and is small enough and attractive enough to store on my bathroom counter without looking ungainly.</li>
            <li>Maybe not quite as powerful as a corded if the batteries aren&#x27;t new</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy enough to refill.  </li>
            <li>I have become forcibly acquainted with a condition called xerostemia or dry mouth.</li>
            <li>This was simple, easy to use and now cords.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let it dry some more and see if it starts to work again.  </li>
            <li>Easy, low tech, portable.  </li>
            <li>I  especially like that it will be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>And I sure wish i&#x27;d starting using this product when i was a kid -  if you don&#x27;t use a waterpik, you might not be getting your teeth as clean as they could be.using this years ago, do yourslef a big favor - buy one before they quit making them!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to pull out of the drawer and use instantly.  </li>
            <li>This Oral Irrigator is simple, easy to set and use.</li>
            <li>Has a small counter foot print, ideal for smaller bathrooms.</li>
            <li>The price is great,you can easily travel with it,and you&#x27;ll be left with healthier teeth.</li>
            <li>More compact, easier to dry after use, batteries can be replaced, easier to fill water container.  </li>
            <li>the switch was in a place that got easily turned on by accident, which i see is a possible place for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Less cumbersome than the electronic models and just as effective.</li>
            <li>He has only used it a couple of times but it is easy to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal as it&#x27;s easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The reservoir is able to do less than half of your mouth if you aren&#x27;t racing through and doing a good job.</li>
            <li>and they last a good long time.  </li>
            <li>I usually mix some Listerine in with the water for a nice fresh result.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t be strong enough, then once found it s stronger than you need,</li>
            <li>&quot; product says this one isn&#x27;t strong enough but it is strong enough for my gums.  </li>
            <li>It is not as strong as the standard plug-in waterpik which I use at home</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, used it daily, and the batteries are still going strong.</li>
            <li>It pumps out the water strong enough to remove all food paticles.</li>
            <li>Looked funny in the picture but for the price had to try it, it is a solid little machine and once you find your way to hold it it works great.</li>
            <li>Too large.</li>
            <li>Certainly outperformed my expectations.</li>
            <li>The design I would describe as \\&quot;smart simplicity\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have a large WaterPik at home and also purchased a travel size.</li>
            <li>You have to use it at a certain angle, but the tip is adjustable(it twists).</li>
            <li>You had to hold it a certain way to keep it from collapsing</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t have a large bathroom</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t want to be putting yucky water on my gums.</li>
            <li>smart design.</li>
            <li>He has a large, cabinet-top irrigator, but needed something he could use in the car when we travel.</li>
            <li>You have to hold it a certain way for it to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the plug in type and they are large and a pain</li>
            <li>wish it has a large water container to hold sufficient amount of water so that I can floss my teeth with just one time water topup.</li>
            <li>I even put a weak listerine solution in it a couple times with great results.</li>
            <li>I fill it with warm water from the shower head and there isn&#x27;t any mess in my sink.</li>
            <li>asked if we could get a new o-ring from the manufacturer, but the part is not provided, so we could not open it and make sure it would close again.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>It is funny that an open-box item in Amazon&#x27;s warehouse deal was also increased  to USD33.85,which is much higher than a brand new item(USD29.73 with coupon).&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to use, not so powerful as I expected</li>
            <li>The two AA  batteries last the whole trip and were still going strong at the end.</li>
            <li>EW-DJ10-A works very well and is strong enough to do a thorough cleaning job.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping from the other reviews that it would be as good as my countertop Waterpick, but it has half the power, and is not as easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I travel a lot and this compact gizmo is a clever design and more powerful than other portable devices I have tried.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would really use this, but since I moved it into the shower, I use it every single day.</li>
            <li>It is very maneuverable, much more that the Waterpik (limited by the hose lenght and rigidness).</li>
            <li>I generally fill the canister with lukewarm water twice each time I use it to effectively clean between all the teeth and along the gum line.  </li>
            <li>There are no extra attachment pieces and that is fine with me as they are not needed.  </li>
            <li>Be sure it is completely dry before opening the battery compartment!</li>
            <li>This one is a bit smaller but works fine.  </li>
            <li>I bought this same dental irrigator in 2009 and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>This thing is nice, on two AA batteries, it pushes a lot of water through your teeth (be careful not to hit your gums to directly though - it&#x27;ll hurt!)</li>
            <li>Using only 2 batteries, it&#x27;s better than rechargeable, more reliable and less to carry.</li>
            <li>; yes it does eat through batteries pretty quickly as many other reviewers have commented.  </li>
            <li>With the Panasonic, extra batteries are easy to carry and available everywhere in the world (and btw, the batteries anywhere are the same voltage ...</li>
            <li>If I had, I&#x27;d have known more quickly that it would only last for 5 or 6 uses, and returned it immediately.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty decent to be battery powered tho.</li>
            <li>This irrigator is VERY GOOD, although it could spray just a little harder.  </li>
            <li>larger water supply, more comfortable to hold, and single AA battery means no tangle of cords on the countertop.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much too large for travel.</li>
            <li>A nice trick would be to put a little mouth wash with water (though the manual DISCOURAGES putting any chemicals except water inside).</li>
            <li>I would like it to be a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>Good for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>It is good to use in addition to dental floss for hard to get areas.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is that it folds up into a smaller unit for transporting when you travel, and the nozzle fits in this neat little secure pocket so it can&#x27;t get lost.  </li>
            <li>but this turns out to be an advantage as a set of alkalines usually are good for a month or more, whereas the rechargeable batteries in my old Water Pik began to lose the ability to hold a decent charge after a year&#x27;s use, necessitating replacing the entire unit.</li>
            <li>The new batteries resulted in much stronger water pressure and I am using the first and second setting--which is fine.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with it, and for the money I don&#x27;t think that you can go wrong.    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay but not as powerful as the one I use everyday at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a few months and am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It was about $15.oo more than this Panasonic, and I expected a much longer life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product and bought one for my wife as well as my brother.</li>
            <li>I much prefer it to flossing.</li>
            <li>I like this guy because he doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Two-speed does the job and is just much quicker fill and use.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow directions to empty the water.</li>
            <li>to fill it twice to do whole mouth...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much the toothbrush leaves behing.</li>
            <li>Both of them really like it.  </li>
            <li>, they would really have a 5 star irrigator.</li>
            <li>All in all though,  this irrigator works very well.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and portable, and I just packed it in my carry-on for a three day trip from Ohio to California and return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t choke on too much water.</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic--you get an A+++ from me.  </li>
            <li>Not much water was getting through the teeny opening, but it works much better now.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always ready to go.</li>
            <li>OK for travel, not much pressure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth the relatively modest investment.</li>
            <li>so I guess it is a reasonable compromise.</li>
            <li>This unit replaces the very unreliable battery powered Waterpik Cordless Plus Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li>Powerful jet clear out any debris.</li>
            <li>I bought two of them, they all worked very well (basically for travel).  </li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds and he really thinks it does the job.</li>
            <li>He really likes this Panasonic Oral Irrigator.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I use a waterpic-WP-100wc at home and am very satified with it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I took a sewing needle and carefully removed the clog, making sure not to damage the filter.  </li>
            <li>very lightweight and portable.</li>
            <li>I am going to try it in my much deeper kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and without cord or taking up a too much space.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job on the teeth and gums my Dentist remarked what a  terrific job I was doing ,she said keep it up.</li>
            <li>, this really is messy!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>I purchased a lithium-ion 14500 battery (very close in size to a AA, but the nubby tab is reduced in height).</li>
            <li>and so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>all put together and ready for travel ...</li>
            <li>thanks for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The irrigator did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>so I was really</li>
            <li>We really like this product.</li>
            <li>Our dental checkups have been much improved with it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this product was even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used a corded irrigator before there aren&#x27;t any real surprises.</li>
            <li>Highest might be too much for some.</li>
            <li>it look like very good,Haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li>It has as much cleaning power as the faucet irrigator.</li>
            <li>I absolutely CANNOT use this without getting water all over myself and on the mirror.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it&#x27;s MUCH  queiter than my hydrofloss, which sounds like it&#x27;s experiencing the mechanical equivalent of an epileptic seizure every time I hit the switch.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is better than expected.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>A full tank doesn&#x27;t last long though so you have to hurry and then refill for a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>I can imagine how much research had the Panasonic engineers done to find out this point.</li>
            <li>The power switch and battery lid are very well water-proof.</li>
            <li>In the car, I realized that there were some important paper together with it, and I rushed back just to find out that nothing happened.</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I think the water is a gentle way to care for this injured area.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the pressure (not sure i would want it any stronger), the cosmetic looks, and its ease to use.</li>
            <li>It really gets the job taken care of.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my countertop WaterPik Mod.</li>
            <li>Waterpink as it ihas much stronger water force.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>It works very well and removes any food particals stuck between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The batteries are very durable.</li>
            <li>The flosser just arrived today and I was ready.</li>
            <li>This Flosser was recommend and noted for gently cleaning around the gums.</li>
            <li>I really like this Panasonic Irrigator.  </li>
            <li>What bothers me the most is that Panasonic&#x27;s warranty center in McAllen, TX takes up to 2 months to send the replacement.</li>
            <li>Has adequete strength to really help in flossing.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li>This portable unit performs well on batteries, and can collapse to a reasonably compact size for travel.  </li>
            <li>Well, I can&#x27;t really carry a bulky, electric irrigator with me and after doing some research decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li>....Works very well.</li>
            <li>Very convenient, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room on the sink.  </li>
            <li>Very well made, portable and with plenty of pumping power.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how much debris it removes from between my teeth and guns.  </li>
            <li>This one operates with two AA batteries, is compact, truly portable and works VERY well.  </li>
            <li>I was very unimpressed otherwise.</li>
            <li>I am very concerned about keeping my dental care and health.  </li>
            <li>I really cleans well and compresses to a convenient size for packing.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Dana</li>
            <li>I am very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li>You do have to fill it up twice to get your whole mouth done.</li>
            <li>I am not seeing myself using this much.</li>
            <li>But I do have an issue with the strength of the irrigation, it is so much stronger than the one I&#x27;m used to that it immediately hurt my gums and made me bleed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s INTENSE.</li>
            <li>it became an absolute necessity.</li>
            <li>plus points: The Panasonic Irrigator is fairly light, and it squishes into a relatively compact size.</li>
            <li>If you tilt it too much, the bump can&#x27;t get water.</li>
            <li>very reliable.  </li>
            <li>I really wish the tip was collapsible in some way or form, the tip remains jutted out</li>
            <li>It works reasonably well</li>
            <li>thanks for delivering the package,i like the feeling so much ,anyway</li>
            <li>When camping it is very convenient to carry it in bathroom kitbag to Community showers.</li>
            <li>and it was quite cumbersome and took up too much space on the counter.</li>
            <li>Been using this at work and it works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-simple design and very portable</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>This cordless Panasonic unit works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is compact and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have braces and it has made my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for the purpose</li>
            <li>Although a bit awkward to handle at times (for petite ladies or a child&#x27;s hands), it still is the best oral irrigator for travel.  </li>
            <li>More than I expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very well used.</li>
            <li>And it is very portable for traveling too.</li>
            <li>But I would not hesitate to recommend anyone who floss much.</li>
            <li>I keep one with the unit ready for battery</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t get through my whole mouth without refilling it).</li>
            <li>My travel one did not work very well</li>
            <li>but I think that would hurt, so probably doesn&#x27;t happen too much.  </li>
            <li>Somehow I like the fast cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much horror stories about oral irrigators not working.</li>
            <li>I really like this compact unit.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews before purchasing and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use, as there is no cord.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic units have lasted a bit longer but neither brand is very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the way my mouth feels after using this irrigator.  </li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>The unit does work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this water flosser.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as much cleaning power</li>
            <li>The unit is still working very well.</li>
            <li>This irrigator is very efficient and has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>Cheap and simple to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very portable.  </li>
            <li>it really gets into every crevice.</li>
            <li>This one has a much smarter design, no additional accessories needed.  </li>
            <li>Added cleaning gave me very kissable breath in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This irrigator works very well, is light and compact and portable, and the batteries last me about a month, which is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>But it does do the job and very well.</li>
            <li>It really flushes all debris from your gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>This product really hurt my gums after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>but the battery drains fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact.</li>
            <li>but I must say it works, and works very well.</li>
            <li>The irrigator came with two AA batteries and is very compact.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use mine out of my home.</li>
            <li>The fact that I did so speaks to the product&#x27;s utility and reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>It does use up battery power quite fast as it noticeably gets weaker after about a week.</li>
            <li>Very well designed and compact.</li>
            <li>Eh, too much trouble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i purchased this as a gift because i like mine so much.</li>
            <li>I cannot even stop me from using it very often.</li>
            <li>Use batteries, which is very portable and handy.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Only batteries available.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so I bought another one, figuring that for the price as opposed to Dental Bills its a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>(if I want to be really picky) is that I sometimes have to refill it before I have completed the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This product worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>recommend this for those who have implants and travel a lot as it is very portable.</li>
            <li>So I floss, use the brushpicks and the irrigator (very often with a distilled water / hydrogen peroxide mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I floss, use the brushpicks and the irrigator (very often with a distilled water / hydrogen peroxide mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, this is a highly recommended item!</li>
            <li>Very compact, works like a charm, and uses AA battery replacements.</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m ordering another one for use when I travel so that I have another one here just for my home bathroom.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this tool.</li>
            <li>but they do not wear out fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used an &amp;#34;oral irrigator&amp;#34; before, so didn&#x27;t really know what features to be looking for...</li>
            <li>the tip isn&#x27;t adjustable, there is no hose, so you&#x27;re holding the whole thing up to your mouth to use it.</li>
            <li>Spring for $40 and get the real Macoy by  Waterpic.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to keep your mouth closed or you will have water spraying all over the place . . .</li>
            <li>and I much prefer it then flossing, so</li>
            <li>so this is very convenient for me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the compact design because you can take it with you when you travel.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My son wants to use it every day now instead of his waterpik at home.</li>
            <li>really like the way this Panasonic water cleaner works.</li>
            <li>It has two speed settings, and both settings really do the job.  </li>
            <li>I never see food particles come out or really feel a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This irrigator is very efficient and has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>Water sprays all over the place even if I hold it very close to my teeth.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing, though, so no real complaints.</li>
            <li>but this device really does the job.</li>
            <li>and it works very well as an irrigator.</li>
            <li>so both hubby and I can use the unit (if he wants to) and we can keep track of which nozzle is ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for that.</li>
            <li>and I use every night and was felling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He has the countertop waterpick, which is a real machine and not conducive to kids to use, fill the reservoir, etc.  </li>
            <li>Correct and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still compact and does not take up much room on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>It has a two speed pulsating water flow and is very portable.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>This model of the irrigator is very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of pressure to get the job done and very portable.</li>
            <li>At home and at our beach condo I use a Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush (WP-900 )  also purchased through Amazon Smile.  </li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really seem to work real well either way.</li>
            <li>very durable, Item stopped working after I drop it</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I have to hurry too fast or refill.</li>
            <li>The two speed are very helpful.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting too much.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t feel any benefit by using this irrigator.</li>
            <li>and it really did the trick.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is very good。Customer service is very nice，To</li>
            <li>The water sipped into the battery chamber and blew out the whole unit and batteries in it.</li>
            <li>I really feel the water blasting through between my teeth with this product.</li>
            <li>Very well made portable irrigator.  </li>
            <li>This works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very usefull.</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>It worked really well for one year and three months.  </li>
            <li>Still works very slowly--at about 10 percent power.</li>
            <li>Does the job and very portable.</li>
            <li>very portable, thinking of keeping one in the office too.&lt;br /&gt;Speed buttons are a bit tricky to operate while using the flosser.</li>
            <li>I have some problem with my gum and it really helps when i use it consistantly.</li>
            <li>This is probably intentional so there&#x27;s not too much water pressure on your gums.</li>
            <li>But it really helps my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>and it is very portable.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I found that it is very convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very portable and fits into a quart size zip lock bag for travel.  </li>
            <li>Really knocks the food stuff out of my braces.  </li>
            <li>I was very sceptical about using another gadget even though my dentist urged me to purchase this oral irrigator.</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;ve bought another for my braces wearing nephew, and now that the price has been cut</li>
            <li>This Panasonic upgraded irrigator with two speeds is a much improved version of the two others I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Try to get out as much as you can.  </li>
            <li>Then store the unit that way until you&#x27;re ready to use it again.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t reassemble it again until you&#x27;re ready to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can take it with me everywhere when I travel because it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Goes through batteries much too fast.</li>
            <li>Much easier and faster than flossing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>CLEANS VERY</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.  </li>
            <li>this really helps, I also carry a bottle of water.</li>
            <li>but for it&#x27;s size it did better than expected.</li>
            <li>The only disadvantage is that the tip rotates too easily so it will turn when it just touches a tooth, the tip stayed in place on the older model.</li>
            <li>I have used it only occasionally when portability was desirable and found it to be effective.  </li>
            <li>The main thing is to keep the top of the unit dry after use, so as to help reduce any moisture ingress into the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the somewhat more compact form factor of my ten-year old Panasonic which finally died, but this does the job.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised actually that it had such good power</li>
            <li>Although it is smaller &amp; more portable, it does work nearly as well as another brand that I replaced.</li>
            <li>A complete upper bridge supported by 6 implants, which I love.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine having a 6 year old try to control this unit or even a counter top version made for kids outside of the shower.  </li>
            <li>explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>At least to me the oral irrigator is proven to be a good replacement for flossing tape and the process takes maybe 1/3 or 1/4 of the time.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read how to clear the water out after use or you&#x27;ll get a musty smell, especially if you store the brush with water in it.</li>
            <li>the power of irrigation will turn to too weak to clean your teeth effectively.</li>
            <li>Initially some discomfort while using, but get used to it pretty quickly</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Oral Irrigator is not meant to be a replacement for the home product, which has a large tank,enabling you to clean your entire tooth surfaces at one time.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without this oral irrigator!Love it so much!</li>
            <li>an open-box item sells at a much higher price than that of a brand new item, Amazon warehouse is misleading  customers.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was the battery and replaced it with a new one.  </li>
            <li>My gums feel healthier and its just plain amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for travelling - folds down quick and stores the nozzle inside.  </li>
            <li>Compared to a standard dental water pick, the capacity to hold water isn&#x27;t as great and there are only 2 settings - low and high -</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to replace batteries which last longer than expected.  </li>
            <li>No bells or whistles, like other brands, just good, solid performance.  </li>
            <li>But to be clear, it replaces neither of those other 2 activities; with each one (brushing, flossing, oral irrigator) providing its own set of  benefits.</li>
            <li>The battery live is very long, one month and even more using it one time a day.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job blasting away debris between my teeth, offers two pressure settings for those with and without sensitive gums, and is small enough to be bring on over-nights and vacations.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly for travel but even for home use it takes up less space and cleans as well as conventional counter top units (less capacity but can be filled more than once if needed) and is easy to store.</li>
            <li>It takes two fillings to clean out her whole mouth, even on the low</li>
            <li>I tried many other brands before settling on the one.</li>
            <li>I wish I had included an order for the second tip along with the original order.</li>
            <li>My experience with the original Water-Pik(tm) is that they are utter pieces of junk!!!  </li>
            <li>I have so many other electrical things plugged in at my vanity area (hair dryer, electric toothbrush, and vanity makeup mirror)</li>
            <li>They were originally purchased 5 years ago and are used daily.  </li>
            <li>The original batteries are still in, although they&#x27;re going to be replaced very shortly.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic lasts longer with better pressure than the other brand.</li>
            <li>I was not so sure before buying this product because it does not look so &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as some other counterparts.</li>
            <li>Probably the most major problem braces wearers have is tiny food bits getting stuck in your teeth that just swishing can&#x27;t dislodge.  </li>
            <li>In that, I agree with many other posters.  </li>
            <li>If you travel with one or more other people and all wish to use the product, you would have to carry the additional heads separately.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep the spout in your mouth while turning on and off with your lips closed around it, otherwise you will have spray everywhere!</li>
            <li>The water chamber is very small and the pressure is just not that good.</li>
            <li>Just a little messier than I had expected and not all that easy to handle since it is rather large, but overall pretty good considering the price.</li>
            <li>The water jet is powerful enough to really do the job, and the irrigator is easy to handle with only one hand.  </li>
            <li>The water on high is kind of messy</li>
            <li>Very portable specially for extensive travel.</li>
            <li>In comparison to other similar products, it provides much greater accessibility to clean all the nooks and crevices.</li>
            <li>The stream of water is definitely strong enough for me, and I love the fact that it is portable, and small enough to fit in a purse or overnight bag without having to take apart a large machine.</li>
            <li>so one may need to refill it a second time to thouroughly clean the gum.</li>
            <li>It has helped me reduce the times I need a hygienist to clean my teeth from 3 times a year, back to two.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll obviously want to clean the thing from time-to-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not thoroughly clean between my teeth, as the pressure is so low.</li>
            <li>In additional, it has bigger water container, so I can clean up my teeth in one water charge.</li>
            <li>Use it in the shower daily after dinner while waiting for my moisturizer to kick in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to keep my gums clean.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure the first few times I used it</li>
            <li>Although the fact that it&#x27;s smaller means that I can&#x27;t do my whole mouth with one tank full of water.</li>
            <li>Simple to operate and clean, but sometimes accidentally turning on irrigator while removing water reservoir causes water to spray all over.</li>
            <li>Only takes a minute or two and your mouth feels so clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly amazed at what flossing and brushing miss when I clean with it the Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  </li>
            <li>When you can see the debris (food - yuk) that gets blown out of your teeth, I knew that brushing/flossing wasn&#x27;t getting the teeth clean enough.  </li>
            <li>While you clean your teeth, turn off the product and spit the water out occasionally.</li>
            <li>Panny supplies higher water pressure than the old model but not as  much as my WaterPik (WP100)</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable and miles less noisy than the Waterpick that sounds like a sledge-hummer next to it.</li>
            <li>I use to worry about my breath and use the strips etc, but not anymore because this definitely keeps your mouth clean.</li>
            <li>Small enough to pack in a purse and works great.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t work, and thus cannot be held at any angle that allows you to clean the lingual surfaces of your lower teeth (I suppose it might work on your upper ones as the angle is not so bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel just as clean, if not cleaner, than traditional flossing.  </li>
            <li>Works simply enough: fill the \\&quot;trough\\&quot; with tap water, put the mouth piece in your mouth at the angle to clean around your teeth and turn it on.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>If it held any more water, it would likely be less comfortable to grasp.  </li>
            <li>Simple to operate and clean.</li>
            <li>In short these irrigators just don&#x27;t work for singles living alone in small spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it was discontinued about 4 years ago, I happily used the battery-powered Water Pik Traveler</li>
            <li>A good item for traveling, but find something else for home use if you have serious dental irrigation needs - say for bridgework, etc.</li>
            <li>This one is not as good as the dark blue one that they used to produce.  </li>
            <li>The whole thing collapes for traveling, is the only unit I know of that has replaceable batteries,and with new batteries has a very powerful spray.</li>
            <li>but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling ....just came back from vacation and easy to pack!</li>
            <li>Very portable and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think ultimately this irrigator would do better with a strength setting from 1-10 much like the Waterpik&#x27;s plug-in model, then I wouldn&#x27;t have to experiment so much with different battery combinations.</li>
            <li>so you have to work fast at high stetting.</li>
            <li>The minor and important design flaw is the water tank can&#x27;t be open up to clean inside.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to the Usual Oral B irrigators available in most drug stores which have weak batteries.</li>
            <li>Note that on high speed it is much less powerful than a standard Waterpick but still effective.</li>
            <li>I hate flossing but does the same with water pressure that is pleasant and very effective.  </li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s designed very well, the water capacity is adequate (approx 6 oz), there are two different power settings, fits well in my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reservoir emptied quickly, also, but really couldn&#x27;t be any bigger and still be portable.</li>
            <li>Battery power is strong enough for a complete cleaning.</li>
            <li>The pick is turnable so that you can adjust it at your right angle, but it sits tight enough to not rotate spontaneously.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on reliability or battery life, since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I give this product  5 stars because its cheap, it works well and it lasts a ridiculously long time.  </li>
            <li>It took nearly 5 years to wear out the first one I bought - so I immediately ordered another one.</li>
            <li>got a couple years use from my 1st Panasonic, and then had to buy another one, but it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive compared to the &#x27;professional&#x27; unit the dentist just sold to my s/o for $140, which takes up valuable room on the sink, and which he will never use.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic portable is every bit as effective as Water Pik, if not more so.</li>
            <li>Our first set of batteries lasted nearly a month.  </li>
            <li>While I did read one review that described the awkwardness of having to hold the entire Panasonic unit to use it, I did not find this to be true.  </li>
            <li>Packs up nice and small with place to store pic.</li>
            <li>Small and effective and mobile.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re back to full power.  </li>
            <li>and it closes up into a nice small size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>usually mix a capful of Listermint mouthwash with warm water in the unit.</li>
            <li>One downside is that it is pretty loud, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Not bad for travel, and about the only choice for camping or hiking.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, the work is satisfactory, but water less of it, one can not reach the expected effect, needs a lot of water, carrying in travel is a good choice, the overall situation of it</li>
            <li>Not a very long life for sure, but for travel, I will continue to use my second unit, which was purchased December 2011.</li>
            <li>the top slides down.</li>
            <li>Love the way it folds down</li>
            <li>The top part can be collapsed down into the water reservoir for traveling--with storage space for the tip.  </li>
            <li>The water tank is small, but it&#x27;s easy and quick to refill.  </li>
            <li>The strong jet fills my mouth up quick and I usually end up with a puddle of water on me and on the sink-</li>
            <li>The jet pulse stream is actually stronger than that of my former plug-in, and it has continued to operate strongly on the first set of (2 AA) batteries for about a month.</li>
            <li>It is the first oral irrigator I have, the current is strong enough.</li>
            <li>The reservoir is good size - could be a little bigger</li>
            <li>The reservoir is good size - could be a little bigger</li>
            <li>It is very messy but that may lessen with practice.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering &amp; shipping was quick and easy as I expect with Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would like to find a case (soft or hard) to hold it for the times that I travel and to keep it clean and safe.</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced to be competitive with water pic (methinks), and the quality is above average for sure!</li>
            <li>The new one works very well, also.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a low cost way to keep my daughters new palate expander clean.  </li>
            <li>I found that using it on the lower speed, and with a reasonable speed in moving it along my teeth, a full reservoir is just the right amount of water to cover the front and back of both lower and upper teeth.  </li>
            <li>It works, but not very easy to use without splashing water on yourself, though with practice we are getting better.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a try  mostly because it would take up less room on my  crowded bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Top half does not stay in correct position, I had to use electrical tape to hold it in use position.</li>
            <li>Just follow the instructions and aim the water jet at 90 degrees (or slightly towards the top) to your teeth, never forcing water into your gums and you should never have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would have been better if it was slightly cheaper though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s innovative design which occupies less space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked fine at first - and the battery life was acceptable, but then a couple of times after putting in a second battery, the pressure suddenly dropped.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more compact, takes up less space in my bathroom, comes apart for cleaning, and packs a punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist considers it adequate for travel use but not for regular at-home use.</li>
            <li>This is my second panasonic oral irrigator, and this one has much better power than the last.  </li>
            <li>I was specifically looking for one that was portable, didn&#x27;t require charging, and had a decent size reservoir.  </li>
            <li>We bought ehis particular model since we travel often between Germany and the USA.</li>
            <li>The unit had more than enough power with the two different power selections...</li>
            <li>on 2x AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Overall quality is decent.</li>
            <li>ok, that&#x27;s too gross for some of you, but think about it for a second]</li>
            <li>Otherwise, for a &#x27;portable pik&#x27;, it works decent for the AA&#x27;s it runs</li>
            <li>It provides a decent stream of pressurized water that will flush food particles from between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This one is quite powerful and one gets the cleaning accomplished with the water tank that it has and when the power runs low , you can just change the 2 AA batteries that it comes equipped with.</li>
            <li>I use a larger counter top model (different brand) for in-home use.</li>
            <li>so this operates the same and noone realizes how many particles one has beetween teeth before using ,but they are sparking white after</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for a, still working but older Panasonic, unit.</li>
            <li>Its water capacity is big enough to hit all of my teeth more than once.</li>
            <li>It holds enough to do one quick cleaning on setting #2.</li>
            <li>but Panasonic cleverly incorporated a way to enclose the stem when the unit is folded for traveling.</li>
            <li>I had an older Water Pik that died.  </li>
            <li>Howver, this is a portable unit and I am using it as my main unit.  </li>
            <li>Over time, I finally adapted and was able to contain the fluid to the sink.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the main reason that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Decent power for my needs.</li>
            <li>The main asset is convenience.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace and oral B portable irrigator (not enough room on bathroom counter top for the bigger one).  </li>
            <li>I will keep my eye open for something better in the future.  </li>
            <li>It pumps with enough force to work as a flosser but runs through batteries quickly (one session, in my case).</li>
            <li>Batteries last a while, but has a noticeable drop in pressure fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as a larger model but works very well.</li>
            <li>I ordered this waterpik to take on trips with me particularly overseas.  </li>
            <li>I bought this mainly because I have implants.</li>
            <li>After more than 5 months of almost daily use, I feel my mouth and teeth are actually cleaner.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly now because of my braces.  </li>
            <li>Advantages:  compact, powerful water-jet action, holds plenty of water to enable complete rapid flossing (without having to refill reservoir).</li>
            <li>I got this irrigator when I heard a speaker mention about amazon.com and this product he brought from amazon in particular.</li>
            <li>Replacement for older unit that lasted 5 years</li>
            <li>Not this particular model, but told to get one.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s low price and convenience/portability factor make it a super buy.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is adequate...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a more expensive one would be any better performance-wise but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to purchase this instead of the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>So you have to fill it up 3 times to do anything decent.</li>
            <li>Some people complain that the Waterpik (which is more powerful than this one) is not powerful enough.</li>
            <li>Some people complain that the Waterpik (which is more powerful than this one) is not powerful enough.</li>
            <li>Operation is straightforward and the reservoir is sufficient, although some people may need to refill it depending on how long they need to run it.  </li>
            <li>With the rechargeables, the irrigator does pump water, but it&#x27;s too weak to do much good.</li>
            <li>But, like so many other things, it has been supersized: the new model is much bulkier than the old one.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all the way in your mouth and closing your lips tightly around the nozzle to make sure no water comes out.</li>
            <li>highly recommended, would give it 5 stars if wasn&#x27;t a bit bulky.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>

            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The pressure is so high that if you miss your teeth (which you will a lot), it will hit the roof of your mouth, your tongue, and your uvula.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It was just 6.5 inches high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li>I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>Using regular batteries on this Panasonic Oral Irrigator causes the action to last much much longer and with more power than the WaterPic&#x27;s rechargeable batteries and there are fewer breakable parts.</li>
            <li>the Panasonic was highly rated and I couldn&#x27;t find negatives about it.  </li>

            <li>Highly recomended for travelers</li>
            <li>It is well-designed, rechargeable, and made of high quality components</li>
            <li>I was in a high altitude area</li>
            <li>Thats is a high tools for cleaning my tooth</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Use high output batterys to increase its performance and life.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it for the road warriors.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space but is still pretty strong for its relatively small size.</li>
            <li>Low is less intense pulsing but works effectively.</li>
            <li>As I recently noticed in other reviews, this thing can end up hosting mold that cannot be effectively cleaned/removed from the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine when I use it after showering since everything is wet then anyway.</li>
            <li>I travel quite frequently and I make certain to take this everywhere.</li>
            <li>This was a great tool for me to reach those spots that floss is tough to get to!</li>
            <li>I would have love a little stronger jet but for a traveling unit, this is a well-designed irrigator.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more power from the jet.</li>
            <li>It died after little more than one year.  </li>
            <li>If it held a little more water, I would do 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It does seem a little weaker than the counter model, but not a lot, and still more than sufficient to take care of my needs.</li>
            <li>I love this little dental \\&quot;irrigator\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Love this little thing.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little better constructed for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Love this little water pick.</li>
            <li>do wish it had a little more strength, but it does do the job</li>
            <li>Could use a little more power but</li>
            <li>Recently, I was very excited to find the Oral Irrigator by Pure Enrichment, $29.99, which uses double A batteries, but I quickly discovered that it had absolutely no water pressure whatsoever</li>
            <li>A small &amp; great product you can keep with you wherever you go ,you&#x27;ll always feel fresh,and it keeps the dentist away...sooo easy to use,just need a small bottle of water &amp; keep a couple of double A batteries and your always ready ...</li>
            <li>The first few days after I was fine.</li>
            <li>Our biggest disappointment are the batteries - it does not come with rechargeable batteries and charger, which I found very surprising.</li>
            <li>I think Panasonic tried hard to make an acceptable portable appliance for cleaning between teeth,  this is a nice try,  but no cigar.  </li>
            <li>It is not as strong as my other unit on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic has created a little marvel: it&#x27;s a snap to use, does a terrific job, and is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Only a dentist, in my Panasonic I use a little hydrogen peroxide too keep the unit disinfected, I had a water pic years ago and more powerful</li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish it was a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li>Works great, reservoir could be a little bigger but no big deal.</li>
            <li>I have several troublesome teeth where food frequently gets caught, and as an experiment, I used three full reservoirs worth of water trying to clean these trouble spots.</li>
            <li>Product reduces to small travel size, user friendly, uncomplicated and performs adequately.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective but a bit messy due to the attached reservoir.  </li>
            <li>I give the new unit a 3 star and older model a 4 star, since pulse pressure is of #1 importance.   </li>
            <li>This new unit has two pulsing speeds, rather than one on the older unit, and almost twice the reservoir capacity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also experienced the on/off switch getting difficult to turn.  </li>
            <li>Use a bigger one that I had for everyday use, but this is great for anytime especially travel.</li>
            <li>The pulse action of the water is much stronger and has 2 speeds instead of one.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve not had an irrigator and hesitate to invest in one, this one is great, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>I keep this in my shower, as it is too messy to use in the sink, but I love it.</li>
            <li>but my first impression is that it is really good.right amount of  pressure for daily use..small enuf for travel.easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like panasonic..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  After a few weeks of use, I&#x27;ve managed to not spray water everywhere and am able to keep it off my clothes and just in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>but for it&#x27;s small size, it&#x27;s power is good enough.</li>
            <li>Runs on batteries, but still feels powerful enough to dislodge food stuck in your teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a very simple device designed to do one thing and it does it pretty well at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that because it&#x27;s so powerful, water splashes on the mirror.</li>
            <li>this product is well worth buying (especially when you have braces)!</li>
            <li>I think it has been useful especially when I forget to floss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different water flosser devices and this is far and away my favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is useful and convenient for my daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does a good job and is small enough be put into the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty much maintenance-free, using replaceable AA batteries (I used the eneloop ones), and I can get the replacement nozzles at my local departmental</li>
            <li>I feel as though I need to wash the whole unit in hot, soapy water before I set it aside for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simple, durable, powerful, &amp; EZ to use.</li>
            <li>I tried rechargeables, but they weren&#x27;t powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>Except this problem, I have no complaint.</li>
            <li>The thing I like the most is how small it is and how travel ready it is.  </li>
            <li>I figured if I had a unit I could actually put away after each use, it would be worth refilling it once or twice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the Irrigator is doing what it is supposed to do, but it is messy to use.</li>
            <li>Similar to a waterpik, not quite as powerful.</li>
            <li>Not unhappy with it, but not totally overjoyed either.</li>
            <li>you squirt that much water in, you better be leaning over the sink so as not to get the entire front of your shirt soaking wet.  </li>
            <li>I worried at first that mold would grow in the bottom chamber, which never dries out completely, but that hasn&#x27;t happened so far</li>
            <li>I wanted a small unit that did not take up too much space on my counter top.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was so big and pretty much had to keep it out all the time because like they say out of sight out of mind.  </li>
            <li>the WaterPik...not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the same quality as my old one that wore out after many years of use.</li>
            <li>Just have to buy one every few years, until they come up with a better design.</li>
            <li>Its ok but messy.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be powerful enough.</li>
            <li>Even on low setting, the water stream is quite powerful.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t spray for more than a few seconds, eventually figured out the filler tube in the reservoir</li>
            <li>Even if it lasts only a year, I&#x27;ll consider it worth the money.</li>
            <li>Bought a WP350 long ago .... was OK but always had to refill water for a cleaning session &#x27;cuz tank couldn&#x27;t hold enough water.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted to have found it for approximately $20 cheaper.</li>
            <li>works OK not a huge amount of pressure</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Good but not great..</li>
            <li>Now if this new unit had speed 1 as high and speed 2</li>
            <li>A little large but works fine.  </li>
            <li>Good cleaner, got the other one on the market and this is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Could ad a little texture to the switch</li>
            <li>The new model has a much larger water reservoir than the old one and a jet stream comparable to a full size WaterPik.</li>
            <li>Small, light, battery operated and strong enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It works great with a full charge but gets weak about near the second or third week of use (I use it once a day)</li>
            <li>Its powerful enough when the battery is new.</li>
            <li>I fill the water container with mostly water and a half cap of mouthwash (against product recommendations) and have had no trouble.</li>
            <li>Note that I drain the water compartment after use and leave its plug open so the compartment can dry out as I believe it is more sanitary.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m home, I find myself using this device instead of my corded model if I need to use it in the middle of the day simply because it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up, I needed a coin to unscrew the battery compartment, then I had to pull out the green water tank, insert the spraying end, fill the tank with water and it was ready to go.</li>
            <li>It only has two settings but the weaker setting it strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>I just use the low intensity since a strong blast of water can actually damage the gums.</li>
            <li>I prefer using it while in the shower, because it can get messy since the water is spraying at a moderately quick and powerful level.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the water stream is moderate, but not what I would call strong.  </li>
            <li>I have to replace them while they still have &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; because they are not providing enough power to produce a strong enough water flow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, is full of water is not enough for half a minute on the run!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small footprint is welcome in a tight bathroom, and it will pack very well to travel.</li>
            <li>it it was about right on the low setting.</li>
            <li>The actual nozzle stays in place to ensure you get the water to the right place.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ignored the negative and focused on the positive.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviews state this device is pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>This makes it possible to clean out your whole mouth by only filling the resevoir once.      </li>
            <li>Just not worth the money for something that breaks so easily,</li>
            <li>It is not easy to use and there should be more speeds than just two.  </li>
            <li>-- floss quickly &amp; effectively without the mess and fuss that one would experience with regular flossing.</li>
            <li>My teeth have just the wrong size gap in a couple of places, and the Panasonic Flosser power spray is very handy to finish what a toothbrush just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted , but after a few month it totally lost power, even with new batteries makes only much noise.</li>
            <li>It is true that the reservoir is limited, but this reviewer did not find this a problem; if needed one an always re-fill and continue.     </li>
            <li>Despite using these various soaps and different power levels, the Panasonic irrigator continues to run fine.</li>
            <li>Because it slides down into the case it is easy to travel with</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hold enough water for me to clean my entire (normal sized!)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the power that I would like to really blast stuff out of there and the capacity isn&#x27;t large enough for me either.</li>
            <li>There are two speeds and after a few days I think most people will only use the higher one.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is great though for trips because it is so small, not much bigger than a big bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a little over a month now and so far I have been completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I also own a hydrofloss irrigator, and this little chap simply doesn&#x27;t compare in the pressure department.  </li>
            <li>This thing keeps my braces clean without much hassle, and it folds down into a convenient travel size - which means I can bring it to work on days when I have appts., etc.</li>
            <li>They work great; however, trying to get the top open to replace batteries is nearly impossible; and secondly the batteries do not last but a few weeks at best (if you use it everyday).</li>
            <li>I leave the fill tank plug open to dry and the unit has remained very clean.  </li>
            <li>So you have to buy a new one each two years.</li>
            <li>This is an item I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>It is a toy if compared to Phillips new Airflosser ....  </li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t live without an oral irrigator this is your model - it can&#x27;t be beat on either the price or quality level.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>The new one can be folded up and operated by battery</li>
            <li>I am new to water flossers.</li>
            <li>or so I figured I&#x27;d  go with a new model.  </li>
            <li>I am on line now looking for a new one, this will not be one of my choices.</li>
            <li>and I have to get used to the feel of the new one.  </li>
            <li>This is an item I can&#x27;t live without now.</li>
            <li>As New Electronics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still works like new, and I use it three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am considering using it as a replacement for my water pik when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>So, I immediately ordered a new one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new version has two speeds and a new replaceable nozzle.  </li>
            <li>I will insert new batteries.</li>
            <li>I must purchase a new unit.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I need new rechargeable batteries as the ones I used</li>
            <li>If you are used to use waterpik irrigator, u can&#x27;t live without this when travelling.</li>
            <li>so I change it,but after replace new batteries stll not working.</li>
            <li>I decided to dispose of it and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I decided it was time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li>After two cycles of battery replacements the unit would not pump water out althoght I had even replaced with new batteries.</li>
            <li>Even after flossing and using my new Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have a new one sent to me in Australia</li>
            <li>so I took hers and ordered her a new one from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I put in new batteries</li>
            <li>Thinking it would be resolved with new batteries i exchanged them.</li>
            <li>THEN I WILL WRITE A NEW REVIEW......</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work at all, even replace the new battery.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of good reviews but the pressure is too low and the water tank does not slip out completely which makes it hard to clean or dry.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using the water pik or any such item.&lt;br /&gt;There was some initial bleeding since I was pointing nozzle right at the gum.</li>
            <li>This battery-operated unit is easy to handle and convenient to store,but it has less power and capacity than wired units.    </li>
            <li>I kept it clean and handled it carefully, as I do.  </li>
            <li>I had previously because this unit uses easy to replace batteries and there is no need to put it on a charger.</li>
            <li>I must of had something on the side when I closed it and that got inside, and was a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised with the power in this simple and powerful water flosser.</li>
            <li>I had their older model which had only one speed and didn&#x27;t hold enough water, so was pleasantly pleased with this one, and would definitely recommend it for travel.</li>
            <li>Powerful even on low setting, so not for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>I find it harder to control and more likely to irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li>And I know that I double check when I open the bottom part that it is secure.</li>
            <li>even more so when using it so be careful not to take it out of your mouth until after you shut it off as, although it sounds like it is done, it isn&#x27;t necessarily and you may end up squirting the wall, mirror or floor!</li>
            <li>and it sure could push out all the little bits of whatever between the teeth!  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t do for regular use, because the reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to clean all teeth at the high pressure setting.  </li>
            <li>you use this thing I feel after brushing becomes very clear.</li>
            <li>Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator with High Capacity Water Tank by ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a very old Panasonic Irrigator.  </li>
            <li>This irrigator was purchased to replace a very old style of oral irrigator.</li>
            <li>i actually like it very much</li>
            <li>And if you have a piece of wire or small enough brush to fit into/through the Jet Pik, use that too, to help clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it have a 0.5 speed.&lt;br /&gt;Speed 1 makes a mess all over with the strong jets.</li>
            <li>It takes up very little space on the counter top, and you don&#x27;t have to plug it in.</li>
            <li>Takes up very little space on the counter and the water chamber is not an issue for me, just add more water.</li>
            <li>Portable ,small, easy to use, and works very well  </li>
            <li>It has 2 power settings, and the water pressure is adequate, not only for a battery operated unit, but for a water flosser in general.</li>
            <li>It has 2 power settings, and the water pressure is adequate, not only for a battery operated unit, but for a water flosser in general.</li>
            <li>have been complaints about the unit failing after a short period of time and parts breaking; my unit is very new, but - if it lasts a reasonable length of time, I&#x27;ll just replace it - the unit isn&#x27;t covered by warranty in Australia and</li>
            <li>beats them clearly!   </li>
            <li>Overall I believe this is a product I would have bought first if I&#x27;d not had to stay with the Water-Pik</li>
            <li>The first one wore out after 3 years of constant use.</li>
            <li>When I finally found someone who could order the pricer was much higher.  </li>
            <li>I have finally replaced the batteries for the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and compact, so I&#x27;ll be able to take it along when I travel.</li>
            <li>However, learn to keep your finger near the switch button since the water will squirt all over you once you move the mouth piece away from your mouth!  </li>
            <li>I first came across an advertisement in 2009 on the use of Oral Irrigator which sells the idea of an alternate replacement to flossing.</li>
            <li>Not knowing what exactly happens, I attributed this to my luck and make a second purchase in May 10.</li>
            <li>I am able to relate what other users complain on the short batteries life in Waterpik which affect the reliabilities of the product.</li>
            <li>yes, the batteries have to be replaced but to me that is a small expense to be able to do what a toothbrush cannot do.  </li>
            <li>So, I tossed it in the trash and ordered another one (yes, exact same model).  </li>
            <li>I can not believe it  and you will not either ,I first  saw this  item in a magazine  then several magazines .</li>
            <li>Using regular batteries is a lot better then having to recharge proprietary batteries which only last a year or two</li>
            <li>I first purchased the waterpik cordless at double the price and had problems with it.  </li>
            <li>Replacement unit (probably refurbished) received December 11, 2012 and subsequently used for short intervals on five more travel trips over next 15 months.</li>
            <li>The first two units I owned were the predecessor model with the darker blue color.</li>
            <li>On my first unit, the motor progressively lost power after a year or so of daily use.     </li>
            <li>Not only it is better for your wallet, but they last 10 times longer than regular batteries.</li>
            <li>In the past I have had a Waterpik plug-in oral irrigator taking up more counter space than I care to spare.  </li>
            <li>Love that it can be compressed into a small carrier and that it works so well.  </li>
            <li>I am still on the first set of batteries--AA alkaline--after several months.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like this as much as my regular plug-in irrigator overall, but this one is much more transportable, obviously, and it works well.  </li>
            <li>IT IS USED DAILY, AND HAS NEVER FAILED.  </li>
            <li>I used it, and it seemed to do the trick pretty well until I went back to the orthodontist and discovered this irragator wasn&#x27;t as thorough as I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to thread the floss with a threader loop several times, and frankly, I&#x27;m not that ambitious</li>
            <li>It comes with 2 pressure and is generally quite gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this irrigator, I had fluid all over the sink and counter because I was not used to using it.  </li>
            <li>I would say my device is the exact opposite</li>
            <li>We ordered an extra set of tips because the original order came with only one.  </li>
            <li>Getting an extra since like it so much!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 1 year and the 2nd</li>
            <li>My first one stopped working after about 1 hour of use and the last one after about 3 hours of use (over 3 years).  </li>
            <li>I like this product - it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, as long as you have fresh batteries in it.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a learning curve sprayed the bathroom mirror first time, and I don&#x27;t think it is a sharable item, we will be ordering another one.</li>
            <li>Taking stars out because the tip seems to be pretty fragile, they need to see how waterpik make theirs.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it overall- worth the price!</li>
            <li>Make sure to buy a big bulk of QUALITY batteries as you may need to replace them every other month or so.</li>
            <li>Panasonic Oral Irrigator  worked exactly as advertised - took it on Safari and to 5 different countries</li>
            <li>My first finally wore out after 3-4 yrs of service.</li>
            <li>No complaint, so far.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted for 4 years with daily use.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find it was battery operated!  </li>
            <li>I was using the low setting at first</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used other products with Eneloop batteries, specially a waterproof shaver, my older Conair dental irrigator and never had a problem with these batteries, so I take the risk and use it with these batteries because this thing eats batteries alive.</li>
            <li>I personally felt the higher speed was a little too strong, so stuck with the slower one.  </li>
            <li>Could spray a little harder but very nice overall.</li>
            <li>The nozzle swivels around a little which makes it easy to reach the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li>but the flow is a little strong.</li>
            <li>Even on the high setting the jet stream is mild compared to other products.  </li>
            <li>The water &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; holds enough water to clean my entire mouth, no need to refill it.</li>
            <li>Bought the Wateerpik big portable and didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t have enough force to clean my teeth and gums</li>
            <li>the only problem - which I now know, is to clean the outside of the container before packing it up.  </li>
            <li>It collapses down to fit in my toiletry kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this has a nice water jet with 2 speeds and works well,  but its a little hard to clean thoroughly</li>
            <li>I need to always have an oral irrigator close to me due to my dental pockets and the resulting severe consequences if I don&#x27;t clean them out in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>It is a good travel water pick, but the pressure is not strong enough compared to a regular one.</li>
            <li>The high setting is too much for me, so I use it on low.  </li>
            <li>I retired my old Panasonic and purchased a new one -so</li>
            <li>I live in a 100 year old home</li>
            <li>As far as water pressure, on a new battery</li>
            <li>Gave it less than 5 stars because the reservoir needs to be re filled for a longer wash .</li>
            <li>Gets very scummy inside over time and there&#x27;s not a really easy way to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to carry and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and my mom and i use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Wow, the stuff I first got out was gross.</li>
            <li>As an adult with braces in the past two years I became fanatical about keeping my mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li>Running a strong solution of bleach through the system for a few seconds cleared that problem, but after 10 years</li>
            <li>The top where you insert battery is hard to open and close for the first time users.</li>
            <li>and I was not getting positive dental check ups after multiple trips.</li>
            <li>It is quite long once extended, so if you are short, you might not be able to bend over your sink and use this device, but I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and have no problems with it.</li>
            <li>it was exactly as described and the battery life seems to last pretty long.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that it &amp;#34;collapses&amp;#34; small enough to fit in my medicine chest or suitcase!  </li>
            <li>Even though the manual stated that some people might get gum bleeding during their first few usage, I was fortunate enough not to be one.</li>
            <li>My first irrigator (same model) lasted several years and was still working very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice device but the water jett force is weak.</li>
            <li>My husband had new crowns and dental implants recently and this really gets in and cleans the area well.</li>
            <li>I experienced some slight gum bleeding on that first use as well, possibly because of using it wrong until I got comfortable with it, but from the second time I used it there was no bleeding.</li>
            <li>Japanese are such smart people!!</li>
            <li>Pros for the Panasonic: easily replaced AA batteries, larger reservoir than the WaterPik while being partially collapsible for travel.</li>
            <li>At home I keep it downstairs for a quick cleaning without having to go back up to use the larger waterpik.</li>
            <li>The suction from the motor drawing out the water from the blue tank causes it to kind of close down on itself in the middle of you using it.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be comparably as powerful as the Waterpik Ultra counter-top model (on moderate settings) that I purchased at the same time, as long as the batteries are kept fresh.  </li>
            <li>Once I got used to it, I can floss in one fill with no mess!</li>
            <li>If you are satisfied with the low setting, you could replace the batteries less frequently.</li>
            <li>Fits in the right amount of water for a single use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WATER RESEVOIR  IS LARGE ENOUGH.....</li>
            <li>It has two speeds, low and high, but I &#x27;ve been using high speed exclusively.</li>
            <li>worked well but a little cumbersome when filled - do not know how to fix the problem</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and so far it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>After I use my Sonicare toothbrush and think my mouth is clean, I irrigate and watch the food particles missed by brushing swirl down the drain.</li>
            <li>Dry outside on clean towel, shake out as much water as you can from container part, set out on clean towel in dry area to air dry</li>
            <li>It gets the job done although I imagine the larger ones have a little more force.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Love to add a little mouthwash to the water, but I may find that clogs the scope in the future as well.</li>
            <li>I love that this little oral irrigator is low tech.  </li>
            <li>4 stars is because I wish there was one more stronger setting to remove really hard to remove stuff.</li>
            <li>I used the original portable waterpic and found it didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Used on two vacation trips, the second of which significant motor slow down and minimal water pressure issues were experienced.</li>
            <li>Other than it&#x27;s limited reservoir, I just love this irrigator.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic clearly makes improvements based on the Customers wishes.</li>
            <li>However, she was quite clear that it is not a replacement for flossing.  </li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;ve gotten half of my mouth clean, the instrument is so covered with&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;water</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I don&#x27;t have to use boring flossing any more on my gums.</li>
            <li>Although  the tank appears clear of water, it should be placed in a sealed plastic bag when packing for&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am waiting to see what Amazon says about refunding it since it clearly did not last a reasonable period of time.</li>
            <li>The reservoir holds enough water that I can do my whole mouth without refilling.</li>
            <li>I was just going to buy the old standby for $60 or $70 when this product caught my eye.</li>
            <li>and so far it has been running well.</li>
            <li>and so far.. its been a reliable brand for me.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this as I find flossing very time consuming especially for my case where the growth of my wisdom tooth traps food particles every time I eat.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My dentist is very insistent on the use of some such dental hygiene instrument, so I dutifully went to the store and bought the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; hand held oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li>:   Has 2 setting for sensitive gums and nubie users.  </li>
            <li>but they were a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>This irrigator fulfilled that with its short, straight tube.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>After several years of paying too much for Waterpik, I then tried a Profloss 4190 Waterflosser for $19.99.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Buy  &#x27;Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser (WP-440)&#x27; by Waterpik</li>
            <li>I used the curved nozzle tip to gently move the tube outside of the chamber.  </li>
            <li>I decided to  check this out at Amazon just to see if they had it ,they did and wow was it</li>
            <li>still can not  get over how much  I saved ,I saved a total of $23.00 without shipping,from Amazon</li>
            <li>Battery has lasted 3 weeks so far with every day use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like the Panasonic Oral Irrigator and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>So far the irrigator has had no problem pumping this \\&quot;soap\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s seriously loud in comparison and</li>
            <li>that they don&#x27;t collapse and spray water everywhere, but not so far apart that the hose inside the reservoir stops working</li>
            <li>so you might have to refill the tank two or three times to complete your cleaning.</li>
            <li>I gave away my bigger one because it took up too much room, and was a pain to deal with.</li>
            <li>Just be mindful that if you have just returned from the dentist and your gums are sensitive that you may feel some discomfort.  </li>
            <li>The reservoir does take a couple of filling to completely rinse out the debris.  </li>
            <li>I have multiple crowns and bridges it my mouth, and my gums are always swollen no matter how much i brush or floss</li>
            <li>Runs on two AA cells, so completely self-contained.  </li>
            <li>I unexpectedly found I like batteries</li>
            <li>Water capacity is modest, but sufficient.</li>
            <li>The entire unit is hand held and battery operated making it very convenient to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Mine completely didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Old one lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the water force of my old Water Pic</li>
            <li>so there is no plug near the sink.</li>
            <li>This thing starts up immediately, and even the directions recommend keeping it running until the water has completely drained after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needs frequent sterilization from bacteria build up.</li>
            <li>(so far)</li>
            <li>It is really convenient for travel, and I always take a couple extra batteries with me in case I run out of power.</li>
            <li>really like the collapsing design and the solid construction.  </li>
            <li>This appears to be designed for adult use.  </li>
            <li>Now if I can remember to direct it into my mouth!?&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>but if it is used frequently the batteries need changing often.  </li>
            <li>The level 2 is even stronger than level 10 in the corded water flosser \\&quot;Waterpik WP-660 Aquarius Professional Water Flosser\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t kept a record exactly how long batteries last, maybe 2 months, but when I change them, I take it apart, clean it and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li>It arrived the same day that i ordered it, had plenty of pep, and really did the job.</li>
            <li>Too early to see how this one will do.</li>
            <li>So far, I can&#x27;t find any cons.</li>
            <li>and I prefer floss, so far.  </li>
            <li>In combination with a sonic toothbrush and standard flossing, it did a great job of helping me to avoid an expected 2nd round of root planing.</li>
            <li>old irrigator gave out after 5 years of travel-only use.</li>
            <li>My son is using it daily and really enjoys the massage of the water.  </li>
            <li>I owned and used the old Panasonic Oral Irrigator for two or three years</li>
            <li>So far it has lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Today it died completely.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that I&#x27;m still practicing with it, and soaking the whole bathroom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for nearly a year</li>
            <li>As an adult I have bracers now, since I can afford them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old water pik started leaking into the battery case</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>The spray is not forceful enough to really do the job and the batteries need to be replaced often.</li>
            <li>reviewing from a mature woman&#x27;s perspective.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 14 yr old son who has braces and its alot easier for him to use than floss.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m an old pro.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, battery operated and totally portable.  </li>
            <li>, you have to refill it several times to do your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>Cleans teeth and mouth completely</li>
            <li>I know it is supposed to be gentler on the gums to use these units at a lower pressure, but this seemed really too low for me</li>
            <li>Obviously, it does not hold much water either, but</li>
            <li>My 9 year old has an expander.  </li>
            <li>When my grandson developed cavities, I sent him one of these.</li>
            <li>B006609MBG Epic Dental</li>
            <li>&amp; I really like that it uses regular AA batteries</li>
            <li>; it means that if I&#x27;m out and about and the batteries are dead, I can use batteries available anywhere to get it going again.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik has much gentler options that actually let me use it on the lingual/palatal surfaces of my teeth, whilst this oral irrigator must be held upright else</li>
            <li>I am really surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li>only drawback is I really don&#x27;t know when to replace the battery.</li>
            <li>If your gums that are sensitive to a jet of water, there could  be something happening there that may require attention, and you can alert your dentist or hygienist to take a</li>
            <li>May have to fill twice to do a complete job.</li>
            <li>It is completely mobile and collapses when emptied and even provides storage for the tip when collapsed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like not having to recharge, worry with a water device near a plug, etc.  </li>
            <li>Also, take it apart after each use and lay on a paper towel near the sink...</li>
            <li>I like the 2 speed action.  </li>
            <li>have since purchased the device locally and really do like it</li>
            <li>I go; not just on my frequent business trips but even for a day out in the city, for example.</li>
            <li>A portable water pic was recommended by my dental para professional.  </li>
            <li>So far I like this.  </li>
            <li>and I did worry about the mold issue as there really isn&#x27;t any way to keep that lid open without laying it on its side.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This may be subjective but it seems the battery life is longer than with the old version.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, it has fulfilled all our expectations.</li>
            <li>must be conscious when the performance reduces, as when to change the batteries.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill completely.</li>
            <li>but so far the batteries have lasted well anyway.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my 12 year old son who has braces.  </li>
            <li>love this water pick no tangling of tubing had for at least 2 years</li>
            <li>For the price of nearly $40</li>
            <li>So far it works quite well.</li>
            <li>I am using it so far at home, but it&#x27;ll go abroad with me soon...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on the gums and taking all debris out, in just one minute.</li>
            <li>I am a dental professional and had never used Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my 8 year old grandson who has orthodontics.</li>
            <li>Runs on batteries completely cordless.</li>
            <li>Had to recharge the WP360 unit frequently ....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using panasonic irrigators for years, this model is lightweight, portable, uses 2 AA batteries, has 2 settings (for sensitive gums)</li>
            <li>I threw away a waterpik a year ago because it was such a hassle, took up too much space, needed to be primed all the time.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 12 years old daughter, for her braces.</li>
            <li>I took this item on a recent trip and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>far as cleaning the water chamber, I have yet to find out how.</li>
            <li>But none compare to the old 350W with respect to power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the currently-available travel models</li>
            <li>have done away with the hose and attach the tip directly to the battery case atop the reservoirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was actually looking for something very compact for traveling, however</li>
            <li>It is sensitive to the angle you hold it at</li>
            <li>Works as well as my old plug in model.</li>
            <li>I love how it can remove the trapped particles between my teeth in an instant!</li>
            <li>After 5 months of regular use it stopped charging and will no longer charge the unit so it is only useful for a doorstop.</li>
            <li>The thing I like the most is that the reservoir and the motor section come apart so that it can be completely dried out prior to storing.  </li>
            <li>This system is the greatest way of cleaning between your teeth without having to use complicated and messy floss</li>
            <li>tank full of water doesn&#x27;t last for long</li>
            <li>The newer design is sleeker and doesn&#x27;t have a cap on top that only trapped water and invited mold.  </li>
            <li>Makes you feel like your own dentist, without all the BS and assistant jabbing the back of your mouth with the saliva sucker.</li>
            <li>Not quite as powerful a water jet as I expected, but the unit works</li>
            <li>As to be expected, using the product is messy, but it has proven to be reliable and effective.</li>
            <li>The irrigator was good at removing food, but not perfect -- I had to use the Waterpik at home to get rid of the deeper stuff (including the plaque stuck just under my gumline).    </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the pressure is not as good</li>
            <li>Not very powerful to clean between teeth properly, but not very weak either.</li>
            <li>The switch is easy to maneuver- slow, high, and off.  </li>
            <li>Gross, I found black mold growing in the tank and Panasonic does not know how to clean this unit and told me I need to buy another!</li>
            <li>The water stream is not powerful enough to fully clean one&#x27;s teeth, particularly if one has braces.</li>
            <li>This is small enough to carry in my purse and was very helpful when I first got my braces and was very self conscious, particularly in situations when eating out.  </li>
            <li>The new Panasonic irrigator has a battery compartment and electrodes similar to the previous model (EW1270AC), so I&#x27;m sure the same comments apply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received my second one of these little waterpiks, finally wore out the first one after many years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>I can only use the low speed when the batteries are fresh; high speed with fresh batteries might loosen a few fillings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Low speed is a nice option for dispensing ACT or other mouthwash to the gum line, but the reservoir is so small that you must work very quickly - note the instructions suggest to use only water and to always empty the unit after use).</li>
            <li>It is small, compact and packs easily.</li>
            <li>Next issue is water seeping through the unit when I clean upper left side of the mouth.</li>
            <li>The reservoir chamber is small, yes, but it can be easily refilled.</li>
            <li>Small and compact, this irrigator is easy to use and and store.  </li>
            <li>Relatively small and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>strong stream, small design, and</li>
            <li>This is very good while it lasted, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>Helps to clean out the little pockets between the gum line and the teeth, which no amount of brushing will do.</li>
            <li>-No cords, therefore no tangle and no need to find a plug  -no base station and no un-serviceable internal batteries to wear out  -Small footprint  -plenty of power  -very compact when collapsed  -tip protected when collapsed  </li>
            <li>My advice is, if you want something that really does the job, go a little higher end.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little or maybe a little more than a little Messy,over all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I can get by with one tank full of water on the low speed, but usually fill up the tank again for use on the higher speed.</li>
            <li>With this portable model, I can take it in the shower, so no mess, and</li>
            <li>the other reviewers battery claims you need fresh alkali</li>
            <li>good quality but the water tank is a little bit small.</li>
            <li>Two speeds make it even more desirable then single speed on my previous irrigator.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works, but it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power as an electric one and the battery live is not terribly long.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted years until the pump started to loose power.  </li>
            <li>After all, if you&#x27;re going to let your engineers rather than your marketing people name your product, it&#x27;s pretty clear that you&#x27;re placing a high premium on functionality and somewhat less of an emphasis on form.  </li>
            <li>The irrigator also seems to have opened up the areas between the teeth since the tape is now getting in between the teeth a little easier (has never happened in several years of just flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to use (got it going without even reading the instructions) and the tank lasts for half the mouth (meaning for ex. lower teeth, front and back) at the slower speed, which for me is not a problem since the tank is so easy to fill up.</li>
            <li>You know how effective it is when you use it between your back molars and can smell the bacteria as they are cleansed out - disgusting but very reassuring - better out than in!</li>
            <li>I use this everyday to clean teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li>It works fine and can collapse to be fairly small for packing.  </li>
            <li>Need to clean it everyday.</li>
            <li>It does clean your teeth, but too messy.</li>
            <li>I guess that was too much because now it only has half the power with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li>There are only two settings and I only tried out the higher one.  </li>
            <li>Only caution, use the low speed at first until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>, this is overall a decent product for the price point and the added convenience of travel utility.&lt;br /&gt;Runs</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s quick: less than a minute.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll keep it, just wished it was the same as the older one.</li>
            <li>The older model was made in Japan, and this is a Chinese product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 2014:  </li>
            <li>And it shortly became my main irrigator, as the Waterpik collects dust somewhere in a closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty big, but much smaller than a mains-operated unit.</li>
            <li>Battery life is decent and manual states use Alkaline only, although rechargeable do work.</li>
            <li>Taking with travel and expect no less.</li>
            <li>Getting food trapped in my teeth at lunch breaks was becoming a big problem for me.</li>
            <li>(usually fill the reservoir twice to make sure I get the entire mouth covered).  </li>
            <li>The first batteries lasted about 6 months, the second set 3 months and the last set not even a month.</li>
            <li>it came with is different than the main Waterpik one.</li>
            <li>Batteries last a decent amount but as they weaken the force of the water decreases as well.</li>
            <li>This irrigator should be conevenient for those who travel because the top part can be pushed down into the water reservoir when empty, for compactness.</li>
            <li>By the third usage(and clean up), I knew I wanted to return it, and thought due to the nature of the product that it would be nonreturnable.</li>
            <li>I have purchased three of the same irrigator from you; however, it is extremely dificult to clean water receptacle without dismantling the item.  </li>
            <li>I would say the high setting on this unit is about equal to 5 or 6 on my Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>The pressure is so high that unless you close your mouth entirely, it will spray everywhere.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time in a thorough packaging, though I believe the high quality of its plastic would not require such a thoroughness.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic Irritator actually jet out high velocity water and washes away the food residue.</li>
            <li>Like the high low feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are two settings, low and high.</li>
            <li>Ultimately as you get used to the pressure, you&#x27;ll use high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this model over my last irrigator, the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W.</li>
            <li>It has two settings, high and low.</li>
            <li>The batteries last a fairly long time and I like the fact that the attachment stores right inside the item while it&#x27;s collapsed.</li>
            <li>I am going to switch to a little more expensive flosser and an electric one to see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>little vaseline or similar lubricant on the O rings every few months is also a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I previously purchased anther product by ToiletTree, it didn&#x27;t last a year and dint have a sound design.  </li>
            <li>I leave the cap open after I use the irrigator to make sure it stays dry and doesn&#x27;t have a chance for mold or other odors to form.  </li>
            <li>I actually have only been using the lower power level as the other one is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, fast, even after brushing, sometimes small pieces of stuff are washed loose (</li>
            <li>Vary simple design, less to break down love it!</li>
            <li>I tried it on several trips out of town and it really works well, great water pressure but not too much to be painful.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts long time, and it cleans out very well.  </li>
            <li>Not really as good as the countertop Waterpik that has many settings.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I was getting ready for a week long vacation &amp; decided to give this portable a try.</li>
            <li>So even though it&#x27;s not perfect, I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li>The switch needs to be redesigned to not only to fit into the existing cavity but a larger thumb push is needed, because of the amount of water splashing about the hands are wet</li>
            <li>Still, the minor issues aren&#x27;t very problematic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really shocked at any negative reviews for this irrigator because I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with it, despite being nervous about making the great leap from string</li>
            <li>as title, and much cheaper than here, but not use it frequently as not get used to it yet.</li>
            <li>Normal alkaline batteries seem to last around a month</li>
            <li>It has 2 power setting, and I normally use the low power, should be enough for normal usage.</li>
            <li>I normally use the irrigator after I bush and floss my teeth, as the final finishing touch.  </li>
            <li>They have made a few improvements, including a two stage power switch if you don&#x27;t want to run it full blast.  </li>
            <li>For travel use, the nozzle can be stored in the small indented space in the side of the upper unit - it is a tight fit, but I did manage to fit it into the space.  </li>
            <li>It takes up very little space and is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Kids could have fun shooting the water at each other!</li>
            <li>The resevoir is large enough to irrigate my entire mouth.</li>
            <li>However, this unit will not replace my vanity top one as the pressure is not adequate for long term daily use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a user friendly, nifty little gadget that gets the job done without a fuss!</li>
            <li>now takes me less than a minute to floss my teeth, and I can tell you the tartar build up has been significantly reduced in just this short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Despite the warning against using rechargable batteries, I went ahead and starting using NiMH rechargeable AA batteries, but I noticed the unit wasn&#x27;t pumping as hard as with the alkaline, and so I had even more difficulty getting the daytime plaque removed.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough to blast food out in hard to reach places like the back molars, water capacity is adequate and also retracts to a compact size for travel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I buy a new product, I actually expect it to work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The new one is about the same size</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t see forking out a lot of $$ for a new big klunky WaterPik.</li>
            <li>Although it took quite a while, once I actually reached the Panasonic Customer Service Department, they replaced my irrigator with a new one.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s with twice, sometimes three times daily use, but you can hear the difference in the pump between when they were new and now.  </li>
            <li>This new one is bigger and gives a longer irrigation time and it even has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;After a bit more than a year of using this, some mold has appeared in the water compartment, which is impossible to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-designed and easy to use, and a AA battery lasts at least a month, in my experience.</li>
            <li>Cleaning - simply dump water out from hole, wash outside with soap and water, fill hole with a bit of clean water, spray it until empty, pull unit apart, wash with soap and water, detatch tip, wash with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I worry that this doesn&#x27;t dry very thoroughly between uses though...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think it is worth the trouble having it fixed.  </li>
            <li>i really needed an oral irrigator as my last 2 became inoperable because of the same defunct part.</li>
            <li>I suspect the device will help maintain oral hygiene, but don&#x27;t count on it being anywhere near as powerful as a plug in model, and don&#x27;t count on it to remove all trapped food particles.     </li>
            <li>I had a Water-Pik several years ago that took up too much counter space, and also quit working after several months</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my tiny bathroom and you can&#x27;t beat the feeling of cleaning your teeth with such a device.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using this one because my regular one trips the electric outlet I&#x27;m using now, and it&#x27;s much easier to transport this one around, obviously.  </li>
            <li>but now has 2 speed and improve connection for the tip but slightly less powerful jet.</li>
            <li>I have one and have purchased at least five more as gifts for friends over 50 who are starting to have gum issues.</li>
            <li>Problem is that a fresh set of batteries lasted less than a week.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this unit for our 6 year old who is having some early orthodontic work done to try to avoid future problems.  </li>
            <li>Also the hygienist had much less trouble doing the cleaning - she usually has to be pretty forceful between the teeth, but today was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>bought this for my daughter who recently got braces,it works very well for that,be carefull though this thing is powerfull and can hurt if not used properly</li>
            <li>[because 2 others failed within a year and they were good enough to replace]</li>
            <li>I used this at least once a day during my two week vacation and the battery is still working strong</li>
            <li>Super messy.</li>
            <li>The unit seems a little big at first, but I got used to it very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I selected the first of two power settings because the second setting was a little too much for my gums.</li>
            <li>However, I always had to watch the dial to stay at the right low and high points that I later found other family members of mine also use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Panasonic oral irrigator to take along during an extended European trip--and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>It does run out of water fast on the higher speed, but only takes a few seconds to re-fill and finish.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one I have owned, the first one last a little of 18 months, which is why I do not rate this higher.</li>
            <li>But for me as an often traveling person, there is no other possibility.</li>
            <li>last a long time, powerful enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>sure how long the batteries last, but I&#x27;ve used it every day for a few weeks and no sign or change in water pressure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any other product to compare them to because this is my first oral irrigator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m due for a dental appointment, I&#x27;m interested to see the results.</li>
            <li>This was our first oral irrigator and chose it because of other reviews.</li>
            <li>NOT small enough.</li>
            <li>Also, it is small enough to easily pack in my overnight bag.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and small enough to take with you when you head out to dinner or to someone&#x27;s home for dinner.  </li>
            <li>Reservoir is small, but so easy to refill, not a big deal.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it is hard to shut off and easy to go from low to high but not low to off.  </li>
            <li>I initially believed the spray wasn&#x27;t as powerful, but I put my regular plug-in irrigator side-by-side outside and the spray distance was the same.  </li>
            <li>i just ordered a new one, after trying an oral irrigator by toilettree products ([[ASIN:B00E6AR2J2 2nd Generation Professional Rechargeable ToiletTree]] which died on me after only two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it on the airplane with no trouble, and used it a few times a day for a month and a half while traveling.</li>
            <li>A powerful little water flosser.</li>
            <li>battery power makes it such that if it&#x27;s low in power, you can just switch a battery and get full power restored, rather than waiting 12 hours or so for a charge in those other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, to use this product, you have to slide it open, fill the reservoir, close the reservoir lid, hold the product vertically by both the top and bottom halves, keep them separated, put your head in the sink bowl, activate the device&#x27;s power without even being able to see it, then awkwardly spray the product around inside your mouth, frequently hitting and damaging the roof of your mouth and your uvula, occasionally choking and gagging when the high pressure spray goes down your throat, and having water occasionally spray</li>
            <li>is powerful and I clean it by soaking in a deep narrow plastic cup with water and a little bleach.</li>
            <li>It has two power settings, at first the low was almost too high, then after a little use (the battery voltage dropped) and</li>
            <li>I would have made a video, but you really don&#x27;t want to see all the little bits of food that the Panasonic Oral Irrigator removed after normal dental</li>
            <li>on the first use the water container leaked a little - something I&#x27;d never seen before on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little unit is really nice in that it folds up small for travel..</li>
            <li>The water pressure, even at the high #2 setting is pitifully low, compared to, say, a Waterpik or similar electronic type.</li>
            <li>Only two speed settings - mid or high.</li>
            <li>I wish there was an extra setting, between the high and low, because I find myself between extremes.</li>
            <li>At first I had a little strange feeling when I used this irrigator, but now I very like it:</li>
            <li>This implement can be a little messy to use at times, but it does generate a powerful stream of water that can be quite useful in cleaning debris from between your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>generally takes 2 fills per cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The unit collapses into a small enough size to fit into my cosmetic bag, so I can take it on extended trips without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>something you can&#x27;t do when only a small hole is available for filling and draining.</li>
            <li>It works really well and holds enough water for one long water floss.</li>
            <li>The instructions were simple yet clear.  </li>
            <li>Better than bulky full -sized one that sits on counter and looks ugly.</li>
            <li>Our old Waterpic finally fell apart after years of service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised my dentist never recommended such a product.</li>
            <li>far I have tried only 1 as my gum bleed at the end of the water</li>
            <li>This product barely gets the job done but burns up batteries in the process.  </li>
            <li>It barely pulsates and water does not come out.  </li>
            <li>just be careful not to aim at your gum, it really hurts.</li>
            <li>I have to fill it twice to complete upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought this water flosser about two months ago only to have it die completely.  </li>
            <li>The only inconvenience is that I have to refill the water tank twice to complete cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this for 3+ weeks on the same 2 AA batteries and it works well.  </li>
            <li>So far it works well, enough to get the gunk between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Although it is recommended not to use rechargeable batteries, I have done so at times, and have had no problems with this so far (4 months of daily usage).  </li>
            <li>I feel like it gives me a solid minute to two minutes of thorough flossing action.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old one (model ES1270) that finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the unit overall.  </li>
            <li>As an adult with braces, it is a necessity to get food out of my teeth, especially at work.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want one of those old water piks where you have to set them up, fill a big container, and they take up counter space.</li>
            <li>Apparently the unit is so waterproof that you can not access the battery compartment.</li>
            <li>I only tried it once so far -- to see how it compares to my plug-in Waterpik Waterflosser.</li>
            <li>Despite the negatives I see in the Panasonic, I would recommend it because the Waterpiks simply die young.</li>
            <li>but barely.</li>
            <li>No comments as to the longevity, as it&#x27;s only a month old.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my ten year old daughter who has braces.  </li>
            <li>Despite daily emptying and cleaning the inside casing developed blackish mold.  </li>
            <li>pressure is definitely much stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li>Having used 5 different oral irrigators and this one by far out preforms even those in the $50 to $100 price range.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Learned after a couple of trips to remove the batteries completely - unless you can figure out a way to keep it vertical the entire time you are in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two Panasonics I&#x27;ve had died after about one year.  </li>
            <li>I gave this oral irrigator a solid 5-star rating because it did exactly what I expected it to.  </li>
            <li>If is not clear how old a child should be to use it without adult</li>
            <li>This one should be used along with regular normal floss...not an alternative of regular floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid the 123 people who gave this contraption a 4 or 5 star review, seem to have no clue as to what a good dental irrigator is all about.</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as some of the plug in models and I do not use it for everyday home use.</li>
            <li>It was catching all the debris without fail.</li>
            <li>bought this because my full size &amp;#34;Hydrofloss&amp;#34; product is too big and heavy to travel</li>
            <li>I would prefer the pressure to be a little higher, and it is slightly bulky, but it seems to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Which means that if you were to set the product down on the counter while it is full of water, the two pieces of it would slide back together, draining the entire reservoir onto the counter.</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful waterpik, and small enough for travel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Think this unit is sipping water with a straw, so you need to keep the bottom of the irrigator always down and figure out how to clean every single space between your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Took a few tries to get it right, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>when full extended for use, sometimes the unit does not lock firmly enough and slides back slightly when switched on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last, but it is still pumping strong after everyday use for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Recently I read a review where the user said that hers was losing its power, even put in new, or different,  batteries, with no change in performance.</li>
            <li>It also ran out of water relatively quickly (I get it, the reservoir can&#x27;t be huge or it&#x27;d be really awkward and cumbersome to hold) -- between that</li>
            <li>it is easy and much too complicated with the waterpick.</li>
            <li>I have a full size water pick, but it takes time to get out set-up and such a short tube from machine to handle, plus I have to stand there at the sink, making a bit of a mess as water squirts every where.  </li>
            <li>I can live with this minor quirk</li>
            <li>You can order parts if needed over time, however I figure its cheaper in the long run to just purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than I thought, and doesn&#x27;t hold enough water (you will have to refill it at least twice), but I think it&#x27;s a good choice for the price.</li>
            <li>all of which died in 6 months or less before I bought my first Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is my first time using one of these things, the one thing that I was not aware of - simply because I just didn&#x27;t think about it - was the amount of water that comes out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Nice product except for the fact that there is no way that I can see to take the base off to clean it out after multiple uses.  </li>
            <li>I bought this unit based on Amazon reviews and not alternative branded 110v units because of obvious voltage differences here in Australia - Australian buyers of US appliances from Amazon should do their research a bit more carefully before complaining that their new purchase failed immediately when first powered on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a strong pulsation and the ability to collapse it down cuts down on sink space.  </li>
            <li>it does appear to be cheaply made and I have little hope that it will last me a long time--but it may surprise me.</li>
            <li>At first they had a little trouble (fun) getting use to the water squiring at them, but with some practice they got it under control.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes if you push very hard on the top of the battery cap, you can get the unit to run, but only while you maintain this pressure.  </li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds, but we always use the high speed (which is not really high).</li>
            <li>I installed  brand new batteries and after few days of use the pressure of the water jet goes down significantly.</li>
            <li>The tank is small and not enough for a thorough mouth clean.    </li>
            <li>Worked fine with one set of batteries for 16 days with at least once daily usage.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this was for the size as I live in a condo and have little counter space.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything -- other than to maybe remove some food particles.  </li>
            <li>you have hard water with minerals in it that gunk up your unit, fill a clean 2 liter soda bottle with filter water from your fridge or Brita and use that in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But other people might prefer the pulse, so I can&#x27;t ding it too much for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very compact for travel unlike some other products that are labeled for travel.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get use to, you will make a mess the first couple times.</li>
            <li>I made a mess the first time I used it because I didn&#x27;t aim correctly and water went every where.</li>
            <li>It makes a mess too the first time you use it</li>
            <li>I am a person who flosses at least twice a day, and despite me being diligent and consistent with this, my first flossing session with this irrigator did cause minor bleeding in one area, which indicates that I was probably not flossing correctly in this area, despite all the effort put into flossing daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works extremely well and packs readily for travels.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The only fault that I can find is that the jet is a little too powerful even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>I really liked this water pick until the motor gave out last week.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it just puts out a very weak stream (after changing batteries and cleaning the flow tube).  </li>
            <li>It does get a little gross after a bit of time.&lt;br /&gt;Decent product overall, and probably decent value as it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li>Much nicer to use than my old on-the-counter heavy water-pic.</li>
            <li>After using a WaterPik with a bigger capacity reservoir, I filled the Panasonic at least 2 times trying to match the thorough job I was used to.  </li>
            <li>but with two bolts connected to a central plastic tube and two diodes in parallel (taken from an old AC adapter) to reduce the voltage -- it connected the two bolts together.</li>
            <li>On low setting, I use it to flush out all the old amalgam bits the dentist left in my mouth.    </li>
            <li>My old one finally stopped working after 2 ,years of constant use.</li>
            <li>good enough for travel, a bit awkward to hold because it&#x27;s bulky.</li>
            <li>Also, there was some odd suction action with the tank during use that would force the tank up as the water emptied, which forced the water to leak even more.</li>
            <li>: The inside can never totally dry out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t imagine the batteries will wear down all the quickly, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to find out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time you use this product, it can be a little intimidating.</li>
            <li>I added the irrigator to my nightly routine, I use it on the first setting (which is still a little painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes a little bit of getting used to the handling at first because of all the squarting, but don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of us living alone - about 28% of all Americans - finding a place on the counter-tops of our typically tiny bathrooms for these behemoths is a major challenge.  </li>
            <li>Being prepared to see a bulky thing, I was not very surprised with its modest size when it was in the package.</li>
            <li>, it is an economical and applicable objects, the only problem is that the water is less, probably because it is portable items!</li>
            <li>Feels the same as the other with the large tank.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Small but have enough power to clean your inner mouth.</li>
            <li>No mess, or maybe only occasionally, when i forget to close my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stream is neither too weak or so strong it will damage your gums.</li>
            <li>This model is very user-friendly, and just plain old works.</li>
            <li>I will get a little grisly for a moment, Being the randy old fart that I am with all the attendant problems of such</li>
            <li>; reservoir capacity enough to finish the job in one fill; powerful enough to get all the little bits.  </li>
            <li>, no tool will make cleaning your teeth and gums fun, but this one makes it very little work.</li>
            <li>Small water reservoir is just enough for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li>While this portable units works ok it is a bit clumsy to use due to its size.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some other oral irrigation &#x27;systems&#x27;, this one does not come with a whole slew of different attachments.</li>
            <li>, every time with a different all-natural fluoride-free toothpaste - I&#x27;ve tried several brands and settled on 5-6 of them), flossing, using [[ASIN:B005LF0QZI Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks, 275 Count (Pack of 4)]], chewing xylitol gum (again, tried several brand and settled on Epic (like this one</li>
            <li>I have braces on my teeth - ulk-I&#x27;m to old for braces, but anyway, I was taking a week long trip</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s been a few months and since I&#x27;m now willing to say \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;, I&#x27;m upping my rating to four stars.</li>
            <li>A litle messy at first until I got use to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, compact and powerful.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s still doing something beneficial as opposed to not doing it at all but not really sure it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>For the first few years, it let me travel and water floss.  </li>
            <li>but boy did it hurt the first few times.</li>
            <li>convenient, small, portable, powerful; batteries run out in a month and have to be changed.  </li>
            <li>If you want a larger water receptacle, buy the big water pick or other large unit.</li>
            <li>but I feel in order to clean the entire mouth I have to replace water at least three times.</li>
            <li>Just be ready to switch out the batteries once they start to run down, as weaker batteries affect the performance a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact when collapsed down.</li>
            <li>Tilt the whole thing upside down, rotate it, turn it from side to side, while it is on, to get all the excess water out from all parts of the device.</li>
            <li>I impulsively bought this when it was on sale, mainly because I hate flossing my teeth and thought this would be a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s two settings, the first (low) setting doesn&#x27;t yield any results, and even after using the second setting, there&#x27;s still things that aren&#x27;t able to be reached and are unable to be removed other than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the tank is a little bit small, but it&#x27;s okay for travel or carry.</li>
            <li>My criticism is that the batteries need to be replaced frequently -- or the force of the water becomes so weak that it does not do an adequate job.</li>
            <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the unit isn&#x27;t the most convenient to handle, and the power switch can be little hard to operate, particularly if your hands are wet.  </li>
            <li>I received this item for less than a week and very please with the product.  </li>
            <li>I previously used the waterpik brand with the whole tank contraption.</li>
            <li>The unit retracts into half its size for travel, which the portable Waterpik could not do, very convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li>The drawback to that being the water reservoir empties quickly and I have to refill at least once per session.</li>
            <li>adequate (negative comments in some of the reviews).</li>
            <li>The first one last about a year until the motor is dead.</li>
            <li>I do have to refill it one time, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the portability of this tiny and powerful machine.</li>
            <li>Since my WaterPik unit was years old, I thought I&#x27;d try something new (and save a little money).</li>
            <li>Within a few months I went for my LANAP evaluation and was told that there is no need for a full scale procedure anymore, only localized for one single deep pocket.</li>
            <li>Within a few months I went for my LANAP evaluation and was told that there is no need for a full scale procedure anymore, only localized for one single deep pocket.</li>
            <li>I used rechargeables now for some time in this without issue other than their very tight fit.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that this has a little longer life, but if it goes, I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li>it is a little large to be maneuverable.</li>
            <li>This little gem is so smart &amp; usefull.</li>
            <li>It does not, however, have a very capacious tank and usually requires a second fill to complete the job.</li>
            <li>Major plus point is that it is extremely portable and everything folds to an adult palm size.</li>
            <li>I also will clean the unit with a bleach (Chlorox) solution of less than a half an ounce per tank about 2x per year to kill anything that might start growing even though I use the listermint mouthwash in the tank.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic Portable Dental Water Irrigator takes up less space when not in use and is much quieter than the standard countertop model I used years ago.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the water runs out so quick...</li>
            <li>Initially I noted the batteries would die very quickly, then the volume of water being pumped decreased - then this morning - it totally quit working.</li>
            <li>If we&#x27;re playful we&#x27;ll spray each other with it if someone tries to grab it first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The soft battery cover can easily be damaged by the wrong tool to open it</li>
            <li>may try and track down the older one as this needs some engineering improvements.  </li>
            <li>This oral irrigator works very well, but I wish it were a little larger because I need to refill it before I&#x27;m done flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li>It cleaned between my teeth very well and only freaked me out a little bit.  </li>
            <li>I think I had \\&quot;prototypes\\&quot; in the past, though this model is very much the same.  </li>
            <li>irrigators are, at their most basic level, a small water reservoir, some form of electricity, and a thin nozzle to spray high pressure water between your teeth.</li>
            <li>In order to use it, you have to awkwardly hold the top and bottom halves of the product just far enough apart</li>

            <li> Panasonic this product for my teeth ache alleviate the problem, now after every meal I will use it, he really effective basically replaces the toothpick, but sometimes still need to cooperate with the pressure line, but for me this is really a good stuff!</li>
            <li> Once set up very easy to operate and shows very good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant, but not aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the best products I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and packs easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble &amp; use at home &amp; perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully, and the batteries are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> It was compact, easy to operate and performed wonderfully.</li>

            <li> They are easy to use, this is an excellent massages and cleans the mouth.</li>
            <li> We found that since it is waterproof, the best option for us was for our daughter to use it in the shower every night which makes for easy cleanup and no water all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic portable is extremely easy to use and does an excellent job.</li>

            <li> Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> The best ever  Great for travel and powerful for battery</li>
            <li> Still, it does a good job of cleaning in conjunction with a toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good product although sometimes I need to fill it twice.</li>
            <li> The two AA bateries lasted 40 days, at this rate Panasonic is superior.</li>
            <li> For the money, I think it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> and the reviews were good</li>
            <li> The pressure is not as good as the Waterpic</li>
            <li> Good battery life, it goes on all trips with me.</li>
            <li> The battery life was amazingly good.  </li>
            <li> I loved the Waterpik handheld, rechargeable; but about once a year, the battery would no longer recharge.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> My god, it&#x27;s just that good in design.</li>
            <li> this one seemed like a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> This is not so good.</li>
            <li> It is also good for flushing out food particles that get caught in gum pockets.    </li>
            <li> I have always owned a Waterpik which is also a good product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a good way to use this.</li>
            <li> This was a really good buy.  </li>
            <li> I received the product in good shape</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the Water Pic.  </li>
            <li> But, it does the job, was good price</li>
            <li> If you want good pressure, don&#x27;t order the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Just good for landfill now.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price of about $30.</li>
            <li> Good pressure.</li>
            <li> It is exceptionally good for a battery operated model.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product is a good value for the price paid.</li>
            <li> , that is good for traveling.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy it again, but the model was discontinued, perhaps because it was so durable and they couldn&#x27;t make a good sale out of it.</li>
            <li> I got this Oral Irrigator, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t someone make a good one of these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this Panasonic on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a good piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> This is a good oral irrigator.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Works great, folds up nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a good battery irrigator.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be good for a portable waterpik that you don&#x27;t have to plug in, but it&#x27;s just a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and chose this irrigator over the others because of the good accolades.  </li>
            <li> good value,fine products</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s plenty good for a temporary oral hygiene tool.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes itself into a portable case and has a good stream of water as well.</li>
            <li> No need to recharge hours just two AA batteries are good and working nicely&lt;</li>
            <li> The water tank leaks when i tip it over and tried to get a good angle to spray.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it does a good job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This appliance seems to do just as good a job as the electric water pik</li>
            <li> This is a good product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> good enough?\\&quot; way)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is a good product to buy</li>
            <li> battery lasts a good length of time.  </li>
            <li> - I bought it because I didn&#x27;t want to clutter my vanity with appliances - good price, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good design neat storage ability.</li>
            <li> This product has helped keep my gums and teeth in good shape.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> Good performance as an accessory along with a ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I ordered Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A from the seller Good</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICED ITEM IN ADDITION TO BRUSHING.&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> Had it for a week on the road and loved it.</li>
            <li> It works good, I will buy again if this one breaks one day.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Well made and relatively good battery life.</li>
            <li> good purchase.</li>
            <li> and I find it to be superior to Water Pik in every category.</li>
            <li> A good buy for 30 dollar purchase.</li>
            <li> good product, cannot replace the teethbrushing</li>
            <li> A good personal,portable oral irrigator that does the job for a good price.  </li>
            <li> It is a good adjunct to the home based Water Pik I use.</li>
            <li> It does a good job</li>
            <li> The feature is that it collapses for storage, so would be a good travel unit.  </li>
            <li> Good for camping, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, good.</li>
            <li> Batteries were good.</li>
            <li> Good investment for my teeth.</li>
            <li> The stream is quite good and has two speeds</li>
            <li> Puts away well and good for travel.</li>
            <li> It is vastly superior to the WP cordless model.</li>
            <li> Compact, good size reservoir and not one (1) but two (2) speeds.   </li>
            <li> I thought this might be a good model to use when I travel, but it leaks.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job for that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> But the size does not affect the performance except in a good way.</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job and gets out stuff</li>
            <li> think I will introduce a friend to buy, share the good stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s battery operated and gives good pulses of water.</li>
            <li> A good attempt but</li>
            <li> Generally good product.</li>
            <li> My dentist has me doing the Waterpik thing, so I trust that it is a good idea.</li>
            <li> It was a good care product after brushing and flossing but just didn&#x27;t have any staying power.  </li>
            <li> Rather than feeling assaulted like they do when I floss, the irrigator makes my gums feel good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this irrigator for about a month &amp; my mouth &amp; teeth have never felt so good.</li>
            <li> Good reliable product.  </li>
            <li> This is especially true of rechargeable battery models.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would be good for traveling.</li>
            <li> I am 100% delighted with this product and the results.</li>
            <li> However, it is a good follow up to brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> A good product.</li>
            <li> It is great not having to search for a plug or deal with any kind of adapter.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning food between teeth.  </li>
            <li> For those people who are considering the Panasonic portable as their day-to-day at-home waterflosser -- it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This does a really good job.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so eager as now to write a review for when a good review is so well deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good value for money.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price!!!Using the bathroom is the most good, as there is water splashing.</li>
            <li> It was so good, someone stole it.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good alternative to having a unit sitting on my counter and that you can take it with you on vacation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : It does a good job cleaning the teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does get out food debris that brushing may not get --seems to be a good thing to start off with as part of your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> My dentist found my gums in good health.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning after you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I wanted a well designed oral irrigator,and this one, upon 1st impression, is a good design.</li>
            <li> Its a good addition to oral care.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition; promptly, too.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, she laughed and told me she was just as hopeless until,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my breath and</li>
            <li> apparently, good for my irrigator.</li>
            <li> It is compact, packs up nicely, and works just great.</li>
            <li> After a week of usage, I would say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Does a good job for away from home use.</li>
            <li> Good for travel.</li>
            <li> I think the amount of water it holds is sufficient for a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Plus, having blown out an AC power-supply based irrigator while traveling internationally, it&#x27;s good to never have to deal with that again.</li>
            <li> and this fits in and works as good as my stationary one at home.</li>
            <li> the water pressure feels good</li>
            <li> Two speeds, good design.</li>
            <li> The system works well and the power is good...</li>
            <li> Our teenager just got braces and my husband wisely suggested a water irrigation device.  </li>
            <li> tried once, worked good.</li>
            <li> This may be a good quality product.</li>
            <li> It is a good value</li>
            <li> Yes, there are 2 speeds which is a good option.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive water flosser, then this is a good option.</li>
            <li> good stuff  </li>
            <li> For not that much more money, the Waterpik removes an incredible amount of material from between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you position it correctly it does a good job cleaning inbetween your teeth</li>
            <li> The pressure was good, I even used it on the lower setting and it did its job.  </li>
            <li> function of the unit seems good, from what I can tell.  </li>
            <li> received the product yesterday, packaging was good and within 20 minutes I was using the product in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For traveling where weight is an issues this irrigator is a good solution.</li>

            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good battery life.</li>
            <li> --If you like good industrial design (think iPad)</li>
            <li> I got this cordless irrigator on a sale for a good price</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> I thought this would make a good item to have on trips, but it uses up a lot of battery life and gets moldy, to boot.</li>
            <li> I used the lower speed and felt like it was doing a good job irrigating my mouth.</li>
            <li> this is a good choice</li>
            <li> Good constuction.</li>
            <li> This portable flosser is a good tool.</li>
            <li> Good for travel, haven&#x27;t used it a lot....</li>
            <li> This arrived in 2 days and has been a good product.</li>
            <li> We would recommend it to those who need a good irrigator.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good luck.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for travel because it&#x27;s light weight when folded up.</li>
            <li> The size is good and collapses well for travel.  </li>
            <li> the Panasonic is the best of the Travel irrigators currently available.  </li>

            <li> It does a great job, and even the \\&quot;low\\&quot; option is very strong.  </li>
            <li> Very good oral irrigator, easy to use, good battery life and can be used for travel.</li>
            <li> It works great, easy to use and gives great pressure.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> It is great, but make sure you put in GOOD batteries (not the $1 store type) in order to get a good result.  </li>
            <li> it is compact and easy to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> works great, portable, easy to use, no cord!</li>

            <li> I have used this many times and it is a great unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Panasonic unit gets very respectable pressure from 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I have been using the device for about 3 weeks now and am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be very pleased with using it.  </li>
            <li> Use it every day and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This did a great job, but I wish it held more water.</li>
            <li> Great product  so much better than.</li>
            <li> Great Power, just love the two power modes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Panasonic irrigator.  </li>
            <li> but now I am very glad it is.</li>
            <li> And of course, my dentist is happy because I have healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My gums &amp; teeth will be &#x27;happy&#x27; after the usage of this fantastic product!</li>
            <li> and I am very glad someone makes something like this because my braces catch food all the time when out and about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the ease of handling and size.</li>
            <li> Happy with it. :)</li>

            <li> I find the Panasonic Oral Irrigator to be compact and powerful - excellent for traveling.</li>
            <li> My dentist is very pleased with the job this water pic does on my gums.</li>
            <li> But was very refreshing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great, but wanted to try this one and the results are much better in the power department, it uses two AA batteries in contrast with conair which uses 3 AA and the stream of water</li>
            <li> I love that is works great and Its compact.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>

            <li> Would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> Will update as I get more use!</li>
            <li> best evaluation I could give was to thoroughly brush and use mouthwash first, then irrigate with this device.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have learned that I need to move pretty swiftly around my mouth, but once I learned this trick I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> this will probably give me more pleasure in my trip ...than having my ex with me!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Moreover, the dentist always comments on how healthy my gums appear!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am in love!</li>
            <li> I have braces so being able to floss with this is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> WAY BETTER than not having one!  </li>
            <li> For best results, I would recommend flossing your teeth first.</li>
            <li> Glad that I purchased!</li>
            <li> My dentist will be pleased!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Much more convenient to use and store that a plug in with a tank and hose!</li>
            <li> Parents were also pleased because the 13-year-old does not resist using it!</li>
            <li> This is a truly outstanding product and a must for anyone who is striving for impeccable oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> My dentist was pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this battery-operated irrigator!  </li>
            <li> and I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I guarantee that your dentist will love your teeth if you use this product or one like it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Now, I have nothing to compare it to, but I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> My dentist is as pleased as I am!</li>
            <li> maybe it is better for your gums than flossing, but I tried flossing after using this and there was still some food in there!</li>
            <li> So glad I did!</li>
            <li> So convenient I love it!</li>
            <li> Sometimes the water splashes all over the place, I guess I just need to learn how to control it better!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE the ease of use, size, and aesthetically pleasing!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love the product!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product for travel - compact size but full-featured!  </li>
            <li> This is the best way to massage and clean the pockets around your teeth for healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic water pick is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great for travel.  </li>
            <li> Works great, holds a lot of water, and is easy to fill.  </li>
            <li> Works great and runs on batteries, so easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> It works great and its easy.  </li>
            <li> Great product easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to pack, Great water pressure.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my water pic, as it&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great.</li>
            <li> Great battery driven Waterpic and mush better than original rechargable WaterPik. Pressure is great and it folds up nice.</li>
            <li> Just an all around great product that has created a loyal fan!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic -- while not yielding quite as powerful a waterjet as the plug-in Waterpik -- does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> Practical and pleasant, very effective in removing all the food debris and keeping mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> Amazing water pressure.</li>
            <li> It is amazing when I get done brushing my teeth then use this and realize there was still food particles caught under my gum, but with no pain in cleaning it out.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The splash is amazing.</li>
            <li> like having it - it&#x27;s amazing how it gets out</li>
            <li> Works amazing for those wearing braces.</li>
            <li> While at home a countertop WaterPik-like device works great to solve this problem, the portable WaterPik-brand irrigators are simply huge.  </li>
            <li> GREAT ONE THING DON&#x27;T USE CHEAP 99 CENT  </li>
            <li> Nice price.</li>
            <li> It is a nice compromise between travel size and reservoir size.  </li>
            <li> Handy for travel.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Panasonic models are great, you will be satisfied with them for sure.</li>
            <li> I can put it in a tote bag if I want to take it with me, and it fits nicely inside the vanity cabinet.      </li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with it</li>
            <li> handy and portable......</li>
            <li> and I liked that the engineers designed the cap to snap on and off instead of breaking off.</li>
            <li> I mix my own concoction of warm water and mouth wash even though the instructions say to use just water.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my best friend - she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen many good reviews</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> and I liked it</li>
            <li> I liked the vanilla taste on her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am very much satisfied and Happy with it. :)</li>
            <li> I should have read the amazon reviews better and because of the good reviews the Panasonic got, I purchased one.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and effective alternative to flossing that&#x27;s easier on your gums.</li>
            <li> The product is handy.</li>
            <li> It effectively removes debris that one cannot get with floss and brushing, and is compact for travelling.</li>
            <li> A nice portable device...</li>
            <li> Nice not to have an additional cord on the counter.  </li>
            <li> This one has two speed/force settings, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> and it is really nice to have a unit that is compact for packing.</li>
            <li> This is a handy product.</li>
            <li> I liked this model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic water floss made it truly effective for my teeth.</li>
            <li> but it does take AA which are if you have your own set up hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> I had tried the portable water pik but never had liked it.  </li>
            <li> When collapsed, it is a nice size to carry in your bag.</li>
            <li> got the irrigator liked it and realize it too</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled when I found the Panasonic Oral Irrigator on-line.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use good alakaline batteries on this product.</li>
            <li> Wish it had some kind of holder for the detachable spout, though.  </li>
            <li> I had to mail it in at my own cost for the warranty service.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is perfect size and does not take up much room in hand carry.</li>
            <li> I just keep it handy where ever I drive and always have a water bottle handy as well.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if it was rechargeable but still works well as is.</li>
            <li> I found though that a 5-cent nickle does the job nicely without damage.</li>
            <li> I use it after brushing and flossing and it does get some more debris out on occasion even with good flossing.  </li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I get a \\&quot;water pik\\&quot; of some kind</li>
            <li> - Have a towel handy to wipe off everything within two feet of the sink.</li>
            <li> Did not give it 5 stars because it is not as effective as a non portable type.</li>
            <li> I researched these and found the panasonic to be recommended over the popular brand you see everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It is so handy</li>
            <li> I expect to get better battery life with the NMH batteries, to save a good bit of money by using them, and to avoid polluting the environment with used alkaline batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked it</li>
            <li> it was nice not having to have another appliance to plug in.</li>
            <li> The Oral Irrigator is comptact and handy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> Compact and effective.  </li>
            <li> A nice alternative to flossing.</li>
            <li> nice perk)..</li>
            <li> (TIP: HAVE TOWELS HANDY and HAIR IN TURBAN).  </li>
            <li> Good Luck :)</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s found his own technique to use it so that there isn&#x27;t water squirting everywhere.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact when it is folded up</li>
            <li> Compact and effective.</li>
            <li> It is nice product.</li>
            <li> It does the job nicely though.</li>
            <li> This is a nice handy effective tool.</li>
            <li> Two AA battery operated means it&#x27;s handy to take anywhere with you.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> but it is nice that it does not take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> I find the highest pressure to be a bit much, and the lowest pressure to be perfect!</li>
            <li> I purchased one and liked it.</li>
            <li> I truly liked it.</li>
            <li> Loving Amazon, hating this product...</li>
            <li> Irrigator I liked him.</li>
            <li> a nice massage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 speeds are nice.</li>
            <li> Yes, I too would have liked a jet stream</li>
            <li> 2 perfect set speeds and just simple and great to use.</li>
            <li> but so effective</li>
            <li> Nice portable unit.  </li>
            <li> include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it cleaned</li>
            <li> Comes in handy when traveling and camping.  </li>
            <li> good  that I expected,Panasonic always my favorite brand</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was compact and did the job.</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that it ran on batteries and didn&#x27;t need a charger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s collapsable for travel</li>
            <li> Folds up nice and compact for traveling.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels nice after I use it.</li>
            <li> Fill it up with warm water and wham.</li>
            <li> It must be popular, because the price jumped about $8 since I purchased it a week ago.</li>
            <li> but it is stiill effective.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact for travel.  </li>
            <li> I used one for many years and then stopped, I don&#x27;t know why because I loved it.  </li>
            <li> nice, works and cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> Handy for travel.</li>

            <li> It packs nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice that it uses batteries</li>
            <li> Love this product and good value.</li>
            <li> weight handy, and portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> own this water flosser.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as string based (polytetrafluoroethylene or nylon) flossing.</li>
            <li> Batteries were tested in a flashlight, still effective.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but it died three months after purchase.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and very easy to use, always handy with out taking up a lot of cainet space.</li>
            <li> Had the original Panasonic (EW1270AC) since 2005 and still running great (6 years, used every day).</li>
            <li> I need this kind of device when traveling - you simply can&#x27;t fly anywhere with a full Water-Pik unit in tow.  </li>
            <li> This is a great tool to keep teeth and gums squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li> As a dentist would probably tell you, it works best when you floss first but is better</li>
            <li> This is a great appliance for keeping your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> A great tool for keeping your teeth and mouth clean.</li>
            <li> This does a great job when you are wearing braces to thoroughly clean stuff in between braces and teeth.  </li>
            <li> I use 1/2 water 1/4 peroxide 1/4 mouth wash for a GREAT clean.</li>
            <li> My main one is a Water Pic--and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, this irrigator does a great job of getting stuck items out of your teeth and leaving your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for people with or without braces because it works awesome.</li>
            <li> A wonderful piece of devise, highly recommendede</li>
            <li> NICE PRESSURE, GOOD DESIGN, EASY TO FILL</li>
            <li> Got a great price on a &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34; special, but I would be happy to pay full price for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it has a handy size suitable for travel and that it is battery run.</li>
            <li> Use normal batteries and not rechargeable, and it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> The best thing that I like about this product is they use a normal AA battery so that you won&#x27;t run out of battery.</li>
            <li> It is a MUST to clean it Often!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product, it works well and is not hard on batteries.</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to use, clean, and store, and it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li> they travel a lot and the portability makes it easy for her to maintain good care of her braces</li>
            <li> The amount of water it holds is good, and it is easy to fill.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is lightening fast and customer service is awesome!  :)</li>
            <li> However, after going through batteries quickly, I switched to rechargeable batteries and they work great.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job and travels easily.</li>
            <li> THis one is easy to use and has good water pressure.  </li>
            <li> Of course, having a combination is also good, but the stuffs between the teeth are easily removed with this irrigator.</li>
            <li> She also wasn&#x27;t super happy to hear I was using a water pik type cleaner either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a good product, but water jet not as strong.</li>
            <li> Good quality, no service needed, batts last forever... and priced perfectly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, holds just enough water to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t think the pressure is as strong as the Water Pic, but it still does a good job &amp; so portable.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to use</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to refill</li>

            <li> Momentum is very strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This oral flosser is portable, very easy to use without even reviewing the operation manual.</li>
            <li> It is very strong, the battery that came with it is manufactured by Panasonic as well, it is disposable battery, and the manual recommends no rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is compact and is very easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and collapses for travel.  </li>
            <li> catches dirt very easily.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with denture implants because you can rinse underneath them very easily and throughly.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to hold and manipulate.  </li>
            <li> VERY EASY TO USE ...</li>
            <li> all my family love this gizmo, much better than the wire!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much you can get out of your teeth even after a good flossing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes me feel so clean, I now feel uneasy when I don&#x27;t get to use it :p</li>
            <li> Excellent for keeping your mouth fresh and clean while traveling.</li>
            <li> Great product my mouth has never felt so clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like water picking this is great - easy to use &amp; easy to take with you if you travel</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s attractive (for a water pick), easy to use and easy to fill/empty.</li>
            <li> Best of all my mouth feels really clean and wonderfully fresh.</li>
            <li> Works really well and size is very good for travel.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use (once you get used to the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34;)....and is easily stored!</li>
            <li> just before we went on vacation,, and it worked great (not as good as my home unit, but a whole lot better than none)   </li>
            <li> But we liked the portability of being able to take them on vacations.  </li>
            <li> and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> Great product but a bit too powerful for a person that has a lot</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> It is cute and handy.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it more than I and it is effective for her.</li>
            <li> I love size, fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was really good and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Much better than the kind with rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> Compact, light, ease of use, good reach to all corners.  </li>
            <li> This inexpensive contraption fixed up that issue perfectly.  </li>
            <li> More amazing, it can be collapsed for packing.</li>
            <li> Works very well though great for when you get food stuck in your teeth and a good substitute to brushing your teeth many times a day.</li>
            <li> I liked being able to travel with it....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that just turned out to be a great success.</li>
            <li> This thing is great and fun to use.</li>
            <li> I own a Waterpik plug-in flosser which I love.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has been about 9 months and it is running flawlessly.</li>
            <li> perfect for travel and everyday use; received in good condition!&lt;br /&gt;excellent device for oral care and good hygiene.</li>
            <li> This item is suitable for use to bring in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t want a counter top unit, so this was the next best thing that offered good performance and travel options.  </li>
            <li> is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic one operates and is just as effective as the Waterpik accept that the Panasonic is more portable.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would be effective and safe space.  </li>
            <li> BUT HONESTLY THOUGHT IT HAD MORE POWER TO THE PRESSURE PULSES</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, just turn to the first speed that has effective clearing.</li>
            <li> I loved it, It was very useful.</li>
            <li> very portable and impressed with how easy to use, compared to competitor&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> Great portable machine with right amount of spray pressure and size.</li>
            <li> It is compact and easy to use (just remember to put it in your mouth before turning it on!)</li>
            <li> With this product, it makes it so easy!</li>
            <li> This thing is strong!</li>
            <li> That thing is strong!</li>
            <li> It feels very good, just started to use, gum bleeding, after a few times, if you just eat immediately after the use of the effect is very good</li>
            <li> It is the  best water pick  by  far than  many others and  </li>
            <li> Tank size is adequate, love being able to use batteries which is great for travel as well as the size and shape.  </li>
            <li> Great product , I travel extensively and this product works great.</li>
            <li> a good job of helping her clean out her teeth.  </li>
            <li> &amp; he said I was doing a good job keeping that area clean.</li>
            <li> and they do a good job - and most importantly</li>
            <li> I am okay with this as filling it up is very easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to store, looks great on sink vanity, full power, better than my old electric, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> He likes this very much and is happy.  </li>
            <li> FAIRLY COMPACT WITH GREAT PRESSURE AND THE RESERVOIR IS JUST THE  RIGHT SIZE FOR A QUICK ON THE GO CLEANING.</li>
            <li> Nice clean feel after using the irrigator!</li>
            <li> At first this product is great.</li>
            <li> first water flosser iv&#x27;e owned &amp; it works great.</li>
            <li> The product worked great when I first bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water pressure is exactly what I needed to keep the pockets irrigated and I am 100% happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptics at first, but this thing is great.</li>
            <li> Works great exactly as described</li>
            <li> To be fair, I always use the electric unit at 10 -- full blast -- because my gums are used to that setting and don&#x27;t bleed.  </li>
            <li> Good size for traveling; good water pressure; good tank size - just enough water if I hurry.</li>
            <li> how well I liked this, it is strong, but not too strong!</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable when using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the item might be more compact to make it more suitable for travel.</li>
            <li> Stream of water is strong and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cordless, compact, easy to use and as effective as the ones with cord.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and a nice finish after brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll strongly recommend this to anyone who have yet to own one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice, easy to use irrigator.</li>
            <li> I got it for travel and find it effective and easy to transport.  </li>
            <li> Nice travel size and easy to use.</li>
            <li> it is easy to fill &amp; telescopes into its own reservoir for compact carry.</li>
            <li> The oral irrigator has very good water pressure and less bulky than others I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s compact and great for travel.</li>
            <li> 2 is good, but one more a bit higher would be nice</li>
            <li> I take much better care of my teeth and gums because this Panasonic product is so handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price, super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> That said, if you just want a gentle rinse, this is a good product and certainly better than not having one when traveling!</li>
            <li> Great size, sufficiently large reservoir, and plenty of power.  </li>
            <li> I took this new flosser on a trip and loved it!  </li>
            <li> I have braces &amp; can&#x27;t live without a good water flosser!</li>
            <li> I have three new dental implants and my dentist told me this is the best thing to do for them to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels a lot better and my hygienist likes the results.</li>
            <li> ......Already like this much better.  </li>
            <li> I take it when I travel as it is better than nothing, but for at home, use an electric one.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a great job and not take much space.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> If you are prepared for these limitations, the Oral Irrigator is much better than having nothing and will do its intended job.</li>
            <li> Their dentist recommended I purchase one because their gums weren&#x27;t as healthy as they could have been.  </li>
            <li> He is still using it once or twice a week, which I figure is better than not at all.  </li>
            <li> + year oral irrigators (mostly corded waterpiks).   </li>
            <li> I have been quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> For ease of use, I like it even better than the full-size</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conversely, this Panasonic is much better designed and is perfect for portable use - and it uses regular batteries</li>
            <li> /&gt;After many years they break.&lt;br /&gt;New</li>
            <li> satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see particles of food removed by using the product, even after flossing and brushing.  </li>
            <li> I really love this Panasonic oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li> Considering the hand held capability there really isn&#x27;t much better</li>
            <li> Much better than the leading brand or any of the others.  </li>
            <li> A push-button would have been a much better control.  </li>
            <li> I have taken three (3) business trips of 5 days or more and could not be happier with the functionality and reliability of the product.  </li>
            <li> This is awesome, I just bought my second unit.</li>
            <li> I love having this as a back-up.  </li>
            <li> I heard that this was better than flossing</li>
            <li> I have been using an oral irrigator type product for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I purchased the Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.  </li>
            <li> , I can spit with more force that WaterPik portable.  </li>
            <li> If it lasts, it will be one of my better purchases.</li>
            <li> Stream is actually more forceful than the waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Works better than a waterpik. Portable.</li>
            <li> I find this is a better choice.</li>
            <li> the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A has preformed very well and I am completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Pressure is perfect and dont worry about the batteries I have been using it for 2 weeks, once a day, and still using the same ones.</li>
            <li> I fly every week for business and this takes up too much room in my luggage.</li>
            <li> We use them every day and it works so much better than even flossing......</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my mouth with better taste because of it.</li>
            <li> This product is better than Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is okay after week and + usage.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> If the mouth piece was on a 12 to 18 inch tube it would be much better.</li>
            <li> I travel and love the way it slids together for packing.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone looking for a more convenient sized version.</li>
            <li> For a $25 truly portable oral irrigator, I don&#x27;t think you can ask for much more.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Most of my teeth are 4 - 7 mm.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I made the decision to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Planning to buy more.</li>
            <li> so glad that  I purchased  the Oral Irrigator  by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> .I am so glad I checked out Amazon,</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> It is very portable and great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this teeth cleaning device.</li>
            <li> I love that it is portable.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied and would buy again.</li>
            <li> With practice I&#x27;ve gotten better at handling the power switch, though I still accidentally spray a stray stream of water around the bathroom once in a while.</li>
            <li> My gums feel much better.</li>
            <li> Saw this and decided to try it because it is much more compact and easier to handle when traveling.</li>
            <li> This is quite an ingenious design.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the waterpick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this is an item what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design.</li>
            <li> Tends to make it more drippy.  </li>
            <li> I decided I needed more voltage.</li>
            <li> After just two weeks gums are healthier just &amp;#34;feel&#x27;&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this, and I have thanked him many times.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my father, and he love it.    </li>
            <li> Does the job but not put together any better than you can expect based on price</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> but like that I&#x27;ll be able to.</li>
            <li> I also have a waterpick and this unit is so much more practical.</li>
            <li> Love the design.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik had a cumbersome shape and there were many issues with the rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazons great customer service</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I could safely say ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to wait until tomorrow to call the number and spend even more time on this.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it is portable and uses batteries.</li>
            <li> Beats Water pik many times over.</li>
            <li> It is even better than what I have.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this unit for when I am on the road.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> this is ok for me because I take my shower at night and then put on my robe and then brush my teeth / floss.  </li>
            <li> But now after a couple of weeks of using it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all any more.  </li>
            <li> Namely, it holds a respectable amount of water, shoots said water into one&#x27;s mouth, and in the process dislodges food particles.  </li>
            <li> So what more could one want in an oral irrigator?  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, the produce is better than nothing, but needs improvement.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now sure that my 8-year-old son wouldn&#x27;t love holding it in his hand.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I guess I should read product descriptions more closely.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure of these portable models but after reading many reviews, this model stood out to me the most.</li>
            <li> The AA battery operated Panasonic Oral Irrigator works better than the rechargeable Waterpik that I used to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light-weight, very portable, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Have not used a waterpik type device in decades but decided to do a better job with the teeth and this thing seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much more</li>
            <li> The water pik before that lasted more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this may lessen the life of the product, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues yet.  </li>
            <li> But regardless love it.</li>
            <li> Panasonic was rated better than the WaterPik one.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and it is a lot more portable.</li>
            <li> Just want to say I love the Panasonic Oral Irrigator.</li>
            <li> This brand uses AA batteries so if I do have a battery problem I am able to replace them.  </li>
            <li> However, there is nothing to keep the top up, so when you&#x27;re trying to use it</li>
            <li> This is a much better way to go.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t floss, this is better than nothing, but otherwise, save your money and look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the speed of delivery.   </li>
            <li> This Panasonic unit works as well as those and is more portable.</li>
            <li> Might be ok to travel  with</li>
            <li> I recently bought one for myself since I was so impressed.</li>
            <li> It looks more &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I really love this cleaning machine.</li>
            <li> The tip should be replaced after one year to continue get the most efficient water flow.  </li>
            <li> Able to floss and brush out anything stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much better product.</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve used waterpix portables.  </li>
            <li> Love the self-storage for the tip, and the included travel case.  </li>
            <li> absolutely love</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strength of the jet is satisfying.</li>
            <li> more than recharging...</li>
            <li> top version that I have .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the battery life.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ideal for the frequent traveler.</li>
            <li> I think the latch for the water is not as secure as I would have liked</li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> Not being able to adjust the stream type is a flaw here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m love my Sonicare, but we camp a lot</li>
            <li> I have used it in my travels and really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on battery life yet, but will update when appropriate.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the price was great!  </li>
            <li> Much better than another brand I had</li>
            <li> I love it way better than the others.</li>
            <li> Love this water pick.  </li>
            <li> Love how portable this is.  </li>
            <li> but ok once you get use to it...</li>
            <li> I read reviews and love Panasonic product</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> This one is nicer and better.  </li>
            <li> Love this ....</li>
            <li> It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure what I was getting with this product</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a winner, even better than the one I have at home which needs to be recharged by electricity.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am sooo pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> would love to recommend all of you</li>
            <li> My teeth make you healthy items.</li>
            <li> I love that it operates on batteries too.</li>
            <li> Wish it is a better product.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> really satisfying products.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Now I keep it for travel only as it&#x27;s the best for that.</li>
            <li> Much better than the rechargeable unit sold in Wallmart which is now gathering dust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming from a waterpick counter top model 110v.  </li>
            <li> It has two speeds just in case you have sensitivity or need more power.</li>
            <li> I had tried so many kinds / brands of electric brushes before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing off the wand part with soap periodically, and leaving it out on the counter more, and that takes care of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about battery life, but has two kinds of batteries, so might be more costly to replace.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> so I was ghlad to be able to take this thing on the road with me.</li>
            <li> I love this oral waterpik.</li>
            <li> I hope it power more.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Waterpik travel</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I purchased an extra one to pack for my son when he&#x27;s starts college this year, should be perfect for when he has to share a bathroom.</li>
            <li> The battery function is much more durable and practical the the ac units.  </li>
            <li> This is OK for lightweight packing but it doesn&#x27;t come close to my Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I always bring spares if I&#x27;ll be away for a week or more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this great product</li>
            <li> it would be better, if it was rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is even better than waterpik in my opinion as it is portable</li>
            <li> Could use more storage.</li>
            <li> This is just okay...</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a more well known waterpik option.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow instructions for when not in use.</li>
            <li> I have to fill it twice, but that is OK.</li>
            <li> The slot in the top of the battery compartment is shaped to take the edge of a quarter coin for opening and closing (not noted in the instructions).  </li>
            <li> so you would have to order more if more than one person is going to use it</li>
            <li> wish it had more settings</li>
            <li> Cleans mouth better than flossing and brushing alone.  </li>
            <li> It did a great job, but it was a real pain to use and an eye sore to boot.</li>
            <li> I leave the cap open and don&#x27;t compact it so the water doesn&#x27;t stagnate, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to sanitize it so it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual or mold or what have you.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say buy it if you need to use it in lieu of flossing, but flossing is probably still best.</li>
            <li> Works even better than my plug-in water-flosser.  </li>
            <li> I will put more updates if people find this helpful.</li>
            <li> Think this is easier than flossing and cleans better.</li>
            <li> and I love it for so many reasons.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a better system.  </li>
            <li> The reviews for this Panasonic unit were better than others for sale, and I ordered it for that reason.</li>
            <li> Nozzle dosen&#x27;t work for more than 1 week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I do brush them well every day, which I&#x27;m sure also helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Way better than WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> but I wished there was more water pressure.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it and we will wait for</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this one as it really is portable - which is great for someone like me who travels a lot for work.</li>
            <li> It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design.</li>
            <li> I mix mouthwash in with the water and it is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> I would suggest making sure</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> interesting device,</li>
            <li> mostly seeds from toast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking to try the -A model and see if it is any better.  </li>
            <li> , I just think it takes all kinds of practice - - then maybe it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> and I accidentally sprayed myself in the face, and have sprayed my bathroom mirror more than once.</li>
            <li> I love to use mouthwash with it</li>
            <li> so I have to do more than floss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using same model for years and my dentist says it does a excellent job</li>
            <li> I investigated the reviews, and this product received better reviews.  </li>
            <li> With two water pressure settings I have never needed anything more.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> its okay, still works,</li>
            <li> Wish I could say I love it.</li>
            <li> I do love the idea</li>
            <li> Better than the water pik portable.</li>
            <li> I love my Panasonic water pick, and when I travel, it always is packed and usEd</li>
            <li> I am  :-)</li>
            <li> Many people seemed to like this waterpik over others.</li>
            <li> Feels better than the Philips Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really love this.  </li>
            <li> able to get rid of the plague in between my teeth</li>
            <li> Glad to see than dentists are recommending the use of these again.  </li>
            <li> At that time I need to charge it more and more often until I gave up on it and purchased the Panasonic Ew-DJ10-A.  Since the batteries are replaceable</li>
            <li> People who are complaining about the unit growing mold must not know that the reservoir pulls off of the top part.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the rechargeable one I had.  </li>
            <li> I just love this thing.</li>
            <li> Love, going to buy another for the downstairs bathroom.</li>
            <li> I feel like there could be an additional level added onto it with a bit more power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Completely satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure why I purchased this.</li>
            <li> but I can say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am definitely pleased with this and would purchase another</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is an okay irrigator.</li>
            <li> would love a travel size irrigator, however, I don&#x27;t like the hassle of buying/changing batteries.</li>
            <li> It is also more portable as it is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda satisfy :-)</li>
            <li> You can brush your teeth, floss, rinse and then use this tool to remove quite a bit more food stuffs.</li>
            <li> Not quite as forceful as a sink top model.</li>
            <li> I think it cleans better than my water pik i have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the need to use throwaway batteries, I&#x27;m satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> Love that it folds up</li>
            <li> I think push on off button is better to use it.</li>
            <li> This model seems much better built, becomes compact for traveling (even protecting the tip) and runs on rechargeable or alkaline batteries, which can be purchased anywhere.</li>
            <li> Much better design than competitor.  </li>
            <li> Wish the reservoir held a bit more water</li>
            <li> and I think my dentist will be pleased.</li>
            <li> , I have been satisfied using just water and swishing with mouthwash</li>
            <li> But I was able to use the highest pressure immediately (maybe because I floss and use an electric brush.)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Much better than any others on the market.</li>
            <li> You do have to make sure the Panasonic nozzle is in your mouth before you turn it on because it does not have a control switch like the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> Lighter and more portable because there is no power cord to carry around for re-charging.</li>
            <li> many years ago.</li>
            <li> For lots of people it&#x27;s ok, however I do need a tougher one</li>
            <li> I was not that pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> and I love the size.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than flossing.</li>
            <li> Top section stores in the water tank, along with the jet&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> so I was really glad to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and have recommended it to many of my family and friends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and when it gives out I purchase another.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At 60, more pockets in the teeth I guess, but even after flossing, rinsing and brushing, specks of food still get washed out.</li>
            <li> I hope to never havve anything more than x-rays from a dentist ever again because of the care I now give my teeth.</li>
            <li> i make it every day,i believe my tooth well better</li>
            <li> Going to look for a better brand</li>
            <li> it is cheap and effective device that I use often.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Water filling hole should have been at the top of bottom tank so that, even if the lid damaged, you can still use the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And when I had to travel I realized I have to get something more portable.</li>
            <li> It becomes very compact when collapsed, so it is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> The speed of irrigation of water could have been more aggresive, but ok for beginners.</li>
            <li> (the water-floss tools are so much better), so I was looking into a portable-type water flosser.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser is top notch as a plug-in model-- but too bulky for travel.  </li>
            <li> and it is OK to use.</li>
            <li> It gets water all over when my husband uses it in the sink, but if it is used in the shower it is OK.</li>
            <li> Worked okay for about a year, then just stopped.</li>
            <li> i love it...</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> He was raving about it, I checked the price which was okay and decided to order one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It,s,okay .I am glad I purchased it , I have to fill  it twice before I am finished</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning, powerful for size.</li>
            <li> While these irrigators do not last forever, I am very happy with the results and was pleased to find one to replace mine.</li>
            <li> My gums never bleed any more.</li>
            <li> , the mirror has been sprayed more than once.</li>
            <li> Use and is not used any more once</li>
            <li> This is a great product!We use the whole family.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> suppose it&#x27;s better than nothing, and it *is*</li>
            <li> I tried once and it more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> and I love how well it cleans my teeth and mouth</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it without batteries and the top seemed to be glued on.</li>
            <li> Nothing: screwdriver, paring knife, butter knife, banging it--nothing could budge that top.</li>
            <li> Not the best I would buy a different model.</li>
            <li> It is better than nothing, but I will try to find something else.  </li>
            <li> Much better than using the floss, and also more efficient.</li>
            <li> The unit died on me for reasons that affect many others if you read the reviews.  </li>
            <li> To many return trips and no longevity.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, some are just better.</li>
            <li> I traveled most of this summer including overseas.</li>
            <li> After using this product  for couple of months visited my dentist&#x27;s office and hygienist was impressed with overall improvement!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pressure seems comparable to the Waterpik \\&quot;portable\\&quot; which is much more bulky and had a plug in adapter.</li>
            <li> the Panasonic has stronger jets, looks better and it&#x27;s easier to carry around.</li>
            <li> What I particularly love about this unit is that it comes apart.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I am between love and like.  </li>
            <li> Things I love about this product, because&lt;br /&gt;it is collapsible</li>
            <li> I love that it collapses into itself &amp; self stores the tip.  </li>
            <li> I took it on the road and was able to use the batteries about 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> , I ended up buying another two for my granddaughters as they love using it.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you are able to identify your nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that I will be able to take it with me on trips.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought a waterpik which does a more thorough job with more water power.  </li>
            <li> so maybe others will see better results?</li>
            <li> I would click &#x27;5 stars&#x27; except that I think it needs to hold more water; maybe another ounce?</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The force of the water is much greater than our plug-in water pik.</li>
            <li> It is the best I have ever had for a portable device, but nothing beats the larger version.</li>
            <li> My gums have not bled or even been sore from Day One of using it, and the pressure doesn&#x27;t seem to be any greater than just a vigorous swish and rinse.  </li>
            <li> Away from home though, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a much better one than this Panasonic unit.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is light, handy.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it could be.  </li>
            <li> but it sure does the job.</li>
            <li> but my wife and I used this device on our many road trips.  </li>
            <li> I guess they will get stronger over time :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Yes, I did that! :))</li>
            <li> Sometimes simpler is really better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the collapsible and portable design.</li>
            <li> This is good.. and it is easy to clean, etc..</li>
            <li> To get more, you have to order them..</li>
            <li> It puts out a stream of water with force rivaling the top of the line non-portable Waterpik</li>
            <li> I like it better than the Water Pik portable</li>
            <li> much better than oral-B...great for travelling</li>
            <li> and you can put a bit more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Love to be able to travel with my water flosser.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> love its portability and size.  </li>
            <li> Of course it could have had more power, all guys want more  power.</li>
            <li> All in all, I prefer this one much more.</li>
            <li> I used my WaterPik as a confident replacement for flossing when I didn&#x27;t have time for both.  </li>
            <li> but there have been many times that it would start collapsing while I was using it.  </li>
            <li> I have one and love using it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to drain all the water out at the end of your teeth cleaning so it doesn&#x27;t drip in your luggage.</li>
            <li> and I think you would be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> They seem to always improve on the model, and my mouth and teeth love the experience.</li>
            <li> The power button is conveniently located at the side, and I am able to use it without looking.</li>
            <li> and the tip should be longer but is designed  to fit in the flosser when not in use which does compact nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I chucked the thing, and I&#x27;m going to have to find a more &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; water flosser.</li>
            <li> not a terrible product or anything but just not for me.</li>
            <li> Would like more settings.</li>
            <li> It does uses a lot of batteries, but I like it better than the electric noisy units.</li>
            <li> I guess it would be better than nothing for travel</li>
            <li> OK by me.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I didnt have to buy more batteries</li>
            <li> It gets out more debris than flossing.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> personally, i love the color :).</li>
            <li> I have dental implants and water flossing is a must to keep them healthy.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I made the purchase as I love the fact that it is battery operated.</li>
            <li> I love that it can use AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially enjoy that it is cordless!</li>
            <li> , Panasonic is an reliable brand, hope this one is better.</li>
            <li> I had a water pic for years,but this is simply the best.</li>
            <li> Compared it to Water-pic: holds more water, sturdier.</li>
            <li> Pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product but water gets sprayed everywhere</li>
            <li> and since I love my oral irrigator I have at home, I knew I would miss it.  </li>
            <li> But I still love it.</li>
            <li> This Oral Irrigator was recommended to me by my oral hygenist, and I guess I need to read the descriptions better</li>
            <li> (okay the 6 more words required.)</li>
            <li> No yucky spatter all over the bathroom mirror and sink :)</li>
            <li> Works as well as a sink top model.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will admit i don&#x27;t love to floss</li>
            <li> l love this flosser.  </li>
            <li> This unit is better than my waterpik</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m used to more rounded ends.</li>
            <li> Love the portability and the price.</li>
            <li> It is more compact, better looking, it performs better than Waterpik&#x27;s product, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with the wires, the plug and the ineffective rechargeable unit.  </li>
            <li> Returned it and purchased the Toilettree one, much better.</li>
            <li> I was worried than when I travel I won&#x27;t be able to use my water-pik.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now and am very happy that after extensive research I picked this one to buy.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I just returned from a trip and enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> Vigorous flossing does more damage.</li>
            <li> Hoping it stays this way because I really am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Blow water pick  away easily, better design and build with quality material.</li>
            <li> Never again; I&#x27;ll pay a bit more and buy at Target.</li>
            <li> If it helps keep my gums and teeth healthy</li>
            <li> No cords is even better.</li>
            <li> A charged set of batteries lasts more than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when theyre healthy again they will not bleed when squirted so</li>
            <li> I love this panasonic</li>
            <li> This functions better than the portable name-brand that has just died because it would not hold a charge anymore -- nor would it work plugged in.</li>
            <li> and it helps to keep my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> Better than the ones which are electric.  </li>
            <li> So much more convenient to use with batteries.  </li>
            <li> I always love the  way it makes my teeth and mouth feel.</li>
            <li> This is a great Product and very Portable as well.</li>
            <li> So, a combination of both is better for oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GOING TO GIVE IT SOME MORE TIME</li>
            <li> OK ....</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> You would think Panasonic could do better on the quality part.</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN THE ORAL B ONE I HAD</li>
            <li> The plug in ones are definitely better to the point of pain on a 10.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and am very happy.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to set up, and the irrigator tip is easy to insert.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik I already have, and I must say that the two speeds are &#x27;very strong&#x27; and &#x27;blast the gunk off stuff strong&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Very useful and handy in cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> Very good, have more quality, it is suitable to go out with the usualVery good, have more quality, it is suitable to go out with the usual</li>
            <li> A very nice and very portable unit.  </li>
            <li> works ok could be more powerful, easy to use, nice size for travel, the way it folds up is a nice size</li>
            <li> So, great super product that dies really quickly - you decide if that is what you want to buy?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for two days, twice a day every day, but I love everything about it!!!  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful and works well!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad - just fill it once more!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad - just fill it once more!</li>
            <li> An oral irrigator is a great aid to periodontal health, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this one in the short time I&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
            <li> It works great as long as you keep good batteries in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great option for anyone in the market, but particularly for those who travel or want to use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Tip allows you to get between teeth and clean close to gums&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap and cost effective</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> Toilet Tree is still the best cordless  flosser, but doesn&#x27;t collapse for travel.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s kinda yucky, it feels good seeing food particles trapped in between teeth and gums getting flushed out so easily with this wonderful irrigator.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, great power, and convenience.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, batteries last enough, good quality materials and good water pressure modes.</li>
            <li> At the end of the week, I take the used NiZn/NiMH battery pair home and recharge them (each in their own chargers, I have to use the special charger that came with the NiZN for the NiZN battery).    </li>
            <li> Easy to use, very portable - great for trips</li>
            <li> If you like it strong as in number 10 on your plug in water pik, then this is more like number 4 at the most.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;design-wise, this irrigator was truly portable, where the nozzle came off easily and fit nicely inside the casing when not in use.</li>
            <li> The stream is not as strong as I like it to be for daily use, but for a battery-powered travel irrigator, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel very clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It does the job and makes your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I have dental implants and it keeps the space between the teeth and gums very clean.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have a very clean mouth when I&#x27;ve finished using it.  </li>
            <li> It very light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Being powered by normal batteries is a great plus for travelling (no need to bring chargers)</li>
            <li> This is the best water pick type product I have come accross in a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s design is pretty good.</li>
            <li> If your willing to put up with filling twice and replacing (2) AA&#x27;s after about forty uses then this will be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This might be a good thing if you&#x27;re concerned about damage from the higher pressure Waterpick.</li>
            <li> but considering the price, two years was a pretty good</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, does the job.</li>
            <li> The replacement was not expensive and proved to be a good means to keep on with use of the product without having to buy new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I used to own the &#x27;waterpik&#x27; model which I also liked but this one is comparable but more compact and the design more clever for travels.</li>
            <li> Easy, Easy, Easy!</li>
            <li> Did an excellent job most of the time with one filling, but occasionally needed two fillings after a rich grainy dinner.</li>
            <li> I am sure over time I will become faster and more accurate.</li>
            <li> That plug part could be designed better, it comes out of it&#x27;s hinges too easily</li>
            <li> I can do a very quick rinse with one filling, but for morning and before bed I go ahead and refill it a couple more times which takes a couple of seconds and is not a problem for me.    </li>
            <li> Top notch and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I wish one could control the speed rate of irrigation flow more easily than&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth better than flossing, collapses for easy storage and traveling.  </li>
            <li> Being able to easily pack</li>
            <li> I love that this is so easy to get out and use, and that it is water proof.  </li>
            <li> Another reason I love it is because it is so easily portable.  </li>
            <li> Most of all it was easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, dries well (better than reviews suggest),</li>
            <li> And I love the fact that I can take it on trips easily.</li>
            <li> easy to use - no electrical cord like on most</li>
            <li> most users mentioned it must be filled with the water more than twice while flossing.</li>
            <li> So, this is perfect for me, as it works very well and does not require much space.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use our counter-top Waterpik these days because the Panasonic Oral Irrigator is simply more convenient and just as effective in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will get more comfortable as I use it</li>
            <li> This unit is battery powered and produces a very strong pulse to clean between the teeth quite well.  </li>
            <li> Great time-saver--don&#x27;t have to floss nearly as often!</li>
            <li> Works great so far!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best; Battery-driven, Stays strong  a long time, the Exchange nozzle doesn&#x27;t fall out during use.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic oral irrigator was exactly what I was looking for: something that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, is easy to use, and does a good job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This one works just as good as the higher priced ones and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Both are using this often, and glad it works fine.</li>
            <li> (I do have cleaner mirrors now having to clean them after use of the flosser!)</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of Waterpiks over the years and the latest one I got is fine at home.  </li>
            <li> And no need to worry about food on my braces because it will clean them all!</li>
            <li> Good for travel when you can&#x27;t or do not wish to carry the large Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I own two but the first one still hasnt worn out yet!  </li>
            <li> we love being able to clean our teeth inside the shower.</li>
            <li> I leave it there for 24 hours and then am able to clean it and make sure any accumulated crud comes out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to refill, but my favorite aspect is using rechargeable AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I have used three times, this portable water flossing is very convenient, very clean , the most important is that it allows me to develop good habits.</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower is another HUGE plus.</li>
            <li> My old unit was great until the on-off switch stopped working.</li>
            <li> But most importantly, it clears out food particles that brushing and flossing miss.</li>
            <li> Oral health is important and the easier the equipment, the better.</li>
            <li> the water tank is perfect for that one use (and you&#x27;re supposed to empty it after every</li>
            <li> If anyone finds a better model, I would enjoy hearing about it</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy the dentists chair, by all means get one for everyone in your family and coerce, bribe, and threaten them to use it as this thing cleans better then any toothbrush could ever do.</li>
            <li> and cheap product from panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could have included more nozzles though.</li>
            <li> Just got adult braces and travel often, so this was a great find.</li>
            <li> Great product, bought 5 so far for myself and family members!&lt;br /&gt;Hmmmm...</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s a great buy for my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic Irrigator for a month and so far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It would then be better to opt for the lower setting so as to get comfortable with the irrigator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has plenty of force and a thoughtful, elegant design.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice addition to the oral hygiene arsenal, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the perfect one.</li>
            <li> It is light enough for travel, I also take it to work,  and the water pressure is good - feels as good as when I use my electric water-pik.</li>
            <li> This does exactly the job it needs to and I am very glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> For what it is it works welll but can&#x27;t help but feel that a more powerful model with a greater water capacity would be better.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> SO FAR GREAT.......</li>
            <li> using panasonic now for a month, know why i loved it so much before.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic has just as good jet power, and is very convenient to use, being that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> Works very well on batteries and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> I keep another pair of NiZn/NiMH batteries ready to go, so I&#x27;m never without good power.</li>
            <li> It worked very well, had good pressure, and held a sufficient amount of water.</li>
            <li> good quality, reasonable price...</li>
            <li> Thank you for good item and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact but way too powerful, even on the lower setting.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of forceful when the batteries are fresh but there is a lower speed you can use then.  </li>
            <li> is powerful and nice to handle</li>
            <li> Loved it so much, that had to get it as a gift for others and everyone loves it.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much I&#x27;d bring it with me during training and workshops</li>
            <li> Nice unit and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It really does a good job.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic Oral Irrigator was a good buy for me, as it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room on the vanity as the tank variety with a hose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very useful, if the power of the water is stronger, it will be better.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s light and easy to travel and store.</li>
            <li> It does an adequate cleaning job (which is the most important point!).</li>
            <li> Very compact, easy to use and does a good job</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that it&#x27;s so easy to have sitting on the counter ready to use.  </li>
            <li> This is my husbands go to for traveling with braces.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well, easy to use, and does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fits in hand nicely, switch is in just the right spot.</li>
            <li> I bought a Waterpik in order to clean under it and it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this although I can&#x27;t compare it to the original Waterpik since I haven&#x27;t used that appliance in so many years.</li>
            <li> But I agree with other reviewers that this is the best out there.</li>
            <li> Mouth odor and gives a significant contribution to the gums healthy.</li>
            <li> but true!)</li>
            <li> The freedom of not having a water line, tank, and AC cord make this model more user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I bought the original irrigator  many years ago, and it still works.  </li>
            <li> Cool!</li>
            <li> However, after the first use of this product, I started to LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Had the original model for many years</li>
            <li> I have tried other oral irrigators, but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> This does a very good job, actually better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> My hygienist was very impressed because after years of having pocket measurements that were borderline high, I now have no inflammation around the gum line and all measurements are normal.  </li>
            <li> The lack of a cord makes it easily portable,  and safer in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> it says and is easy to use no cumbersome charger.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to pack as well.</li>
            <li> It uses almost no counter space and is easily portable.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it uses batteries instead of a cord which makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> after that it will come off easy when there are batteries inside.  </li>
            <li> Easy to store when not in use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to pack up and take on the road when I travel.</li>
            <li> (We all know how easy it is to exceed 50 pounds between shoes, clothes, toiletries, etc).  </li>
            <li> Keep an eye on the nozzle, they eventually get plugged and the unit will not function well and will go through batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s battery-operated and easy to transport.&lt;br /&gt;-lynn</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, easy to use, and priced well.    </li>
            <li> This is easy to use.</li>
            <li> For a battery operated it has the power to irrigate btween the teeth and your mouth feels clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Easy to pack when traveling.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has ample power to get rid of food particles that cannot be removed with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and it also collapses for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I will  cause it is so easy .I</li>
            <li> The shape is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and portable.</li>
            <li> With the collapsing water reservoir, this unit stored easily in my toiletry pouch.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill water too.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power to clean your teeth and most of the time I get done with one fill up.</li>
            <li> It is easy to take on trips.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> easy to put together</li>
            <li> I use an oral irrigator that attaches to the faucet when at home, The faucet attached irrigator is not something I can easily use in a hotel room or on a camping trip.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but no cover for the head</li>
            <li> Easy to fill.</li>
            <li> For optimum performance, batteries probably should be changed more frequently, perhaps weekly.</li>

            <li> This irrigator is compact, easy to use, and not another bulky machine you try to squeeze on the edge of your bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li> Works great; just wish the water reservoir was larger so it could hold more water...</li>
            <li> Easily portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have used this on trips for easy packing and convenience.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and fits easily into your carry on.  </li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as I hoped.</li>

            <li> Easy to easy, compact and convenient for travel or every day use.</li>
            <li> but it has proved to be just as strong.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The water jet is quite strong, I would say as strong as my home water pick.  </li>
            <li> Although the pressure of the water is not as strong as Waterpik, it is portable and wireless.</li>
            <li> I am used to the WaterPik&#x27;s strong pressure.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> The spray is strong and when you are done I have to run the rest of the water in the shower or you will have water everywhere.</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as the plug in but gets job done</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest you do not purchase this device.  </li>
            <li> The pulsating was not as strong as I had had with my WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Flossing was never my strong point</li>
            <li> I like this but the stream that comes out shoots way to strongly.  </li>
            <li> Water pressure is not that strong as those countertop models but that should be understood because it just uses 2 AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong on lithium batteries.</li>
            <li> Two settings for water jet are not too strong.</li>
            <li> Strong product that I keep in the shower.</li>
            <li> strong flow...works well</li>
            <li> The batteries that came with it are still going strong and I have used it at leat twice a day on a twelve day trip</li>
            <li> I changed the batteries out in about 2-3 weeks to keep the power strong.</li>
            <li> Regular batteries, good  power and closes up nicely to a travel size.  .</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this waterpik.</li>
            <li> Well it wasn&#x27;t in my mouth all the way or a good angle, and my left ear got a nice irrigation.  </li>
            <li> It provides strong bursts of water into hard-to-reach spots, &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any problems with gum irritation.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is not so strong as that of the waterpik.</li>
            <li> Strong jet&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power is not as strong as the one I used to have</li>
            <li> using it, I stand over the sink, but the water splashback is so strong it hits my mirror, goes running everywhere...</li>
            <li> Not as strong a power washer as home, plug in wall, tank unit, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> scared it&#x27;d be too strong for my gums.</li>
            <li> I think two is a lil strong for my liking...</li>
            <li> Seems decently sealed - a good thing since the used mouth rinse runs all over it.</li>
            <li> I have done damage to myself with water piks that plug in because the water pressure can be so strong.</li>
            <li> If alkaline batteries are too strong for you, start out with rechargeable batteries until your gums get healthier.</li>
            <li> This is not as strong as a plug in irrigator</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic every night for about 2 weeks now on the 1st set of AA batteries .... still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Not a substitute for floss and not as strong a flow as the waterpik</li>
            <li> They need some strong competition in this niche market.</li>
            <li> The size of the water tank and the pressure of the pulses are perfect for cleaning with a single fill in my experience and it&#x27;s easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> and I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> he recommended I floss more and he ordered some special mouth wash.</li>
            <li> One full tank is perfect for single use.</li>
            <li> compact/fast and outlasts any other product in it&#x27;s catagory, Try It You&#x27;ll Love It!!!</li>
            <li> Works fine and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I opened my mouth and gave the bathroom mirror a nice wash.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s collapsible and pretty handy.</li>
            <li> Not bad for its price, but needs more capacity of water for 1 time usage, I think.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> If you lean forward over the sink and cup your hand over the top of  your mouth you can use it easily and quickly if you don&#x27;t have the time or desire to use it while showering.</li>
            <li> It is easy to store, easy to use, and a comfortable size.  </li>
            <li> This waterpik is perfect for people who have braces it helps keeping your hardware a little bit more clean.</li>
            <li> you must or preferably use during shower, tend to splash a lot due to its power, for traveling it&#x27;s the best thing you can own, really helpful.</li>
            <li> this company (Good As New Electronics) refused because they claim the box is opened.  </li>
            <li> this review will help anyone intend to order this product at Good As New Electronics.</li>
            <li> This works just fine.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a while now, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Waterpik WP100 for years and it has been fine, but it doesn&#x27;t travel well.  </li>
            <li> Product delivers as advertised, and is easy to hold comfortably.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be replacing my electric model, but this will work out fine for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 weeks now and batteries are still working fine.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s cheap considering its nice function.</li>
            <li> Despite all of my high-voltage experiments with this irrigator, it has held up and continues to run fine.    </li>
            <li> use rechargeable battery, even though the doc says not too, and that still works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used it for about 6 weeks and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to, but once I did, which took about one or two uses,, it was fine.  </li>
            <li> It is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for since my gums have started bleeding more and more.</li>
            <li> I like this one because it does have 2 settings which are just fine for me..</li>
            <li> I tested it and it worked fine with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about a month and then went belly up.  </li>
            <li> As a portable travel device, it is fine.</li>
            <li> works fine, wish a bit cheaper</li>
            <li> and it is working just fine.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but the door to the tank keeps coming off  </li>
            <li> First oral irrigator I have used (so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others), but the product seems great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, light, and easily packable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a fine irrigator.</li>
            <li> and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I think this might deter me but in the shower it is fine</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Deal of the Day for about $26, and for the most part, have been pretty satisfied with the performance of Panasonic&#x27;s version of the WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine...</li>
            <li> It works fine .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working fine though.</li>
            <li> Does the job, light weight and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> still works fine, had it 3yrs.</li>
            <li> When I returned home the gasket worked and the item did not leak, it was fine.</li>
            <li> Had this for two and a half years now, still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I immediately ignored the recommendation not to use rechargeable batteries, and it works fine, so that is an option too.  </li>
            <li> They worked fine for around six months, and then gave out.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not as strong as my electric WaterPik and the reservoir must be filled a couple of times per use, it&#x27;s compact and convenient for travel, which is just what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Love it - amazing how much is left after brushing - very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Much more power, easier to clean, more convienient, priced right.</li>
            <li> Because the tank is hosted within the handheld, it will take a few uses before becoming accustomed to holding it comfortably and learning how to best maneuver it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very powerful though and easy to fill.</li>
            <li> EASY to use and very powerful just like my corded model from another manufacturer that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> It really is very powerful and easy to use, once I got the batteries in.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the water steam is very powerful.</li>
            <li> It does the same thing and is great when travelling, as it fits easily into your toiletry case.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use - easy to clean.</li>
            <li> As far as the power goes I thought it had a good strong flow at times that too varied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, effective, and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> They should work just fine for you too if you can make them fit.</li>
            <li> Fully waterproof, good for use in the shower (may be a good place to use this as you can make a mess with the water pouring out of your mouth over the sink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The irrigators can remove large stuff stuck between teeth, but are not as effective at removing food that sits below the gum line.</li>
            <li> The tank holds a large amount of water, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use , very convenient !</li>
            <li> I have had Braun and Waterpik oral irrigators over the years and this little beauty is the best of all.</li>
            <li> Pushed out a corn-on-the-cob fragment AFTER brushing, flossing, and gum stimulating the very first evening!</li>
            <li> This irrigator was just what I expected and it did a very good job.</li>
            <li> I feel tempted to update to this model even though my original keeps on going strong.</li>
            <li> Fair stream, ok for trip, best outside or in tup water leaks a little, have to move along or refill.</li>
            <li> Very good, worthy of promotion, especially have tooth decay teeth clean</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan.  </li>
            <li> a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a huge unit taking up a lot of space and know myself, if this wasn&#x27;t out, I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li> (Make sure you get the kind that don&#x27;t self-discharge; they&#x27;ll be marked as \\&quot;pre-charged\\&quot; on the shelf.)  </li>
            <li> It has been a huge hit.</li>
            <li> It works awesome, even for a 9 year old to clear food, etc.  </li>
            <li> Not for everyday use but, as a travel accessory, perfect!</li>
            <li> An experienced user may have different feelings</li>
            <li> More powerful than I thought</li>
            <li> Pansonic is just as described; works beautifully; is light weight; and I will even feel comfortable taking it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as the model I was using is no longer available.</li>
            <li> great initially</li>
            <li> This time round, I started to shop in Amazon which provides an excellent source of reviews by users.</li>
            <li> I never realized how important flossing is until I used this item.</li>
            <li> If you love your smile and care for your teeth than you need to invest in this Panasonic Oral Irrigatior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by Suheiwa</li>
            <li> This goes neatly into a drawer and is easy to clean, so that&#x27;s a winner.  </li>
            <li> Light and water proof.</li>
            <li> liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> IT IS FABULOUS ---</li>
            <li> It is fantastic for traveling.</li>
            <li> --you need a sink close by for the mouth drainage--but it is compact and could easily fit in a shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> However, it is important to me to have an oral irrigator which does a thorough job.</li>
            <li> and you always have one hand free to turn the spray on/off/up/down as you need to.</li>
            <li> Gum health is so important</li>
            <li> This is a great product, will drain out any left overs from between the Gums.</li>
            <li> I prefer the battery operated ones since I used it primarily out of the country.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use fresh batteries if you are going to used it twice a day for a week or so.  </li>
            <li> This one fit the bill well.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to work like your more powerful machine though.  </li>
            <li> This item is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this product today</li>
            <li> It works for me and that is what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> the water jet actually made my gum blood one time (there is a slower speed setting, great.)</li>
            <li> can comfortably given this 3.5-to-4 stars for a travel unit.</li>
            <li> But it stopped fuctioning after 3 months of light use.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is easy to clean and fill.  </li>
            <li> Simple, efficient and great design.</li>
            <li> i can‘t wash my tooth smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have had another irrigator made by Waterpik that is much more powerful.  </li>
            <li> was (although they were quite happy to let me fill their pockets, one periodontist charged me $1000 for essentially doing nothing.)  </li>
            <li> But being a tad cheap, I bought  a Battery and Charger Set (4 batteries) along with it.</li>
            <li> Can be stored in the shower and used there as well keeping the bathroom mirror spot free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much yuck gets lodged between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great for travel - compact in size but still close to the power of my big Water Pik model with 10 settings that I have for home use.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this irrigator after reading all the reviews on all of the irrigators available.  </li>
            <li> By the way, it is easy to disassemble to clean every so often.</li>
            <li> Has amazing power and seems to be built very well.  </li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to holding the bulky machine but after some use, I felt comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> It gets used several times a day, EVERY day, and works great.  </li>
            <li> both stopped working just after the available return date for a credit.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Maybe they will send me a free replacement?</li>
            <li> It has been great for my personal use.</li>
            <li> I use the lower pressure setting because it has such great pressure.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that it&#x27;s battery operated.</li>
            <li> I use a more powerful, plugged in WaterPik, to rinse out the gunk between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too bulky to comfortably handle in-use.</li>
            <li> Light weight,easy to use, reliable.  </li>
            <li> I must say that I really enjoy using my Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll enjoy this a lot when I travel.  </li>
            <li> Amazing how much debris that it removes over brushing.</li>
            <li> There was no portable version of an irrigator available in Australia</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold when using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap enough!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this thing is great, but still think flossing is necessary (though maybe not every night??).</li>
            <li> It of course does a fantastic job in the irrigation department.  </li>
            <li> We have had this for a few years and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li> Fantastic irrigator.  </li>
            <li> and I am free of any gum disease, and all my pockets are 3mm now.</li>
            <li> and I am free of any gum disease, and all my pockets are 3mm now.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase &amp; would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend the more powerful plug-in flossers for day-to day.  </li>
            <li> Way more fun than flossing.</li>
            <li> It works so well that my orthodontists thinks I am doing a great job flossing daily.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness Amazon has such a great return policy.</li>
            <li> Unit is compact and light weight.</li>
            <li> Works well for me; irrigates and removes debris; water capacity just enough water to do the job;cordless and portable; great for travel.</li>
            <li> B003OC74SW Replacement nozzles]] are available, so the irrigator can be shared.  </li>
            <li> Great irrigator, replaces an identical one used intensively for several years.</li>
            <li> My mouth definitely feels cleaner after using it, and my dentist seems to be happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have confirmed it was before the order was processed to ship, and what they told me was just return it when I receive it.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and effective for travel.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for travel and everyday use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comfortable to use and</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using this thing, I still don&#x27;t have a comfortable way of using this product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and carry in your bag.</li>
            <li> Compacts to fit in travel toiletries bag.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job of getting &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out from between teeth and in the gums.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still using my Panasonic because it does a fantastic job</li>
            <li> I liked this so much for travel that I used it for every day.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t fit in your hand well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s portability is also an indispensable feature if you&#x27;re on the road all the time.</li>
            <li> &quot; the 350W could almost fit in palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are a couple available with separate reservoirs.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I each took one of these to Europe with us recently and they worked great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit because it was small,relatively light weight and used replaceable batteries.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The stench was absolutely nauseating, and I had to spend 5 minutes scrubbing the outside and the inside of the product as best</li>
            <li> Panasonic offers a superior product.    </li>
            <li> Have used others with more complex systems and like the battery system best.  </li>
            <li> So far so good and hoping my dentist will see the  results.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nicely portable, decent price.  </li>
            <li> We recently took it on a trip and we couldn&#x27;t be more delighted with it.</li>
            <li> This is far superior to the Waterpik that you have to plug in.  </li>
            <li> A great product if you are a frequent traveller and need a powerful irrigator.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygenist was also impressed, and said I wouldn&#x27;t really benefit from flossing extra.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik is better as a home model (but not by much), and it, of course, holds a lot more water than any portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> far superior to flossing.</li>
            <li> great product, my wife and myself love it, small but does better job that the big one I had, plus beautiful price.</li>
            <li> At home, I&#x27;d still recommend a good plug in unit with a larger water supply and a bit more power.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Good pressure option for those who are sensitive</li>
            <li> This is a really great device and is very powerful for only running on 2 batteries (included in box).  </li>
            <li> Tis is a very useful tool to keep it clean and is easy for her to use.  </li>
            <li> The flosser is pretty strong!</li>
            <li> I use a counter top Water Pic, but I&#x27;m sure there are other good units to be had.</li>
            <li> I would like the water capacity to be greater; but it is the right size for travel.</li>
            <li> To top it all off, the water reservoir leaks, should you not use the irrigator right away.</li>
            <li> This is the single best option, other brands can&#x27;t compete (specially in the battery section)&lt;br /&gt;Great flow and battery life also, great price!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have had the original WaterPik, which plugs into the wall, and it is much more useful.    </li>
            <li> I love the amount of water the pick holds, just enough to get a good clean.</li>
            <li> It travels really well!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, very nice design</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is also very powerful.</li>
            <li> Very useful appliance for teeth and gums hygienе and protection</li>
            <li> Very useful product.</li>
            <li> Wish the reservoir was a bit bigger, but it&#x27;s wonderful to have this in a handheld version without the bulky bin and tubes like some of the older models.  </li>
            <li> Both the old and new have some great features: A powerful motorized pump and a nicely sized water resevoir you can collapse for travel.</li>
            <li> but smooth is easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Compact, portable and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> You can buy replacement probe tips, and these are quick and easy to change.  </li>
            <li> Not as strong as I would have like but adequate for a battery powered item.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use and quickly rinses out all of the food particles between my teeth.</li>
            <li> is that the pressure isn&#x27;t super strong.</li>
            <li> With the two speed settings, it is easy for my 7 and 9 year old to use and sure helps them do a better job than just brushing alone.  </li>
            <li> Quick to set up and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Refill is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> do wish that the power stayed super strong throughout the battery life</li>
            <li> Excellent little machine!  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to set up and ready to use.</li>
            <li> It does run out of water fast, but is very easily refilled.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that you can pull the reservoir off and clean it and its most important to let it completely dry out between use.</li>
            <li> I put warm water in it and use the high power.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel very fresh and clean after using this every morning.</li>
            <li> It  folds up very well to pack for a trip, with the jet piece easily removed and stored safely in the unit.</li>
            <li> It feels really good on your teeth, portable and easy to store even if you have a tiny bathroom.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, however, I am so appreciative to those before me who gave positive reviews which led me to buy this product, that I feel compelled to pay it forward for those who may be considering this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a water flosser for years, and I was so excited to get this one.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this water pik when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> This model is easy to use, clean and store, and really cleans my mouth and gums on top of brushing.  </li>
            <li> May be this issue is unique to me</li>
            <li> I have used a original &amp;#34;Water Pick&amp;#34; years ago, but never like it.  </li>
            <li> ON/Off switch is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I filled it full of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li> and I love that it does fold up pretty compactly.</li>
            <li> I was a able to return it and get another WaterPik when the first one would no longer work after 6 months.      </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t lose and it&#x27;s quality is even better than those in a higher price range.  </li>
            <li> Powerful!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get it,</li>
            <li> Original Panasonic portable oral irrigator purchased solely for travel purposes from Amazon March 23, 2012.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small size is simply perfect for traveling or when one&#x27;s away from the house.    </li>
            <li> My original one \\&quot;died\\&quot; and</li>
            <li> And, my dental hygenist was always impressed at the small amount of plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li> That is why I then ordered replacement tips for my WaterPik(the original reason for my shopping for an oral irrigator</li>
            <li> Still working great after a long time.  </li>
            <li> have successfully introduced this gadget to 9 of my other friends who love it after they tried using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After this product was opened and found with inferior quality, it was repackaged in the original box and never been used.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost!  </li>
            <li> I tried the original Water Pic some years ago and gave it away.  </li>
            <li> Leave a comment if you have a question about it that maybe I can help, and like it if you find it useful!</li>
            <li> this is the best option, I used Waterpik and it didnt last more than 6 months, plus Panasonic is smaller to travel with.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product in preparation with plans to begin wearing braces.  </li>
            <li> She uses it once or twice a day, and the original batteries are still working.  </li>
            <li> I would, however, recommend the original non-portable WaterPik that uses an electric wall socket for power.</li>
            <li> Panasonic products have never disappointed.</li>
            <li> First Dental Check up confirmed my review!</li>
            <li> Was excited to find this product on line.</li>
            <li> Filler cap fits tighter, doesn&#x27;t fall off like original cap.</li>
            <li> I had used my first Panasonic Irrigator for 2 years and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Portable and travel friendly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend because its fun and it works!</li>
            <li> I need something with more consistent quality.</li>
            <li> the way its WAY better than the oral B irrigator, and the ora-jet which I bought first at CVS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a regular counter top model, but has a fairly good pressure.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested in keeping their gums and teeth healthy</li>
            <li> Once extended, the nozzle and water reservoir become accessible.  </li>
            <li> Was able to get some sticky smores out after a girl scouts outing pretty easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And after weeks of use, still using original batteries.  </li>
            <li> I originally got this for travel use</li>
            <li> Def worth it!</li>
            <li> My gum was swollen because my braces were tightened and since I started using this a week ago I have already noticed significant improvement.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is best when you can&#x27;t floss yet because of time constraints (or you&#x27;re just being lazy like me).</li>
            <li> Need to reread original documents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month, using it nightly, and I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> WORTH EVERY PENNY !</li>
            <li> OTHERWISE WORTH EVERY PENNY  !  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean, as it comes apart very easily, and it has a very short water circuit (with the Waterpik</li>
            <li> /&gt;The $35.00 Panasonic unit holds more water, has a more efficient, 2-speed sprayer, and is easier to clean &amp; dry between use, since the spray tip is very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> User friendly and my teeth feel clean after using.</li>
            <li> even on the lowest setting, This is my first oral irrigator and so far its pretty good!</li>
            <li> (yes, I put in new batteries) and were no longer effective.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it now works like new.</li>
            <li> After brushing and flossing it still finds food particles to clean out.</li>
            <li> You can pry off the switch and clean under it.  </li>
            <li> I still do not  know how to clean inside of lower part of the mouth as I can&#x27;t adjust the nozzle to keep water in side the mouth.</li>
            <li> Since this product has arrived my teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, powerful and uses AA sized batteries so you don&#x27;t have to keep charging it or have yet another charger plugged into your wall.</li>
            <li> I use the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser at home to clean my teeth, but for cleaning my teeth at work after lunch, or for those times when I&#x27;m travelling, this Panasonic Oral Irrigator can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I may need to spring for a costlier Water-Pik to clean teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Needed a travel water jet device to help clean my teeth while traveling.</li>
            <li> Water tank size is ample for me clean all my teeth.</li>
            <li> pleased I got this, as it comes in really handy for dislodging dinner bits and such.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, powerful enough for my braces!</li>
            <li> so that when I realized I was going on a week-long trip, I didn&#x27;t want to be without SOMEthing to clean out the gunk.</li>
            <li> He uses it to help clean around his braces.</li>
            <li> So I went cordless, yes battery operated, but I take it with me on my travels and my oral health has improved and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to clean from the bottom of the tooth up</li>
            <li> I really love the idea of this, and it&#x27;s clear that it is a winner for most people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is plenty powerful (two flow rates to choose from), fits easily into your hand during use,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Originally, I wanted something to help clean around my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know what clean teeth are until you have tried this.</li>
            <li> This is powerful and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and now I need to clean my mouth after every meal and snack.</li>
            <li> I clean inside the cylinder periodically by using hypochloride bleach(Chlorox).Don&#x27;t seem to hurt it.</li>
            <li> So far this works better and is more convenient than the 2 Water Pik products I bought.</li>
            <li> This product is inadequate to clean gums and between teeth amd</li>
            <li> I clean it out by swishing detergent and running it with detergent in it, and then desinfecting it with diluted Listerine about once a week.</li>
            <li> Can be taken apart to clean it.</li>
            <li> It would be worth the cost if it were just a bit more powerful</li>
            <li> wish that is lasted longer and that I knew of a way to clean out the grime.  </li>
            <li> Mouth never feels clean.</li>
            <li> easey to store and clean.</li>
            <li> Plenty powerful for travel and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> it help me to keep tooth clean and shine</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> (I do, of course use super-floss to clean implant posts and under bridges)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be prepared to clean your sink and mirror area with each use.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll get the Waterpik traveller&#x27;s one, and use this to clean the grout in my bathroom?</li>
            <li> case.&lt;br /&gt;There is not way to totally clean all the mold out the grown inside the water tank because you cannot take it apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont feel clean with out it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my dentist&#x27;s reccomendation to buy some type of oral irrigator to clean around my braces.  </li>
            <li> Clean it in your bathtub or shower stall, so it doesn&#x27;t spray all over your sink/counter/mirror.</li>
            <li> You can clean the inside out.  </li>
            <li> I do like the compact size, and the force of the water flow does clean.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of water flossers, and this is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> We purchased a water pik type of product at the suggestion of the orthodontist to help us keep her teeth and the palate expander clean.  </li>
            <li> This was my 3rd try for a travel oral irrigator - by far the best yet.  </li>
            <li> I can now keep my teeth and gums clean always.</li>
            <li> It is also easier to clean and store.</li>
            <li> I have braces on my upper teeth, so good cleaning is really important to me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t clean my teeth without it.</li>
            <li> On speed 2 it works well to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth clean at work.</li>
            <li> that it can really clean up the teeth/</li>
            <li> Do not use to clean your ears.</li>
            <li> with this irrigator, I got clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out how to clean the tank and don&#x27;t want  to be forcing mold spores into my gums.</li>
            <li> your mouth and teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really clean like I thought it should.</li>
            <li> You can also soak the Jet Pick in Peroxide overnight to clean it out and help keep mold from growing in there.  </li>
            <li> Tips: keep it clean always.</li>
            <li> It is a must for dental hygiene and keeping your gums clean.</li>
            <li> I clean all the crevices with toothpicks and Q-tips.</li>
            <li> The speed on \\&quot;2\\&quot; is quite strong (with fresh batteries).  </li>
            <li> Keep the batteries fresh, carry extras to keep the power strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks its still working nicely on the 2 batteries , good pressure and flow .&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 speeds and the high speed with a fairly new battery gives you a great amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li> BUT, it can&#x27;t be taken apart to clean inside, so a lot of gunk gets deposited inside and is quite visible through the clear plastic, it feels most unsanitary to me!  </li>
            <li> Decided to get this oral irrigator after looking at all the positive reviews on Amazon and glad that it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> read many positive reviews of this product before I purchased and it met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the fact that the plug in models are more convenient as far as not having to worry about changing batteries and power is always consistent.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all, I&#x27;m okay with it because I feel it is much more sanitary than most irrigators with the long, coiled tube.  </li>
            <li> My old Water Pik was much better!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really easy to travel with as the nozzle fits quite nicely into its own little space.  </li>
            <li> Although only about 2/3 as powerful as a plug-in, it still does a very nice job.  </li>
            <li> With the lower pressure of the spray comes the added problem that it appears to clog very easily, from what, I do not know but requires significant &amp;#34;due diligence&amp;#34;  to be sure it will operate with out problems when you next use it.  </li>
            <li> The product is designed well and easy to understand right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s so easy to use and the price is right.</li>
            <li> strong stream, and size is just right.  </li>
            <li> I use Sanyo, but I am sure there are other good solutions.</li>
            <li> It is a lot easier to use and keep clean, than the full size water pik.</li>
            <li> Other wise it is OK.  </li>
            <li> I originally owned a waterpik thinking that for such a pricy product, it had to be good.  </li>
            <li> I take a cheese grater with a turn handle and insert the bar of Dove soap into the grater, then turn the handle many times to produce soap bits that land in a large,  microwaveable measuring cup.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, if they made the unit to hold more water, it would become too large for travel.  </li>
            <li> Much more convienient than taking the large irrigator system.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require special batteries (it uses 2 AA batteries).  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who had just got his braces and was having issues using the special floss from his orthodontist.</li>
            <li> I went in to the bathtub and after a very wet struggle with the device, I didn&#x27;t see anything better than a good floss could achieve.</li>
            <li> An incredible little machine.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A is very efficient with two pulse strengths, looooong battery life, easy to fill, easy to collapse for storage or travel.  </li>
            <li> An good device to clean my teeth regularly toghther with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The device does a very good job of cleaning out trapped food in bridgework and between teeth.  </li>
            <li> The power is pretty impressive for a little battery powered machine.  </li>
            <li> It was a little more powerful the I thought it was going to be but workes great at cleaning my sons braces after he eats.</li>
            <li> Water pressure is adequate for me as of now, and I am surprised how can any one want more pressure on their teeth!</li>
            <li> More pressure and capacity would be nice, but are not possible with a highly portable unit running two AA batteries - I am satisfied with the compromises made in this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product,after 2sec of use-mouth full of water but nothing cleanse up,and need to fill with water so many times to finish whole mouth</li>
            <li> I can use the more powerful speed as well as the lower for more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really great stuff, but I still not really used to it.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Oral Irrigator is a great device for making sure you get all the small food particles out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Good basic irrigator/losser.</li>
            <li> but, that said, it is definitely good enough.</li>
            <li> The true test will be if the results are what the dentist is looking for.  </li>
            <li> This waterpick is so much better than the one I had used befor that I paid almost twice as much as for this one.</li>
            <li> No ugly cord laying on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as well as the full size pic.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye dentists :-)</li>
            <li> She loved it, as it got a lot of the gunk out of the braces and was also quite compact (relatively speaking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;During my last visit to the dentist&#x27;s office, she said I was doing a good job flossing.  </li>
            <li> B0027LSEPS Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A]]I purchased this because I don&#x27;t have the counter space for a full sized product.</li>
            <li> It works well but is bulky because you have to hold the whole thing instead of just the tip when using the counter top type.</li>
            <li> It does such a good job cleaning that I don&#x27;t need to floss any longer.</li>
            <li> Good quality, low price</li>
            <li> and I will water floss as long as I have my own teeth!</li>
            <li> Overall, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I would pour in a lid full of listrine for every time I use it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has been tremendously helpful in keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was looking good Oral irrigator which is not too big to handle.  </li>
            <li> Currently I am using water picks, not as good as favorably portable items.</li>
            <li> It is good while it is last, but it can stop working anytime.  </li>
            <li> In six months, it&#x27;s full of mold.</li>
            <li> of course it&#x27;s a good product - it&#x27;s japanese.</li>
            <li> The tank holds just enough water for one good flossing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good enough value for the money, but that&#x27;s about all I can say about it.</li>
            <li> I basically full.</li>
            <li> water tank is good enough for one use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit works good with my rechargeable enloops and the pressure seems to be the same as the included alkaline AA batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original Review: For years I have thought that a portable water pick would be a good idea, but never thought until recently to see if one existed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this device.</li>
            <li> After using an electricity powered water irrigator, was pleasantly surprised to find that this portable battery-operated irrigator does an equally effective job.</li>
            <li> A good product, given the current options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fits well in the hand hold just enough water and has good pressure.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic has made good electronics for years and this one is no different.   </li>
            <li> This works really well and love that I can take it when traveling.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Oral Irrigator is the closest I&#x27;ve found to a full size</li>
            <li> This unit has a nifty motor that pumps at a powerful but comfortable rate.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good, but the durability leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> For a travel product, Panasonic seems to have hit a sweet spot.</li>
            <li> If you like the Waterpik Waterflosser, you will likely consider the Panasonic portable as a good temporary alternative.  </li>
            <li> I would not have bought it at full price.</li>
            <li> Just be ready to turn it off because it holds more water than your mouth can, so if you&#x27;re not paying attention, something is in for a shower.  </li>
            <li> Pressure is equivalent to &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; on my full size water pic (scale goes up to 10).  </li>
            <li> I have to refill 3 times for a full rinse.  </li>
            <li> Good for occasional use on a trip.</li>
            <li> This product arrived today and it might be a good thing, but the battery cover will turn to the open position but there seems to be no way to pull it out and insert battery.</li>
            <li> with the tank full it runs for about a minute.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the bigger 110 v water Pik</li>
            <li> good but pain to refill constantly</li>
            <li> not as good as a regular water pic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice improvement over the old model</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, usage wise is quite good&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this and ordering a full size plug in waterpick.</li>
            <li> I feel using preassure nr 1 is good enough for anyone and</li>
            <li> I have own two of this waterfloss so far.</li>
            <li> But later on it was so good</li>
            <li> I could give it a better rating, but the mold build up is a real show stopper</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does only a fair job of irrigating the teeth and gum line.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I&#x27;m guessing this rarely happens: one of the times I filled it</li>
            <li> simple and good item.</li>
            <li> But the real improvement comes in the two speed  feature that can be made more gentler while operating than it&#x27;s predecessors.  </li>
            <li> If I were traveling for a longer period, I would schlep my full size model.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Fill with a mixture of mouthwash and water - really makes your mouth feel more refreshed and cleaner than just brushing, flossing and gargling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the kick that</li>
            <li> It was good for a short trip, but I didn&#x27;t have the smallest temptation to replace the full size water-pik with this after I returned home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal though.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a portable.  </li>
            <li> Not bad still getting use to it I guess.</li>
            <li> not bad for the price</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a deal of the day, not bad at the price I got it at..</li>
            <li> This little battery-operated device is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Works great; easy to use with a little practice</li>
            <li> Easy to use, lightweight and gets in between tough teeth perfectly.</li>
            <li> It has good power with a new battery and cleans between teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I find that the higher speed works better for me in getting the right water pressure.  </li>
            <li> The actual device is nicely made, easy to use, compact ...</li>
            <li> Super good for travel as well, could pack the upper part into the machine.</li>
            <li> Spray is barely strong enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use at work to clean my throat, the pulse action is VERY strong, if that is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is large enough for a good clean, and is easy to refill.  </li>
            <li> it has strong jet and does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was easy to use and did not take up a lot of space and this product does that exactly.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to control for her (besides the switch).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m pressed on time at work, I may use this as a quick consolatory replacement for a full floss.</li>
            <li> For the most part, the reservoir has been sufficient for me to clean my entire mouth, but if I have had to refill a time or two after eating a meal that leaves more particles between my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is high quality and most of all it works as good as any similar device.</li>
            <li> Works great, just as other reviews state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading other reviews and was squally happy.  </li>
            <li> My irrigator has been great and other than accidentally spraying myself a couple of times, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other wiseworks great.</li>
            <li> And now Panasonic has come out with a new model that, if anything, is better than the original.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be pleased if my new one performs as well for 15 months!</li>
            <li> Bought this product hoping it would help me keep a clean fresh mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried to clean and disinfect without success.</li>
            <li> It does make your mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to clean my kid&#x27;s tooth , but I cannot even clean my own tooth without massive splashing.</li>
            <li> this thing is seriously the best i have had.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be lucky to get one year of use, before it quits entirely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The collapsible (for travel) water reservoir is completely adequate.  </li>
            <li> Rechargable battery wore out too quickly.</li>
            <li> I kind of like chicken bullion the best</li>
            <li> and I found it to be much better than the older version.</li>
            <li> knowing nothing is left inside to be later spitted in someones face ..is priceless!</li>
            <li> The water pressure is adequate</li>
            <li> Water runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> The size of the water tank is adequate.</li>
            <li> It will take awhile to learn how to use this item as it sprays water quickly all over the place.  </li>
            <li> My lucky family members are all getting one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> But refilling is quick and painless.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I do tried all kind of flossers, water picks over the last decade and this one is travellers,&lt;br /&gt;Workers dream, can not be better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Broke really quickly.</li>
            <li> It is an adequate alternative to flossing.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be better than the older version (Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator).</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to purchase rechargeable batteries for it since it goes through them quickly.</li>
            <li> It collapses into a super compact size for travel.  </li>
            <li> yet after many, many daily uses.</li>
            <li> This had more power than the older  model my wife uses.  </li>
            <li> This is a tremendous value.</li>
            <li> Oh, it has a low/high water pressure switch and adequate instructions and pictures...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really hoping Santa brings me a more powerful RECHARGEABLE oral irrigator this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Overall, pleased with the purchase, and even my husband who doesn&#x27;t have braces has started using it, because it is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> and only has good power with fresh batteries..</li>
            <li> OEM batteries died to quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; does such an excellent job that I might use it at home on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It seems to have adequate pressure for my needs</li>
            <li> Since our bathroom isn&#x27;t big enough for the plug-in water pic, this is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li> but it is faster if you want a quick rinse of something stuck between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I use peroxide allowing it to remain awguke to remove mild dew that forms inside.  </li>
            <li> The amount of water it holds is adequate for me.</li>
            <li> &gt;♦ Has a steady stream, but more of a pulsing</li>
            <li> The fact that it folded was a selling point because I&#x27;m short on bathroom space and it fit nicely on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the older model.</li>
            <li> is a bit more powerfull than my older conair with the option to go stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is convenient to use and does an adequate job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s size, this tank runs out of water quickly.  </li>
            <li> The water reservoir capacity is adequate -</li>
            <li> --Cleans quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Mainly because my mouth feels better than ever.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Since the rechargeable irrigators only work with 120 current, these were a perfect answer to traveling abroad with an irrigator.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it much right now, as it is not travel season, but it still has the original batteries in it and they are still working..</li>
            <li> I use the &#x27;high&#x27; mostly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for people with braces :)</li>
            <li> I use the &#x27;high&#x27; mostly.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended getting this unit along with a rechargeable toothbrush and Glide Oral B Health Pro for a healthy smile.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Small, portable, does a very good job considering its size.</li>
            <li> Very good for small size.  </li>
            <li> My teeth really feel clean now!</li>
            <li> It can even replace the stationary version, because thanks to the right size of its tank, you don&#x27;t have to refill it many times during one use.</li>
            <li> - something very important when new babies are in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up as a replacement</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic Oral Irrigator because of other reviews and also the price was very nice.  </li>
            <li> It works very well - easy to use and light weight and effective -  but do not get any water in the battery compartment or the unit will die an instant death!  </li>
            <li> The power is just right for the gum so that water pressure clean the space between teeth and massage gum.</li>
            <li> Holds just the right amount of water to irrigate and clean between  your teeth.</li>
            <li> Two great things about this unit, in addition to the fact that it&#x27;s powerful enough at the high speed to clean between my teeth perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, I notice my gums are stronger, because - instead of being able to fit 4 strand of dental floss between some teeth, I can only fit 2 strands.  </li>
            <li> I know since I purchased this item there are now better travel oral irrigators that are probably much nicer than this one; however, I was so pleased with mine that I ordered an additional four to give to my adult children.  </li>
            <li> that having this batter-operated water irrigator fit exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this unit.  </li>
            <li> I expected the stream from the irrigator to be a lot stronger and more precise, more like what the dentist offices have.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I listened to my dentist, because although there is a bit of a learning curve if you&#x27;ve brushed and flossed most of your life, the effort is worth it.</li>
            <li> Portable and looks very elegant, and can be carry everywhere, it can be smaller too by inserting the irrigator into the tank.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other buyers are talking about, but this product works great, and it&#x27;s really powerful too.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with it, especially in comparison with a competing product.  </li>
            <li> Overall it might be worth contemplating paying more money upfront for a more durable product than dealing with the frustration and expense of replacing this one.</li>
            <li> This is my very first oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li> compared with other brands, this entry level irrigator is cheap and as good as the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use with 2 power modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fill the water tank with cool (not cold</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a full size water pic, but it gets the job done for me.</li>
            <li> I owned a Waterpic and I never knew when it was time to recharge, and if you wait too long, it isn&#x27;t good for the battery, so after under a year, the thing died.  </li>
            <li> it as powerful as the corded full size waterpic?</li>
            <li> I expect to run it on rechargeables for a good long time, as well.</li>
            <li> Smart and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Uses up capacity quickly so work fast!!</li>
            <li> It is more powerful than older Panasonic model it replaced - the  two speeds help a lot.</li>
            <li> nothing like a clean fresh mouth taste &amp; SMILE...</li>
            <li> Overall, the Panasonic irrigators are an effective tool for keeping teeth clean and I will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Great water pick to clean between teeth, a bit messy a times.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great, but once it wears down the water stream becomes noticeably weaker.</li>
            <li> It works great and collapses down for travel and storage</li>
            <li> Larger reservoir than older models is great.  </li>
            <li> And while it&#x27;s not ultra compact, it is certainly compact enough to keep handy while on the go!</li>
            <li> wow, with 2 AA batteries, the oral irrigator pumped out apretty strong jet of water and that was at the lower of the two speeds!  </li>
            <li> A larger electric irrigator would hold more water and possibly be even more effective.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much I purchased one for my daughter, and highly recommended to friends that travel.</li>
            <li> But she thought that using this device along with flossing, brushing with Sonicare and then using a good mouthwash (Listerine) was a good routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that you can open the device for cleaning by very gently pulling the upper housing from the lower tank.  </li>
            <li> It has more power with new batteries.</li>
            <li> This new one is even better.</li>
            <li> Love it...........couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I really love my new water pick.</li>
            <li> Over all it is a nice product, very clean, works just like other reviews described that I read before I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit about a year ago and was quite happy with it until I noticed black stuff growing in the seams at the bottom of the tank.  </li>
            <li> aside from slight design flaw and rechargeable battery problems, i was quite happy with this item.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic version seems to work very well, is a lot quieter in operation, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic oral irrigator is very good,and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Strong construction,  very powerfull.    </li>
            <li> It is not as strong as   my electric water pic but very satisfactory  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and very portable.</li>
            <li> It has a powerful stream, just as powerful as my full size WaterPik that I have at home.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does not take up much space.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is very compact - the perfect size for a small bathroom or traveling.  </li>
            <li> It is very portable and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery easy to use.</li>
            <li> I preferred older models, where the water was filled from a flap at the top, which was much easier to fill without spilling.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to use than the Waterpik because you don’t have the tubing to deal with and it store easily in the medicine cabinet instead of taking up space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This is a very compact and easy to use device.  </li>
            <li> The size is very convenient and packs away easy.</li>
            <li> The item works very well, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easily transportable and cleans between the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it my gums bled and it hurt!  </li>
            <li> This is a great because you don&#x27;t have to mess with a cord.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love it!  </li>
            <li> addictive better than flossing!</li>
            <li> I use it daily &amp; love the results!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> , to my surprise was much bigger than I thought it would be, but I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Great for traveling-- can&#x27;t live without my waterpik on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Not only the pressure is greater than my Waterpick, but also easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> The power of the water is strong enough, for sure</li>
            <li> I love the low hassle and easy storability of the unit.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not as powerful as the counter-top models but really, how strong does the water stream need to be?  </li>
            <li> Nice travel size and for home use, stores away easily in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries have lasted longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have had counter top water picks of all brands , most do the job they are supposed to do, with a few of higher price doing a bit better ...</li>
            <li> Kind of splashes unless you&#x27;re careful how you hold it but easy to carry and powerful for a portable.</li>
            <li> No amount of rinsing with hot water, alcohol, or hydrogen peroxide would clean it.  </li>
            <li> I actually have fun with oral care now--I&#x27;m even flossing more!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I get an irrigator, but I just don&#x27;t have a large area available on the bathroom counter, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to get a better clean at home.</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget.</li>
            <li> Great little item</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something not so great, it can leak a little bit.</li>
            <li> It does a great job in a little time and stimulating your gums(you even can feel it afterwards)  </li>
            <li> Simple to use, but may not have the fine adjustment capability as a table top model.  </li>
            <li> I received this pretty quickly for Super Saver Shipping.  </li>
            <li> To do a very good job with the Panasonic you must refill its tank at least 2 times.</li>
            <li> loved it since could use in shower, totally portable (runs on AA), large reservoir</li>
            <li> He reported that although the Panasonic Oral Irrigator didn&#x27;t do as thorough a job as his large one, it did a good enough job to keep his teeth from hurting after every meal eaten on the road.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find a way to separate the blue portion for a full clean of the product.</li>
            <li> Has a powerful stream that takes a little getting used to, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Well, a little more power would be nice.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Oral Irrigattor and had high hopes as most reviewers recommended the product .</li>
            <li> This is very nice, water pressure is strong enough, Compact enough to carry around anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would buy for everyday use, but its great for travel.  </li>
            <li> For a cheap, portable oral irrigator, you really can&#x27;t beat this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing and deep cleaning water flosser!!</li>
            <li> I use this brand for many years and appear to be the most trouble free.</li>
            <li> well-designed re on-off button placement, hand fit, weight, reasonable cost, etc.  </li>
            <li> Just enough water pressure, which is amazing for a battery operated device.</li>
            <li> I suspected this model would not be as powerful as the rechargeable version</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far I love it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as powerful as my Water Pik that I plug in at home.  </li>
            <li> or so it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> They works nicely, but they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Really powerful water-jet.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost for convenience.</li>
            <li> Nice personal Oral Irrigator.  </li>
            <li> Worth buying for someone like me who relies on an oral irrigator to keep gums in shape.  </li>
            <li> the go.\\&quot;  Mine worked flawlessly and efficiently for about 15 months, then the water pressure gradually decreased to a level that was ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful as some of the bulky water flossers out there but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> They have braces powerful and gets all the stuff out of the braces</li>
            <li> That made the irrigator too powerful, and I felt like my gums were being laser-cut away.</li>
            <li> I would not find it effective for everyday use, but I guess it is OK for my purpose.</li>
            <li> It is just as powerful as the electric one I had</li>
            <li> This purchase replaced another line-powered device which was not so useful.</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and this is the perfect size to keep in the drawer and no clumsy cord to fumble with.  </li>
            <li> so much better than the  Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser (WP-440)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bigger water tank, and 2 speeds are nice features to have.</li>
            <li> For crowns, braces, and/or bridges, an oral irrigator of some kind is essential to remove all the gunk stuck between and around them.</li>
            <li> The product is useful, but not as useful as it should be.</li>
            <li> Before it broke I liked it well enough.</li>
            <li> It delivers a much more powerful stream and unlike the Water-Pik does not require frequent recharging.</li>
            <li> Nice portable charger that is powerful enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> After one day of trying to find a benefit in using it, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Definatly worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money, just know that it doesn&#x27;t pulse-out water as forceful as some countertop units.</li>
            <li> Works well and seems almost as effective as traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Surprised to see so many bits stuck even after brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth prices paid.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and really liked having this portable one to take with me to work.</li>
            <li> Too powerful of a stream on the lowest setting</li>
            <li> useful</li>
            <li> so I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li> Works as it should - lightweight and yet powerful..</li>
            <li> I must admit so far I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The unit is nice to be portable and worked well initially.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found this useful.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic model offers a much better product.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this based on the price, certainly it can&#x27;t be worth it, but I read the reviews and took a chance.  </li>
            <li> battery-run is not too powerful.  </li>
            <li> Worth the effort for your dental health.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> As long as it keeps running for me for a couple years I will be very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly powerful for a portable battery powered unit.</li>
            <li> I wish it could be more clear but the file size has to be under 100 MB.    </li>
            <li> I bought that for my mom, and I feel that is not as powerful as this one.  </li>
            <li> It could have a pulsating speed option but so far I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had so much fun.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely spend time to write reviews for products</li>
            <li> Really works well... use warm water for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Powerful, portable and energy efficient.</li>
            <li> Was worth the price.</li>
            <li> This water flosser has truly made it worth my while.</li>
            <li> Compact, well designed and powerful.  </li>
            <li> WAY too powerful to use-HURTS to use</li>
            <li> This product does not perform nearly as well as my Waterpik but is OK for travel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The design is very well thought out and you can disassemble and reassemble quickly to either take on trips or to clean periodically with a vinegar solution, which works well.</li>
            <li> For under $30, even if it has to be replaced in a year, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> useful while traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well with fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li> this was worth a try in that it is rather inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Better than using the old flossing string.</li>
            <li> useful as additional dental appliance</li>
            <li> Manual floss is better by far excoet for the strands breaking all the time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out there was so much more crud/leftover food bits in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is powerful flosser.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have rarely gone a night without using it because it leaves my mouth feeling so</li>
            <li> However, in comparison, I find the Panasonic Oral Irrigator to offer the same water irrigation speed as the WaterPik and to be equally effective with mouth/teeth irrigation.  </li>
            <li> This product uses AA batteries which can be replaced and this product works far better.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll have to reorder only the $8 replacement package and either pay the shipping or wait until I need something else that totals more than $25 to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> It is quite comparable and useful for travel.</li>
            <li> The oral irrigator has two different settings which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> this well designed, compactable, nesting and powerful</li>
            <li> Much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Fresh breath is everything</li>
            <li> It is not so powerful as to blast your mouth, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does lose power as the batteries weaken, but the durability and longevity of this item makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li> in with your fresh water.</li>
            <li> It turned out that my aggressive brushing was hurting, not helping my innocent and sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> When I saw this, I decided that it was worth try.</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill, easy to use, and easy to empty.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a plugin unit, but the mobility is really useful.</li>
            <li> I like to feel fresh after using this irrigator.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, this is much more convenient than flossing, but will update review after I see my dentist again in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> There is definitely enough pressure for the tool to work effectively.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet for travel, but it will take a bit more luggage space than the old one did.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of bulky to hold when you actually flossing</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not even worth one star.  </li>
            <li> love it, but have to refill water frequently</li>
            <li> It is better than nothing when you are on the road somewhere or far away from home.</li>
            <li> I do change the batteries monthly but its worth it.</li>
            <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t floss (weird phobia of mine, can&#x27;t take the sound or feeling), this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and holds plenty of water.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was great about taking it back, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.</li>
            <li> Worth it if you travel a lot and don&#x27;t want to miss.</li>
            <li> And, like many products offered to the U.S. Consumer, it can&#x27;t be fixed or recycled, so it will end up in a landfill.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as the the plug-in model I keep at home, but it will suffice for a one or two week trip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very powerful, has a decent sized reservior, and does the job!  </li>
            <li> I find the high speed is more than adequate - after all, you don&#x27;t want to blast your teeth and gums too much.</li>
            <li> Power setting on high easily removes food from between teeth.  </li>
            <li> very useful water floss, comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I first purchased this item, I have realized I need to check to make sure my batteries are new and work well.</li>
            <li> Very powerful irragator that worked very well cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> Every now and then when I put in the water, I add a little fluoride for a more refreshing, dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Really good for those who travel a lot, small size and easy use.</li>
            <li> At first it has this plastic pipe feel out of the box , fairly large but works fine .</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product and really makes your mouth feel fresh and clean by removing all debri.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like flossing this is a great alternative and your gums will thank you (try adding a couple of drop of oregano oil to the plain water)...</li>
            <li> Especially, good for foreign travel because you don&#x27;t have to work about the  current.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me that a consequence of that is that keeping the mouth clean is both harder to do and more important than before.</li>
            <li> reduce my rating to 3 stars because I discovered and bought a Redi-Breeze irrigator (from Amazon) that fastens to the faucet, that does a better job, not requiring battery changes, not subject to performance fall-off as the batteries decline, nor filling a reservoir or cleaning the unit.  </li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel so clean, and does a great job of getting in the hard to reach areas of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Big healthy smile!</li>
            <li> Have  2 other oral irrigators, Shower Breese oral irrigator that I use most every day as it&#x27;s most convenient,</li>
            <li> Great if you have bridges and hard to clean spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> There maybe other good products in the market, but with this price I think this one really worth it.</li>
            <li> Batteries wear out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, runs through batteries pretty quickly, so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have an older plug-in waterpik model and this works with as much power as that one, but much more convenient.  </li>
            <li> Brushed my teeth and flossed, but the Panasonic Oral Irrigator still removed more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and made my teeth and gums feel amazingly clean.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of trying different techniques I am able to clean all of my teeth on both sides of the gums with one reservoir of water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with this for a trip, but wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with it for the long term.</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s possible to clean it with bleach or something,</li>
            <li> Be sure to clean the tank regularly too.</li>
            <li> Well, unless you are trying to unglue your gums or dislocate your teeth or clean your bathroom with it, this is more than enough.</li>
            <li> Well, unless you are trying to unglue your gums or dislocate your teeth or clean your bathroom with it, this is more than enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic is easy to use, strong jet power and batteries have lasted for 3-4 weeks based on daily use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip</li>
            <li> Not to strong to hurt your gums but strong enough to get food out and massage the gums.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s good for travel, but possibly not for your main product.</li>
            <li> compact ( I am a small woman) and length wise is no larger than the palm of my hand, width wise</li>
            <li> It is far more effective than floss and cheaper in the long term.</li>
            <li> The fact that the batteries are just driving a small motor using a good bit of current made this product a good candidate for MiMH batteries.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect and saw this pretty cheap as a daily deal.  </li>
            <li> I decided the price was right</li>
            <li> Also the price is right.</li>
            <li> The right size for just about anyone.  </li>
            <li> Water cartridge is the right size.</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> She noticed right away and squirted me with it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> Amazon is sending a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> and I could feel that it was getting right into the problem areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably right there in front of you...in the faucet.</li>
            <li> However the pressure is non-existant now and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work right.</li>
            <li> The right way is to replace them after you use up 30-40 tanks of water.</li>
            <li> Right now I have three of the EW-DJ10 units on hand and two of them work sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Price was also right.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose just right</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this one has been the right solution for me.</li>
            <li> Price was right, too.  </li>
            <li> I like this water pic because it is portable, inexpensive, cordless, and has the right amount of water pressure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To extend the life of this Panasonic unit by 2 or 3 times, pull it apart right away after each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if it was more of a purse size, but considering what it does I bet this is as small as you can get it.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first few weeks</li>
            <li> Good fit for small spaces around the sink.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to clean than the WaterPik.</li>
            <li> nice to get that strong power stream back which the old one lost over time.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean very well.</li>
            <li> It takes 2 fillings to clean whole mouth.</li>
            <li> love it have stock in batteries but for me this is the only way to go fast easy</li>
            <li> I recommend this oral irrigator over WaterPik as is much easier to use, transport, clean, etc.  </li>
            <li> The water capacity it sufficient for me to clean my whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This hand held tank is much easier to use and clean.</li>
            <li> really like how clean everything feels after I use this.</li>
            <li> and it really gets my mouth clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little teeth cleaner!  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to fill with water and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and after 5 months is still running on the same batteries.</li>
            <li> This water pick is very easy to use and to fill, and I just keep it on the vanity next to tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> A better design would have been a button like most blenders have that must be held down to keep the power on.</li>
            <li> ; I sure hope I can return these as well as I have no other use for the 48 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve really liked our Panasonic &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; for several years, but this replacement doesn&#x27;t seem as good as our old blue one.</li>
            <li> After trying 3 different water picks, I decided to try one last time to find one that was compact (great for travel), easy to hold, and had more than one speed ( the low is more than enough pressure for my mouth.)</li>
            <li> very little power, doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great how it collapses with storage for the tip it take up very little space.</li>
            <li> its not at all easy to move with wet hands...which they are sure to be.  </li>
            <li> $30 for five years of outstanding daily service in my view is worthy of re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to purchase this while it was on sale, but if I&#x27;d known how much I&#x27;d love this</li>
            <li> I find the lower pressure setting is strong enough for me, but there is always the higher setting for a more intense cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, with a new set of 2 AA&#x27;s it works fine.</li>
            <li> Great product, powerful and does a great job, small enough to easily pack down for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am so glad since the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A is by far the best!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light, compact, easy to fill and empty and clean, batteries</li>
            <li> Pretty bulky but for the freedom from a hose and electric cord it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great for travelling and small counter.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic waterjet is battery powered and would be great for travel or for a small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> gives plenty of pressure and about one full does the whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and travel!</li>
            <li> I think the two choices of speed are wonderful - I only use the low setting though because I have sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to let this dry out completely before re-use, and clean periodically with vinegar to avoid bacteria build-up.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Water Flosser is strong enough to get most of the food particles from between my teeth and easy to use, especially to fill it with water.</li>
            <li> It can easily be stored, easily rinsed out, and I can add a bit of Listerine mouthwash (to kill the bacteria) as long as I rinse it out before storing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but would like a little more pressure with the irrigation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had two of these little devices and they are awesome to use prior to brushing with my oral B electric</li>
            <li> highly recommend it to everyone, your oral health will improve as well as your smile!</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist for a formal report on the health of their gums, but I can see that their teeth are clean without that white film they tend to miss when they just brush and in between their teeth is nice and clean like they flossed.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product so much, I bought this second one.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s strong enough to clean all things on the teeth and between the gum and teeth.</li>
            <li> &quot; and \\&quot;Weak\\&quot; - the most powerful of which is about the same as my AC -powered home unit set on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> The size was perfect for traveling and it did its job; would not use for everyday as needs to be refilled in order to floss entire mouth.</li>
            <li> I also get occasional tonsil stones, and this device is great for getting back in the throat to wash them out as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Overall great product that has worked well over the last month.</li>
            <li> While not like the more powerful water jet machines this one did the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; on my recent trip.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be a fluke, and since I was, overall, happy with the product&#x27;s performance, I ordered a replacement one for myself, which duly broke within the same time-frame.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have space for a larger  irrigator that may be more powerful.  </li>
            <li> I refill the tank twice each use and the tip rotates making it easy to direct.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as strong as the countertop models unless you aim the stream directly into the gumline.</li>
            <li> It is nice and compact for travel, and holds enough water for my whole mouth, when used on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> As  the recommended brushing time is 2 minutes - using an Oral Irrigator shouldn&#x27;t  take 2 more additional minutes because the mouth(or the gums) don&#x27;t naturally need so much work on them.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is adequate for one person, depending on how much irrigation you need/want.</li>
            <li> As for the workings, I loved the pick, but it lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a compact, easy to use dental irrigator.</li>
            <li> Bought this one for a back up and haven&#x27;t had to use it because the first one I bought is still going strong!</li>
            <li> Time will tell how long the NiZn batteries will last, but so far they are the best match with this oral irrigator.    </li>
            <li> Sure enough, the Panasonic&#x27;s little irrigator isn&#x27;t the most aesthetically appealing product in the world, but it gets the job done.    </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and would recommend it especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty powerful - better than simply flossing!</li>
            <li> as mentioned, I&#x27;ve been impressed with the power of the stream, so I won&#x27;t be too surprised if the batteries don&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li> jet of water is pretty powerful, and does a good job of blasting out trapped particles.  </li>
            <li> I always ended up spraying water everywhere, it made a mess of the bathroom sink area, and it didn&#x27;t feel like a comparable alternative to good ol&#x27; fashioned flossing.  </li>
            <li> At the second speed, it is also just right for clearing of more &#x27;stubborn&#x27; debris.</li>
            <li> This is a highly effective way to get loose particles out of the spaces between my crowded teeth.  </li>
            <li> From my point of view the older model was better - you were able to store the nozzle inside of irigator body and save the space, which is not possible with new model.</li>
            <li> runs out of water very fast</li>
            <li> I like th i s product very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Glory hallelujah, my problems were solved and at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> The top slides down into the reservoir making it compact and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> However, it should be OK for my daughter, who is only 6.3 feet height, because it is just right with me, who is not too much higher</li>
            <li> This is fine for a portable irrigator - easy to use, though not especially powerful.  </li>
            <li> So far, the water irrigator is working fine.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is battery operated and not quite as powerful but certainly helpful when on the road.  </li>
            <li> Much better than old (and new ones too!)</li>
            <li> but this is no big deal as it fills quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to finally find exactly what I need and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I also run the blue part and the nozzle through the dishwasher (top rack)</li>
            <li> i use rechargeable battery w/ downside needing to open compartment more risking corrosion.</li>
            <li> It collapses smaller, has more power, uses batteries.</li>
            <li> My first water pic.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t do that with more traditional pic.</li>
            <li> At first, the unit looks  bulky.  </li>
            <li> However, one must understand that the reservoir volume is necessary, on top of the motor and the batteries.  </li>
            <li> After seeing my first one, my wife also wanted one.  </li>
            <li> My son (17) used it every day at first, but then tapered off a bit.  </li>
            <li> Now my husband wants one!  </li>
            <li> So be aware of that.    </li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare as this is my first oral water pik device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall pleased with the Panasonic units</li>
            <li> It is so powerful and really gets the food out from my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Just to be on the safe side, I will travel with extra batteries!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Occasionally I use about one third mouthwash with the filling water for a refreshing mouthwash.</li>
            <li> worth the very affordable price.</li>
            <li> how much stuff!  </li>
            <li> This led me to purchase my first cordless waterpik in Oct 09.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the batteries but not the case.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as described in the ad.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen how it works, but the first time I used it I had a funny taste in my mouth which I think was the gunk between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Being battery operated is more convenient because I only have one power socket in the bathroom which is in use.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, the bottom of the filter was clogged.  </li>
            <li> First time use of an oral irrigator, and bought 5 for family.</li>
            <li> Would do much better flossing with regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> I just replaced the battery for the first time.  </li>
            <li> My first thought on turning it on was, \\&quot;Yikes</li>
            <li> I am married to a dentist and he likes it too.</li>
            <li> First one is still going after 10 years</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with this product, and, as usual, pleased with the delivery from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have purchased 3 or 4 of this product, but at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> Returned unit under warranty coverage to Panasonic Exchange Center in McAllen TX on November 29, 2012 (shipping at my own expense).</li>
            <li> first one broke</li>
            <li> However, I lost the hinge door on my first two units about a year.</li>
            <li> This was my first water pick-like device</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I decided to buy this Panasonic portable water pick, keeping in mind that it has a disadvantage of being &#x27;bulky&#x27;, especially for my kids.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind this, because I&#x27;ve already ordered a WaterPick WP100 for them, as they are now a bit more grown up and stay on a different floor in our house.      </li>
            <li> It became ~1.5 times higher, which is 8.5 inches.</li>
            <li> Most everything was double this price.  </li>
            <li> But even if you need to reload more water, its a very simple thing to do.</li>
            <li> This is my first \\&quot;oral irrigator\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch on the first intermittantly stayed on, so after a couple of years I bought another one.  </li>
            <li> Found this product a couple of years ago after having  problems with Water-Pik rechargeable batteries not lasting more than a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know more after the next trip to the dentist, but for now the irrigator seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> Over the years I enjoyed using different Waterpik irrigaters.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the only sure way to make sure the unit is DRY and CLEAN, which prevents mold/bacterial growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After eating I ran to this thing to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I received it in the mail yesterday and used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> If you use a dental irrigation device at home, such as the WaterPik, you will love this product.  </li>
            <li> My first one is still working after 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I have a larger vanity top irrigator.  </li>
            <li> But omg with this water pick after the first time use, my pain is gone.</li>
            <li> Very portable slides in to itself for travel worth the money.</li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t pump like it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> I have used the water pik table top version for past 25 years or more, and always missed it when I went on vacations.  </li>
            <li> The reason for buying another one was because I lost the first one in a move.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a battery powered irrigator but this thing is terrific.  </li>
            <li> Hoping for a lot better check up on my next dental visit.</li>
            <li> The first one just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This is the first oral irrigator I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li> I soaked my bathroom the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> I feel like Im forcing a water hose in my mouth and more water sprays outside of my mouth than in it.</li>
            <li> #34;this is the first I&#x27;ve heard about a mold problem, Sorry!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with the product.</li>
            <li> IN IT, BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER, AND OPERATE THE IRRIGATOR BETTER.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that sometimes you need to fill it with water more than once during a cleaning, but this is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> The first one quit working in 5 months</li>
            <li> This is the 10th unit I have gotten in since I bought the first one for myself in July 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in on this and really like it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So much better than one of those big things that sit on the sink and take up room.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I sent it back because for the money I paid...just a bit more with it</li>
            <li> When I first started, I had to refill it once.</li>
            <li> Very compact!</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I am biased towards Panasonic products but the quality of this dental appliance is quickly evident.</li>
            <li> Our last WaterPic has the water refill opening on top, so when someone used the pick, their &amp;#34;mouth backwash&amp;#34; accumulated around the opening, some of it under the cover</li>
            <li> but I like my regular size water pic better.  </li>
            <li> The thread is better for regular flossing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The first 4 or 5 days were a scream-</li>
            <li> so I have to heat the water up first before using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wish it held more fluid in the chamber</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a water pick</li>
            <li> But be ready for water to splash everywhere!</li>
            <li> I had a cordless, rechargeable unit from a competitor (you know, the famous name one) prior to purchasing this one.</li>
            <li> This one is not quite as powerful nor does it hold as much water.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 2 + years.  </li>
            <li> Still using the first one for over one year now.</li>
            <li> I would love to get my money back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an oral irrigator for years and have tried many different models.  </li>
            <li> Ok, it didn&#x27;t cost a fortune, but I did expect it to last a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased ....because I love this item.</li>
            <li> I use it about 3 times a week and haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet, which is pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to flossing and find that it gets to the back teeth better than you ever could manually.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it ended up all over my mirror and the walls.</li>
            <li> You Must make sure to leave the cap open when not in use or you can get mildew buildup in there.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its advertising says about it.</li>
            <li> Then to put the batteries in place you need something with width because you need to turn this nickle size white plastic screw on top to the word &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I used luke water as suggested, so as not to have a first time shock.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Be aware of the location of the switch where it is before flossing.  </li>
            <li> If you want it for home only, you might be better with something you plug in; for travel/home use, don&#x27;t bother trying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally decided on this one &amp; I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it&#x27;s convenient, the tank is the appropriate size to use on my entire mouth without refilling.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Then you put the nozzle in your mouth (first, lest you want to squirt up the mirror) and turn it on.</li>
            <li> This worked well for the first couple months, but then it started leaking out the side during use.  </li>
            <li> The only improvement that I suggest is a more contoured shape.</li>
            <li> It does have many pros, such as:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> It is definitely better than not using one at all, but only if portable is all you can find room for; as in traveling and living out of a suitcase.</li>
            <li> The best thing about the product is the fact that it is small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> the first version of this irrigator for years.</li>
            <li> first one lasted two years, then stopped working</li>
            <li> When you are talking portable, size matters, and bigger isn&#x27;t better.  </li>
            <li> This is my first oral irrigator</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s low pressure output that it is in the cabinet more permanently.  </li>
            <li> But, for short term use, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I still continue to employ most of the above techniques, and this Panasonic is an integral part of</li>
            <li> I still continue to employ most of the above techniques, and this Panasonic is an integral part of</li>
            <li> very deep cleaning sensation, Love it.</li>
            <li> First I used floss after every meal and then used an interdental brush but both seem to exacerbate the pain - they were just too abrasive since I have to do it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though on first use, panicked and pulled it out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Might want to practice without batteries first.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say this was 100% the cause, but it seems like a logical possibility for the unit not turning on anymore.</li>
            <li> After trying for several hours to remove the top of the battery well, I gave up.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Probably would pay more for somthing nicer unless your useing this for vacations or away from the house only...</li>
            <li> Next time I would purchase something more environmentally-and financially-friendly.</li>
            <li> The instructions need to be clearer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the answerer, keep turning the cap AFTER you are pointed to the open position and it will come up and be able pulled out.</li>
            <li> It is a lot better than waterpick 360 in which the battery can not hold a charge after only 6 months..</li>
            <li> I lost the first one and replaced it.</li>
            <li> my first water flosser.</li>
            <li> first of these type of devices i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> However I would like it more if it had a bigger tank.</li>
            <li> product does exactly that which is mentioned in the product description</li>
            <li> It would be a mistake to stop using the product when bleeding is evident.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, the unit is compact and powerful and it gets out stuff you didn&#x27;t know was stuck in there.  </li>
            <li> I use this for the first time, blood came out from the gums.</li>
            <li> Make sure to take the batteries out and put the battery cover back on so no water gets inside the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> The batteries last too, I quite often have to refill the water tank  as I require more time -</li>
            <li> This is my first water irrigation item.  </li>
            <li> —I keep it near a window for air and light.</li>
            <li> I bought practically the first one made and took it abroad.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is NOt the regular bulky thing you would need to leave at your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This product worked OK but had a short battery life.  </li>
            <li> But is enough to do my top teeth refill and do the lower teeth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an oral irrigator but wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it so this seemed a relatively inexpensive entry into the field.</li>
            <li> Keep your mouth slightly open so water has a way to go, you would not be able to hold the whole tank contents in your mouth!</li>
            <li> Make sure you fully extend the water tank, or it might collapse when water gets low.</li>
            <li> and I have used it several times without being able to get all the way around my mouth,</li>
            <li> went ok after the 2nd time - using not the highest preassure, but nr 1, it is still feeling like the job is done in a minute!</li>
            <li> one suggestion is if you got a power toothbrush, this thing is not necessary for most people</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m up to the higher setting.</li>
            <li> However on my first trip the gasket broke and leaked</li>
            <li> so I could not use it on my first trip.</li>
            <li> Bought this one for a friend because I have used the first one for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I have learned that a water-pic treatment daily will save many dental bills, &amp; promote oral health.  </li>
            <li> I have been a fan of PANASONIC quality since I first used their radios in the 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Shot water in my eyes first time.</li>
            <li> First off let me say I&#x27;ve owned a Waterpik home unit for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> (I only use the #1 setting most of the time anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect it to last many years.</li>
            <li> Bought this a year back and stocked up one more and introduced it to my cousin.</li>
            <li> It actually work better than the waterpik portable one.</li>
            <li> Way better than a big clunky &amp;#34;Waterpic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase but being able to replace batteries rather than the entire unit sold me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s inexpensive, portable, lightweight and works pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s room in the device to potentially store more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, as it is my first irrigator.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it was supposed to do</li>
            <li> but i may buy another in hopes that the death of the first one was a fluke.</li>
            <li> I floss and brush my teeth everyday and think I do a really good job of it, until I use my oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li> have been using mine for a little over 2 years and it is like new and with great results.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the collapsible design which makes the device very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> and i have to clean it after my job with this is done, still running on original batteries after two weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, easy to store and works extremely well for my problems with my gums.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic always has high quality products and I think this is worthy of the brand.</li>
            <li> I DO rinse the unit out with clean water and turn it on to clean the inside with the water only.</li>
            <li> Cons: recommended only for water (no mixture of mouthwash, as is recommended by my hygienist), it is not as easy to turn on/off and is not as powerful.</li>
            <li> Strong flow only when batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li> Yes, the initial battery is wicked powerful, and the replacements that I am using are not as strong.  </li>
            <li> Low speed is great for beginners, and high speed is more than powerful enough for long time users.</li>
            <li> This is simple to use and I am sure just as effective as the other &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> We finally wore out our original Panasonic Oral Irrigator and this one works much better with NiMH rechargeable batteries than the old one.</li>
            <li> The new one has dual speeds (very nice for sensitive gums) and the batteries last much longer.  </li>
            <li> Right after a battery change it has a lot of power, as the month goes on, not so much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much water but for me, it&#x27;s just about right.  </li>
            <li> This new model as a slightly larger water holding capacity than it&#x27;s predecessor, although both are adequate for most days.  </li>
            <li> The water pressure in the first one came out right, the 3rd one is too strong.  </li>
            <li> However, First  issue is water reservoir which  doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to clean a full mouth.</li>
            <li> if not better performance, and a nice upgrade to the original.</li>
            <li> This is weak, but perfect for cleaning sensitive pockets away from home.  </li>
            <li> I laughed at myself, thinking I had to get used to it,  but it really did make a mess.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t honestly feel it is making any great difference to my oral hygiene which is disappointing as I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> Tried the rechargable PowerGenix AA batteries and like the extra power boost from the batteries slighly higher voltage and significantly lower interal inpedance (lets the battery source higher current for more powerful operation).</li>
            <li> When I floss after that, I feel very clean and only minimum flossing is needed.</li>
            <li> It works on batteries which last a long time and is great for travelling as well as it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Why buy any other kind, including plug-in?   </li>
            <li> This Oral Irrigator is just as good as the last one I bought, exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> a bit lighter than the other brand but still effective.</li>
            <li> Due to these issues, I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective oral irrigation product.</li>
            <li> Have used it twice and its good so far except for the initial gum bleeding which has mentioned to be normal.</li>
            <li> Way more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li> Was more powerful than I expected</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I thought it would be, but does a decent job conveniently.</li>
            <li> After root scaling and planing for early periodontal disease,  I&#x27;d try anything to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Use an old toothbrush and some Peroxide to clean or wipe off any mold you see.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there does not seem to be a good alternative, so it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the chores of flossing and has been constantly reminded by my dentist to make such good habit for dental health reasons.</li>
            <li> So - it doesnt hold a lot of fluid, but the pressure is good and its so convenient that I use it daily -</li>
            <li> BUT, this one works well, holds more water and has enough water pressure to really irrigate between teeth.  </li>
            <li> However not taking into account the braces, regular in between the teeth flossing, it does a good job, but I can&#x27;t compare it to a regular floss with a thread.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved it so much, I purchased another within a few days so he could have one with him at all times.</li>
            <li> Loved it enough I bought a second.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are super clean and white.</li>
            <li> This is the most poorly designed product I own.</li>
            <li> can start quickly , even if the unit looks clean on the outside .Thankfully</li>
            <li> Very affordable - actually was free when you shop with your amazon card points!</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve on how to make sure you get to all your teeth without spraying the whole bathroom, but it is possible.</li>
            <li> It even takes popcorn  hulls out of my gum line and when I mix a little mouthwash with the water it is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have used this device for a little over one month, an I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> It does not hold very much water and has 2 speeds - \\&quot;Very</li>
            <li> The unit has a powerful jet at the high setting, which I use almost all the time.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for back of the mouth (2nd &amp; 3rd molars) where a normal tooth brush would not reach.</li>
            <li> The high is too powerful for my preference.</li>
            <li> Somewhere I saw that this unt had a very high pulse rate, so that interested</li>
            <li> With Panasonic, the water is just right for normal cleaning when I turn it on, at the first speed.</li>
            <li> This item is very elegant, Panasonic is a very trustworthy company from my previous experience.</li>
            <li> I knew that it would be a novelty at first, but hoped it was easy enough that they would continue.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s small and compact and fits easily out of sight in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> It has 2 speed settings, although I find the first setting to be strong enough.</li>
            <li> They are too low and should be higher for easy access.  </li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s not as powerful as my 110 volt home unit, its power using 2 AA batteries is quite nice for cleaning between my teeth in lieu of using dental floss, which is not nearly as easy.</li>
            <li> This had the highest number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use it in the shower so there is really NO mess to clean up</li>
            <li> I like it better than other irrigators I have owned  because I does as good a job at cleaning and spews less water around than they do.</li>
            <li> I love that it compacts down to a smaller size, and it is very easy to fill up with water.</li>
            <li> so first I tried the single speed Panasonic Oral Irrigator which was OK.</li>
            <li> I bought one and liked it so much I&#x27;m buying one as a gift for other people.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this teeth cleaner and we rush to see who can use it first in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve checked the tube, nozzle, and everything I can reasonably access, but no solution is evident.</li>
            <li> The first one began leaking water into the battery chamber and that really reduced battery life.  </li>
            <li> However, this is my first water flosser, so I don&#x27;t have much experience</li>
            <li> I used one with a charger a long cord for more than two years.</li>
            <li> The pressure is pretty intense for my gums.  </li>
            <li> I use it while in the shower but not directly under the spray, but I am sure it&#x27;s water proof.</li>
            <li> In the long run it is probably more costly to operate than one that is chraged electrically.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s compact design allows me to conveniently carry it in my backpack pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> So this is pretty much a lifeline for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WaterPik battery life dropped off pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> The design of this thing does make me think it&#x27;s going into my travel bag, and I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a different product with a larger tank, and more comfortable wand-type sprayer.</li>
            <li> and I begins to develop the good habit of \\&quot;flushing\\&quot; the food debris around my gum before the usual brushing every night.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is so small, it has emptied out after 30-40 seconds - meaning that for a good irrigation job, you end up refilling it four or five times.</li>
            <li> than that small problem I found it good value for the amount of money paid</li>
            <li> it is not so powerful as normal stationary irrigator</li>
            <li> it uses AA batteries and a small amount of water to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Small, convenient and does a good job cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as powerful as the plug in kind.  </li>
            <li> I then drained three entire reservoirs worth of soapy water to try and clean out and rinse the tube inside, and even THEN, it still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> But I use it on the 2nd setting and my mouth feels really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit provides a good clean even though the tip is a poor angle for irrigating underneath the ceramic plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when he went over certain spots; it was the first time I was ready to run out of his office!&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m surprised most with this product is that its pulsated stream of water was just of the right size and power, the same like of the Braun-Oral B I used before.</li>
            <li> I will sometimes add a little mouthwash and really warm or slightly hot water when I have gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> I personally like the high power setting because it cleans between the teeth better.  </li>
            <li> After the battery level dropped more I switched to the High which was about what the Low was before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a good product and for the price you got a cordless pitiable product that is damn near as powerful as a much more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Good pressure, but it is not a substitute for flossing!&lt;br /&gt;Throw a little mouthwash in the tank with water for an extra clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Originally bought it for travel, but found I used it more than the big-tank model that was way more expensive.</li>
            <li> Wow! was my first word after having tried out this miniature size water-cleaning device!....</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to fill, easy to empty and is small enough and attractive enough to store on my bathroom counter without looking ungainly.</li>
            <li> Maybe not quite as powerful as a corded if the batteries aren&#x27;t new</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy enough to refill.  </li>
            <li> I have become forcibly acquainted with a condition called xerostemia or dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This was simple, easy to use and now cords.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let it dry some more and see if it starts to work again.  </li>
            <li> Easy, low tech, portable.  </li>
            <li> I  especially like that it will be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> And I sure wish i&#x27;d starting using this product when i was a kid -  if you don&#x27;t use a waterpik, you might not be getting your teeth as clean as they could be.using this years ago, do yourslef a big favor - buy one before they quit making them!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to pull out of the drawer and use instantly.  </li>
            <li> This Oral Irrigator is simple, easy to set and use.</li>
            <li> Has a small counter foot print, ideal for smaller bathrooms.</li>
            <li> The price is great,you can easily travel with it,and you&#x27;ll be left with healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> More compact, easier to dry after use, batteries can be replaced, easier to fill water container.  </li>
            <li> the switch was in a place that got easily turned on by accident, which i see is a possible place for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less cumbersome than the electronic models and just as effective.</li>
            <li> He has only used it a couple of times but it is easy to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal as it&#x27;s easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> The reservoir is able to do less than half of your mouth if you aren&#x27;t racing through and doing a good job.</li>
            <li> and they last a good long time.  </li>
            <li> I usually mix some Listerine in with the water for a nice fresh result.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t be strong enough, then once found it s stronger than you need,</li>
            <li> &quot; product says this one isn&#x27;t strong enough but it is strong enough for my gums.  </li>
            <li> It is not as strong as the standard plug-in waterpik which I use at home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, used it daily, and the batteries are still going strong.</li>
            <li> It pumps out the water strong enough to remove all food paticles.</li>
            <li> Looked funny in the picture but for the price had to try it, it is a solid little machine and once you find your way to hold it it works great.</li>
            <li> Too large.</li>
            <li> Certainly outperformed my expectations.</li>
            <li> The design I would describe as \\&quot;smart simplicity\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have a large WaterPik at home and also purchased a travel size.</li>
            <li> You have to use it at a certain angle, but the tip is adjustable(it twists).</li>
            <li> You had to hold it a certain way to keep it from collapsing</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t have a large bathroom</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t want to be putting yucky water on my gums.</li>
            <li> smart design.</li>
            <li> He has a large, cabinet-top irrigator, but needed something he could use in the car when we travel.</li>
            <li> You have to hold it a certain way for it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the plug in type and they are large and a pain</li>
            <li> wish it has a large water container to hold sufficient amount of water so that I can floss my teeth with just one time water topup.</li>
            <li> I even put a weak listerine solution in it a couple times with great results.</li>
            <li> I fill it with warm water from the shower head and there isn&#x27;t any mess in my sink.</li>
            <li> asked if we could get a new o-ring from the manufacturer, but the part is not provided, so we could not open it and make sure it would close again.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It is funny that an open-box item in Amazon&#x27;s warehouse deal was also increased  to USD33.85,which is much higher than a brand new item(USD29.73 with coupon).&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to use, not so powerful as I expected</li>
            <li> The two AA  batteries last the whole trip and were still going strong at the end.</li>
            <li> EW-DJ10-A works very well and is strong enough to do a thorough cleaning job.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping from the other reviews that it would be as good as my countertop Waterpick, but it has half the power, and is not as easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I travel a lot and this compact gizmo is a clever design and more powerful than other portable devices I have tried.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would really use this, but since I moved it into the shower, I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> It is very maneuverable, much more that the Waterpik (limited by the hose lenght and rigidness).</li>
            <li> I generally fill the canister with lukewarm water twice each time I use it to effectively clean between all the teeth and along the gum line.  </li>
            <li> There are no extra attachment pieces and that is fine with me as they are not needed.  </li>
            <li> Be sure it is completely dry before opening the battery compartment!</li>
            <li> This one is a bit smaller but works fine.  </li>
            <li> I bought this same dental irrigator in 2009 and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> This thing is nice, on two AA batteries, it pushes a lot of water through your teeth (be careful not to hit your gums to directly though - it&#x27;ll hurt!)</li>
            <li> Using only 2 batteries, it&#x27;s better than rechargeable, more reliable and less to carry.</li>
            <li> ; yes it does eat through batteries pretty quickly as many other reviewers have commented.  </li>
            <li> With the Panasonic, extra batteries are easy to carry and available everywhere in the world (and btw, the batteries anywhere are the same voltage ...</li>
            <li> If I had, I&#x27;d have known more quickly that it would only last for 5 or 6 uses, and returned it immediately.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty decent to be battery powered tho.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is VERY GOOD, although it could spray just a little harder.  </li>
            <li> larger water supply, more comfortable to hold, and single AA battery means no tangle of cords on the countertop.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much too large for travel.</li>
            <li> A nice trick would be to put a little mouth wash with water (though the manual DISCOURAGES putting any chemicals except water inside).</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> Good for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It is good to use in addition to dental floss for hard to get areas.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is that it folds up into a smaller unit for transporting when you travel, and the nozzle fits in this neat little secure pocket so it can&#x27;t get lost.  </li>
            <li> but this turns out to be an advantage as a set of alkalines usually are good for a month or more, whereas the rechargeable batteries in my old Water Pik began to lose the ability to hold a decent charge after a year&#x27;s use, necessitating replacing the entire unit.</li>
            <li> The new batteries resulted in much stronger water pressure and I am using the first and second setting--which is fine.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with it, and for the money I don&#x27;t think that you can go wrong.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s okay but not as powerful as the one I use everyday at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few months and am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It was about $15.oo more than this Panasonic, and I expected a much longer life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product and bought one for my wife as well as my brother.</li>
            <li> I much prefer it to flossing.</li>
            <li> I like this guy because he doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> Two-speed does the job and is just much quicker fill and use.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow directions to empty the water.</li>
            <li> to fill it twice to do whole mouth...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much the toothbrush leaves behing.</li>
            <li> Both of them really like it.  </li>
            <li> , they would really have a 5 star irrigator.</li>
            <li> All in all though,  this irrigator works very well.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and portable, and I just packed it in my carry-on for a three day trip from Ohio to California and return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t choke on too much water.</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic--you get an A+++ from me.  </li>
            <li> Not much water was getting through the teeny opening, but it works much better now.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always ready to go.</li>
            <li> OK for travel, not much pressure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly worth the relatively modest investment.</li>
            <li> so I guess it is a reasonable compromise.</li>
            <li> This unit replaces the very unreliable battery powered Waterpik Cordless Plus Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li> Powerful jet clear out any debris.</li>
            <li> I bought two of them, they all worked very well (basically for travel).  </li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds and he really thinks it does the job.</li>
            <li> He really likes this Panasonic Oral Irrigator.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I use a waterpic-WP-100wc at home and am very satified with it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I took a sewing needle and carefully removed the clog, making sure not to damage the filter.  </li>
            <li> very lightweight and portable.</li>
            <li> I am going to try it in my much deeper kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and without cord or taking up a too much space.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job on the teeth and gums my Dentist remarked what a  terrific job I was doing ,she said keep it up.</li>
            <li> , this really is messy!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased a lithium-ion 14500 battery (very close in size to a AA, but the nubby tab is reduced in height).</li>
            <li> and so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> all put together and ready for travel ...</li>
            <li> thanks for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The irrigator did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> so I was really</li>
            <li> We really like this product.</li>
            <li> Our dental checkups have been much improved with it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this product was even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used a corded irrigator before there aren&#x27;t any real surprises.</li>
            <li> Highest might be too much for some.</li>
            <li> it look like very good,Haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li> It has as much cleaning power as the faucet irrigator.</li>
            <li> I absolutely CANNOT use this without getting water all over myself and on the mirror.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it&#x27;s MUCH  queiter than my hydrofloss, which sounds like it&#x27;s experiencing the mechanical equivalent of an epileptic seizure every time I hit the switch.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is better than expected.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> A full tank doesn&#x27;t last long though so you have to hurry and then refill for a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I can imagine how much research had the Panasonic engineers done to find out this point.</li>
            <li> The power switch and battery lid are very well water-proof.</li>
            <li> In the car, I realized that there were some important paper together with it, and I rushed back just to find out that nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I think the water is a gentle way to care for this injured area.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the pressure (not sure i would want it any stronger), the cosmetic looks, and its ease to use.</li>
            <li> It really gets the job taken care of.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my countertop WaterPik Mod.</li>
            <li> Waterpink as it ihas much stronger water force.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> It works very well and removes any food particals stuck between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The batteries are very durable.</li>
            <li> The flosser just arrived today and I was ready.</li>
            <li> This Flosser was recommend and noted for gently cleaning around the gums.</li>
            <li> I really like this Panasonic Irrigator.  </li>
            <li> What bothers me the most is that Panasonic&#x27;s warranty center in McAllen, TX takes up to 2 months to send the replacement.</li>
            <li> Has adequete strength to really help in flossing.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li> This portable unit performs well on batteries, and can collapse to a reasonably compact size for travel.  </li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t really carry a bulky, electric irrigator with me and after doing some research decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> ....Works very well.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room on the sink.  </li>
            <li> Very well made, portable and with plenty of pumping power.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much debris it removes from between my teeth and guns.  </li>
            <li> This one operates with two AA batteries, is compact, truly portable and works VERY well.  </li>
            <li> I was very unimpressed otherwise.</li>
            <li> I am very concerned about keeping my dental care and health.  </li>
            <li> I really cleans well and compresses to a convenient size for packing.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Dana</li>
            <li> I am very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You do have to fill it up twice to get your whole mouth done.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing myself using this much.</li>
            <li> But I do have an issue with the strength of the irrigation, it is so much stronger than the one I&#x27;m used to that it immediately hurt my gums and made me bleed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s INTENSE.</li>
            <li> it became an absolute necessity.</li>
            <li> plus points: The Panasonic Irrigator is fairly light, and it squishes into a relatively compact size.</li>
            <li> If you tilt it too much, the bump can&#x27;t get water.</li>
            <li> very reliable.  </li>
            <li> I really wish the tip was collapsible in some way or form, the tip remains jutted out</li>
            <li> It works reasonably well</li>
            <li> thanks for delivering the package,i like the feeling so much ,anyway</li>
            <li> When camping it is very convenient to carry it in bathroom kitbag to Community showers.</li>
            <li> and it was quite cumbersome and took up too much space on the counter.</li>
            <li> Been using this at work and it works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-simple design and very portable</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> This cordless Panasonic unit works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is compact and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have braces and it has made my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for the purpose</li>
            <li> Although a bit awkward to handle at times (for petite ladies or a child&#x27;s hands), it still is the best oral irrigator for travel.  </li>
            <li> More than I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very well used.</li>
            <li> And it is very portable for traveling too.</li>
            <li> But I would not hesitate to recommend anyone who floss much.</li>
            <li> I keep one with the unit ready for battery</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t get through my whole mouth without refilling it).</li>
            <li> My travel one did not work very well</li>
            <li> but I think that would hurt, so probably doesn&#x27;t happen too much.  </li>
            <li> Somehow I like the fast cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much horror stories about oral irrigators not working.</li>
            <li> I really like this compact unit.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use, as there is no cord.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic units have lasted a bit longer but neither brand is very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the way my mouth feels after using this irrigator.  </li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> The unit does work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this water flosser.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as much cleaning power</li>
            <li> The unit is still working very well.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is very efficient and has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> Cheap and simple to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very portable.  </li>
            <li> it really gets into every crevice.</li>
            <li> This one has a much smarter design, no additional accessories needed.  </li>
            <li> Added cleaning gave me very kissable breath in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> This irrigator works very well, is light and compact and portable, and the batteries last me about a month, which is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> But it does do the job and very well.</li>
            <li> It really flushes all debris from your gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> This product really hurt my gums after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> but the battery drains fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact.</li>
            <li> but I must say it works, and works very well.</li>
            <li> The irrigator came with two AA batteries and is very compact.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use mine out of my home.</li>
            <li> The fact that I did so speaks to the product&#x27;s utility and reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> It does use up battery power quite fast as it noticeably gets weaker after about a week.</li>
            <li> Very well designed and compact.</li>
            <li> Eh, too much trouble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i purchased this as a gift because i like mine so much.</li>
            <li> I cannot even stop me from using it very often.</li>
            <li> Use batteries, which is very portable and handy.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Only batteries available.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so I bought another one, figuring that for the price as opposed to Dental Bills its a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> (if I want to be really picky) is that I sometimes have to refill it before I have completed the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This product worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> recommend this for those who have implants and travel a lot as it is very portable.</li>
            <li> So I floss, use the brushpicks and the irrigator (very often with a distilled water / hydrogen peroxide mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I floss, use the brushpicks and the irrigator (very often with a distilled water / hydrogen peroxide mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, this is a highly recommended item!</li>
            <li> Very compact, works like a charm, and uses AA battery replacements.</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;m ordering another one for use when I travel so that I have another one here just for my home bathroom.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this tool.</li>
            <li> but they do not wear out fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used an &amp;#34;oral irrigator&amp;#34; before, so didn&#x27;t really know what features to be looking for...</li>
            <li> the tip isn&#x27;t adjustable, there is no hose, so you&#x27;re holding the whole thing up to your mouth to use it.</li>
            <li> Spring for $40 and get the real Macoy by  Waterpic.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to keep your mouth closed or you will have water spraying all over the place . . .</li>
            <li> and I much prefer it then flossing, so</li>
            <li> so this is very convenient for me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the compact design because you can take it with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My son wants to use it every day now instead of his waterpik at home.</li>
            <li> really like the way this Panasonic water cleaner works.</li>
            <li> It has two speed settings, and both settings really do the job.  </li>
            <li> I never see food particles come out or really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This irrigator is very efficient and has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> Water sprays all over the place even if I hold it very close to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing, though, so no real complaints.</li>
            <li> but this device really does the job.</li>
            <li> and it works very well as an irrigator.</li>
            <li> so both hubby and I can use the unit (if he wants to) and we can keep track of which nozzle is ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for that.</li>
            <li> and I use every night and was felling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He has the countertop waterpick, which is a real machine and not conducive to kids to use, fill the reservoir, etc.  </li>
            <li> Correct and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still compact and does not take up much room on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> It has a two speed pulsating water flow and is very portable.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> This model of the irrigator is very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of pressure to get the job done and very portable.</li>
            <li> At home and at our beach condo I use a Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush (WP-900 )  also purchased through Amazon Smile.  </li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really seem to work real well either way.</li>
            <li> very durable, Item stopped working after I drop it</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I have to hurry too fast or refill.</li>
            <li> The two speed are very helpful.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t feel any benefit by using this irrigator.</li>
            <li> and it really did the trick.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is very good。Customer service is very nice，To</li>
            <li> The water sipped into the battery chamber and blew out the whole unit and batteries in it.</li>
            <li> I really feel the water blasting through between my teeth with this product.</li>
            <li> Very well made portable irrigator.  </li>
            <li> This works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very usefull.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> It worked really well for one year and three months.  </li>
            <li> Still works very slowly--at about 10 percent power.</li>
            <li> Does the job and very portable.</li>
            <li> very portable, thinking of keeping one in the office too.&lt;br /&gt;Speed buttons are a bit tricky to operate while using the flosser.</li>
            <li> I have some problem with my gum and it really helps when i use it consistantly.</li>
            <li> This is probably intentional so there&#x27;s not too much water pressure on your gums.</li>
            <li> But it really helps my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> and it is very portable.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I found that it is very convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very portable and fits into a quart size zip lock bag for travel.  </li>
            <li> Really knocks the food stuff out of my braces.  </li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about using another gadget even though my dentist urged me to purchase this oral irrigator.</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;ve bought another for my braces wearing nephew, and now that the price has been cut</li>
            <li> This Panasonic upgraded irrigator with two speeds is a much improved version of the two others I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Try to get out as much as you can.  </li>
            <li> Then store the unit that way until you&#x27;re ready to use it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t reassemble it again until you&#x27;re ready to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can take it with me everywhere when I travel because it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Goes through batteries much too fast.</li>
            <li> Much easier and faster than flossing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> CLEANS VERY</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH.  </li>
            <li> this really helps, I also carry a bottle of water.</li>
            <li> but for it&#x27;s size it did better than expected.</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is that the tip rotates too easily so it will turn when it just touches a tooth, the tip stayed in place on the older model.</li>
            <li> I have used it only occasionally when portability was desirable and found it to be effective.  </li>
            <li> The main thing is to keep the top of the unit dry after use, so as to help reduce any moisture ingress into the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the somewhat more compact form factor of my ten-year old Panasonic which finally died, but this does the job.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised actually that it had such good power</li>
            <li> Although it is smaller &amp; more portable, it does work nearly as well as another brand that I replaced.</li>
            <li> A complete upper bridge supported by 6 implants, which I love.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine having a 6 year old try to control this unit or even a counter top version made for kids outside of the shower.  </li>
            <li> explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li> At least to me the oral irrigator is proven to be a good replacement for flossing tape and the process takes maybe 1/3 or 1/4 of the time.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read how to clear the water out after use or you&#x27;ll get a musty smell, especially if you store the brush with water in it.</li>
            <li> the power of irrigation will turn to too weak to clean your teeth effectively.</li>
            <li> Initially some discomfort while using, but get used to it pretty quickly</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Oral Irrigator is not meant to be a replacement for the home product, which has a large tank,enabling you to clean your entire tooth surfaces at one time.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without this oral irrigator!Love it so much!</li>
            <li> an open-box item sells at a much higher price than that of a brand new item, Amazon warehouse is misleading  customers.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was the battery and replaced it with a new one.  </li>
            <li> My gums feel healthier and its just plain amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for travelling - folds down quick and stores the nozzle inside.  </li>
            <li> Compared to a standard dental water pick, the capacity to hold water isn&#x27;t as great and there are only 2 settings - low and high -</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to replace batteries which last longer than expected.  </li>
            <li> No bells or whistles, like other brands, just good, solid performance.  </li>
            <li> But to be clear, it replaces neither of those other 2 activities; with each one (brushing, flossing, oral irrigator) providing its own set of  benefits.</li>
            <li> The battery live is very long, one month and even more using it one time a day.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job blasting away debris between my teeth, offers two pressure settings for those with and without sensitive gums, and is small enough to be bring on over-nights and vacations.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly for travel but even for home use it takes up less space and cleans as well as conventional counter top units (less capacity but can be filled more than once if needed) and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> It takes two fillings to clean out her whole mouth, even on the low</li>
            <li> I tried many other brands before settling on the one.</li>
            <li> I wish I had included an order for the second tip along with the original order.</li>
            <li> My experience with the original Water-Pik(tm) is that they are utter pieces of junk!!!  </li>
            <li> I have so many other electrical things plugged in at my vanity area (hair dryer, electric toothbrush, and vanity makeup mirror)</li>
            <li> They were originally purchased 5 years ago and are used daily.  </li>
            <li> The original batteries are still in, although they&#x27;re going to be replaced very shortly.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic lasts longer with better pressure than the other brand.</li>
            <li> I was not so sure before buying this product because it does not look so &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as some other counterparts.</li>
            <li> Probably the most major problem braces wearers have is tiny food bits getting stuck in your teeth that just swishing can&#x27;t dislodge.  </li>
            <li> In that, I agree with many other posters.  </li>
            <li> If you travel with one or more other people and all wish to use the product, you would have to carry the additional heads separately.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you keep the spout in your mouth while turning on and off with your lips closed around it, otherwise you will have spray everywhere!</li>
            <li> The water chamber is very small and the pressure is just not that good.</li>
            <li> Just a little messier than I had expected and not all that easy to handle since it is rather large, but overall pretty good considering the price.</li>
            <li> The water jet is powerful enough to really do the job, and the irrigator is easy to handle with only one hand.  </li>
            <li> The water on high is kind of messy</li>
            <li> Very portable specially for extensive travel.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other similar products, it provides much greater accessibility to clean all the nooks and crevices.</li>
            <li> The stream of water is definitely strong enough for me, and I love the fact that it is portable, and small enough to fit in a purse or overnight bag without having to take apart a large machine.</li>
            <li> so one may need to refill it a second time to thouroughly clean the gum.</li>
            <li> It has helped me reduce the times I need a hygienist to clean my teeth from 3 times a year, back to two.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll obviously want to clean the thing from time-to-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not thoroughly clean between my teeth, as the pressure is so low.</li>
            <li> In additional, it has bigger water container, so I can clean up my teeth in one water charge.</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower daily after dinner while waiting for my moisturizer to kick in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to keep my gums clean.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> Although the fact that it&#x27;s smaller means that I can&#x27;t do my whole mouth with one tank full of water.</li>
            <li> Simple to operate and clean, but sometimes accidentally turning on irrigator while removing water reservoir causes water to spray all over.</li>
            <li> Only takes a minute or two and your mouth feels so clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly amazed at what flossing and brushing miss when I clean with it the Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  </li>
            <li> When you can see the debris (food - yuk) that gets blown out of your teeth, I knew that brushing/flossing wasn&#x27;t getting the teeth clean enough.  </li>
            <li> While you clean your teeth, turn off the product and spit the water out occasionally.</li>
            <li> Panny supplies higher water pressure than the old model but not as  much as my WaterPik (WP100)</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable and miles less noisy than the Waterpick that sounds like a sledge-hummer next to it.</li>
            <li> I use to worry about my breath and use the strips etc, but not anymore because this definitely keeps your mouth clean.</li>
            <li> Small enough to pack in a purse and works great.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t work, and thus cannot be held at any angle that allows you to clean the lingual surfaces of your lower teeth (I suppose it might work on your upper ones as the angle is not so bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel just as clean, if not cleaner, than traditional flossing.  </li>
            <li> Works simply enough: fill the \\&quot;trough\\&quot; with tap water, put the mouth piece in your mouth at the angle to clean around your teeth and turn it on.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> If it held any more water, it would likely be less comfortable to grasp.  </li>
            <li> Simple to operate and clean.</li>
            <li> In short these irrigators just don&#x27;t work for singles living alone in small spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it was discontinued about 4 years ago, I happily used the battery-powered Water Pik Traveler</li>
            <li> A good item for traveling, but find something else for home use if you have serious dental irrigation needs - say for bridgework, etc.</li>
            <li> This one is not as good as the dark blue one that they used to produce.  </li>
            <li> The whole thing collapes for traveling, is the only unit I know of that has replaceable batteries,and with new batteries has a very powerful spray.</li>
            <li> but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling ....just came back from vacation and easy to pack!</li>
            <li> Very portable and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think ultimately this irrigator would do better with a strength setting from 1-10 much like the Waterpik&#x27;s plug-in model, then I wouldn&#x27;t have to experiment so much with different battery combinations.</li>
            <li> so you have to work fast at high stetting.</li>
            <li> The minor and important design flaw is the water tank can&#x27;t be open up to clean inside.  </li>
            <li> Far superior to the Usual Oral B irrigators available in most drug stores which have weak batteries.</li>
            <li> Note that on high speed it is much less powerful than a standard Waterpick but still effective.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing but does the same with water pressure that is pleasant and very effective.  </li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s designed very well, the water capacity is adequate (approx 6 oz), there are two different power settings, fits well in my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reservoir emptied quickly, also, but really couldn&#x27;t be any bigger and still be portable.</li>
            <li> Battery power is strong enough for a complete cleaning.</li>
            <li> The pick is turnable so that you can adjust it at your right angle, but it sits tight enough to not rotate spontaneously.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on reliability or battery life, since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I give this product  5 stars because its cheap, it works well and it lasts a ridiculously long time.  </li>
            <li> It took nearly 5 years to wear out the first one I bought - so I immediately ordered another one.</li>
            <li> got a couple years use from my 1st Panasonic, and then had to buy another one, but it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive compared to the &#x27;professional&#x27; unit the dentist just sold to my s/o for $140, which takes up valuable room on the sink, and which he will never use.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic portable is every bit as effective as Water Pik, if not more so.</li>
            <li> Our first set of batteries lasted nearly a month.  </li>
            <li> While I did read one review that described the awkwardness of having to hold the entire Panasonic unit to use it, I did not find this to be true.  </li>
            <li> Packs up nice and small with place to store pic.</li>
            <li> Small and effective and mobile.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re back to full power.  </li>
            <li> and it closes up into a nice small size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> usually mix a capful of Listermint mouthwash with warm water in the unit.</li>
            <li> One downside is that it is pretty loud, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Not bad for travel, and about the only choice for camping or hiking.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, the work is satisfactory, but water less of it, one can not reach the expected effect, needs a lot of water, carrying in travel is a good choice, the overall situation of it</li>
            <li> Not a very long life for sure, but for travel, I will continue to use my second unit, which was purchased December 2011.</li>
            <li> the top slides down.</li>
            <li> Love the way it folds down</li>
            <li> The top part can be collapsed down into the water reservoir for traveling--with storage space for the tip.  </li>
            <li> The water tank is small, but it&#x27;s easy and quick to refill.  </li>
            <li> The strong jet fills my mouth up quick and I usually end up with a puddle of water on me and on the sink-</li>
            <li> The jet pulse stream is actually stronger than that of my former plug-in, and it has continued to operate strongly on the first set of (2 AA) batteries for about a month.</li>
            <li> It is the first oral irrigator I have, the current is strong enough.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is good size - could be a little bigger</li>
            <li> The reservoir is good size - could be a little bigger</li>
            <li> It is very messy but that may lessen with practice.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering &amp; shipping was quick and easy as I expect with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would like to find a case (soft or hard) to hold it for the times that I travel and to keep it clean and safe.</li>
            <li> They are reasonably priced to be competitive with water pic (methinks), and the quality is above average for sure!</li>
            <li> The new one works very well, also.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a low cost way to keep my daughters new palate expander clean.  </li>
            <li> I found that using it on the lower speed, and with a reasonable speed in moving it along my teeth, a full reservoir is just the right amount of water to cover the front and back of both lower and upper teeth.  </li>
            <li> It works, but not very easy to use without splashing water on yourself, though with practice we are getting better.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try  mostly because it would take up less room on my  crowded bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Top half does not stay in correct position, I had to use electrical tape to hold it in use position.</li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions and aim the water jet at 90 degrees (or slightly towards the top) to your teeth, never forcing water into your gums and you should never have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would have been better if it was slightly cheaper though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s innovative design which occupies less space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked fine at first - and the battery life was acceptable, but then a couple of times after putting in a second battery, the pressure suddenly dropped.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more compact, takes up less space in my bathroom, comes apart for cleaning, and packs a punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist considers it adequate for travel use but not for regular at-home use.</li>
            <li> This is my second panasonic oral irrigator, and this one has much better power than the last.  </li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for one that was portable, didn&#x27;t require charging, and had a decent size reservoir.  </li>
            <li> We bought ehis particular model since we travel often between Germany and the USA.</li>
            <li> The unit had more than enough power with the two different power selections...</li>
            <li> on 2x AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Overall quality is decent.</li>
            <li> ok, that&#x27;s too gross for some of you, but think about it for a second]</li>
            <li> Otherwise, for a &#x27;portable pik&#x27;, it works decent for the AA&#x27;s it runs</li>
            <li> It provides a decent stream of pressurized water that will flush food particles from between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This one is quite powerful and one gets the cleaning accomplished with the water tank that it has and when the power runs low , you can just change the 2 AA batteries that it comes equipped with.</li>
            <li> I use a larger counter top model (different brand) for in-home use.</li>
            <li> so this operates the same and noone realizes how many particles one has beetween teeth before using ,but they are sparking white after</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a, still working but older Panasonic, unit.</li>
            <li> Its water capacity is big enough to hit all of my teeth more than once.</li>
            <li> It holds enough to do one quick cleaning on setting #2.</li>
            <li> but Panasonic cleverly incorporated a way to enclose the stem when the unit is folded for traveling.</li>
            <li> I had an older Water Pik that died.  </li>
            <li> Howver, this is a portable unit and I am using it as my main unit.  </li>
            <li> Over time, I finally adapted and was able to contain the fluid to the sink.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the main reason that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Decent power for my needs.</li>
            <li> The main asset is convenience.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace and oral B portable irrigator (not enough room on bathroom counter top for the bigger one).  </li>
            <li> I will keep my eye open for something better in the future.  </li>
            <li> It pumps with enough force to work as a flosser but runs through batteries quickly (one session, in my case).</li>
            <li> Batteries last a while, but has a noticeable drop in pressure fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as a larger model but works very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this waterpik to take on trips with me particularly overseas.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because I have implants.</li>
            <li> After more than 5 months of almost daily use, I feel my mouth and teeth are actually cleaner.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly now because of my braces.  </li>
            <li> Advantages:  compact, powerful water-jet action, holds plenty of water to enable complete rapid flossing (without having to refill reservoir).</li>
            <li> I got this irrigator when I heard a speaker mention about amazon.com and this product he brought from amazon in particular.</li>
            <li> Replacement for older unit that lasted 5 years</li>
            <li> Not this particular model, but told to get one.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s low price and convenience/portability factor make it a super buy.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is adequate...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a more expensive one would be any better performance-wise but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to purchase this instead of the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> So you have to fill it up 3 times to do anything decent.</li>
            <li> Some people complain that the Waterpik (which is more powerful than this one) is not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Some people complain that the Waterpik (which is more powerful than this one) is not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Operation is straightforward and the reservoir is sufficient, although some people may need to refill it depending on how long they need to run it.  </li>
            <li> With the rechargeables, the irrigator does pump water, but it&#x27;s too weak to do much good.</li>
            <li> But, like so many other things, it has been supersized: the new model is much bulkier than the old one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all the way in your mouth and closing your lips tightly around the nozzle to make sure no water comes out.</li>
            <li> highly recommended, would give it 5 stars if wasn&#x27;t a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, accept no substitutes.</li>

            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The pressure is so high that if you miss your teeth (which you will a lot), it will hit the roof of your mouth, your tongue, and your uvula.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It was just 6.5 inches high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this for folks who have had wisdom tooth problems (food getting stuck in cavities &amp; in between the gums).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Panasonic FW-D110-A.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to go beyond flossing.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> Using regular batteries on this Panasonic Oral Irrigator causes the action to last much much longer and with more power than the WaterPic&#x27;s rechargeable batteries and there are fewer breakable parts.</li>
            <li> the Panasonic was highly rated and I couldn&#x27;t find negatives about it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Panasonic Irrigator.</li>
            <li> device is portable, runs on two AA batteries and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone that travels.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Do not use it on the high setting as you will have to refill every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a teeth cleaning aid after brushing your teeth and flossing.</li>
            <li> I like this model and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I got this after trying &amp;#34;Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator with High Capacity Water Tank by ToiletTree</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive, highly portable teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended for travelers</li>
            <li> It is well-designed, rechargeable, and made of high quality components</li>
            <li> I was in a high altitude area</li>
            <li> Thats is a high tools for cleaning my tooth</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use high output batterys to increase its performance and life.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it for the road warriors.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space but is still pretty strong for its relatively small size.</li>
            <li> Low is less intense pulsing but works effectively.</li>
            <li> As I recently noticed in other reviews, this thing can end up hosting mold that cannot be effectively cleaned/removed from the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine when I use it after showering since everything is wet then anyway.</li>
            <li> I travel quite frequently and I make certain to take this everywhere.</li>
            <li> This was a great tool for me to reach those spots that floss is tough to get to!</li>
            <li> I would have love a little stronger jet but for a traveling unit, this is a well-designed irrigator.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more power from the jet.</li>
            <li> It died after little more than one year.  </li>
            <li> If it held a little more water, I would do 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It does seem a little weaker than the counter model, but not a lot, and still more than sufficient to take care of my needs.</li>
            <li> I love this little dental \\&quot;irrigator\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little better constructed for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Love this little water pick.</li>
            <li> do wish it had a little more strength, but it does do the job</li>
            <li> Could use a little more power but</li>
            <li> Recently, I was very excited to find the Oral Irrigator by Pure Enrichment, $29.99, which uses double A batteries, but I quickly discovered that it had absolutely no water pressure whatsoever</li>
            <li> A small &amp; great product you can keep with you wherever you go ,you&#x27;ll always feel fresh,and it keeps the dentist away...sooo easy to use,just need a small bottle of water &amp; keep a couple of double A batteries and your always ready ...</li>
            <li> The first few days after I was fine.</li>
            <li> Our biggest disappointment are the batteries - it does not come with rechargeable batteries and charger, which I found very surprising.</li>
            <li> I think Panasonic tried hard to make an acceptable portable appliance for cleaning between teeth,  this is a nice try,  but no cigar.  </li>
            <li> It is not as strong as my other unit on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic has created a little marvel: it&#x27;s a snap to use, does a terrific job, and is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Only a dentist, in my Panasonic I use a little hydrogen peroxide too keep the unit disinfected, I had a water pic years ago and more powerful</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish it was a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li> Works great, reservoir could be a little bigger but no big deal.</li>
            <li> I have several troublesome teeth where food frequently gets caught, and as an experiment, I used three full reservoirs worth of water trying to clean these trouble spots.</li>
            <li> Product reduces to small travel size, user friendly, uncomplicated and performs adequately.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective but a bit messy due to the attached reservoir.  </li>
            <li> I give the new unit a 3 star and older model a 4 star, since pulse pressure is of #1 importance.   </li>
            <li> This new unit has two pulsing speeds, rather than one on the older unit, and almost twice the reservoir capacity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also experienced the on/off switch getting difficult to turn.  </li>
            <li> Use a bigger one that I had for everyday use, but this is great for anytime especially travel.</li>
            <li> The pulse action of the water is much stronger and has 2 speeds instead of one.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve not had an irrigator and hesitate to invest in one, this one is great, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> I keep this in my shower, as it is too messy to use in the sink, but I love it.</li>
            <li> but my first impression is that it is really good.right amount of  pressure for daily use..small enuf for travel.easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like panasonic..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  After a few weeks of use, I&#x27;ve managed to not spray water everywhere and am able to keep it off my clothes and just in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> but for it&#x27;s small size, it&#x27;s power is good enough.</li>
            <li> Runs on batteries, but still feels powerful enough to dislodge food stuck in your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple device designed to do one thing and it does it pretty well at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that because it&#x27;s so powerful, water splashes on the mirror.</li>
            <li> this product is well worth buying (especially when you have braces)!</li>
            <li> I think it has been useful especially when I forget to floss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different water flosser devices and this is far and away my favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is useful and convenient for my daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does a good job and is small enough be put into the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty much maintenance-free, using replaceable AA batteries (I used the eneloop ones), and I can get the replacement nozzles at my local departmental</li>
            <li> I feel as though I need to wash the whole unit in hot, soapy water before I set it aside for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simple, durable, powerful, &amp; EZ to use.</li>
            <li> I tried rechargeables, but they weren&#x27;t powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> Except this problem, I have no complaint.</li>
            <li> The thing I like the most is how small it is and how travel ready it is.  </li>
            <li> I figured if I had a unit I could actually put away after each use, it would be worth refilling it once or twice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the Irrigator is doing what it is supposed to do, but it is messy to use.</li>
            <li> Similar to a waterpik, not quite as powerful.</li>
            <li> Not unhappy with it, but not totally overjoyed either.</li>
            <li> you squirt that much water in, you better be leaning over the sink so as not to get the entire front of your shirt soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> I worried at first that mold would grow in the bottom chamber, which never dries out completely, but that hasn&#x27;t happened so far</li>
            <li> I wanted a small unit that did not take up too much space on my counter top.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was so big and pretty much had to keep it out all the time because like they say out of sight out of mind.  </li>
            <li> the WaterPik...not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the same quality as my old one that wore out after many years of use.</li>
            <li> Just have to buy one every few years, until they come up with a better design.</li>
            <li> Its ok but messy.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Even on low setting, the water stream is quite powerful.</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t spray for more than a few seconds, eventually figured out the filler tube in the reservoir</li>
            <li> Even if it lasts only a year, I&#x27;ll consider it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought a WP350 long ago .... was OK but always had to refill water for a cleaning session &#x27;cuz tank couldn&#x27;t hold enough water.  </li>
            <li> I am delighted to have found it for approximately $20 cheaper.</li>
            <li> works OK not a huge amount of pressure</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Good but not great..</li>
            <li> Now if this new unit had speed 1 as high and speed 2</li>
            <li> A little large but works fine.  </li>
            <li> Good cleaner, got the other one on the market and this is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Could ad a little texture to the switch</li>
            <li> The new model has a much larger water reservoir than the old one and a jet stream comparable to a full size WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Small, light, battery operated and strong enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It works great with a full charge but gets weak about near the second or third week of use (I use it once a day)</li>
            <li> Its powerful enough when the battery is new.</li>
            <li> I fill the water container with mostly water and a half cap of mouthwash (against product recommendations) and have had no trouble.</li>
            <li> Note that I drain the water compartment after use and leave its plug open so the compartment can dry out as I believe it is more sanitary.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m home, I find myself using this device instead of my corded model if I need to use it in the middle of the day simply because it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up, I needed a coin to unscrew the battery compartment, then I had to pull out the green water tank, insert the spraying end, fill the tank with water and it was ready to go.</li>
            <li> It only has two settings but the weaker setting it strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> I just use the low intensity since a strong blast of water can actually damage the gums.</li>
            <li> I prefer using it while in the shower, because it can get messy since the water is spraying at a moderately quick and powerful level.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the water stream is moderate, but not what I would call strong.  </li>
            <li> I have to replace them while they still have &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; because they are not providing enough power to produce a strong enough water flow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, is full of water is not enough for half a minute on the run!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small footprint is welcome in a tight bathroom, and it will pack very well to travel.</li>
            <li> it it was about right on the low setting.</li>
            <li> The actual nozzle stays in place to ensure you get the water to the right place.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ignored the negative and focused on the positive.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviews state this device is pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> This makes it possible to clean out your whole mouth by only filling the resevoir once.      </li>
            <li> Just not worth the money for something that breaks so easily,</li>
            <li> It is not easy to use and there should be more speeds than just two.  </li>
            <li> -- floss quickly &amp; effectively without the mess and fuss that one would experience with regular flossing.</li>
            <li> My teeth have just the wrong size gap in a couple of places, and the Panasonic Flosser power spray is very handy to finish what a toothbrush just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted , but after a few month it totally lost power, even with new batteries makes only much noise.</li>
            <li> It is true that the reservoir is limited, but this reviewer did not find this a problem; if needed one an always re-fill and continue.     </li>
            <li> Despite using these various soaps and different power levels, the Panasonic irrigator continues to run fine.</li>
            <li> Because it slides down into the case it is easy to travel with</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold enough water for me to clean my entire (normal sized!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the power that I would like to really blast stuff out of there and the capacity isn&#x27;t large enough for me either.</li>
            <li> There are two speeds and after a few days I think most people will only use the higher one.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is great though for trips because it is so small, not much bigger than a big bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over a month now and so far I have been completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I also own a hydrofloss irrigator, and this little chap simply doesn&#x27;t compare in the pressure department.  </li>
            <li> This thing keeps my braces clean without much hassle, and it folds down into a convenient travel size - which means I can bring it to work on days when I have appts., etc.</li>
            <li> They work great; however, trying to get the top open to replace batteries is nearly impossible; and secondly the batteries do not last but a few weeks at best (if you use it everyday).</li>
            <li> I leave the fill tank plug open to dry and the unit has remained very clean.  </li>
            <li> So you have to buy a new one each two years.</li>
            <li> This is an item I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> It is a toy if compared to Phillips new Airflosser ....  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t live without an oral irrigator this is your model - it can&#x27;t be beat on either the price or quality level.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> The new one can be folded up and operated by battery</li>
            <li> I am new to water flossers.</li>
            <li> or so I figured I&#x27;d  go with a new model.  </li>
            <li> I am on line now looking for a new one, this will not be one of my choices.</li>
            <li> and I have to get used to the feel of the new one.  </li>
            <li> This is an item I can&#x27;t live without now.</li>
            <li> As New Electronics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still works like new, and I use it three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am considering using it as a replacement for my water pik when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> So, I immediately ordered a new one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new version has two speeds and a new replaceable nozzle.  </li>
            <li> I will insert new batteries.</li>
            <li> I must purchase a new unit.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I need new rechargeable batteries as the ones I used</li>
            <li> If you are used to use waterpik irrigator, u can&#x27;t live without this when travelling.</li>
            <li> so I change it,but after replace new batteries stll not working.</li>
            <li> I decided to dispose of it and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I decided it was time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li> After two cycles of battery replacements the unit would not pump water out althoght I had even replaced with new batteries.</li>
            <li> Even after flossing and using my new Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have a new one sent to me in Australia</li>
            <li> so I took hers and ordered her a new one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I put in new batteries</li>
            <li> Thinking it would be resolved with new batteries i exchanged them.</li>
            <li> THEN I WILL WRITE A NEW REVIEW......</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all, even replace the new battery.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of good reviews but the pressure is too low and the water tank does not slip out completely which makes it hard to clean or dry.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using the water pik or any such item.&lt;br /&gt;There was some initial bleeding since I was pointing nozzle right at the gum.</li>
            <li> This battery-operated unit is easy to handle and convenient to store,but it has less power and capacity than wired units.    </li>
            <li> I kept it clean and handled it carefully, as I do.  </li>
            <li> I had previously because this unit uses easy to replace batteries and there is no need to put it on a charger.</li>
            <li> I must of had something on the side when I closed it and that got inside, and was a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised with the power in this simple and powerful water flosser.</li>
            <li> I had their older model which had only one speed and didn&#x27;t hold enough water, so was pleasantly pleased with this one, and would definitely recommend it for travel.</li>
            <li> Powerful even on low setting, so not for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> I find it harder to control and more likely to irritate my gums.  </li>
            <li> And I know that I double check when I open the bottom part that it is secure.</li>
            <li> even more so when using it so be careful not to take it out of your mouth until after you shut it off as, although it sounds like it is done, it isn&#x27;t necessarily and you may end up squirting the wall, mirror or floor!</li>
            <li> and it sure could push out all the little bits of whatever between the teeth!  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t do for regular use, because the reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to clean all teeth at the high pressure setting.  </li>
            <li> you use this thing I feel after brushing becomes very clear.</li>
            <li> Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator with High Capacity Water Tank by ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a very old Panasonic Irrigator.  </li>
            <li> This irrigator was purchased to replace a very old style of oral irrigator.</li>
            <li> i actually like it very much</li>
            <li> And if you have a piece of wire or small enough brush to fit into/through the Jet Pik, use that too, to help clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it have a 0.5 speed.&lt;br /&gt;Speed 1 makes a mess all over with the strong jets.</li>
            <li> It takes up very little space on the counter top, and you don&#x27;t have to plug it in.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space on the counter and the water chamber is not an issue for me, just add more water.</li>
            <li> Portable ,small, easy to use, and works very well  </li>
            <li> It has 2 power settings, and the water pressure is adequate, not only for a battery operated unit, but for a water flosser in general.</li>
            <li> It has 2 power settings, and the water pressure is adequate, not only for a battery operated unit, but for a water flosser in general.</li>
            <li> have been complaints about the unit failing after a short period of time and parts breaking; my unit is very new, but - if it lasts a reasonable length of time, I&#x27;ll just replace it - the unit isn&#x27;t covered by warranty in Australia and</li>
            <li> beats them clearly!   </li>
            <li> Overall I believe this is a product I would have bought first if I&#x27;d not had to stay with the Water-Pik</li>
            <li> The first one wore out after 3 years of constant use.</li>
            <li> When I finally found someone who could order the pricer was much higher.  </li>
            <li> I have finally replaced the batteries for the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact, so I&#x27;ll be able to take it along when I travel.</li>
            <li> However, learn to keep your finger near the switch button since the water will squirt all over you once you move the mouth piece away from your mouth!  </li>
            <li> I first came across an advertisement in 2009 on the use of Oral Irrigator which sells the idea of an alternate replacement to flossing.</li>
            <li> Not knowing what exactly happens, I attributed this to my luck and make a second purchase in May 10.</li>
            <li> I am able to relate what other users complain on the short batteries life in Waterpik which affect the reliabilities of the product.</li>
            <li> yes, the batteries have to be replaced but to me that is a small expense to be able to do what a toothbrush cannot do.  </li>
            <li> So, I tossed it in the trash and ordered another one (yes, exact same model).  </li>
            <li> I can not believe it  and you will not either ,I first  saw this  item in a magazine  then several magazines .</li>
            <li> Using regular batteries is a lot better then having to recharge proprietary batteries which only last a year or two</li>
            <li> I first purchased the waterpik cordless at double the price and had problems with it.  </li>
            <li> Replacement unit (probably refurbished) received December 11, 2012 and subsequently used for short intervals on five more travel trips over next 15 months.</li>
            <li> The first two units I owned were the predecessor model with the darker blue color.</li>
            <li> On my first unit, the motor progressively lost power after a year or so of daily use.     </li>
            <li> Not only it is better for your wallet, but they last 10 times longer than regular batteries.</li>
            <li> In the past I have had a Waterpik plug-in oral irrigator taking up more counter space than I care to spare.  </li>
            <li> Love that it can be compressed into a small carrier and that it works so well.  </li>
            <li> I am still on the first set of batteries--AA alkaline--after several months.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like this as much as my regular plug-in irrigator overall, but this one is much more transportable, obviously, and it works well.  </li>
            <li> IT IS USED DAILY, AND HAS NEVER FAILED.  </li>
            <li> I used it, and it seemed to do the trick pretty well until I went back to the orthodontist and discovered this irragator wasn&#x27;t as thorough as I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to thread the floss with a threader loop several times, and frankly, I&#x27;m not that ambitious</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 pressure and is generally quite gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this irrigator, I had fluid all over the sink and counter because I was not used to using it.  </li>
            <li> I would say my device is the exact opposite</li>
            <li> We ordered an extra set of tips because the original order came with only one.  </li>
            <li> Getting an extra since like it so much!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 1 year and the 2nd</li>
            <li> My first one stopped working after about 1 hour of use and the last one after about 3 hours of use (over 3 years).  </li>
            <li> I like this product - it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, as long as you have fresh batteries in it.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a learning curve sprayed the bathroom mirror first time, and I don&#x27;t think it is a sharable item, we will be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> Taking stars out because the tip seems to be pretty fragile, they need to see how waterpik make theirs.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it overall- worth the price!</li>
            <li> Make sure to buy a big bulk of QUALITY batteries as you may need to replace them every other month or so.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Oral Irrigator  worked exactly as advertised - took it on Safari and to 5 different countries</li>
            <li> My first finally wore out after 3-4 yrs of service.</li>
            <li> No complaint, so far.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted for 4 years with daily use.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find it was battery operated!  </li>
            <li> I was using the low setting at first</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used other products with Eneloop batteries, specially a waterproof shaver, my older Conair dental irrigator and never had a problem with these batteries, so I take the risk and use it with these batteries because this thing eats batteries alive.</li>
            <li> I personally felt the higher speed was a little too strong, so stuck with the slower one.  </li>
            <li> Could spray a little harder but very nice overall.</li>
            <li> The nozzle swivels around a little which makes it easy to reach the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li> but the flow is a little strong.</li>
            <li> Even on the high setting the jet stream is mild compared to other products.  </li>
            <li> The water &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; holds enough water to clean my entire mouth, no need to refill it.</li>
            <li> Bought the Wateerpik big portable and didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t have enough force to clean my teeth and gums</li>
            <li> the only problem - which I now know, is to clean the outside of the container before packing it up.  </li>
            <li> It collapses down to fit in my toiletry kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this has a nice water jet with 2 speeds and works well,  but its a little hard to clean thoroughly</li>
            <li> I need to always have an oral irrigator close to me due to my dental pockets and the resulting severe consequences if I don&#x27;t clean them out in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> It is a good travel water pick, but the pressure is not strong enough compared to a regular one.</li>
            <li> The high setting is too much for me, so I use it on low.  </li>
            <li> I retired my old Panasonic and purchased a new one -so</li>
            <li> I live in a 100 year old home</li>
            <li> As far as water pressure, on a new battery</li>
            <li> Gave it less than 5 stars because the reservoir needs to be re filled for a longer wash .</li>
            <li> Gets very scummy inside over time and there&#x27;s not a really easy way to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to carry and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and my mom and i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Wow, the stuff I first got out was gross.</li>
            <li> As an adult with braces in the past two years I became fanatical about keeping my mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li> Running a strong solution of bleach through the system for a few seconds cleared that problem, but after 10 years</li>
            <li> The top where you insert battery is hard to open and close for the first time users.</li>
            <li> and I was not getting positive dental check ups after multiple trips.</li>
            <li> It is quite long once extended, so if you are short, you might not be able to bend over your sink and use this device, but I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and have no problems with it.</li>
            <li> it was exactly as described and the battery life seems to last pretty long.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the fact that it &amp;#34;collapses&amp;#34; small enough to fit in my medicine chest or suitcase!  </li>
            <li> Even though the manual stated that some people might get gum bleeding during their first few usage, I was fortunate enough not to be one.</li>
            <li> My first irrigator (same model) lasted several years and was still working very well.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice device but the water jett force is weak.</li>
            <li> My husband had new crowns and dental implants recently and this really gets in and cleans the area well.</li>
            <li> I experienced some slight gum bleeding on that first use as well, possibly because of using it wrong until I got comfortable with it, but from the second time I used it there was no bleeding.</li>
            <li> Japanese are such smart people!!</li>
            <li> Pros for the Panasonic: easily replaced AA batteries, larger reservoir than the WaterPik while being partially collapsible for travel.</li>
            <li> At home I keep it downstairs for a quick cleaning without having to go back up to use the larger waterpik.</li>
            <li> The suction from the motor drawing out the water from the blue tank causes it to kind of close down on itself in the middle of you using it.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be comparably as powerful as the Waterpik Ultra counter-top model (on moderate settings) that I purchased at the same time, as long as the batteries are kept fresh.  </li>
            <li> Once I got used to it, I can floss in one fill with no mess!</li>
            <li> If you are satisfied with the low setting, you could replace the batteries less frequently.</li>
            <li> Fits in the right amount of water for a single use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WATER RESEVOIR  IS LARGE ENOUGH.....</li>
            <li> It has two speeds, low and high, but I &#x27;ve been using high speed exclusively.</li>
            <li> worked well but a little cumbersome when filled - do not know how to fix the problem</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and so far it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> After I use my Sonicare toothbrush and think my mouth is clean, I irrigate and watch the food particles missed by brushing swirl down the drain.</li>
            <li> Dry outside on clean towel, shake out as much water as you can from container part, set out on clean towel in dry area to air dry</li>
            <li> It gets the job done although I imagine the larger ones have a little more force.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Love to add a little mouthwash to the water, but I may find that clogs the scope in the future as well.</li>
            <li> I love that this little oral irrigator is low tech.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars is because I wish there was one more stronger setting to remove really hard to remove stuff.</li>
            <li> I used the original portable waterpic and found it didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Used on two vacation trips, the second of which significant motor slow down and minimal water pressure issues were experienced.</li>
            <li> Other than it&#x27;s limited reservoir, I just love this irrigator.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic clearly makes improvements based on the Customers wishes.</li>
            <li> However, she was quite clear that it is not a replacement for flossing.  </li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;ve gotten half of my mouth clean, the instrument is so covered with&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;water</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I don&#x27;t have to use boring flossing any more on my gums.</li>
            <li> Although  the tank appears clear of water, it should be placed in a sealed plastic bag when packing for&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see what Amazon says about refunding it since it clearly did not last a reasonable period of time.</li>
            <li> The reservoir holds enough water that I can do my whole mouth without refilling.</li>
            <li> I was just going to buy the old standby for $60 or $70 when this product caught my eye.</li>
            <li> and so far it has been running well.</li>
            <li> and so far.. its been a reliable brand for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this as I find flossing very time consuming especially for my case where the growth of my wisdom tooth traps food particles every time I eat.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My dentist is very insistent on the use of some such dental hygiene instrument, so I dutifully went to the store and bought the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; hand held oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li> :   Has 2 setting for sensitive gums and nubie users.  </li>
            <li> but they were a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> This irrigator fulfilled that with its short, straight tube.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> After several years of paying too much for Waterpik, I then tried a Profloss 4190 Waterflosser for $19.99.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Buy  &#x27;Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser (WP-440)&#x27; by Waterpik</li>
            <li> I used the curved nozzle tip to gently move the tube outside of the chamber.  </li>
            <li> I decided to  check this out at Amazon just to see if they had it ,they did and wow was it</li>
            <li> still can not  get over how much  I saved ,I saved a total of $23.00 without shipping,from Amazon</li>
            <li> Battery has lasted 3 weeks so far with every day use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like the Panasonic Oral Irrigator and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> So far the irrigator has had no problem pumping this \\&quot;soap\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s seriously loud in comparison and</li>
            <li> that they don&#x27;t collapse and spray water everywhere, but not so far apart that the hose inside the reservoir stops working</li>
            <li> so you might have to refill the tank two or three times to complete your cleaning.</li>
            <li> I gave away my bigger one because it took up too much room, and was a pain to deal with.</li>
            <li> Just be mindful that if you have just returned from the dentist and your gums are sensitive that you may feel some discomfort.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir does take a couple of filling to completely rinse out the debris.  </li>
            <li> I have multiple crowns and bridges it my mouth, and my gums are always swollen no matter how much i brush or floss</li>
            <li> Runs on two AA cells, so completely self-contained.  </li>
            <li> I unexpectedly found I like batteries</li>
            <li> Water capacity is modest, but sufficient.</li>
            <li> The entire unit is hand held and battery operated making it very convenient to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Mine completely didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Old one lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the water force of my old Water Pic</li>
            <li> so there is no plug near the sink.</li>
            <li> This thing starts up immediately, and even the directions recommend keeping it running until the water has completely drained after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needs frequent sterilization from bacteria build up.</li>
            <li> (so far)</li>
            <li> It is really convenient for travel, and I always take a couple extra batteries with me in case I run out of power.</li>
            <li> really like the collapsing design and the solid construction.  </li>
            <li> This appears to be designed for adult use.  </li>
            <li> Now if I can remember to direct it into my mouth!?&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> but if it is used frequently the batteries need changing often.  </li>
            <li> The level 2 is even stronger than level 10 in the corded water flosser \\&quot;Waterpik WP-660 Aquarius Professional Water Flosser\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t kept a record exactly how long batteries last, maybe 2 months, but when I change them, I take it apart, clean it and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> It arrived the same day that i ordered it, had plenty of pep, and really did the job.</li>
            <li> Too early to see how this one will do.</li>
            <li> So far, I can&#x27;t find any cons.</li>
            <li> and I prefer floss, so far.  </li>
            <li> In combination with a sonic toothbrush and standard flossing, it did a great job of helping me to avoid an expected 2nd round of root planing.</li>
            <li> old irrigator gave out after 5 years of travel-only use.</li>
            <li> My son is using it daily and really enjoys the massage of the water.  </li>
            <li> I owned and used the old Panasonic Oral Irrigator for two or three years</li>
            <li> So far it has lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Today it died completely.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that I&#x27;m still practicing with it, and soaking the whole bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for nearly a year</li>
            <li> As an adult I have bracers now, since I can afford them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old water pik started leaking into the battery case</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> The spray is not forceful enough to really do the job and the batteries need to be replaced often.</li>
            <li> reviewing from a mature woman&#x27;s perspective.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 yr old son who has braces and its alot easier for him to use than floss.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m an old pro.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, battery operated and totally portable.  </li>
            <li> , you have to refill it several times to do your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> Cleans teeth and mouth completely</li>
            <li> I know it is supposed to be gentler on the gums to use these units at a lower pressure, but this seemed really too low for me</li>
            <li> Obviously, it does not hold much water either, but</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has an expander.  </li>
            <li> When my grandson developed cavities, I sent him one of these.</li>
            <li> B006609MBG Epic Dental</li>
            <li> &amp; I really like that it uses regular AA batteries</li>
            <li> ; it means that if I&#x27;m out and about and the batteries are dead, I can use batteries available anywhere to get it going again.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik has much gentler options that actually let me use it on the lingual/palatal surfaces of my teeth, whilst this oral irrigator must be held upright else</li>
            <li> I am really surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li> only drawback is I really don&#x27;t know when to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> If your gums that are sensitive to a jet of water, there could  be something happening there that may require attention, and you can alert your dentist or hygienist to take a</li>
            <li> May have to fill twice to do a complete job.</li>
            <li> It is completely mobile and collapses when emptied and even provides storage for the tip when collapsed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like not having to recharge, worry with a water device near a plug, etc.  </li>
            <li> Also, take it apart after each use and lay on a paper towel near the sink...</li>
            <li> I like the 2 speed action.  </li>
            <li> have since purchased the device locally and really do like it</li>
            <li> I go; not just on my frequent business trips but even for a day out in the city, for example.</li>
            <li> A portable water pic was recommended by my dental para professional.  </li>
            <li> So far I like this.  </li>
            <li> and I did worry about the mold issue as there really isn&#x27;t any way to keep that lid open without laying it on its side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be subjective but it seems the battery life is longer than with the old version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, it has fulfilled all our expectations.</li>
            <li> must be conscious when the performance reduces, as when to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> This fits the bill completely.</li>
            <li> but so far the batteries have lasted well anyway.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 12 year old son who has braces.  </li>
            <li> love this water pick no tangling of tubing had for at least 2 years</li>
            <li> For the price of nearly $40</li>
            <li> So far it works quite well.</li>
            <li> I am using it so far at home, but it&#x27;ll go abroad with me soon...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on the gums and taking all debris out, in just one minute.</li>
            <li> I am a dental professional and had never used Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my 8 year old grandson who has orthodontics.</li>
            <li> Runs on batteries completely cordless.</li>
            <li> Had to recharge the WP360 unit frequently ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using panasonic irrigators for years, this model is lightweight, portable, uses 2 AA batteries, has 2 settings (for sensitive gums)</li>
            <li> I threw away a waterpik a year ago because it was such a hassle, took up too much space, needed to be primed all the time.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 12 years old daughter, for her braces.</li>
            <li> I took this item on a recent trip and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> far as cleaning the water chamber, I have yet to find out how.</li>
            <li> But none compare to the old 350W with respect to power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the currently-available travel models</li>
            <li> have done away with the hose and attach the tip directly to the battery case atop the reservoirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was actually looking for something very compact for traveling, however</li>
            <li> It is sensitive to the angle you hold it at</li>
            <li> Works as well as my old plug in model.</li>
            <li> I love how it can remove the trapped particles between my teeth in an instant!</li>
            <li> After 5 months of regular use it stopped charging and will no longer charge the unit so it is only useful for a doorstop.</li>
            <li> The thing I like the most is that the reservoir and the motor section come apart so that it can be completely dried out prior to storing.  </li>
            <li> This system is the greatest way of cleaning between your teeth without having to use complicated and messy floss</li>
            <li> tank full of water doesn&#x27;t last for long</li>
            <li> The newer design is sleeker and doesn&#x27;t have a cap on top that only trapped water and invited mold.  </li>
            <li> Makes you feel like your own dentist, without all the BS and assistant jabbing the back of your mouth with the saliva sucker.</li>
            <li> Not quite as powerful a water jet as I expected, but the unit works</li>
            <li> As to be expected, using the product is messy, but it has proven to be reliable and effective.</li>
            <li> The irrigator was good at removing food, but not perfect -- I had to use the Waterpik at home to get rid of the deeper stuff (including the plaque stuck just under my gumline).    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pressure is not as good</li>
            <li> Not very powerful to clean between teeth properly, but not very weak either.</li>
            <li> The switch is easy to maneuver- slow, high, and off.  </li>
            <li> Gross, I found black mold growing in the tank and Panasonic does not know how to clean this unit and told me I need to buy another!</li>
            <li> The water stream is not powerful enough to fully clean one&#x27;s teeth, particularly if one has braces.</li>
            <li> This is small enough to carry in my purse and was very helpful when I first got my braces and was very self conscious, particularly in situations when eating out.  </li>
            <li> The new Panasonic irrigator has a battery compartment and electrodes similar to the previous model (EW1270AC), so I&#x27;m sure the same comments apply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received my second one of these little waterpiks, finally wore out the first one after many years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> I can only use the low speed when the batteries are fresh; high speed with fresh batteries might loosen a few fillings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Low speed is a nice option for dispensing ACT or other mouthwash to the gum line, but the reservoir is so small that you must work very quickly - note the instructions suggest to use only water and to always empty the unit after use).</li>
            <li> It is small, compact and packs easily.</li>
            <li> Next issue is water seeping through the unit when I clean upper left side of the mouth.</li>
            <li> The reservoir chamber is small, yes, but it can be easily refilled.</li>
            <li> Small and compact, this irrigator is easy to use and and store.  </li>
            <li> Relatively small and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> strong stream, small design, and</li>
            <li> This is very good while it lasted, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Helps to clean out the little pockets between the gum line and the teeth, which no amount of brushing will do.</li>
            <li> -No cords, therefore no tangle and no need to find a plug  -no base station and no un-serviceable internal batteries to wear out  -Small footprint  -plenty of power  -very compact when collapsed  -tip protected when collapsed  </li>
            <li> My advice is, if you want something that really does the job, go a little higher end.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little or maybe a little more than a little Messy,over all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can get by with one tank full of water on the low speed, but usually fill up the tank again for use on the higher speed.</li>
            <li> With this portable model, I can take it in the shower, so no mess, and</li>
            <li> the other reviewers battery claims you need fresh alkali</li>
            <li> good quality but the water tank is a little bit small.</li>
            <li> Two speeds make it even more desirable then single speed on my previous irrigator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works, but it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power as an electric one and the battery live is not terribly long.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted years until the pump started to loose power.  </li>
            <li> After all, if you&#x27;re going to let your engineers rather than your marketing people name your product, it&#x27;s pretty clear that you&#x27;re placing a high premium on functionality and somewhat less of an emphasis on form.  </li>
            <li> The irrigator also seems to have opened up the areas between the teeth since the tape is now getting in between the teeth a little easier (has never happened in several years of just flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to use (got it going without even reading the instructions) and the tank lasts for half the mouth (meaning for ex. lower teeth, front and back) at the slower speed, which for me is not a problem since the tank is so easy to fill up.</li>
            <li> You know how effective it is when you use it between your back molars and can smell the bacteria as they are cleansed out - disgusting but very reassuring - better out than in!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to clean teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li> It works fine and can collapse to be fairly small for packing.  </li>
            <li> Need to clean it everyday.</li>
            <li> It does clean your teeth, but too messy.</li>
            <li> I guess that was too much because now it only has half the power with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> There are only two settings and I only tried out the higher one.  </li>
            <li> Only caution, use the low speed at first until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> , this is overall a decent product for the price point and the added convenience of travel utility.&lt;br /&gt;Runs</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s quick: less than a minute.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll keep it, just wished it was the same as the older one.</li>
            <li> The older model was made in Japan, and this is a Chinese product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 2014:  </li>
            <li> And it shortly became my main irrigator, as the Waterpik collects dust somewhere in a closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty big, but much smaller than a mains-operated unit.</li>
            <li> Battery life is decent and manual states use Alkaline only, although rechargeable do work.</li>
            <li> Taking with travel and expect no less.</li>
            <li> Getting food trapped in my teeth at lunch breaks was becoming a big problem for me.</li>
            <li> (usually fill the reservoir twice to make sure I get the entire mouth covered).  </li>
            <li> The first batteries lasted about 6 months, the second set 3 months and the last set not even a month.</li>
            <li> it came with is different than the main Waterpik one.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a decent amount but as they weaken the force of the water decreases as well.</li>
            <li> This irrigator should be conevenient for those who travel because the top part can be pushed down into the water reservoir when empty, for compactness.</li>
            <li> By the third usage(and clean up), I knew I wanted to return it, and thought due to the nature of the product that it would be nonreturnable.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of the same irrigator from you; however, it is extremely dificult to clean water receptacle without dismantling the item.  </li>
            <li> I would say the high setting on this unit is about equal to 5 or 6 on my Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> The pressure is so high that unless you close your mouth entirely, it will spray everywhere.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time in a thorough packaging, though I believe the high quality of its plastic would not require such a thoroughness.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Irritator actually jet out high velocity water and washes away the food residue.</li>
            <li> Like the high low feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are two settings, low and high.</li>
            <li> Ultimately as you get used to the pressure, you&#x27;ll use high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this model over my last irrigator, the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W.</li>
            <li> It has two settings, high and low.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a fairly long time and I like the fact that the attachment stores right inside the item while it&#x27;s collapsed.</li>
            <li> I am going to switch to a little more expensive flosser and an electric one to see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> little vaseline or similar lubricant on the O rings every few months is also a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously purchased anther product by ToiletTree, it didn&#x27;t last a year and dint have a sound design.  </li>
            <li> I leave the cap open after I use the irrigator to make sure it stays dry and doesn&#x27;t have a chance for mold or other odors to form.  </li>
            <li> I actually have only been using the lower power level as the other one is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fast, even after brushing, sometimes small pieces of stuff are washed loose (</li>
            <li> Vary simple design, less to break down love it!</li>
            <li> I tried it on several trips out of town and it really works well, great water pressure but not too much to be painful.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long time, and it cleans out very well.  </li>
            <li> Not really as good as the countertop Waterpik that has many settings.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I was getting ready for a week long vacation &amp; decided to give this portable a try.</li>
            <li> So even though it&#x27;s not perfect, I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li> The switch needs to be redesigned to not only to fit into the existing cavity but a larger thumb push is needed, because of the amount of water splashing about the hands are wet</li>
            <li> Still, the minor issues aren&#x27;t very problematic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked at any negative reviews for this irrigator because I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with it, despite being nervous about making the great leap from string</li>
            <li> as title, and much cheaper than here, but not use it frequently as not get used to it yet.</li>
            <li> Normal alkaline batteries seem to last around a month</li>
            <li> It has 2 power setting, and I normally use the low power, should be enough for normal usage.</li>
            <li> I normally use the irrigator after I bush and floss my teeth, as the final finishing touch.  </li>
            <li> They have made a few improvements, including a two stage power switch if you don&#x27;t want to run it full blast.  </li>
            <li> For travel use, the nozzle can be stored in the small indented space in the side of the upper unit - it is a tight fit, but I did manage to fit it into the space.  </li>
            <li> It takes up very little space and is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Kids could have fun shooting the water at each other!</li>
            <li> The resevoir is large enough to irrigate my entire mouth.</li>
            <li> However, this unit will not replace my vanity top one as the pressure is not adequate for long term daily use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a user friendly, nifty little gadget that gets the job done without a fuss!</li>
            <li> now takes me less than a minute to floss my teeth, and I can tell you the tartar build up has been significantly reduced in just this short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Despite the warning against using rechargable batteries, I went ahead and starting using NiMH rechargeable AA batteries, but I noticed the unit wasn&#x27;t pumping as hard as with the alkaline, and so I had even more difficulty getting the daytime plaque removed.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough to blast food out in hard to reach places like the back molars, water capacity is adequate and also retracts to a compact size for travel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I buy a new product, I actually expect it to work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The new one is about the same size</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see forking out a lot of $$ for a new big klunky WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Although it took quite a while, once I actually reached the Panasonic Customer Service Department, they replaced my irrigator with a new one.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s with twice, sometimes three times daily use, but you can hear the difference in the pump between when they were new and now.  </li>
            <li> This new one is bigger and gives a longer irrigation time and it even has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;After a bit more than a year of using this, some mold has appeared in the water compartment, which is impossible to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-designed and easy to use, and a AA battery lasts at least a month, in my experience.</li>
            <li> Cleaning - simply dump water out from hole, wash outside with soap and water, fill hole with a bit of clean water, spray it until empty, pull unit apart, wash with soap and water, detatch tip, wash with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I worry that this doesn&#x27;t dry very thoroughly between uses though...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think it is worth the trouble having it fixed.  </li>
            <li> i really needed an oral irrigator as my last 2 became inoperable because of the same defunct part.</li>
            <li> I suspect the device will help maintain oral hygiene, but don&#x27;t count on it being anywhere near as powerful as a plug in model, and don&#x27;t count on it to remove all trapped food particles.     </li>
            <li> I had a Water-Pik several years ago that took up too much counter space, and also quit working after several months</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my tiny bathroom and you can&#x27;t beat the feeling of cleaning your teeth with such a device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using this one because my regular one trips the electric outlet I&#x27;m using now, and it&#x27;s much easier to transport this one around, obviously.  </li>
            <li> but now has 2 speed and improve connection for the tip but slightly less powerful jet.</li>
            <li> I have one and have purchased at least five more as gifts for friends over 50 who are starting to have gum issues.</li>
            <li> Problem is that a fresh set of batteries lasted less than a week.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this unit for our 6 year old who is having some early orthodontic work done to try to avoid future problems.  </li>
            <li> Also the hygienist had much less trouble doing the cleaning - she usually has to be pretty forceful between the teeth, but today was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who recently got braces,it works very well for that,be carefull though this thing is powerfull and can hurt if not used properly</li>
            <li> [because 2 others failed within a year and they were good enough to replace]</li>
            <li> I used this at least once a day during my two week vacation and the battery is still working strong</li>
            <li> Super messy.</li>
            <li> The unit seems a little big at first, but I got used to it very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I selected the first of two power settings because the second setting was a little too much for my gums.</li>
            <li> However, I always had to watch the dial to stay at the right low and high points that I later found other family members of mine also use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Panasonic oral irrigator to take along during an extended European trip--and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> It does run out of water fast on the higher speed, but only takes a few seconds to re-fill and finish.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one I have owned, the first one last a little of 18 months, which is why I do not rate this higher.</li>
            <li> But for me as an often traveling person, there is no other possibility.</li>
            <li> last a long time, powerful enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> sure how long the batteries last, but I&#x27;ve used it every day for a few weeks and no sign or change in water pressure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other product to compare them to because this is my first oral irrigator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m due for a dental appointment, I&#x27;m interested to see the results.</li>
            <li> This was our first oral irrigator and chose it because of other reviews.</li>
            <li> NOT small enough.</li>
            <li> Also, it is small enough to easily pack in my overnight bag.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and small enough to take with you when you head out to dinner or to someone&#x27;s home for dinner.  </li>
            <li> Reservoir is small, but so easy to refill, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it is hard to shut off and easy to go from low to high but not low to off.  </li>
            <li> I initially believed the spray wasn&#x27;t as powerful, but I put my regular plug-in irrigator side-by-side outside and the spray distance was the same.  </li>
            <li> i just ordered a new one, after trying an oral irrigator by toilettree products ([[ASIN:B00E6AR2J2 2nd Generation Professional Rechargeable ToiletTree]] which died on me after only two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it on the airplane with no trouble, and used it a few times a day for a month and a half while traveling.</li>
            <li> A powerful little water flosser.</li>
            <li> battery power makes it such that if it&#x27;s low in power, you can just switch a battery and get full power restored, rather than waiting 12 hours or so for a charge in those other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, to use this product, you have to slide it open, fill the reservoir, close the reservoir lid, hold the product vertically by both the top and bottom halves, keep them separated, put your head in the sink bowl, activate the device&#x27;s power without even being able to see it, then awkwardly spray the product around inside your mouth, frequently hitting and damaging the roof of your mouth and your uvula, occasionally choking and gagging when the high pressure spray goes down your throat, and having water occasionally spray</li>
            <li> is powerful and I clean it by soaking in a deep narrow plastic cup with water and a little bleach.</li>
            <li> It has two power settings, at first the low was almost too high, then after a little use (the battery voltage dropped) and</li>
            <li> I would have made a video, but you really don&#x27;t want to see all the little bits of food that the Panasonic Oral Irrigator removed after normal dental</li>
            <li> on the first use the water container leaked a little - something I&#x27;d never seen before on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little unit is really nice in that it folds up small for travel..</li>
            <li> The water pressure, even at the high #2 setting is pitifully low, compared to, say, a Waterpik or similar electronic type.</li>
            <li> Only two speed settings - mid or high.</li>
            <li> I wish there was an extra setting, between the high and low, because I find myself between extremes.</li>
            <li> At first I had a little strange feeling when I used this irrigator, but now I very like it:</li>
            <li> This implement can be a little messy to use at times, but it does generate a powerful stream of water that can be quite useful in cleaning debris from between your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> generally takes 2 fills per cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit collapses into a small enough size to fit into my cosmetic bag, so I can take it on extended trips without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> something you can&#x27;t do when only a small hole is available for filling and draining.</li>
            <li> It works really well and holds enough water for one long water floss.</li>
            <li> The instructions were simple yet clear.  </li>
            <li> Better than bulky full -sized one that sits on counter and looks ugly.</li>
            <li> Our old Waterpic finally fell apart after years of service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised my dentist never recommended such a product.</li>
            <li> far I have tried only 1 as my gum bleed at the end of the water</li>
            <li> This product barely gets the job done but burns up batteries in the process.  </li>
            <li> It barely pulsates and water does not come out.  </li>
            <li> just be careful not to aim at your gum, it really hurts.</li>
            <li> I have to fill it twice to complete upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this water flosser about two months ago only to have it die completely.  </li>
            <li> The only inconvenience is that I have to refill the water tank twice to complete cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this for 3+ weeks on the same 2 AA batteries and it works well.  </li>
            <li> So far it works well, enough to get the gunk between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Although it is recommended not to use rechargeable batteries, I have done so at times, and have had no problems with this so far (4 months of daily usage).  </li>
            <li> I feel like it gives me a solid minute to two minutes of thorough flossing action.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one (model ES1270) that finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the unit overall.  </li>
            <li> As an adult with braces, it is a necessity to get food out of my teeth, especially at work.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want one of those old water piks where you have to set them up, fill a big container, and they take up counter space.</li>
            <li> Apparently the unit is so waterproof that you can not access the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I only tried it once so far -- to see how it compares to my plug-in Waterpik Waterflosser.</li>
            <li> Despite the negatives I see in the Panasonic, I would recommend it because the Waterpiks simply die young.</li>
            <li> but barely.</li>
            <li> No comments as to the longevity, as it&#x27;s only a month old.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my ten year old daughter who has braces.  </li>
            <li> Despite daily emptying and cleaning the inside casing developed blackish mold.  </li>
            <li> pressure is definitely much stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Having used 5 different oral irrigators and this one by far out preforms even those in the $50 to $100 price range.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Learned after a couple of trips to remove the batteries completely - unless you can figure out a way to keep it vertical the entire time you are in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two Panasonics I&#x27;ve had died after about one year.  </li>
            <li> I gave this oral irrigator a solid 5-star rating because it did exactly what I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> If is not clear how old a child should be to use it without adult</li>
            <li> This one should be used along with regular normal floss...not an alternative of regular floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid the 123 people who gave this contraption a 4 or 5 star review, seem to have no clue as to what a good dental irrigator is all about.</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as some of the plug in models and I do not use it for everyday home use.</li>
            <li> It was catching all the debris without fail.</li>
            <li> bought this because my full size &amp;#34;Hydrofloss&amp;#34; product is too big and heavy to travel</li>
            <li> I would prefer the pressure to be a little higher, and it is slightly bulky, but it seems to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Which means that if you were to set the product down on the counter while it is full of water, the two pieces of it would slide back together, draining the entire reservoir onto the counter.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful waterpik, and small enough for travel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Think this unit is sipping water with a straw, so you need to keep the bottom of the irrigator always down and figure out how to clean every single space between your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get it right, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> when full extended for use, sometimes the unit does not lock firmly enough and slides back slightly when switched on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last, but it is still pumping strong after everyday use for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Recently I read a review where the user said that hers was losing its power, even put in new, or different,  batteries, with no change in performance.</li>
            <li> It also ran out of water relatively quickly (I get it, the reservoir can&#x27;t be huge or it&#x27;d be really awkward and cumbersome to hold) -- between that</li>
            <li> it is easy and much too complicated with the waterpick.</li>
            <li> I have a full size water pick, but it takes time to get out set-up and such a short tube from machine to handle, plus I have to stand there at the sink, making a bit of a mess as water squirts every where.  </li>
            <li> I can live with this minor quirk</li>
            <li> You can order parts if needed over time, however I figure its cheaper in the long run to just purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than I thought, and doesn&#x27;t hold enough water (you will have to refill it at least twice), but I think it&#x27;s a good choice for the price.</li>
            <li> all of which died in 6 months or less before I bought my first Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is my first time using one of these things, the one thing that I was not aware of - simply because I just didn&#x27;t think about it - was the amount of water that comes out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Nice product except for the fact that there is no way that I can see to take the base off to clean it out after multiple uses.  </li>
            <li> I bought this unit based on Amazon reviews and not alternative branded 110v units because of obvious voltage differences here in Australia - Australian buyers of US appliances from Amazon should do their research a bit more carefully before complaining that their new purchase failed immediately when first powered on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a strong pulsation and the ability to collapse it down cuts down on sink space.  </li>
            <li> it does appear to be cheaply made and I have little hope that it will last me a long time--but it may surprise me.</li>
            <li> At first they had a little trouble (fun) getting use to the water squiring at them, but with some practice they got it under control.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes if you push very hard on the top of the battery cap, you can get the unit to run, but only while you maintain this pressure.  </li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds, but we always use the high speed (which is not really high).</li>
            <li> I installed  brand new batteries and after few days of use the pressure of the water jet goes down significantly.</li>
            <li> The tank is small and not enough for a thorough mouth clean.    </li>
            <li> Worked fine with one set of batteries for 16 days with at least once daily usage.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was for the size as I live in a condo and have little counter space.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything -- other than to maybe remove some food particles.  </li>
            <li> you have hard water with minerals in it that gunk up your unit, fill a clean 2 liter soda bottle with filter water from your fridge or Brita and use that in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But other people might prefer the pulse, so I can&#x27;t ding it too much for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very compact for travel unlike some other products that are labeled for travel.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get use to, you will make a mess the first couple times.</li>
            <li> I made a mess the first time I used it because I didn&#x27;t aim correctly and water went every where.</li>
            <li> It makes a mess too the first time you use it</li>
            <li> I am a person who flosses at least twice a day, and despite me being diligent and consistent with this, my first flossing session with this irrigator did cause minor bleeding in one area, which indicates that I was probably not flossing correctly in this area, despite all the effort put into flossing daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works extremely well and packs readily for travels.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The only fault that I can find is that the jet is a little too powerful even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I really liked this water pick until the motor gave out last week.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it just puts out a very weak stream (after changing batteries and cleaning the flow tube).  </li>
            <li> It does get a little gross after a bit of time.&lt;br /&gt;Decent product overall, and probably decent value as it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li> Much nicer to use than my old on-the-counter heavy water-pic.</li>
            <li> After using a WaterPik with a bigger capacity reservoir, I filled the Panasonic at least 2 times trying to match the thorough job I was used to.  </li>
            <li> but with two bolts connected to a central plastic tube and two diodes in parallel (taken from an old AC adapter) to reduce the voltage -- it connected the two bolts together.</li>
            <li> On low setting, I use it to flush out all the old amalgam bits the dentist left in my mouth.    </li>
            <li> My old one finally stopped working after 2 ,years of constant use.</li>
            <li> good enough for travel, a bit awkward to hold because it&#x27;s bulky.</li>
            <li> Also, there was some odd suction action with the tank during use that would force the tank up as the water emptied, which forced the water to leak even more.</li>
            <li> : The inside can never totally dry out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine the batteries will wear down all the quickly, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to find out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time you use this product, it can be a little intimidating.</li>
            <li> I added the irrigator to my nightly routine, I use it on the first setting (which is still a little painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of getting used to the handling at first because of all the squarting, but don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of us living alone - about 28% of all Americans - finding a place on the counter-tops of our typically tiny bathrooms for these behemoths is a major challenge.  </li>
            <li> Being prepared to see a bulky thing, I was not very surprised with its modest size when it was in the package.</li>
            <li> , it is an economical and applicable objects, the only problem is that the water is less, probably because it is portable items!</li>
            <li> Feels the same as the other with the large tank.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Small but have enough power to clean your inner mouth.</li>
            <li> No mess, or maybe only occasionally, when i forget to close my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stream is neither too weak or so strong it will damage your gums.</li>
            <li> This model is very user-friendly, and just plain old works.</li>
            <li> I will get a little grisly for a moment, Being the randy old fart that I am with all the attendant problems of such</li>
            <li> ; reservoir capacity enough to finish the job in one fill; powerful enough to get all the little bits.  </li>
            <li> , no tool will make cleaning your teeth and gums fun, but this one makes it very little work.</li>
            <li> Small water reservoir is just enough for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> While this portable units works ok it is a bit clumsy to use due to its size.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other oral irrigation &#x27;systems&#x27;, this one does not come with a whole slew of different attachments.</li>
            <li> , every time with a different all-natural fluoride-free toothpaste - I&#x27;ve tried several brands and settled on 5-6 of them), flossing, using [[ASIN:B005LF0QZI Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks, 275 Count (Pack of 4)]], chewing xylitol gum (again, tried several brand and settled on Epic (like this one</li>
            <li> I have braces on my teeth - ulk-I&#x27;m to old for braces, but anyway, I was taking a week long trip</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s been a few months and since I&#x27;m now willing to say \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;, I&#x27;m upping my rating to four stars.</li>
            <li> A litle messy at first until I got use to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact and powerful.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s still doing something beneficial as opposed to not doing it at all but not really sure it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> For the first few years, it let me travel and water floss.  </li>
            <li> but boy did it hurt the first few times.</li>
            <li> convenient, small, portable, powerful; batteries run out in a month and have to be changed.  </li>
            <li> If you want a larger water receptacle, buy the big water pick or other large unit.</li>
            <li> but I feel in order to clean the entire mouth I have to replace water at least three times.</li>
            <li> Just be ready to switch out the batteries once they start to run down, as weaker batteries affect the performance a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact when collapsed down.</li>
            <li> Tilt the whole thing upside down, rotate it, turn it from side to side, while it is on, to get all the excess water out from all parts of the device.</li>
            <li> I impulsively bought this when it was on sale, mainly because I hate flossing my teeth and thought this would be a good alternative.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s two settings, the first (low) setting doesn&#x27;t yield any results, and even after using the second setting, there&#x27;s still things that aren&#x27;t able to be reached and are unable to be removed other than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the tank is a little bit small, but it&#x27;s okay for travel or carry.</li>
            <li> My criticism is that the batteries need to be replaced frequently -- or the force of the water becomes so weak that it does not do an adequate job.</li>
            <li> look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the unit isn&#x27;t the most convenient to handle, and the power switch can be little hard to operate, particularly if your hands are wet.  </li>
            <li> I received this item for less than a week and very please with the product.  </li>
            <li> I previously used the waterpik brand with the whole tank contraption.</li>
            <li> The unit retracts into half its size for travel, which the portable Waterpik could not do, very convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li> The drawback to that being the water reservoir empties quickly and I have to refill at least once per session.</li>
            <li> adequate (negative comments in some of the reviews).</li>
            <li> The first one last about a year until the motor is dead.</li>
            <li> I do have to refill it one time, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the portability of this tiny and powerful machine.</li>
            <li> Since my WaterPik unit was years old, I thought I&#x27;d try something new (and save a little money).</li>
            <li> Within a few months I went for my LANAP evaluation and was told that there is no need for a full scale procedure anymore, only localized for one single deep pocket.</li>
            <li> Within a few months I went for my LANAP evaluation and was told that there is no need for a full scale procedure anymore, only localized for one single deep pocket.</li>
            <li> I used rechargeables now for some time in this without issue other than their very tight fit.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that this has a little longer life, but if it goes, I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> it is a little large to be maneuverable.</li>
            <li> This little gem is so smart &amp; usefull.</li>
            <li> It does not, however, have a very capacious tank and usually requires a second fill to complete the job.</li>
            <li> Major plus point is that it is extremely portable and everything folds to an adult palm size.</li>
            <li> I also will clean the unit with a bleach (Chlorox) solution of less than a half an ounce per tank about 2x per year to kill anything that might start growing even though I use the listermint mouthwash in the tank.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Portable Dental Water Irrigator takes up less space when not in use and is much quieter than the standard countertop model I used years ago.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the water runs out so quick...</li>
            <li> Initially I noted the batteries would die very quickly, then the volume of water being pumped decreased - then this morning - it totally quit working.</li>
            <li> If we&#x27;re playful we&#x27;ll spray each other with it if someone tries to grab it first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The soft battery cover can easily be damaged by the wrong tool to open it</li>
            <li> may try and track down the older one as this needs some engineering improvements.  </li>
            <li> This oral irrigator works very well, but I wish it were a little larger because I need to refill it before I&#x27;m done flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li> It cleaned between my teeth very well and only freaked me out a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I think I had \\&quot;prototypes\\&quot; in the past, though this model is very much the same.  </li>
            <li> irrigators are, at their most basic level, a small water reservoir, some form of electricity, and a thin nozzle to spray high pressure water between your teeth.</li>
            <li> In order to use it, you have to awkwardly hold the top and bottom halves of the product just far enough apart</li>
            <li> The big negative is that both speeds are less powerful than the older model.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice device, is seems to work well and assists me in getting food particles out of some difficult places with minimal trauma</li>
            <li> Good product but mine failed after a few months.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is not super large so often times I need to fill it twice to do my mouth as long as I do at home</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool for everyone trying to take better care of their teeth and gums, but especially for those unwilling or unable to invest in the less cost-effective alternatives.</li>
            <li> It works fairly strong as a water-pick but the water container is a little small</li>
            <li> Had a hard time getting the placement right.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using the high setting, it&#x27;s much less than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had a different brand previously, did not last long or hold as much water.  </li>
            <li> Water flossing massages the area around a weak tooth and leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but after a couple of weeks of consistent use I find it to be strong without being painful</li>
            <li> Only two downsides; it runs out of water because of the small tank (although that is what makes it portable) and it puts out a large volume of water in a short time which makes it necessary to get rid of the water which is accumulating in your mouth several times during use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my teeth have become very crooked and it was hard to clean in between with just brushing.  </li>
            <li> I work very hard to keep my teeth clean</li>
            <li> The oval shape is a little awkward to hold since I have small hands but will fit nicely in my purse or bag.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the other person writing about his son not being very tall and can&#x27;t use this, but now I understand.  </li>
            <li> As far as uses outside of its obvious, life-saving use for people with severe and impossible-to-reach dental pockets, it also helps get out tiny particles that brushing or even conventional flossing can&#x27;t get to.</li>
            <li> , the most important question is: once you get past the offensively bad design, does the product actually work?</li>
            <li> Was most surprised at the unpleasant taste I occasionally find hiding between teeth even after brushing.</li>
            <li> I usually end up filling it a 2nd time to complete my mouth cleansing (adult braces) but it IS a portable unit and when my braces are off, I won&#x27;t have to fill it twice.</li>
            <li> The NiZN batteries, while performing well in the Panasonic irrigator, have resulted in a little too much pressure in the long term.</li>
            <li> The batteries (two \\&quot;A\\&quot; cells) last a long time, several weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts long (I only replaced it once in 6 months of almost daily use), gets what regular string floss doesn&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> After using several women &amp;#34;thingamagigs&amp;#34; I went and got hubby&#x27;s flat head screw driver and 1 stern twist</li>
            <li> After using it every day, I turned it upside down and turned back on for 4 or 5 seconds to clear the internal water system.</li>
            <li> It takes up very little space on my bathroom counter, and holds enough water to do a very thorough cleaning job.</li>
            <li> This new irrigator seems to have less power.</li>
            <li> We live half the year in our Motorhome</li>
            <li> /&gt;only true problems since you have to refill it each time the water is straight out of the tap and cold which hurts my teeth</li>
            <li> 15 years ago I purchased a Panasonic irrigator that did not have much power, so I tried 2 other models from other companies.  </li>
            <li> did I finally realize that brushing is only a half measure (and wears your teeth - the dentist told me he saw groves from the brushing, even using soft brushes).  </li>
            <li> The water doesn&#x27;t last long enough before needing a refill.</li>
            <li> The only con I have is that the batteries don&#x27;t last long in this thing.</li>
            <li> Long story short, the seller would not take it back, Panasonic said talk to the seller, and I eventually filed an Amazon claim, which was resolved in my favor quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works well; one filling of water continues long enough for a full-mouth treatment, are the batteries are still holding their charge after three weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to others for travel purposes only and not for daily home use, as long as all preventative maintenance is carried out each and every time it is used.  </li>
            <li> I hope it will last long enough for the money paid for it.</li>
            <li> Water speed is decent and holds firmly in my hand.  </li>
            <li> , the water tank seems kinda small as I had to refill at least one more time each time</li>
            <li> Teeth and I only just got this, but I must say it totally squirts water into your teeth and gums and makes one feel there cannot be a single microbe left.</li>
            <li> The high speed is about the same as the one speed on the prior model, not sure the purpose of the low speed.</li>
            <li> The battery (requires 2 AA, a very common battery) lasts a long time (about one full month with multiple daily uses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the battery is a bit hard to take off for the first time, but use a nickle and turn it a bit side ways and it will come off.  </li>
            <li> Hard to figure out how to use at first.</li>
            <li> At first I found it hard to use without spraying water everywhere, but I have learned now how to use it.</li>
            <li> The last irrigator,  a Water........  didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> However, when I use fresh disposable batteries, I only experience optimal performance a few times before it turns into the \\&quot;little oral irrigator that</li>
            <li> you can perform the acrobatics necessary to keep the thing dry while cleaning your entire mouth, you&#x27;re my hero.</li>
            <li> of the above I used religiously after every single meal.</li>
            <li> of the above I used religiously after every single meal.</li>
            <li> It probably does not have as much power as some...but is small and convenient .</li>
            <li> The amount of water it holds is small in capacity, so I have to refill twice or thrice to get through my whole mouth</li>
            <li> Ordinarily, I use the Waterpik which I really like.</li>
            <li> I have bought others in the past and they have so much pressure, they hurt.</li>
            <li> Very portable and small.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to use and encourages you to floss when you are lazy or rushing.</li>
            <li> at least this way it&#x27;s never uncomfortable and you can&#x27;t damage your gums.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> Calling it an \\&quot;oral irrigator\\&quot; was not far off,  it simply sprays water on your teeth without a chance of  getting anything done between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work short term let alone long term.</li>
            <li> and we will see how long the batteries last.  </li>
            <li> This runs on disposable batteries which last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> But if I were judging it for daily use over the long term (in a \\&quot;gosh is the cheaper item</li>
            <li> Because I only use it one week, I do not know how long it will keep well.</li>
            <li> It ended up under the bathroom sink we&#x27;re headed back for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with regular flossing: bleeding gums; minor irritation.</li>
            <li> I would caution you though, they didn&#x27;t last long with my energizer rechargeables.</li>
            <li> As strange as it looks, the ergonomics actually work.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> Battery last for long.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time in this unit, and then you just replace them  </li>
            <li> However, my engineer did say the rechargables would not last as long per charge as the Alkalines do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 AA Battery can last for quite long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li> Penlite batteries seem to be holding up and lasting fairly long.</li>
            <li> The battery does&#x27;t last as long as I think it should.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it every day or it won&#x27;t apparently last as long.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to go through a set of batteries, so cannot comment on battery life.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other irrigators are just as messy as this one because this is my first one.  </li>
            <li> No more heavy tubes full of water in big containers to sit on the countertop.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing the pump is broken as even with a full tank of water</li>
            <li> I recharge the batteries when I notice a significant slow down and reduction in pressure.</li>
            <li> I can get the outside gums fine, but the inside ones are really difficult for me to reach, for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t even set this product down without draining it completely</li>
            <li> I marked it down to 4 stars because of the lack of information about the number of nozzles included with the irrigator and the number of nozzles in the replacement package.</li>
            <li> Waterpik offers something similar, but you will need a converter and the product itself is too big and too heavy when you have only limited baggage on a flight</li>
            <li> When fully assembled, it&#x27;s a little tall and the bathroom cabinet door doesn&#x27;t clear it, so I store it with the nozzle off and laying on the counter next to the unit.</li>
            <li> A little awkward to hold and use but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> if they are smart, and know how to use it correctly, and arent a complainer by nature, there is nothing bad that can really be said about this particular unit.&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li> It is certainly not a substitute for a full sized model if you are serious about flossing.</li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s have complained that the reservoir rune out too quickly.</li>
            <li> The purchase process took me two hours because the Amazon web could not deal with my long absence from purchasing products from them.</li>
            <li> All these portable ones don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Also, the Waterpik did not last very long.</li>
            <li> the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because batteries don&#x27;t seem to last very long...</li>
            <li> The pulsating action is less vigorous with the Panasonic but it seems to do the job</li>
            <li> I think the rubber rings on the piston wear out, and you know the \\&quot;end of life\\&quot; is near when there is water in the battery compartment and the pressure is slightly reduced.  </li>
            <li> I still see black mold in the creases and the company offers no instructions to preventing this or correcting this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - As a previous view pointed out, the water cannot be completely emptied from the tank when packing.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> but I resisted and finally confessed that I am incapable of keeping myself or my bathroom dry when armed with a WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> I have owned two of these; both grow mold inside the unit, despite following the manufacturer instructions to drain and air dry the unit after use.  </li>
            <li> Not that difficult; in fact it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Switched to Toilet Tree 2015 Version --</li>
            <li> When you pull it back up the entire unit is wet, now it&#x27;s slippery.</li>
            <li> You can expect that if you&#x27;re carefully spraying in between each tooth, and along the entire gumline in and out, you may need 2-3 fillups to cover the entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure how long the batteries last, so far 2 weeks with multiple daily uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only had the unit for 5 days, but after double checking with flossing in some of the harder to reach areas, the water jet seems to work just as well as the dental floss tape to dislodge stuff from in-between the teeth.</li>
            <li> ; it replaced a Toilet Tree irrigator that stopped working; batteries are replaceable too</li>
            <li> However, the rechargeable battery on the Waterpik gets less powerful over time, and only seems to last about 4 months before I&#x27;m forced to toss it and buy another device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first two died after about a year after buying (motor failure).</li>
            <li> Similar power to the major brands though less injecter heads.</li>
            <li> My only question is how long it will last, as my other devices broke after only a year of use.</li>
            <li> The water tank doesn&#x27;t hold enough for a single use and I tend to refill the water tank about one or two times.</li>
            <li> Water tank is for single use only, makes sense.</li>
            <li> A little hard to clean (but the benefits outweigh this shortcoming by a mile)</li>
            <li> Other machines power cords barely reached the sink.  </li>
            <li> , when the product starts getting dirty, I submerge the whole thing (minus the battery) in a container full of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> I then flush several tanks of plain water through the unit to clear any bleach residue.</li>
            <li> When you are done using it, the tip goes in the side and you push the white, upper part down into the blue part.</li>
            <li> : 2 speeds, decent water capacity, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: can be messy, not good for people with small hands.</li>
            <li> one other thing, even drying it out the way I suggest, mold still tends to grow inside the resevoir and in several places on the outside -- even on the Jet Pik handle.  </li>
            <li> If I was the proverbial little old lady then there is no way I could have gotten the cap off.</li>
            <li> This looks like a different design but hopefully will last as long or longer than my other Panasonic irrigator.</li>
            <li> The whole flosser is also difficult to keep clean; dirt gets inside the unit and is not able to be removed.</li>
            <li> Hard to handle because it&#x27;s straight and not contoured.</li>
            <li> Does not hold much water and hard to refill</li>
            <li> A little hurt for the first few times using.</li>
            <li> Used this way, I can claim with satisfaction that I&#x27;m almost completely free of morning bad breath; and my dentist always gives me high marks for my oral hygiene as well..</li>
            <li> This has reduced the pressure enough to stop cutting open the gumline in the one spot while giving enough pressure to effectively clean my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> It makes a bit of a mess, and it sucks battery life fairly quickly, but my teeth and gums do feel cleaner and healthier</li>
            <li> The tip on the new unit is very tight and it&#x27;s a struggle to get it out of the unit for packing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different water flosses but they either had very little pressure or only lasted a very short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase because it is more of a portable/travel irrigator, but was desperate to get my teens to start using.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s clear they are no better than the current crop of poor-durability water piks.  </li>
            <li> While my teeth feel cleaner afterwards the power, even on the lower setting, is kind of painful.</li>
            <li> It is my first time making video review, please bear with me if my skills were not good.</li>
            <li> Okay travel flosser because it collapses but awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to a regular water pic and this one is just not powerful enough to be satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> If this came with a small soft carrying case, I would not mind taking this with me outside the home.</li>
            <li> So - I&#x27;m not sure how long the batteries will last, but so far it&#x27;s 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps not everyone would have this difficulty, but I had a Panasonic water flosser a long time ago that didn&#x27;t have this problem.  </li>
            <li> Looked all over for this item for my husband who has used these for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is not really loud either.  </li>
            <li> I travel frequently and every time I needed it the batteries were dead.</li>
            <li> Soft or firm water flow.</li>
            <li> Stronger than expected current.</li>
            <li> waited too long to return the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then pour that mixture back into the empty mouthwash container.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t forsee and long relationship.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is larger than expected.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last about 3 to 4 weeks, not really an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy long ago an irrigator for an oral cavity.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require being plugged in or recharged, simply uses a battery, does the work it is expected to do.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a minor nuisance.</li>
            <li> The pik never held a charge for long.  </li>
            <li> Even after careful brushing I will still occasionally find debris removed by this unit.</li>
            <li> root.&lt;br /&gt;After long term usage the battery will also be out and</li>
            <li> Used it on a recent trip and it performed as expected.</li>
            <li> I wish i&#x27;d known about these long ago</li>
            <li> I think they could fix that with a minor redesign.</li>
            <li> The water compartment can be removed from the generator and in this state, it can be completely washed AND dried,</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the on/off button which is not very tactile especially when your hands are wet</li>
            <li> Well, the Panasonic Oral Irrigator is a product that I hope to have with me for the rest of my lifetime, long after my stint with braces has come to an end.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it lasts in the long run.</li>
            <li> Depending upon how long it lasts, I&#x27;d buy another one.</li>
            <li> A minor quibble.</li>
            <li> The container for the water is smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> and I find it much harder to hold onto and just too big for something I want to tuck into my carry on bag.</li>
            <li> I resisted getting a water flosser for a long time because of the price, but then this model came on Amazon Deals and I had to get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery lasted all summer long and still working without changing them.</li>
            <li> It was banished long ago to our appliance graveyard, for the safety of one and all.  </li>
            <li> It does not generate nearly enough pressure to even remotely approach the pressure needed to do the job.</li>
            <li> It is a big slider, and it works well even with my hand being wet.</li>
            <li> We have tried several more expensive water pic and they always broke after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> Not much money, but the quality is low.</li>
            <li> Not a product I kept for long.</li>
            <li> My trip lasted about a month, &amp; the batteries lasted that long.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it works almost as well as a much more expensive one I had purchased on advice from my dentist which finally died after a few years.</li>
            <li> I panicked since I don&#x27;t know how long my daughter had this one before I took it.</li>
            <li> Battery lasted surprisingly long...</li>
            <li> I reinserted batteries after a long flight - would not respond.</li>
            <li> description of this product on Amazon website is not clear, for example there is no origin of this product and no product warranty certificate.  </li>
            <li> The white section that contains the motor squashes down and is contained within the blue section for easier storage.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually a simply matter of just pulling it back down into place.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it gradually loses its punch even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> I estimate the new batters should last at least three - four months.</li>
            <li> The only thing I recommend is that you use it in the shower or get out your wet dry vac.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll hit that spot for an entire tank and typically, when I wake the next morning, the soreness is gone.  </li>
            <li> very distasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, agree with other reviewers, the Panasonic is impossible to clean.  </li>
            <li> I live in a small apartment with no counter space so any of those products with a reservoir wouldn&#x27;t have worked for me.</li>
            <li> Very slight difference from old model..</li>
            <li> Then early this year—after unit unused and in storage for approximately six months—motor would not turn on (completely dead)—unable to revive (kaput!).</li>
            <li> I thought about bringing my corded waterpic, but it&#x27;s large, hard to pack when wet, would need a voltage converter etc., so I opted for one of these battery powered machines.</li>
            <li> was not sure at first because of the small water tank but lasts long enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I look forward to this being a long term addition to my oral healthcare!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the different voltage other countries use.</li>
            <li> Other than the water pressure being weaker than I prefer, this is a relatively well made</li>
            <li> I bought this model because of the problem other water picks have, short battery life.</li>
            <li> Has enough power to remove any foreign object from between teeth.</li>
            <li> as I tried to figure out how big or little to open my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have a standard Waterpik at home and use this at work as part of an aggressive oral care routine recommended by my dentist due to gum disease.</li>
            <li> At that point, the irrigator is still working but getting pretty weak.</li>
            <li> You fill the blue part with lukewarm water by opening a little hinged door and simply running tap water into it.</li>
            <li> batteries last a little over one month of daily use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After being disconnected several times due to being transferred to a non-working extentsion, I was told it was my responsiblity to call them and get instructions to blow dry the tank after each use.</li>
            <li> I choose this Panasonic model because it has less footprint compared to the Waterpik, very portable and costs less than the other portable brands.</li>
            <li> - however the Water Pic would never hold a charge for very long so this Panasonic is an improvement over that.</li>
            <li> The batteries never lasted very long and the pulsating just got weaker and weaker with time.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it very long, but already can see a difference in my oral health.</li>
            <li> It works for a very long time (3-4 weeks) with one set of batteries</li>
            <li> Compact, no cords, no hoses and the battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> So we were looking for something more durable than the current crop of badly designed water piks.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bad they changed the design of the nozzle so the old ones won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I take care to rinse and air dry my unit</li>
            <li> /&gt;It needs to be redesigned so that the water housing section can be separated (removed) to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I take it apart and air dry it every night.</li>
            <li> And you gotta leave it in a well ventilated area for it to dry or else</li>
            <li> I became almost obsessed with the hygiene to the point that I would avoid snacking if I knew I couldn&#x27;t clean my teeth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I became almost obsessed with the hygiene to the point that I would avoid snacking if I knew I couldn&#x27;t clean my teeth afterwards.</li>
            <li> To keep it dry after use takes some time.</li>
            <li> I feel like the design makes it difficult to move this thing to effectively clean all of my gums.  </li>
            <li> So far (after 14 days), battery power is holding up and I am assuming it will last at least a month.</li>
            <li> Overall I would purchase this again for travel but keep a standard pic for everyday use.</li>
            <li> With two of us using it every night, they last about a week which is a total waste.</li>
            <li> It really helps blast particles left behind out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The only slight negative is it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water as the counter, bulky plug in types.</li>
            <li> Will last a few years, This is my second</li>
            <li> Because of its size, I do have to refill the water reservoir once during cleaning, but its not a big deal and only takes a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> to take with you when you travel, the only negative thing so far is the cost of operation, you have to use the alkaline&lt;br /&gt;batteries, not rechargeable ones</li>
            <li> I had to replace my first one because the little trap door where you fill it with water popped off and got left behind on my last vacation.  </li>
            <li> On initial usage, it caused a mess in my toilet, water splashing all over.</li>
            <li> Plenty of cleaning power on the slow speed, haven&#x27;t felt the need to use the high speed.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of limited packing space.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a person with limited use of one arm and hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexplicably simultaneously more painful and less effective.  </li>
            <li> Even after flossing I&#x27;ll get additional food out of my gums and in many cases this is the only device that can remove painful food jammed underneath my gums.</li>
            <li> I cannot see where the package advertising reveals that the irrigator might be reconditioned or returned, but mine clear was, unless water is part of the usual packaging.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the opening flap is still the same flimsy type that I ended up breaking last time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Usually have to fill it two times to complete the cleaning</li>
            <li> but I always used AA rechargables in my old one and they would usually go for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It lives on batteries, so no long cord to mess with either.</li>
            <li> This did not last more than a few months which was quite disappointing  to me.</li>
            <li> It does not take long (a few weeks) for the battery power to weaken and the spray weaken along with it--my first complaint.</li>
            <li> I have not yet had to replace the batteries, so I am curious to find out how long it will</li>
            <li> It just gets messy with water everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> This one also has a two-speed switch; the speeds are 1) slow, and 2) normal.</li>
            <li> This is the first portable I&#x27;ve used, and I was very disappointed in both the size of the tank (could not get more than one side done per tankful) and the force of the water.</li>
            <li> A little weak and runs out of water quickly.  </li>
            <li> After a while, the plastic pegs that hold it in place weaken and the door comes loose.</li>
            <li> and you will loose your teeth, so</li>
            <li> Even with new batteries, there is hardly any pressure.</li>
            <li> But then I finally had some read meat and it was down hill from here.</li>
            <li> By the time I was done with 3 refills to work on techniques, my ear, hair on left side, and kitchen cabinets needed a wipe down.</li>
            <li> - it does chomp down on batteries quite a bit, although I can say I&#x27;v gotten three solid weeks of use out of a set of Duracells -</li>
            <li> After years with the earlier model, it slowed down, so I opted for this newer model.</li>
            <li> That is, pull off the water resevoir, open up the plug where you fill it with water, and store the resevoir upside down, so it dries.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that it leaks a little as you&#x27;re using it, but other than that I would totally recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and the batterys last me around 2 and a half weeks on average.</li>
            <li> They have used larger oral irrigation systems in the past that required taking up a big chunk of limited counter space.</li>
            <li> It collapses into a tiny, low profile unit that takes up very little space.  </li>
            <li> On average, I used it at least three times per day and it performed very  well for over a year.  </li>
            <li> Something I didn&#x27;t think about when i was browsing...not necessarily a draw back but a consequence to small size.  </li>
            <li> My previous irrigator required very regularly charging and then just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The current model has improved on the previous design.</li>
            <li> You need to dry it carefully before opening the battery compartment, so there would not be any humidity going</li>
            <li> It folds come to the size of deodorant which makes it much less of an eye sore if left on the counter.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does its basic job well - getting food particles out, and is small enough to be taken on trips.</li>
            <li> Especially since you&#x27;re sticking half of the apparatus in your mouth every time, and it seems like the unit has a tendency to get grotty.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE IS AN EXTRA, AS THE FIRST ONE WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately a lot of people won&#x27;t read this review, but if you do, please keep looking for another irrigator unless you are willing to buy this one for only short-term use.</li>
            <li> Prefer this to the typical water floss that has an open tank.  </li>
            <li> It runs on a pair of AA&#x27;s, and if the lack of a built-in rechargable battery bothers you, you can just get a pair of rechargable batteries and a charger for ten bucks or less at any drugstore.  </li>
            <li> It stops working after three months, the total number of time I used is less than 10.</li>
            <li> At either of the two power settings, the reservoir holds enough water to run for less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that it does have slightly less power than the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I have used this regularly in the past 6 months and only just replaced the two batteries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several versions of the Panasonic Oral Irrigator over the past several years but this one EW</li>
            <li> /&gt;The water is pumped out quickly in half a minute or so , enough to get the job done .</li>
            <li> Priced less than WaterPik for the same results.</li>
            <li> I had the previous model for almost 8 years and it finally gave out.</li>
            <li> My second one lasted less than a month.</li>
            <li> I always empty my flosser and let it dry.</li>
            <li> First turn it hard and the cover will rotate like 30 degrees, then turn it really hard and it will finally open.</li>
            <li> the first few uses may cause a little bleeding but not to worry, its because the trapped food and bacteria causes irritation/ inflammation on the gums.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;That little hole is not enough to let it dry out.</li>
            <li> the pipe is easy to broken and hard to fix.</li>
            <li> is much less than what a powered unit provides and that the battery life, even with the most expensive batteries is less than expected.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit for people who take oral hygiene seriously.</li>
            <li> or you will seriously injure your throat if you are accidentaly on a high setting.  </li>
            <li> I am going to look for another item that performs the same function without the mess.</li>
            <li> I am handicapped and can only use one arm,  You definitetly need two arms or there is mess and splatters all over the plce.  </li>
            <li> One small annoyance is that the on-off-speed switch is a bit difficult to operate when wet which is most of the time when you&#x27;re using the irrigator.</li>
            <li> The tool functionally works, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it without water flying out of my mouth and making a big mess.</li>
            <li> I had problems getting the battery case to open -- it is really tight and you need to lean into it while tuning with a coin.</li>
            <li> The only time it produced a decent jet of water was when batteries were new - then they diminished in power until it was useless, usually in about a week.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the batteries do not seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> This little gadget little has solved those issues for me completely.</li>
            <li> The only other minor gripe is the power switch is a little tricky when it&#x27;s all wet</li>
            <li> In other words, don&#x27;t fill it up and put it down for a bit, because you meant to do something else, however briefly.</li>
            <li> I have tried seven (yes, 7) different oral irrigation units including two Waterpik counter models, and none compare favorably to this little workhorse.  </li>
            <li> The power is a little short and the battery life too.  </li>
            <li> I have a little spot around a back molar that grabs all sorts of food bits.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for those who floss but also like a little extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t take it apart; just leave it on my sink with the little compartment door open so it can</li>
            <li> The tank cannot be detached from the irrigator, and the tank only has a little hole where you put water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only improvement would be to make it a little lighter for travelers.</li>
            <li> This newer version&lt;br /&gt;is a little bigger</li>
            <li> Wish the res. was a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> Most of the other portable irrigators use a permanently installed rechargeable battery which usually start to fail after a year or two</li>
            <li> but I think if you turn the machine on when done and get all the water out as well as leaving the little door open you will not have a mold issue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run it twice per day since Oct. 18 with one set of alkaline batteries and they&#x27;re just now starting to seem a little week.</li>
            <li> Biggest advantage is from flushing small food particles from under gumline -- there&#x27;s really no other way to get them out.</li>
            <li> The second unit was redesigned which makes it a little easier to remove the tank and disinfect, although the manufacturer recommends NOT removing the tank.  </li>
            <li> The small compartment that houses the nozzle when collapsed and not in use is a clever idea that will ensure it never goes missing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rechargeable, but over about 4 months it held less &amp; less charge until it barely worked.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The compact size and design make it quite suitable for traveling (although you feel compelled to pop off the tip to keep it from getting broken, and then I worry about losing it in the suitcase), but it is a little underpowered and, because of the way you have to hold your hand on the on/off button all the time, it is hard to keep water from running down your wrist and wetting your sleeve.  </li>
            <li> This was about half the price of other products in the same category.</li>
            <li> After a couple of bad times with the \\&quot;leading\\&quot; product, this one is the top pick.  </li>
            <li> I shied away from the portable Waterpik waterflosser, because of its many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with food getting stuck in my teeth that I could not get out with floss, which would then lead to swollen gums, pain, infection, etc, making it even more painful to floss the affected area.</li>
            <li> Great flosser if you hate using the string floss!  </li>
            <li> (it is at least 20 years old)  </li>
            <li> While they don&#x27;t have the initial \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; of alkaline&#x27;s, after about 4 uses, the alkaline loses its advantage and runs at the same level of the NiMH.</li>
            <li> I personally would prefer the rechargeable variety (to save on batteries), but this was hardly enough to lay me off from at least trying this product.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it comes with only one nozzle so you can&#x27;t share it with your husband or wife.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to finish the job.</li>
            <li> within a few months it started acting up and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> even harder pulses</li>
            <li> Arrived within expected time frame.  </li>
            <li> Handle part keeps slipping into the tank part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used water piks before but never one that gets me soaking wet in the process.  </li>
            <li> It stows the nozzle in the side of the case and protects the switch when closed.  </li>
            <li> Took a couple tries to use it without spraying all over.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really no need to re-fill tank.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I partially closed the unit.  </li>
            <li> This means that When I use it, I get my bathroom and myself wet.</li>
            <li> It got wet and now doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> So, I had to empty it each time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The dog likes it because we fill it with water mixed with a few drops of liquid beef bullion.</li>
            <li> A total waste of effort and money ...</li>
            <li> With my WaterPik I never used any of them as they serve no real function.      </li>
            <li> lower quality than expected.  </li>
            <li> So I have to wear my bathrobe whenever I want to floss so that I don&#x27;t get all wet.  </li>
            <li> I go back to my dentist in a few months, so</li>
            <li> I think the pressure could be harder.</li>
            <li> a customer service rep admit that when the center gets them they are not even examined but chucked into a bin for salvage/discard.</li>
            <li> it no longer works after a couple years and minimal use.</li>
            <li> My 1st try was disaster, everything was wet, but now learned how to use it.</li>
            <li> when I figured out how to unclog, it still only worked for a few days.  </li>
            <li> just what I expected.</li>
            <li> But be careful</li>
            <li> I purchased the oral irrigation device by Panasonic a few weeks ago and have used it numerous times.</li>
            <li> The plastic build of the irrigator will collect residue and succumb if not cleaned and dried properly after usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s morepowerful than I expected.</li>
            <li> Suction stopped working after careful 8 months storage.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only been a few months, which I thought might just be the batteries I used</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-louder than i expected</li>
            <li> It is always wet inside which causes the mold.</li>
            <li> Had one of these before and after a few years it finally broke.  </li>
            <li> I use the harder setting.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t keep your finger on the switch YOU WILL GET WET</li>
            <li> I carefully followed the instructions and wound up with water everywhere</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I&#x27;m not much into gadgets, but I had tons of dental work done and felt obliged to try this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really an issue anymore</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> I spent over 70 minutes on the phone with a representative who was in the Philipines.</li>
            <li> A few days later, she want to a friend&#x27;s house, and her friend had the Braun version of this product.  </li>
            <li> Once it is used and has residual water in it, when it&#x27;s closed, it leaks.  </li>
            <li> Tried it several times but it is just too messy to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s closed up mode it reminds me of the size of those slender &amp;#34;ENERGY DRINKS&amp;#34; cans.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only had it few weeks, so I can&#x27;t comment on battery life, but</li>
            <li> If you used it twice everyday, you would need to change out the batteries by the end of the week if you wanted the same amount of power of irrigation.</li>
            <li> it finally died on me few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The batteries lasted a lot longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Panasonic support is closed after 9 pm Eastern time</li>
            <li> No real shortcomings.</li>
            <li> After a few rounds, I finally got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Harder to handle than I would like.  </li>
            <li> She recently got a palate expander installed that covers a few teeth and goes across the roof of her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t return it because I expected it will work</li>
            <li> I works exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> You fill with water and it lasts for maybe a minute to get empty.</li>
            <li> I have never used a device like that, and bought it from amazon since it was on sale at the moment because I was curious about it.</li>
            <li> As the water reservoir empties, the on-off switch sinks into the reservoir, so that the user cannot shut off the irrigator.  </li>
            <li> That may not sound like a big deal, because you can re-extend it, but trust me, when you&#x27;re using it</li>
            <li> Be careful of mold accumulation.  </li>
            <li> but it works as expected</li>
            <li> Yet I noticed pink mildew inside my nostril.</li>
            <li> THAT THE BATTERY GETS WET AND CORRODES,</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate more than flossing is visiting the dentist.  </li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s sooo much easier than those big bulkey ones with wires and other useless parts...</li>
            <li> However the tank is not large enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little messy and a bit hard to manage at first</li>
            <li> Thus, when going from one side of the mouth to the other, or top to bottom, your gums/inner cheeks get a painful spray.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Water had to be refilled twice and it was not strong enough.</li>
            <li> but it is not strong enough to damage gums.  </li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that the irrigator has to be used in conjunction with other means of oral hygiene, and not replace them entirely.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that the irrigator has to be used in conjunction with other means of oral hygiene, and not replace them entirely.</li>
            <li> 2500 mAh Limited Quantity!!</li>
            <li> All of the other irrigators have ports for the rechargable battery that could get wet.  </li>
            <li> but the second set is starting to slow down already too.  </li>
            <li> Base holds enough water in the base to flush your whole mouth but is still compact enough to fit your hand and not take up too much room on your sink.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid to clean it as the instructions states not to damage the tubing.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that it was big and bulky and not good to take if you are traveling.</li>
            <li> not a very fancy machine, the water speed is not very high, as a result, the cleaning result is not very satisfying.</li>
            <li> However, even the second one is now growing black mold not just in the water tank but in between the plastic parts of the housing, which are not accessible.  </li>
            <li> The only down part is that it can get a bit messy.</li>
            <li> This is again critical since these irrigators tend to accumulate a lot of slime; and the idea of using a filthy product to spray water into tight spaces between my teeth doesn&#x27;t seem appealing or hygienic.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way, apparently it can grow a mold that attracts ants.</li>
            <li> i presently live out of the States, in a country where oral irrigators are not available, though recommended, at least by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I needed something small as I have a very small counter and sink; I would have preferred a plug in model but they all seemed to take up too much counter space.</li>
            <li> for long term or everyday use.</li>
            <li> The pressure on the thing could knock your eye out if you didn&#x27;t aim carefully!</li>
            <li> I was already to buy another when I started reading the reviews about other products out there.  </li>
            <li> Hey - no worries, mate (guess where I spent my vacation!)  </li>
            <li> Holds enough water for about 40 seconds on weak spray, the stronger spray goes in about 25-30 which is barely enough to get around the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Has extreme power.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to use one-handed</li>
            <li> My other one used to make a puddle on the counter.</li>
            <li> gets the particles out that dental floss, picksand all my other devices could not.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any dental or periodontal work done, other than cleanings, since I have been using it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Have used other slimilar irrigators that have to be plugged in for charging.</li>
            <li> Tried different brand with a lot of frustration in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why other companies cannot learn the design from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I used to use other brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d explore other options if I had it to do over again - or return it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these things before, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other brands.</li>
            <li> Now the irrigator is at the same pumping power as the li-ion battery was with the diodes, but the NiZn batteries don&#x27;t fade, and no more hand-making dummy batteries.  </li>
            <li> give me 15 sec&#x27;s and zap!    </li>
            <li> Even on the &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; speed recommended for first-time users and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; cleaning, the water pressure feels weird at first.</li>
            <li> Also, the small plastic piece which holds the water n broke shortly after I purchased this item which means I have to hold my thumb over it in order to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> She had been pushing me to use an electric toothbrush and was not aware of this device.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it for other purposes, like watering flowers and trees in the garden and creating water fountains for your kinds etc.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but they said that I could not send the unit back because it&#x27;s 20 days past their warranty, even though the unit is guaranteed for 2 years for parts.</li>
            <li> after doing some research and reading other people issues their dentist recommended water flosser.</li>
            <li> The nozzle does not rotate in your mouth as compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> It is relatively small and works comparably to the larger one that I use at home.  </li>
            <li> so i bought this, based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s small, not cumbersome like some of the more expensive brands are and does the job!  </li>
            <li> My gums have bled from time to time due to the water pressure but you eventually get use to it.</li>
            <li> I just did not like the other brands I tried.  </li>
            <li> I gave the other one I bought 6 years ago to my brother to use.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind it is battery operated and has small capacity compared to the big &#x27;uns.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in your bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;without keeping it sanitized due to propagation of mold and&lt;br /&gt;bacteria</li>
            <li> Does not take a lot of space unlike other brands</li>
            <li> I have been using it ever since, try other products but not compare to this one.  </li>
            <li> This can be problematic because if water is there for a period of time and you did not remove it, there can be mold as mentioned by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Coincidentally, my plug-in unit failed a day or so after the Panasonic arrived, so I use it several times a day, plus on a recent overnight motorcycle trip to Big Bear Lake, CA.</li>
            <li> I saw other people complaining theirs</li>
            <li> It travels easily due to the &amp;#34;built-in&amp;#34; self-storage compartment for the removeable water tip.  </li>
            <li> It amazes me that even after a thorough brushing and flossing, I use the little irrigator only to flush out a little piece of blueberry.  </li>
            <li> It is nothing like any of the other oral irrigator&#x27;s</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last so it&#x27;s basically a waste of money and resources!</li>
            <li> I wish it had other tips in addition to the one that comes with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking for battery-operated, the other models I&#x27;ve used are all charged with an AC plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a short squirt-time because the reservoir is small -- so you fill it twice if you want.</li>
            <li> Small however so a trade off versus larger counter models.</li>
            <li> I only have room for a small machine</li>
            <li> I had read  horror stories about the rechargable batteries not working afer a couple of months on other units.  </li>
            <li> Did a trial run with it the other day</li>
            <li> so I only need a small amount of water to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Oral Irrigator for my son who has a small bathroom and does not have enough room for the Waterpik brand.  </li>
            <li> It is small it holds plenty of water for 1 bath and it folds up to be even smaller.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands and had reliability issues.  </li>
            <li> Problem: the force of the water is extreme and splatters all over when using it.</li>
            <li> It is not ergonomic, not made for the human hand, and every time I try to rotate it, to turn it off without spritzing my face, I wonder if they tested it on any fairly small people, or just gorillas.  </li>
            <li> Just carry some ordinary double AA batteries</li>
            <li> I found it reliable and extremely convenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other oral irrigators that haven&#x27;t held up.  </li>
            <li> Sharp edges of the plastic parts may hurt if your hands are sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, I use rechargeables</li>
            <li> My wife gave this to me for Christmas and it lasted through 3 months of every other day use.</li>
            <li> i found out from other reviews, it&#x27;s not recommended to use rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small enough to just stick  in my purse.</li>
            <li> I like the idea that it is small enough to carry with you when you go away.  </li>
            <li> but the other one seems &amp;</li>
            <li> 2 settings for speed, and it is extremely portable.</li>
            <li> it is what I was used to using with a small enough footprint that I won&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> in the middle of the night I used to feel crumbs, in the mouth, and now no more.</li>
            <li> Works about as expected!</li>
            <li> Other than this all is well.  </li>
            <li> I went to the dentist the other day</li>
            <li> I like the reservoir that seems larger than those in the past.  </li>
            <li> I give this a 4 because I knew what I was getting by reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I came across users complaining about mold and mildew issues for other models (where water is stored permanently and flosser plugged in to the wall socket).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not because I hate flossing that much, just more that I had braces in my mouth and flossing with braces is beyond frustrating and time-consuming.</li>
            <li> Common problem of all these portable models is following: they loose their power as time goes by.</li>
            <li> Two draw backs: it needs refilling mid-use and the batteries run down quickly, so I&#x27;m careful to have extras.</li>
            <li> The cleaning process can get a little protracted, but it is well worth it if you can avoid an expensive dental procedure.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it i got shocked to see how much of food items that were left behind all these days</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to spray water all over.</li>
            <li> The batteries are used up after only very few uses, then the effectiveness is reduced.  </li>
            <li> No gum bleeding, bad breath or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I am a sweet kisser!</li>
            <li> I usually add a little mouthwash to the water and ensure the water is room temperature as my teeth are a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having to buy a new handheld Waterpik every 4 months or so when it would no longer re-charge.</li>
            <li> We are an active family, often taking weekend trips on a whim.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not going to use the device for a while, take the batteries out and leave the battery compartment cap off for a few days to let the contacts dry thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes to much time and to do it properly is on the wrong side of painful, but this irrigator blast the stuff out quickly and I&#x27;m done before I know it; sans pain.</li>
            <li> However, seeing as how I used it only for travel and at our cabin in the mountains, I think its shelf life is not very good.  </li>
            <li> High is too painful for me, and mid doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough punch.</li>
            <li> the small size cuts down on the potential messiness of this type of product.</li>
            <li> This product made a huge mess all over my counter, and the only way to prevent this was to get on my knees, kneel over the sink, and use it with my head in the sink bowl, which, due to the ridiculous length and shape, means that aiming the device was haphazard at best&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was recently broken down after so many years of service.</li>
            <li> I chose this little portable irrigator because I have very limited counter &amp; storage space.  </li>
            <li> teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, like other reviewers, I find the unavoidable drip of used water spit onto the unit and sometimes down my arm</li>
            <li> In a few months of use it gets black particles trapped in the blue case portion.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> --Unit is very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d recommend combining the use of this with conventional flossing for an optimal result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Find it a little harder to maneuver than the standing irrigators.</li>
            <li> For work, I use an empty, see-through, one-dollar shampoo container as found at stores like Target or Walgreens (meant for travel kits) and squirt a little soap solution from that into the Panasonic irrigator.    </li>
            <li> This only becomes a problem if you have very tight spaces between teeth which require the maximum power to get trapped stuff out.</li>
            <li> I seriously almost drowned myself twice on this thing and sprayed myself with this several times.</li>
            <li> My only difficulty with this item is that the nozzle is hard for me to remove.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, only holds a little water, but when traveling that&#x27;s just what you want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and hard to hold and re-position as you&#x27;re moving it around in the mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to slide when holding this big square in your hand.</li>
            <li> hard to reach the back side of lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little big to handle, but i guess because of the water volume, it can&#x27;t be too small either</li>
            <li> so when I travel it is hard to carry the big irrigator.</li>
            <li> Only goes one way and the 2 setting do not vary hardly at all..</li>
            <li> The only problem is that when using it, it is sometimes hard to find the on/off switch to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> Too hard to open.</li>
            <li> It was a pretty disappointing experience: awkward to maneuver due to combination of size and weight, also it did not deliver much pressure relative to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> It does the job irrigating the way back areas that are hard to rech by just flossing.</li>
            <li> The stem is a little short, and I almost have to stuff the unit in my mouth to get behind my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> The water bursts were not that strong and the tank was very small and the battery failed to recharge within a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> and this unit is not nearly as powerful, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> the only drawback is that it won&#x27;t be in stock for at least another month.</li>
            <li> During this period encountered low water pressure out of nozzle and noticeable water leakage between water tank and motor body when in use (seal not effective).</li>
            <li> Overall, I am not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> not worth anymore that 5.00.  </li>
            <li> Warranty folks at Panasonic wanted the product shipped to them, for replacement not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as powerful.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommend me to use this due to all the mess that happen to my teeth.</li>
            <li> so it was not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not worth the health risks to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Not worth whatever it might do to improve gum health.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the investment</li>
            <li> The only complaint</li>
            <li> Reading some of the negative reviews of this item prior to purchase almost kept me from purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> But having used such systems in the past, those additional attachments have felt gimmicky and a wasteful overkill anyway.</li>
            <li> just not worth the money or the hassle in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but design is flawed and could it have been much  much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I use it daily at least once a day.</li>
            <li> was that all my old tips had broken).</li>
            <li> I spent a few hours researching these and settled on this unit.</li>
            <li> It is wide and not comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the old Water Pik&#x27;s and this is a poor substitute.  </li>
            <li> After using this for two weeks, I still cannot irrigate my mouth on one chamber-full of fluid because I am too slow.  </li>
            <li> You would be surprised what lies behind and under your teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li> Only gripe is that the applicator is a little sharp and will cause bleeding of the gums if you touch them too hard.</li>
            <li> It slows down and loses pressure when the batteries start to get low.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the nozzle edge is slightly sharp so keep it a little distance from the gums.</li>
            <li> Replacing the batteries every few months is needed and it is certainly not as strong/forceful as the Waterpik model</li>
            <li> I had other handhelds that you could not clean out.</li>
            <li> Mistake, it does take up  less room but is clumsy to use and does not have  enough water to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Mine just recently started to slow down, less power in the pulsing.</li>
            <li> I even filed the plastic detent clip down a bit to reduce the difficulty of turning it on.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use two of those, so I made a dummy battery out of a #10 bolt, #10 washers, and fasteners (to keep the washers attached) and ground the dummy battery down to size.</li>
            <li> (the power of the irrigator went down).</li>
            <li> To get the lithium-ion voltage down, I made another dummy battery</li>
            <li> so that was a let down.  </li>
            <li> (I  just ignore what the manual says on rechargables and use eneloops to keep the battery costs down).  </li>
            <li> Though some might down it for the need for batteries I look at this way; no need for ANOTHER transformer/charger.   </li>
            <li> I just rinse down the shower.</li>
            <li> I use mine in the shower so the dripping water complaints down the elbow don&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> YOu need to insert it in your mouth, bend your head down, and turn the appliance on.</li>
            <li> As they wear down there is a noticable decrease in the waterjet power, at which point setting #1 or 2 both feel weak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaking it pulled it down.</li>
            <li> The other 5 star reviews explain how I feel!</li>
            <li> The single control switch should be placed differently though - it seems rather poorly placed.</li>
            <li> If you have the water-pik set to a strong setting you might be disappointed with the pressure.</li>
            <li> Its little door falls off and is hard to put back on.</li>
            <li> After a while, even a little bit of standing water will get yucky inside and leave gunk especially if you have hard water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read other reviews that said it was messy, but I figured maybe it was just clumsiness or user error (no offense).</li>
            <li> Note the WaterPik cordless models (WP360, WP450) have  a 110-120 vac charger rating rather than the 110-240 vac that all my other plug-in portable devices have, so the WaterPik can&#x27;t be used in Europe with a plug adapter; you&#x27;d need a (heavy and bulky) step-down transformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works very well for a battery portable unit, water flossing really is a bad term for this unit, this is too remove lodged food particles between your teeth only, for a heathy mouth you still must floss and brush to remove food debris  and film, because this will become plaque, and no amount of brushing can remove&lt;br /&gt;Plaque</li>
            <li> i read about the black mold issue that Panasonic just could not address, so it sits out in 2 parts on my counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through two waterpik products in less than two years - work</li>
            <li> However, the waterpik dies after half a year.</li>
            <li> i have not found a difference in usage between this Panasonic and the ones i used previously.</li>
            <li> I stand by all I said in my previous review below.  </li>
            <li> alot less  inexpensive than anywhere  else  on earth.</li>
            <li> I use a Hydro floss at home but needed something less bulky for travel.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with the previous model which died days before the 2-year warranty was up, this irrigator works well.</li>
            <li> note that the angle of the spray head and how you hold it will be slightly awkward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The previous irrigators that I purchased had battery issues.  </li>
            <li> My previous items lasted for a year or less.  </li>
            <li> Have had 3 (2 warranty replacements) in less than 3 years.</li>
            <li> life is around a week and a half with two people using it.</li>
            <li> Place the tip into my mouth, keeping my teeth together, but my lips slightly apart on one side&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> ,the storage water is so less that</li>
            <li> I may not be typical user as my dentist has advised me to turn up my Waterpik to the max because of my teeth crowding.</li>
            <li> My previous models were battery hogs requiring replacement every three or four days.</li>
            <li> I used this item less than 10 times in 40 days.&lt;br /&gt;There is no return to Amazon on this item after 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have gotten black mold inside before you have to store it with the trap door</li>
            <li> The water pressure is extremely weak or low, due to a portable battery energy source.</li>
            <li> (Black)</li>
            <li> so it ends up being about half the size.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I found myself anticipating the arrival, which was less than 7 days.  </li>
            <li> I previously purchased a waterpik rechargeable version of this product and after about 3-4 months the battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Anyway this product is a big improvement over the last one I bought that didn&#x27;t work and I failed to return it within the return period.</li>
            <li> Just buy a typical rechargeable batteries and have extras so that you won&#x27;t ever had it run out of &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> My previous experience with &amp;#34;Oral Irrigators&amp;#34; was that they are &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; and splash water all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is so less bulky than the counter waterpiks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin steam of water jet with pulsating action removes all food particles from narrow gaps between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I got it half price as the deal of the day</li>
            <li> After using the Panasonic Irrigator my dentist noticed an improvement in my gums and much less tartar.</li>
            <li> I previously had an electronic irrigator (that wasn&#x27;t portable) for about six years.</li>
            <li> This of course means that the reservoir is not adequate and I end up filling it 3-4 times on one use.</li>
            <li> Takes less than a minute to do the job.</li>
            <li> I wanted to occupy less space than the Panasonic oral irrigator ---</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two previous versions</li>
            <li> and I went with this one because of the reliability of the previous models.  </li>
            <li> Both of the previous Panasonics I&#x27;ve owned did not die...</li>
            <li> It holds less than a 1/4 cup of water.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Waterpik</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d take half star off the rating, but since Amazon does not offer increments of half star rating, I&#x27;ll leave it at 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Previously I had a battery operated Conair InterPLak WJ3CS for years</li>
            <li> the water container is half the size of the conair , like 165 ml something like that, the conair has 300 ml</li>
            <li> It takes less space in my sink area than the conair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gums became stronger and less bleeding.</li>
            <li> But that I can overlook; black mold I cannot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy, with big hands, and it&#x27;s uncomfortable even for me to hold.  </li>
            <li> So less stress for me.</li>
            <li> I used it less than 10 times.</li>
            <li> I take off the silly little tank, and then attach a 2-3ft vinyl tube with an inside diameter the same size as the outside diameter of the unit&#x27;s tube.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it gets a little messy.</li>
            <li> If there were batteries inside, removing the cap would have been a matter of tapping the unit on a hard surface and the weight of the batteries would have forced the cap off, but with an empty compartment it&#x27;s a different story.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend also uses it to clean tonsil pockets (though he did say it was a little painful)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not expecting the ensuing mess, you might frantically try to turn it off again.</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ve probably moved your finger away from the switch, so you have to find it again while simultaneously trying to manage the watery mess.</li>
            <li> and it creating a mess</li>
            <li> Some may find the reservoir on the small side, but it is not really an issue with me.</li>
            <li> How the hell do you all use this without making a mess?</li>
            <li> It was unweildy and made a soaking mess.  </li>
            <li> Still not a good enough reason to not purchase.</li>
            <li> No need to mess with charging cords and AC adapters.  </li>
            <li> It is completly WATERPROOF, so you can use it in the shower &amp; not make any mess at all.</li>
            <li> When I first put it together it seemed awkward, but it was designed for travel so can&#x27;t have everything prefect.  </li>
            <li> I would rate 5 star if it were a little less bulky.  </li>
            <li> with a little less spray pressure .</li>
            <li> Had two waterpiks who both broke down after a few months, and changed to the Panasonic after that.</li>
            <li> Portable and no special batteries required.</li>
            <li> THE BUTTON IS TO TIGHT</li>
            <li> I have teeth that have gaps between them and teeth that are too tight</li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s defense I do have tight teeth</li>
            <li> However, the size of the thing it is a little awkward at first.</li>
            <li> then last year bought a rechargeable cordless waterpik - w/in a year couldn&#x27;t hold charge, recharging base was an irritant due to cord, obviously need to be near outlet, reservoir small and challenge to refill.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a highly recommended item!it for a few seconds before using it because there was stale and stinky water inside the system -</li>
            <li> But this new model arrived with the cover of the battery compartment unable to be opened.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first after reading some of the reviews-- someone had said the button was too hard to move and they had problems turning it off.</li>
            <li> i used it every night , the only thing was i had to fill it at least 2 times, but i feel that was a small thing to do considering the benfit i recieved.</li>
            <li> It is extremely messy for a small child to use, which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> once a week, it does tend to get a little gunky.  </li>
            <li> I never had an irrigator before, so I was a little worried.</li>
            <li> Takes up little space on bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I tried to make this work but the little door where you fill the water compartment would not stay shut.</li>
            <li> This little machine acts like a combination of dental floss and a power washer.</li>
            <li> This little irrigator does just what it says.</li>
            <li> It is weak &amp; low quality.</li>
            <li> It also had a little storage compartment for the pick jet.</li>
            <li> A smaller resevoir, you could not collapse it for travel, and the water flow was weak.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to the water tank and getting it positioned so it seals correctly.</li>
            <li> , so we have each ours; they have neat little color rings to identify them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t travel much so of little use to me.</li>
            <li> But the grip for water force control is a little bit slippery.</li>
            <li> Lacking a little amount of water, but the water pressure in portability and want to give 5 points.</li>
            <li> Recharging the battery made little, or no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had problems with little particles getting between my teeth,  </li>
            <li> It works as advertised, it  takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> I hope I can get used to it because it hurts a little.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes add a little mouthwash in the water to give a fresher feeling to my mouth.</li>
            <li> small, compare to other waterpiks.</li>
            <li> The little door on the unit keeps falling off  </li>
            <li> The water tank is a little bit too small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is a little bit bulky to carry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was while perusing Amazon for the Waterpik that I came across this little gem.</li>
            <li> You know the batteries are drained when the water force becomes weak at the third setting.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus, the tip stores in a little channel on the side</li>
            <li> Little did he know, I&#x27;ve quit all that</li>
            <li> It is a little lacking in power.</li>
            <li> It has never clogged and I add a little peroxide periodically.  </li>
            <li> I put a little mouthwash in the container.  </li>
            <li> I like this little thing..</li>
            <li> The thinghy itself is a little flumsy...</li>
            <li> Need a little getting use to to ensure that the sprayed water stays in the mouth.</li>
            <li> i just put a little mouthwash in it and fill the remainder with water.  </li>
            <li> If you tip it a little it spills too.  </li>
            <li> When you extend it, you&#x27;ll feel a little click that tells you the unit is locked in a fully-open position.....</li>
            <li> The little hinged door that opens for fulling is flimsy, I expect it will break after repeated use and Panasonic will not have a replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have several bridges that make it very hard to get the floss in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular water pics for years and was tired of the mess and size.  </li>
            <li> I is a little hard to turn off when you are done and your hands are wet.  </li>
            <li> But..... it was less expensive and will probably last at least several years.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to collapse and hard to open fully.  </li>
            <li> because my bathroom bench space is limited)I&#x27;ll be storing my Waterpik for use if the Panasonic does break down and while waiting for a replacement!</li>
            <li> I need to irrigate regularly and this was so convenient for a recent 11 day trip where the standard electric irrigator would have been very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Batteries died quickly, not very powerful</li>
            <li> Works extremely well -- gets out food that brushing and flossing don&#x27;t get to -- a must if you eat a lot of popcorn!!  </li>
            <li> ♦ Switch is a little difficult for a 6 year old to work, but not too</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if you are like me and prefer lukewarm water to be jetting inside your mouth, you will have a nasty surprise of COLD older water for the first split second when you use it the next time!</li>
            <li> Too bad, as I am now in Europe might not be worth returning it, even if it has 2 years warrantee.</li>
            <li> the corded one would just be too crazy at the sink - especially when trying to get the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I relied on a needle-less syringe to remove particles from under the bridges - a somewhat tedious exercise, as you might imagine, and only partially satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for a few months.</li>
            <li> I experimented a few times before taking it on the road to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> it is a bit messy but works well.</li>
            <li> I got the idea for this portable type from one of my patients who uses it for her developmentally disabled child.  </li>
            <li> I got this to replace my Panasonic EW1270AC which I&#x27;d had for a few years.  </li>
            <li> is&#x27;t about the size of a round hairbrush)   2.</li>
            <li> Look somewhere else, please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> No free lunch.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this waterpick since a few month and it has been working flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the people who say it&#x27;s messy to use.  </li>
            <li> I tried flossing a few times after using the irrigator and there were no leftovers.</li>
            <li> Once I rush to meetings and just throw the unit in my drawer without discharging redundant water.</li>
            <li> Also affordable to replace every few years.</li>
            <li> So you will need to refill quite a few times per session.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> But like my Waterpik/Flosser for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It could get messy if you just jump into using it.  </li>
            <li> After storing mine for a few months (I take it on trips as a substitute for my countertop Waterpik)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because it is messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun irrigator for a few years</li>
            <li> Messy to use unless you do it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Extremely messy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my daughter was having trouble getting food out of her dental appliance.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Both broken shortly after 1 year of use.</li>
            <li> It is too much trouble to return it, so</li>
            <li> short, it&#x27;s useable, but a poor replacement for an AC unit for home use.  </li>
            <li> Of course I splashed myself &amp; the mirror with water a few times...</li>
            <li> When I say messy</li>
            <li> I would have expected at least 6+ months of usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a few problems popping up with my teeth, that said, I pulled out my ancient WaterPik</li>
            <li> that was messy and user</li>
            <li> It also was rather messy to use.</li>
            <li> This the second one of these that has broken within six months.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it every day, gums start to give  trouble.</li>
            <li> I have lots of trouble with food getting caught in my bridges between implants.</li>
            <li> The green section is what holds the water, that you pour in through a closable hole.  </li>
            <li> so I use it in the SHOWER where I can be as messy as</li>
            <li> It is ovoid rather than round like its predecessor</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended I get this since I have a few teeth that are close together and seem to catch food despite flossing.  </li>
            <li> As it is, the option to return EXPIRED 5 days ago, and I&#x27;m stuck with a dead hunk of plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had trouble with my impacted wisdom tooth.</li>
            <li> Panasonice deserves a slap on the head for this waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted the money</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> messy but works.</li>
            <li> Also, the spout does not easily fit into it&#x27;s storage place at the side of the irrigator.</li>
            <li> &gt;♦ Extremely messy for a child to use.  </li>
            <li> I wasted money on two of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not smooth</li>
            <li> , a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> I have had this product for just a few weeks</li>
            <li> he has trouble using dental floss.</li>
            <li> Used everyday in shower...</li>
            <li> and I have purchased a few for my wife and grandchildren.</li>
            <li> but it does the job for a few days.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, buy one with a hose for the water.</li>
            <li> It is messy to fill and</li>
            <li> i use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Having used Waterpik for years with the problem of each unit failing to hold a charge after just a few months, Panasonic has found the solution with a battery operated unit.  </li>
            <li> It removes any food left behind by brushing and&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It helps to soak the tank in 1/2 bleach and water for a few minutes after extended use.</li>
            <li> I found out the motor dead.</li>
            <li> Not a huge issue.</li>
            <li> travelling  - not really a huge problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> The reservoir is a little small but fills quickly so no problem.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that removing the nozzle is not easy, requiring that you must pull hard to get it to come off.  </li>
            <li> Works reasonably well but is a bit uncomfortable to use due to the large size of the base.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a rechargeable portable Waterpik brand and it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Turning the water flow down or off becomes an anxious process.    </li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I used to insist on firm, stiffly bristled toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> During a typically cleaning, I usually have to refill the unit a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> getting food out of hidden places!</li>
            <li> While the Panasonic Oral Irrigator works well, I have been disappointed in how quickly the batteries need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It is a bit bulky and may be difficult for smaller hands to hold as noted in other reviews, but I have not had difficulty with it.</li>
            <li> Tried to make my life easier, but this device is not a true substitute for floss, it helps when you are lazy, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I knew that the giant, expensive waterpik was not right for me.  </li>
            <li> however I like the fact that this product uses plain batteries which eliminates the need for a charging adapter</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is extremely stiff though.</li>
            <li> My units are plain EW-DJ10&#x27;s and not the -A model.</li>
            <li> Not easy at all to turn the power off with the finger/thumb while it&#x27;s being used.</li>
            <li> Fills up easily, no issues.</li>
            <li> No easy way to fix.</li>
            <li> would note that my dental hygienist recommends using this type appliance to remove food particles not easily removed by flossing.  </li>
            <li> A little bulky for small hands.</li>
            <li> The tank volume is a little bit small that I have to fill in 2-3 cycles every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Made a mess in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> It is small and takes up little space in my luggage.</li>
            <li> that was a major disappointment due to the lack of power.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it uses disposable batteries since I&#x27;ve had poor luck with rechargeable portable irrigators from Waterpik (they have two different models and both were horrible)</li>
            <li> I have owned a few water pik water flossers in the past but this one is the handiest.</li>
            <li> down side of this is the switch which feels clumsy to me.  </li>
            <li> This one will cut down the flossing time at least one forth compared to doing with thread in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Too bad as it was a great idea, albeit put together in a non-lasting manner by idiots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used (multiple) rechargeable Waterpiks for years, and after being frustrated with their low quality I bought one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not easily used as water squirts all over when trying to do small spaces</li>
            <li> but this little thing!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my very old and dirty Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I bought the irrigator after having wire mesh placed across six of my teeth which had come loose because I fell on a sidewalk and my jaw was also broken.</li>
            <li> it would mean the unit is getting 0.6 less volts than if alkaline batteries were used.</li>
            <li> but I must say that it can be a little hard on your gums.</li>
            <li> and I found it a little hard to use it correctly, cleanning my teeth without hurting them.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Oral Irrigator is efficient, has two speeds, takes up very little space and is portable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taking very little space on the counter.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space on the bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient because it takes up very little counter space, and doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in.</li>
            <li> It became sluggish and had very little pressure after that.</li>
            <li> It was hard to fill and messy to use.  </li>
            <li> So stupidly designed because of a ridiculously small water tank/holder that you get about 20 seconds worth of water/spray.  </li>
            <li> It is very convenient to use, the place with bad is too power-hungry, often should change the battery.</li>
            <li> I sometimes worry about whether all the water drains or not, but for e past cole months I have not had any problems nor reason to worry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to mention names, there are not many on the market.</li>
            <li> but they make things that i actually want to buy and use sadly..</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it takes ordinary AA batteries.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small, compact and convenient.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my small bathroom as well but that, as you read, can&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion for the manufacturer would be to include a take along bag for it, for buyer convenience, but it wasn&#x27;t difficult to come up with one myself.  </li>
            <li> I find it easier than flossing, although I&#x27;m not sure that it is a substitute for flossing.</li>
            <li> The 2 speed switch is silly, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using the low power setting.  </li>
            <li> usually  I take the seller for their  word .</li>
            <li> Packs up small.</li>
            <li> Rechargeable batteries are usually 1.2 volts, not 1.5 volts like alkaline batteries are so with 2 batteries installed</li>
            <li> The product is so long, heavy, and unwieldy that it is extremely difficult to aim inside your mouth&lt;</li>
            <li> The tank quantity is small</li>
            <li> No more bleeding either.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the collapsible design.</li>
            <li> Not sure why others are complaining about this unless they are spending a minute or two on each tooth.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but the amount of water flow during use seems a bit excessive.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up getting water all over my clothes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two Waterpiks in the past and they stopped running after about two months.</li>
            <li> Usually it just needed a change in battery.</li>
            <li> Then the recharging port failed, and after reading up on it, it seems to be an ongoing problem with the device, yet they continue to sell the same item.</li>
            <li> The water tank is small</li>
            <li> I have two daughters who are both in braces who share a small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Changed batteries twice but no luck and of course past warranty.</li>
            <li> I like the size of this product because it is small, portable and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> No more Panasonics for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every day for the past month</li>
            <li> No more problems.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is small, so I needed something compact.</li>
            <li> Water reservoir is small, so need refill 2 to 3 times for each use.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount of mouth wash in the water.</li>
            <li> This oral irrigator works well as I&#x27;ve owned a plug-in type waterpik in the past</li>
            <li> (faster setting)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this comment in a few months!</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of finding the lazy way out of flossing.</li>
            <li> The last cordless flosser only lasted five months and the reservoir was difficult to fill and difficult to drain.</li>
            <li> maybe via some slick folding reservoir).</li>
            <li> There is a small cap that opens up the chamber to fill with water and/or mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I usually use mine in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have owned over the past 20 years 4 Panasonic irrigators.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not OK with using devices that require disposable batteries when they could be powered by rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> Small size is convenient to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The reviews asking about the noise is meaningless as it only runs for 40 Seconds.  </li>
            <li> The contain is too small.</li>
            <li> The size is not that small</li>
            <li> Only one drawback is the expensive accessories.</li>
            <li> small portable, and comes with a set of batteries.  </li>
            <li> however after few weeks it&#x27;s weaker but than you can change the battery !</li>
            <li> Folds up really small for traveling.  </li>
            <li> so it fits into my small bag.</li>
            <li> Remove the flosser tip by pressing the button on the side (I was lazy and didnt read the instructions and was freaking out because I couldnt get it</li>
            <li> Just got this and have used it for the past week.</li>
            <li> I also notice that mold is building up on the inside of the water container, and not exactly sure how to get it out.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it can be difficult to open if the pick head shifts in its holding spot.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it after reading many horrible reviews on the portable Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;concerning</li>
            <li> Reservior  small.  </li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Small reservoir.  </li>
            <li> Even the low speed is just slightly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> this arrived and I was unable to open the battery cover to insert batteries.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it is small, I can take it anywhere in the world and all I need are batteries.</li>
            <li> It was no better than swishing water in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Works well, I usually fill it 2 or 3 times per treatment.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether it will affect the component</li>
            <li> SMALL BODY WITH AMPLE POWER</li>
            <li> sadly, they will last 5 times, but anyway they are rechagible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really much better.</li>
            <li> I have also added small amount of hydrogen peroxide to expedite the healing of my gums even though it is not recommended by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> with small footprint on sink counter.</li>
            <li> and I usually use about 3 refills each time</li>
            <li> Folds up into a small size (the nozzle fits inside the outer shell.  </li>
            <li> rather bulky -- small reservoir -- would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> I cannot get it back into the flosser, so it is useless at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two (2) of these irrigators in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESNT PERFORM UP TO ITS STANDARD.</li>
            <li> In those two years I bought and used 2 different rechargable Waterpik flossers, both of which refused to charge after a few months (a common problem) and became expensive trash.  </li>
            <li> AS USUAL PURCHASING FROM AMAZON ...............  </li>
            <li> WORKS WELL FOR BEING SMALL.  </li>
            <li> This is almost impossible to deactivate without looking, which means you have to take a high pressure water jet out of your mouth just to deactivate it</li>
            <li> Ill designed (I am an engineer) gets dirty in hard to clean crevices.</li>
            <li> My Teledyne Portable WaterPik broke after very few uses.  </li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> doing it&#x27;s job - just very messily, and not quite as well as a competing product.</li>
            <li> The built-in rechargeable batteries in the Waterpik only last for 2 uses before needing a recharge, very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> But could never find it again and was not happy with any of the other &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; travel models, because of their size and bulk.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad: it seems to chew through batteries (2 AA) fairly quickly and the power switch can be a little difficult to operate</li>
            <li> believe the Panasonic Oral Irrigator suffers from a major design flaw: the power switch.</li>
            <li> Even when it was working was not very good.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not a very good Oral Irrigator</li>
            <li> but it is too expensive to keep replacing them every few months for no reason other than they just stop turning on.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this irrigator to anyone who has used water pics in the past and is tired of the mess and counter space they take up</li>
            <li> Not suitable for using it at the sink.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much worthless because it is so underpowered, delivering perhaps one-third the water stream that a full-size plug-in irrigator does, like Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Was the first time ever I  used an Oral irrigator in my life and it felt violent in my mouth, but.</li>
            <li> fact, providing it hasn&#x27;t broken down by the time I return from a forthcoming</li>
            <li> The base is quite large -not appropriate for kids</li>
            <li> Toward the end of a cycle the batteries get a little weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful with my belongings, and am disappointed by this device&#x27;s short life.</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic personal health care products in the past and none have been so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Nearly impossible to direct the water jet to where you want it.  </li>
            <li> The stream was weak and did not remove particles that were heavily stuck.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s running weak after just a few months of use</li>
            <li> It helps get to places that are impossible to get to otherwise - i.e., under a bridge which otherwise requires those stupid plastic needles that you have to thread under the bridge, something most people won&#x27;t go to the trouble of doing.  </li>
            <li> I got braces at 45 and had a hard time with flossing, this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> When I read the complaints that the pressure was too hard, I knew this was the one for me.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an oral irrigator as a means of reducing enamel wear from brushing too hard and as an adjunct to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to use floss to prevent my teeth from bleeding but it is so hard to use floss every day.</li>
            <li> to use and cleans some hard to reach places</li>
            <li> This means it is hard to wipe the water inside using a paper.</li>
            <li> it was not which made it hard to use.</li>
            <li> It suits my needs to a T and it hardly takes up any space at all on the vanity.</li>
            <li> HARD  </li>
            <li> Off/on switch hard to use with my arthritis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having a dull toothache for months now and have been putting off visiting a dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still having hard time to taking out the nozzle after using it.</li>
            <li> Did I mention I discovered this the hard way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used this product so it&#x27;s hard to comment at this time.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to see.</li>
            <li> Hard to hold onto.  </li>
            <li> to use it properly, at least for my mouth, it&#x27;s hard to avoid spraying water everywhere.</li>
            <li> For one who has a filling in every tooth, this product came uears too late.  </li>
            <li> So if you use a product like this, be open minded and forget the water-pi.., oops I almost said that name, try the panasonic, you won&#x27;t be unhappy.</li>
            <li> The batteries need to be changed at least monthly with two users.</li>
            <li> shutting off the unit is extremely difficult once your hand and irrigator are wet from irrigating.  </li>
            <li> A bit clumsy but manageable.</li>
            <li> I use the irrigator at least once a day and often twice a day.  </li>
            <li> They reduced the voltage by 0.3 volts, and after trying again, the irrigator no longer felt like it was cutting my gums away, but the diodes would heat up, and the 14500 li-ion battery would fade as before, plus that battery would only get through two days of lunch cleaning before it needed recharging (I could use the NiMH batteries for two weeks without problem).    </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> the water tank holds and is sealed nicely, no dripping or water running out while in the suitcase if I did not have time to let it sit and drain.   </li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained about the size of the water reservoir.</li>
            <li> Panasonic unit appears well made and works as advertised with the added convenience of using common AA batteries.</li>
            <li> A set of batteries lasts at least a month,</li>
            <li> It is awkward to handle, since you are holding the entire unit.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> At least the DDS has gotten off my case about flossing so he must see a difference or maybe just gave up.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it has to be refilled at least once</li>
            <li> have complained about mold in the tank</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minor complaint -</li>
            <li> how to operate this unit is not tricky, just use your common sense, otherwise read the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> model replaced one which I had had for at least 10 years</li>
            <li> A bit clumsy to hold</li>
            <li> I find I need at least two fills per cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic unit has a quick/easy refill, folds up and takes replaceable batteries (you can always put rechargable AA&#x27;s in it, at least they&#x27;re serviceable).</li>
            <li> Let the unit sit for at least 1 hour and then run the rest of the solution through it.</li>
            <li> Some people had complained about the lack of power.</li>
            <li> I think she is using at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> Note, this is a common issue with all water based flossers.</li>
            <li> Even the slow speed on the Water Pik makes me cringe to use it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just a slow learner in terms of how to angle the pik.</li>
            <li> The increased water pressure has forced an opening under my gumline between two front teeth causing bleeding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast-or-slow, that&#x27;s it; and \\&quot;slow\\&quot; is rather slow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s noisy, messy and gets poor battery life - but-</li>
            <li> It seems that the stream is too thick, it should be pressurized in order to reduce the waterfall effect.</li>
            <li> I have tooth pain from fillings slowly falling apart.</li>
            <li> The other problem is one container of water is not enough for me and it is annoying to have to refill it.</li>
            <li> What I mean by \\&quot;messy\\&quot; is that you&#x27;re going to get water everywhere.</li>
            <li> No more Panasonic for me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I mean water flying all over the place.</li>
            <li> The directions say don&#x27;t use rechargeable batteries, and they mean it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit shallow, and hard to push on with one finger.  </li>
            <li> Small capacity/high output !</li>
            <li> Planned failure of consumer devices is a pox on our culture these days.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bundle on a replacement and wasn&#x27;t adverse to saving space in our very small (no countertop) bathroom.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is very small and I have no counter space, just a Pullman style sink.  </li>
            <li> A complete disappointment!</li>
            <li> : The water container folds up into the device, which is very small when self contained.</li>
            <li> find these bulky units very difficult to use - as has been commented on by earlier reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Also the water flow adjustments make it much less painful than the other brands.</li>
            <li> And this one is a lot less expensive, and has no charger to worry about.</li>
            <li> Serious feature lacking in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slippery plastic, and fits so tightly that it&#x27;s difficult to grip without slippage.  </li>
            <li> A little weird for me, but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just had bad luck, but I am now shopping for a different brand.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing because it can separate your gums from your teeth causing pocket</li>
            <li> If it can&#x27;t be cleaned it will have to be replaced - not a good deal.</li>
            <li> BTW, the Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks work really well, and have now taken the place of the hated flossing for me.</li>
            <li> I would always run it for a few seconds before using it because there was stale and stinky water inside the system -</li>
            <li> I came back to take another look at them and was shocked to see I had paid this amount for this toy.</li>
            <li> this unit is butt ugly from its clinical blue to its ungainly shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> No more lectures from the Dental Hygenist about not flossing enough (I hate flossing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this will hold up over the long run, but it has already lasted longer than my Waterpik brand that failed after two weeks - and I waited another two weeks for a replacement - and the replacement failed after another two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit messy but if you stick with it its gets easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> I suppose that any product as dreadfully named as the Panasonic EW-DJ10-A is a product that&#x27;s likely to perform its intended task with single minded efficiency.  </li>
            <li> It is bulky and awkward to use and just not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> tooth hardly wobbles!  </li>
            <li> After using this for about three days, my dull toothache disappeared!</li>
            <li> They break and fail and are engineered like a cheap piece of crap!!!</li>
            <li> The first week I used it, I could not believe the horrible tasting crud that was hiding under my gum line!  </li>
            <li> I periodically soak it in a weak bleach water solution to rid it of any mildew that accumulates.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get the dumb thing apart to see if it&#x27;s plugged up.</li>
            <li> Battery operated, so understandably it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, small reservoir.  </li>
            <li> Cannot think about anything to complaint this oral tools!</li>
            <li> But the power at the highest level is so weak it doesn&#x27;t get the stuff out from between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This has a weak flow at the highest pressure setting</li>
            <li> at some points I can&#x27;t even tell where the water is hitting because it is so weak.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to handle.</li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO US.</li>
            <li> The off/on switch is very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> The water leaks and injection is very hard to control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to shut off after used if you don&#x27;t use all the water you put in it, you will spray water everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Fill up with water before attaching the flosser tip because it fits in your sink less awkwardly.  </li>
            <li> Not too tough to refill for another shot if needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the level 1 water pressure setting, as my gums aren&#x27;t really tough yet.</li>
            <li> but I have tough time with that.  </li>
            <li> Still worked very slowly.  </li>
            <li> Guess I am a bit undecided about the usefulness of this irrigation, but it is messy, as water sprays from your mouth and goes everywhere!!!  </li>
            <li> It was a little awkward.</li>
            <li> A little awkward to use, the tank is the handle, time will tell how dependable it is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use cold water it hurts and its a little tricky to put the batteries in.</li>
            <li> The reason I chose a 4 is because it is a little bit awkward in my hand.</li>
            <li> The repalcement tip is hard to get and expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want my water pik to get broken in transit.  </li>
            <li> this unit is frustrating to operate for a beginner.  </li>
            <li> They start to charge poorly, and than don&#x27;t charge at all.</li>
            <li> I was just tired of buying them.</li>
            <li> you could be making it worse.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not happy with doing this each and every time you use the unit, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep it with me because I hate poking a finger at the back of the mouth when some food is stuck.</li>
            <li> Seems to do its job, but rather awkward and messy to use.</li>
            <li> It works well and  removes food particles that flossing leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I really like how this item works, however, after awhile it does tend to trap a lot of moisture which in turns leads to the awful smell of mildew or mold.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic will not stand behind this product.</li>
            <li> I find the slow speed useless.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist was not terribly happy when I told her that I don&#x27;t floss.  </li>
            <li> showed up broken</li>
            <li> I always have spare batteries on me (either in my house or car), so there won&#x27;t be any cases of poor timing when I want to use it</li>
            <li> Not a great fan of the operating button.  </li>
            <li> For over 10 years, I used the Waterpik Ultra Cordless &amp; was fed up replacing them about once every year &amp; 1/2 for approximately $45.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Besides I know from experience that unlike Amazon, Panasonic doesn&#x27;t stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> The charging system is poorly designed /</li>
            <li> IT IS POORLY DESIGNED AND LEAKS WATER ALL OVER WHEN USED.</li>
            <li> Batteries need changing every 6 months approximately.</li>
            <li> no worries about current/voltage compatibility nor an adaptor plug ... hate those english outlets).  </li>
            <li> Key feature was the reservoir which - for traveling - inverted over the base power unit.  </li>
            <li> I had a \\&quot;wired\\&quot; model that my dentist gave me and it was so sloppy and cumbersome</li>
            <li> Another annoying thing about a rechargeable unit is that eventually the rechargeable batteries fade and would not hold a charge long ....</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find some black fungus growing in the tank.</li>
            <li> It was painful, and since my teeth are slightly crowded</li>
            <li> I remove the reservoir (don&#x27;t be afraid to pull really hard) and soak it in bleach.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to say the least.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a small waterpik.batteries impossible to replace.collapses on itself during use.</li>
            <li> Might have been a bad unit, not sure.</li>
            <li> I had a countertop irrigator for a long time and although it worked I hated the cleanup and dust collection factors.  </li>
            <li> I have a permanent retainer and it makes flossing really tough!</li>
            <li> This unit is battery driven and very weak.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little unwieldy at the base</li>
            <li> The item did a mediocre job.</li>
            <li> for the price, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> THEY KEEP GETTING WORSE !  </li>
            <li> Just a bunch of poor quality parts about to break!  </li>
            <li> Flossing is difficult for me</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The on off switch is difficult to use when water is pulsing out of the irrigator.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this</li>
            <li> It completely failed to get anything out of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another way the unit can fail is the motor.</li>
            <li> I thought it was weird looking</li>
            <li> If anything goes wrong with it, i will update.   </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this piece o&#x27;crap.</li>
            <li> The problem: the portable waterpik is so WEAK as to be useless!  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worked well for about a year.</li>
            <li> Failed w/ after 20 uses / 5 months.  </li>
            <li> I found this product difficult to use and cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> Together I also bought Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser which wouldn&#x27;t even start (something appears terribly wrong with the power switch).</li>
            <li> Difficult to operate.</li>
            <li> I found them all to be quite expensive, so I decided to continue to use the Panasonic portable all the time.</li>
            <li> I purchase one about every three months as the pump fails so often.</li>
            <li> I guess if you aim it wrong, you could do some damage to your periodontal pockets (?),</li>
            <li> This item worked about one month and then failed.  </li>
            <li> and therefor it is difficult to use the switch.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> My unit failed in 40 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to figure out what goes wrong but have been unable to do so.  </li>
            <li> I still have all of them and cleaning can be really difficult at times.</li>
            <li> My portable Waterpick lasted about 9 months before the battery began to fail.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought this.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to drain for cleaning.</li>
            <li> The on off button is in the wrong place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this</li>
            <li> Turnes out there was nothing wrong with the unit I replaced.  </li>
            <li> Unable to locate it in any stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I failed to use it every day.  </li>
            <li> but I was unable to remove to battery cover</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to fill in the shower.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Actually painful, to my gums at least.</li>
            <li> Silly me...</li>
            <li> and then the thing is useless.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they have improved it by now, but the design is basically flawed.</li>
            <li> But it is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped charging after about 1 1/2 years and is now completely useless since it doesn&#x27;t even operate when plugged in (by design).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but I&#x27;m going to toss it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product, for its price, works as well as the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I have a bridge in my mouth &amp; have a difficult time flossing under it.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like, is where the on and off buttons are which makes it uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t really go wrong with the quality of its performance compared to its price.</li>
            <li> False!  </li>
            <li> THE BATTERY OPENING IS ALSO POORLY DESIGNED AND CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO.</li>
            <li> bad part is that it is a poor choice for home use.  </li>
            <li> the tip is difficult to pull out, making it inconvenient to share with another person.</li>
            <li> This product seems carefully designed to be the worst irrigator</li>
            <li> Awkward and uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Shape makes it awkward do use, and the on/off switch is difficult to operate.</li>
            <li> Especially hard to get to the backs of</li>
            <li> it was too late although Amazon tells me it can be canceled AMAZON LIES!!!</li>
            <li> to get particles out so you have dirty water to rinse mouth.</li>
            <li> I did have to hack the spout though by cutting about a half-inch off the tip.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is awkward to hold and maneuver in the mouth and</li>
            <li> am afraid to store it all neatly put together as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This unit sucked up batteries like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste has micro-fine silica, and I was afraid that in a pressure washer like this irrigator it would blast away enamel and dental work.</li>
            <li> Bis disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Besides, it&#x27;s so inconvenient to use 2 AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> The product itself was somewhat disappointing.</li>
            <li> Or, you&#x27;ll have to awkwardly hold it while you fumble for the off position, and that area of the tooth/gums get blasted a bit too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just stinks from mildew.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted customer service</li>
            <li> My dentist  did numb my mouth for it</li>
            <li> My mother in law recommended this after I bought a waterpik, and was unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> The control switch is in an awkward position.  </li>
            <li> Unhappy that product can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment for me</li>
            <li> If you have an area that always gets food stuck between your teeth, this Panasonic Oral Irrigator is just what you need to remove the particles that drive you crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> while it does the trick this model is a bit awkward to use without squirting water all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> but it drives me crazy when I travel and can&#x27;t take care of the food even with dental floss.  </li>
            <li> that I was going crazy trying to keep food out between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> switch is awkward while you are using it.  </li>
            <li> this is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> An awful mess!</li>
            <li> However, over the years the water tank began to have an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> I must admit that I was very skeptical when I bought it</li>
            <li> This product eats batteries so it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> and this is very difficult with this unit.</li>
            <li> As a result I canceled that idiotic surgery, decided to drastically change my oral hygiene, had another root scaling and planing, and made an appointment for a LANAP procedure.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to use it at the sink.  </li>
            <li> Be warned: The battery cap was virtually impossible to remove when the item arrived.</li>
            <li> The tooth was so bad that it moved if I touched it with my tongue.  </li>
            <li> This is an offensively bad product.</li>
            <li> product is a joke, it doesn&#x27;t even come close to working, it is designed so badly that I am stunned it ever made it out the door, and it came covered in something that smelled and tasted like rancid vomit.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because the item works well,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not taking Motrin because I picked my gums badly.</li>
            <li> The answer if your a bad flosser.  </li>
            <li> I use floss picks throughout the day, but they still had a tendency to be a source of bad breath for me.</li>
            <li> It must have bad design.</li>
            <li> I had a root scaling and planing and continued with my bad habits thinking that the problem will disappear.</li>
            <li> Too bad...</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t take rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> Bad experience...</li>
            <li> I bought it because I&#x27;ve had bad luck with the rechargable water pik.  </li>
            <li> The bad thing (in my opinion) is that the pressure is way too week.</li>
            <li> Are all my batteries bad?</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this atrocious product, donate the money to charity instead.  </li>
            <li> it was painful.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be shocked at what it \\&quot;irrigates\\&quot; out from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> buyer beware because you can get sick from that mold.</li>
            <li> It grew a disgusting black mold in the reservoir and smelled real bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked for 6months :(</li>
            <li> my dentist will be like crazy when she see my mouth!</li>
            <li> So disappointed since now I can&#x27;t use on a trip and have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I was frankly a bit disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed with the power supplied.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the unit and can not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I looked for water piks for month but couldn&#x27;t see spending $50 on one that seemed very awkward and troublesome.</li>
            <li> It is very inconvenient to use as the bottle is attached to the spray unit.</li>
            <li> It was very inconvenient to use</li>
            <li> The sliding power level is stupid.</li>
            <li> Errors on attempting to access the knowledge base.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing so my dentist recommended a water pik.  </li>
            <li> I wish this had a base with a wand attached, but was still compact and ran on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> annoying............</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the worst water pic, and it gets dirty inside.  </li>
            <li> Used to use Water Pik years ago but hated the ugly thing sitting on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing and the DDS is always all over my case to do it, so I got one of these.  </li>
            <li> I hate having food stuck in my teeth after I eat</li>
            <li> Now that I have had this for about 6 months, I really hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss and every time I go to the dentist, I get a lecture and lots of scraping off tartar.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing.  </li>
            <li> The base of the Oral irrigator keeps closing on me.</li>
            <li> Besides, hate to floss</li>
            <li> I got all that crap our of around my braces and teeth.  </li>
            <li> The irrigator tip was connected to the base with a hose which neatly coiled, and stored in the reservoir, when not in use.  </li>
            <li> This is terribly annoying since we like these</li>
            <li> This thing is terrible, really annoying to take apart and replace batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought a water pic, but hated it.</li>
            <li> I have always hated flossing.</li>
            <li> I was using a Water Pic and hated the way the tubing wore out</li>

            <li> both my husband and I were very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> WaterPik was the worst...</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t terrible, just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worst piece of garbage ever.</li>
            <li> Beyond awful.</li>
            <li> The worst appliance I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Disgusting but...</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be a horrible event, except it blocks the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a terrible flosser</li>
            <li> you can get nasty mold or orange gunk growing on your irrigator.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product and bought one for my wife as well as my brother. It works great! We all use it daily and it make a big difference. I much prefer it to flossing.</li>
            <li> Works great, I use it in the shower every morning!  It makes my mouth feel like i just went to the dentist.  I got braces at 45 and had a hard time with flossing, this does the trick.  I do change the batteries every two weeks to keep it working up to par.  I also run the blue part and the nozzle through the dishwasher (top rack) once a week, it does tend to get a little gunky.  If it broke i would definitely buy another one!</li>
            <li> The item did a mediocre job. The stream was weak and did not remove particles that were heavily stuck. Didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> I have implants that require irrigation and this does the trick. Would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> This works just fine. My mouth feels a lot better and my hygienist likes the results.</li>
            <li> 2nd time buying this. loved it since could use in shower, totally portable (runs on AA), large reservoir but after several years, water seeped into battery compartment. then last year bought a rechargeable cordless waterpik - w/in a year couldn&#x27;t hold charge, recharging base was an irritant due to cord, obviously need to be near outlet, reservoir small and challenge to refill. using panasonic now for a month, know why i loved it so much before. i use rechargeable battery w/ downside needing to open compartment more risking corrosion. highly recommended, would give it 5 stars if wasn&#x27;t a bit bulky. for the price, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling-- can&#x27;t live without my waterpik on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Much easier to clean than the WaterPik. Also the water flow adjustments make it much less painful than the other brands. Even the slow speed on the Water Pik makes me cringe to use it. The lack of a cord makes it easily portable,  and safer in the bathroom. I tried many other brands before settling on the one. It is also cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good basic irrigator/losser. Battery power lasts quite awhile. Stream of water is strong and effective.</li>
            <li> ......Already like this much better.  It collapses smaller, has more power, uses batteries.Overall I believe this is a product I would have bought first if I&#x27;d not had to stay with the Water-Pik [because 2 others failed within a year and they were good enough to replace]</li>
            <li> we love being able to clean our teeth inside the shower. No worries of water spraying everywhere. Great product, thank you.</li>
            <li> I like this guy because he doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my bathroom counter.  The drawback to that being the water reservoir empties quickly and I have to refill at least once per session. Something I didn&#x27;t think about when i was browsing...not necessarily a draw back but a consequence to small size.  It does was it says and is easy to use no cumbersome charger.  So overall I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> This is a great oral irrigator.  It works on batteries which last a long time and is great for travelling as well as it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a water flosser for years, and I was so excited to get this one. I&#x27;m so disappointed in it. The water chamber is very small and the pressure is just not that good. It does not do what I had hoped - get everything from between teeth. I wish I had returned it because I just don&#x27;t use it like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  My previous irrigator required very regularly charging and then just stopped working.  I suspected this model would not be as powerful as the rechargeable version but it has proved to be just as strong.  Only gripe is that the applicator is a little sharp and will cause bleeding of the gums if you touch them too hard.</li>
            <li> Works fine but eats batteries!!!</li>
            <li> At first this product is great. In a few months of use it gets black particles trapped in the blue case portion.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get particles out so you have dirty water to rinse mouth. I have not been able to find a way to separate the blue portion for a full clean of the product. Until this issue is resolved this product is not recommended.</li>
            <li> I am used to using an electric water irrigator and this one with batteries just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the oomph that the electric does. I take it when I travel as it is better than nothing, but for at home, use an electric one.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic water pic. The first one wore out after 3 years of constant use. Originally bought it for travel, but found I used it more than the big-tank model that was way more expensive. Two-speed does the job and is just much quicker fill and use. Be sure to follow directions to empty the water. Change the batteries once in a while but not as often as you would think. I can only use the low speed when the batteries are fresh; high speed with fresh batteries might loosen a few fillings.</li>
            <li> When flying, packing space is of maximum importance.  I didn&#x27;t want to take up space with my waterpik from home and I didn&#x27;t want my water pik to get broken in transit.  So, I bought this portable model.  I took extra batteries and didn&#x27;t have to use them on my 4 day trip.  I did fill the resevoir 2 times with each use.  Not for everyday use but, as a travel accessory, perfect!</li>
            <li> For one who has a filling in every tooth, this product came uears too late.  Great dental health tool.  Government should provide one for everyone.</li>
            <li> My only difficulty with this item is that the nozzle is hard for me to remove.  It&#x27;s slippery plastic, and fits so tightly that it&#x27;s difficult to grip without slippage.  Perhaps not everyone would have this difficulty, but I had a Panasonic water flosser a long time ago that didn&#x27;t have this problem.  Still, it does a good job of cleaning in conjunction with a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist has a sign in his office:  Q. Do I need to floss all of my teeth?  A. No, just the ones you want to keep.</li>
            <li> I retired my old Panasonic and purchased a new one -so nice to get that strong power stream back which the old one lost over time.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this water pik when I first bought it. It works great, easy to use and gives great pressure.&lt;br /&gt;However within a few months it started acting up and doesn&#x27;t work as well. The battery compartment is all corroded and gross.&lt;br /&gt;Not for long term or everyday use.</li>
            <li> My first water pic. It gets the job done although I imagine the larger ones have a little more force.&lt;br /&gt;Have to fill it twice to do whole mouth...but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling ....just came back from vacation and easy to pack! Couldn&#x27;t do that with more traditional pic.</li>
            <li> Have had similar model same brand for &amp;#62;10 years; bought second for weekend home. After brushing and flossing it still finds food particles to clean out. Great product</li>
            <li> This is a good product although sometimes I need to fill it twice. The advantage to a regular water pik which I have also used is that I can close it up and keep it in my medicine chest.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a while now, and it works just fine. My teeth have just the wrong size gap in a couple of places, and the Panasonic Flosser power spray is very handy to finish what a toothbrush just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a water flosser for my gum issues. I keep this in my shower, as it is too messy to use in the sink, but I love it. Compact, portable and super easy to use. The reservoir holds enough water that I can do my whole mouth without refilling. I wasn&#x27;t sure I would really use this, but since I moved it into the shower, I use it every single day. Love it!!</li>
            <li> And what a great value! I like the compactness of this irrigator, and the spray jets have 2 speeds in case you have softer gums. I sometimes worry about whether all the water drains or not, but for e past cole months I have not had any problems nor reason to worry. I never had an irrigator before, so I was a little worried. This seems to do a great job and not take much space. As an added bonus, it&#x27;s ability to collapse into itself makes travel easier</li>
            <li> I got this product because I just wanted to up my dental hygiene regiment. I love it. It&#x27;s just enough pressure without hurting my gums. The only issue is that it leaks a little as you&#x27;re using it, but other than that I would totally recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> At first, the unit looks  bulky.  However, one must understand that the reservoir volume is necessary, on top of the motor and the batteries.  I would have love a little stronger jet but for a traveling unit, this is a well-designed irrigator.</li>
            <li> This is the second device I have purchased from Amazon.  After seeing my first one, my wife also wanted one.  They work great.  I can&#x27;t believe how much the toothbrush leaves behing.</li>
            <li> Great! I was using the rechargeable ones, which die in 12-18 months. The two AA bateries lasted 40 days, at this rate Panasonic is superior.</li>
            <li> It is small, compact and packs easily. I use it at home every day but also like the portability of it for travel. Works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.  I had an earlier version for several years.  It finally broke and I replaced it and I&#x27;m still happy with it.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Oral Irrigator is efficient, has two speeds, takes up very little space and is portable.  The speed on \\&quot;2\\&quot; is quite strong (with fresh batteries).  The two AA batteries last about one month with daily use.  I am extremely pleased with it.  I wish I had included an order for the second tip along with the original order.</li>
            <li> This battery-operated unit is easy to handle and convenient to store,but it has less power and capacity than wired units.    My dentist considers it adequate for travel use but not for regular at-home use.</li>
            <li> Excellent device, exceeded my expectations! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Oral Irrigator is not meant to be a replacement for the home product, which has a large tank,enabling you to clean your entire tooth surfaces at one time. To do a very good job with the Panasonic you must refill its tank at least 2 times. The force of the cleaning drops as the reservoir is depleted. Therefore, you have to repeat the product on the last teeth done before the refill. In addition, you are warned not to use rechargeable batteries. Regular ones last about 20 minutes. If you are prepared for these limitations, the Oral Irrigator is much better than having nothing and will do its intended job.</li>
            <li> Great time-saver--don&#x27;t have to floss nearly as often! Wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner. Works great and I travel alot and it&#x27;s easy to pack as well. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great tool for the traveller because of its compact size and battery operation.  It works fairly strong as a water-pick but the water container is a little small so one may need to refill it a second time to thouroughly clean the gum. For the money, I think it is a good buy. I used to own the &#x27;waterpik&#x27; model which I also liked but this one is comparable but more compact and the design more clever for travels.</li>
            <li> Looked all over for this item for my husband who has used these for a long time.  No one carried them.  When I finally found someone who could order the pricer was much higher.  He likes this very much and is happy.  So happy I thought of ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase because it is more of a portable/travel irrigator, but was desperate to get my teens to start using.  Their dentist recommended I purchase one because their gums weren&#x27;t as healthy as they could have been.  I knew that it would be a novelty at first, but hoped it was easy enough that they would continue.  Well my youngest (14) is using it every day.  She used it with her braces on and is still with them off.  My son (17) used it every day at first, but then tapered off a bit.  He is still using it once or twice a week, which I figure is better than not at all.  Both of them really like it.  At first they had a little trouble (fun) getting use to the water squiring at them, but with some practice they got it under control.  We haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist for a formal report on the health of their gums, but I can see that their teeth are clean without that white film they tend to miss when they just brush and in between their teeth is nice and clean like they flossed.  Now my husband wants one!  I would definitely purchase one again.  I hope this helps someone with their decision because I count on these reviews when I&#x27;m purchasing an item on line.  I gave it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t personally use it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long it will last but my first impression is that it is really good.right amount of  pressure for daily use..small enuf for travel.easy to use.  Gave it less than 5 stars because the reservoir needs to be re filled for a longer wash . and batteries...cannot use rechargeable as mentioned in the instructions .I think the manufacturer should have put in an option to charge it instead of the consumer spending money on batteries.All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> great for a water pik on the go. already bought a second one to replace the last one. a definite must if a water pik is on your list</li>
            <li> This irrigator was just what I expected and it did a very good job.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for travelling. It has exceeded my expectation. Not only the pressure is greater than my Waterpick, but also easy to carry around. Had it for a month now, I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s so compact that you can travel with it . The design is a marvel . So far I love it .</li>
            <li> We finally wore out our original Panasonic Oral Irrigator and this one works much better with NiMH rechargeable batteries than the old one. It also stays cleaner. The only disadvantage is that the tip rotates too easily so it will turn when it just touches a tooth, the tip stayed in place on the older model. The high speed is about the same as the one speed on the prior model, not sure the purpose of the low speed.</li>
            <li> This dental irrigator works the way you would have antcipated.  Does the job---easy to utilize and inexpensive</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s almost as powerful as my Water Pik that I plug in at home.  The AA batteries are interchangeable with my toothbrush and camera, so it&#x27;s great to bring on vacation.      This is my second Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  I had to replace my first one because the little trap door where you fill it with water popped off and got left behind on my last vacation.  So be aware of that.    They have made a few improvements, including a two stage power switch if you don&#x27;t want to run it full blast.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare as this is my first oral water pik device. The water resovoir is perfect size/easy to use. My mouth feels amazing! Will update as I get more use!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot.  But I&#x27;m blown away.  After a couple of bad times with the \\&quot;leading\\&quot; product, this one is the top pick.  A marvel of design, it performs flawlessly and collapses into almost nothing for travel.</li>
            <li> I thought a portable unit would help me decide whether or not to invest in a more expensive version.  Not the case - this unit is frustrating to operate for a beginner.  An experienced user may have different feelings</li>
            <li> Our old Waterpic finally fell apart after years of service. The pressure on the thing could knock your eye out if you didn&#x27;t aim carefully! I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bundle on a replacement and wasn&#x27;t adverse to saving space in our very small (no countertop) bathroom. I decided the price was right and the reviews were good so I&#x27;d give the Panasonic a shot. I&#x27;m very pleased with this mini version. The pressure is not as good as the Waterpic but, that said, it is definitely good enough. The size is ideal and I like not having to plug anything in. I do have to fill the reservoir twice but that&#x27;s doable. It uses almost no counter space and is easily portable. I would not only recommend it but am thinking of giving one as a gift. It&#x27;s a user friendly, nifty little gadget that gets the job done without a fuss!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd portable panasonic irrigator for our family and were are 30+ year oral irrigators (mostly corded waterpiks).   I&#x27;m overall pleased with the Panasonic units and they last well.  This new model as a slightly larger water holding capacity than it&#x27;s predecessor, although both are adequate for most days.  Not too tough to refill for another shot if needed.  Another plus is the two speeds.  The big negative is that both speeds are less powerful than the older model.  So I gave this one to my wife who likes the lower pressure pulses.   I use NiMH rechargeable batteries in all of them, changing them every two weeks for best pressure.  I&#x27;ve also experienced the on/off switch getting difficult to turn.  You can pry off the switch and clean under it.  I even filed the plastic detent clip down a bit to reduce the difficulty of turning it on.  I give the new unit a 3 star and older model a 4 star, since pulse pressure is of #1 importance.   Now if this new unit had speed 1 as high and speed 2 even harder pulses, they would really have a 5 star irrigator.</li>
            <li> i purchased this panasonic oral irrigator ( water pic type device ) just before we went on vacation,, and it worked great (not as good as my home unit, but a whole lot better than none)   i used it every night , the only thing was i had to fill it at least 2 times, but i feel that was a small thing to do considering the benfit i recieved.</li>
            <li> This is the best water pick type product I have come accross in a long time. My wife and I have been useing the rechargable  type units. I don&#x27;t have to mention names, there are not many on the market. In one word they stink. They start to go downhill from day one. They start to charge poorly, and than don&#x27;t charge at all. This is over a six month or so period. I was just tired of buying them. But we liked the portability of being able to take them on vacations.  Panasonic&#x27;s product works well. I have finally replaced the batteries for the first time. I imagine it&#x27;s about two months or so. Also the price is right. I was just going to buy the old standby for $60 or $70 when this product caught my eye. I  figured for $30 or so it was worth the try. Smartest thought I&#x27;ve had in a while. Guess one needs to be open minded. So if you use a product like this, be open minded and forget the water-pi.., oops I almost said that name, try the panasonic, you won&#x27;t be unhappy.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this and decided to purchase it. I like the fact it uses batteries instead of a cord which makes it easy to travel with. Like the other reviews state this device is pretty powerful. No complaints at all--is advertised correctly!</li>
            <li> My Teledyne Portable WaterPik broke after very few uses.  I was already to buy another when I started reading the reviews about other products out there.  Needless to say, I am so glad since the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A is by far the best! It is so powerful and really gets the food out from my teeth.  Just to be on the safe side, I will travel with extra batteries!</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few months. It works great as long as you keep good batteries in. Couldn&#x27;t believe what the toothbrush misses</li>
            <li> Nice price. I need to use an irrigator about once a week to keep bacteria away from my gum or the pain is EXQUISITE.  So, I don&#x27;t have an option. I&#x27;ve used the Waterpik WP100 for years and it has been fine, but it doesn&#x27;t travel well.  I am going on a cruise, so I needed something portable.  I bought the Panasonic Oral Irrigator because of other reviews and also the price was very nice.  I have been quite pleased.  It can easily be stored, easily rinsed out, and I can add a bit of Listerine mouthwash (to kill the bacteria) as long as I rinse it out before storing.  Hey - no worries, mate (guess where I spent my vacation!)  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is my second panasonic oral irrigator, and this one has much better power than the last.  It works well for travel. My only complaint is that the opening flap is still the same flimsy type that I ended up breaking last time. All in all though,  this irrigator works very well.</li>
            <li> This is a highly effective way to get loose particles out of the spaces between my crowded teeth.  The unit has a powerful jet at the high setting, which I use almost all the time.  I generally fill the canister with lukewarm water twice each time I use it to effectively clean between all the teeth and along the gum line.  It is very convenient and portable, and I just packed it in my carry-on for a three day trip from Ohio to California and return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best evaluation I could give was to thoroughly brush and use mouthwash first, then irrigate with this device.  I would have made a video, but you really don&#x27;t want to see all the little bits of food that the Panasonic Oral Irrigator removed after normal dental care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally I use about one third mouthwash with the filling water for a refreshing mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Have had a couple of these.  They works nicely, but they don&#x27;t last.  You&#x27;ll be lucky to get one year of use, before it quits entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE  -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; THEY KEEP GETTING WORSE !  Just a bunch of poor quality parts about to break!  This one lasted&lt;br /&gt;only a month.  DO NOT BUY !</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for traveling.  My waterpik was just too cumbersome.  I would totally recommend this to anyone who travels.  It works great and travels good.  I experimented a few times before taking it on the road to get used to it.  A great product.</li>
            <li> My husband looked at reviews extensively to find me a compact, cordless oral irrigator.  I knew that the giant, expensive waterpik was not right for me.  This model is easy to use, clean and store, and really cleans my mouth and gums on top of brushing.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The size is convenient but it hurts your gums when it shoots out water. Overall, it gets the job done. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this one. Had two waterpiks who both broke down after a few months, and changed to the Panasonic after that. I like that it has a handy size suitable for travel and that it is battery run. I have had mine for about six months and so far it has been running well.</li>
            <li> I use this one for travel.  I floss after I brush and I wouldn&#x27;t travel w/o it.  I have a stationery one at home.  I guess that is why I needed this for travel so I would not do without it.  Especially, good for foreign travel because you don&#x27;t have to work about the  current.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product as it was battery operated but it does quite well.  I have one that plugs into the wall and this unit is not nearly as powerful, but it does the job.  It is a nice compromise between travel size and reservoir size.  Holds enough water for about 40 seconds on weak spray, the stronger spray goes in about 25-30 which is barely enough to get around the mouth.  But it&#x27;s easy enough to refill.  All in all it&#x27;s a great product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thing is strong! even on the lowest setting, This is my first oral irrigator and so far its pretty good! the battery is a bit hard to take off for the first time, but use a nickle and turn it a bit side ways and it will come off.  after that it will come off easy when there are batteries inside.  I normally don&#x27;t like panasonic.. but they make things that i actually want to buy and use sadly.. and so far.. its been a reliable brand for me.</li>
            <li> This is my first Oral Irrigattor and had high hopes as most reviewers recommended the product . Product delivers as advertised, and is easy to hold comfortably. It doesn&#x27;t take lots  of counter space and shows well. However, First  issue is water reservoir which  doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to clean a full mouth. May be this issue is unique to me but I feel in order to clean the entire mouth I have to replace water at least three times. Next issue is water seeping through the unit when I clean upper left side of the mouth. I still do not  know how to clean inside of lower part of the mouth as I can&#x27;t adjust the nozzle to keep water in side the mouth. Water speed is decent and holds firmly in my hand.  So far (after 14 days), battery power is holding up and I am assuming it will last at least a month. I like the unit and would appreciate if someone suggests how to operate (on my lower teeth) this unit as the manual doesn&#x27;t explain it well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Compact...holds enough water. Takes up little space on bathroom counter. Batteries included..works great!</li>
            <li> Arrived within expected time frame.  Packaged well.  Totally satisfied with this product.  I find that the higher speed works better for me in getting the right water pressure.  Easy to store when not in use.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried to make this work but the little door where you fill the water compartment would not stay shut. So you had to hold that and keep your finger on the power so you don&#x27;t choke on too much water. It took 3 hands and I am one short. As far as the power goes I thought it had a good strong flow at times that too varied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will continue to floss and look for another type where there is not a door that may fall open at any second.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift for my granddaughter who has braces. they travel a lot and the portability makes it easy for her to maintain good care of her braces</li>
            <li> I purchased this Panasonic oral irrigator to take along during an extended European trip--and all I can say is WOW!  Panasonic has created a little marvel: it&#x27;s a snap to use, does a terrific job, and is easy to keep clean.  For ease of use, I like it even better than the full-size Waterp*** that I use at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks Panasonic--you get an A+++ from me.  Highly recommended, accept no substitutes.</li>
            <li> Hard to handle because it&#x27;s straight and not contoured. Handle part keeps slipping into the tank part.  Switched to Toilet Tree 2015 Version -- it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> This has been a great investment. It is easy to pack up and take on the road when I travel. I use it every day and use rechargeable batteries, with no issues. I did have to hack the spout though by cutting about a half-inch off the tip. Not much water was getting through the teeny opening, but it works much better now.</li>
            <li> I love how it can remove the trapped particles between my teeth in an instant! I decided to buy this as I find flossing very time consuming especially for my case where the growth of my wisdom tooth traps food particles every time I eat. It is very handy, good for travel. I was also very happy to see 2 AA batteries included in the package so I have tried the product as soon as it was delivered. I wish they include a travel pouch or case in the package as well. Very good buy!</li>
            <li> Very good oral irrigator, easy to use, good battery life and can be used for travel. It is more powerful than older Panasonic model it replaced - the  two speeds help a lot.</li>
            <li> I have an older plug-in waterpik model and this works with as much power as that one, but much more convenient.  It does run out of water fast on the higher speed, but only takes a few seconds to re-fill and finish.  I am using the batteries that came with is, but I will probably try the rechargable batteries (even though they don&#x27;t recommend it).  It&#x27;s fantastic for travelling - folds down quick and stores the nozzle inside.  It is not really loud either.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Has extreme power.  Bought for my son who just got braces.  More powerful than I thought and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a rechargeable portable Waterpik brand and it was very disappointing. I travel frequently and every time I needed it the batteries were dead. Even when charged they would not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, this Panasonic is much better designed and is perfect for portable use - and it uses regular batteries so it&#x27;s always ready to go. It folds for packing and the tip even fits inside of it. I have used this many times and it is a great unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this unit for three years and it still works great. Note: Every several months I fill it with white vinegar and run it to remove mineral deposits from water.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Got the oral irrigator because of a problem with food getting stuck between my back teeth. It does a great job, and even the \\&quot;low\\&quot; option is very strong.  I haven&#x27;t used it for traveling but will definitely take it with me since it collapses.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of good reviews but the pressure is too low and the water tank does not slip out completely which makes it hard to clean or dry. I would recommend another brand such as waterpik.</li>
            <li> Excellent waterpik.  Small enough to use one-handed; reservoir capacity enough to finish the job in one fill; powerful enough to get all the little bits.  I plan on getting a second to keep at work.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take with me on vacation.  I cannot be without my Waterpik WP-100. However, I did not want to add to my suitcase weight by packing the larger machine. (We all know how easy it is to exceed 50 pounds between shoes, clothes, toiletries, etc).  I ordered this a *bit* hesitant, thinking there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s going to hold a candle to the electric powerhouse that my Waterpik is.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  There are only two settings and I only tried out the higher one.  I would say the high setting on this unit is about equal to 5 or 6 on my Waterpik.  I won&#x27;t be replacing my electric model, but this will work out fine for travel.</li>
            <li> The right size for just about anyone.  Much nicer to use than my old on-the-counter heavy water-pic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used water piks before but never one that gets me soaking wet in the process.  Maybe I&#x27;m just a slow learner in terms of how to angle the pik. I like it except for that.  Handy for travel.</li>
            <li> This was, essentially, a replacement of an earlier model....one that lasted about 4 years. It has 2 speeds..I use the &#x27;high&#x27; mostly. Still amazed what this tool can get from your teeth....what brushing misses. Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> OK for travel, not much pressure</li>
            <li> Good battery life, it goes on all trips with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.&lt;br /&gt;After many years they break.&lt;br /&gt;New one&#x27;s always have improvements !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now if only the batteries lasted longer !!!&lt;br /&gt;it takes ordinary AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see particles of food removed by using the product, even after flossing and brushing.  As to be expected, using the product is messy, but it has proven to be reliable and effective.</li>
            <li> Bought this product hoping it would help me keep a clean fresh mouth. Flossing is difficult for me and I can seemingly never get to my rear teeth correctly. Since this product has arrived my teeth have never felt so clean. I&#x27;m surprised my dentist never recommended such a product. All and all I am extremely happy with this product</li>
            <li> I really love this Panasonic oral irrigator.  My dentist is very insistent on the use of some such dental hygiene instrument, so I dutifully went to the store and bought the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; hand held oral irrigator.  That one quit charging after several months.  So I began looking for a replacement.  I found this one, read the reviews and bought it.  (Wish I had read the reviews of the name brand one before I bought it.).&lt;br /&gt;This Pansonic is just as described; works beautifully; is light weight; and I will even feel comfortable taking it \\&quot;on the road\\&quot; with me.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the very affordable price.</li>
            <li> A small &amp; great product you can keep with you wherever you go ,you&#x27;ll always feel fresh,and it keeps the dentist away...sooo easy to use,just need a small bottle of water &amp; keep a couple of double A batteries and your always ready ...nothing like a clean fresh mouth taste &amp; SMILE...once you try it you,ll never leave home without it...actually i use it at home too,it&#x27;s sooo much easier than those big bulkey ones with wires and other useless parts...compact/fast and outlasts any other product in it&#x27;s catagory, Try It You&#x27;ll Love It!!!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Oral Irrigator does a great job at cleaning between teeth.  It&#x27;s design is pretty good. The swivel nozzle is definitely a plus when changing sides of your mouth.     Pro&#x27;s:   Has 2 setting for sensitive gums and nubie users.  Swivel nozzle for changing positions.  Considering the hand held capability there really isn&#x27;t much better it can get.    Con&#x27;s:  Should have a push button. Only pump water when pushed.  Trying to switch the unit off in a hurry.  Learning techniques of keeping water in the sink. (user issue)  Keeping the unit vertical. (user issue).    I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 weeks now and batteries are still working fine. My gums didn&#x27;t bleed when I fist started but they were a bit sensitive. So I only use this once at night. It even gets popcorn remnants out.     I only use tap water because the plastic might crack and wear out. So I rinse with mouthwash just to give my mouth something to taste.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small, compact and convenient. the small size cuts down on the potential messiness of this type of product. I would recommend this although I can&#x27;t compare it to the original Waterpik since I haven&#x27;t used that appliance in so many years. It&#x27;s certainly worth the relatively modest investment.</li>
            <li> Its battery powered, not recharchable&lt;br /&gt;Only inconvenience</li>
            <li> Really powerful water-jet.&lt;br /&gt;Have being using it for a week and my teeth feels so clean!&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 settings - 1 (weaker) and 2 (normal).&lt;br /&gt;So far I have tried only 1 as my gum bleed at the end of the water flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Will see if the bleeding will goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the water tank seems kinda small as I had to refill at least one more time each time I floss.&lt;br /&gt;Then again, the device would not be that portable... so I guess it is a reasonable compromise.</li>
            <li> The product is great.  It cleans as well as my plug-in irrigator.  Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazing water pressure. Portable and no special batteries required. Nice.</li>
            <li> I have used a original &amp;#34;Water Pick&amp;#34; years ago, but never like it.  This Panasonic version seems to work very well, is a lot quieter in operation, and easy to use.  It runs off of two AA batteries, has a self contained water tank, is water proof, and has to speeds.  The water tank is small, but it&#x27;s easy and quick to refill.  The unit is &amp;#34;Odd&amp;#34; looking, but quite functional. It takes up very little space on the counter top, and you don&#x27;t have to plug it in. You can buy replacement probe tips, and these are quick and easy to change.  Using the units is simple, and it always seems to dislodge food particles that the tooth brush misses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this device based how well it seems to perform in daily use.</li>
            <li> It has helped me reduce the times I need a hygienist to clean my teeth from 3 times a year, back to two. This is the second one I have owned, the first one last a little of 18 months, which is why I do not rate this higher. The batteries need to be changed at least monthly with two users. Keep an eye on the nozzle, they eventually get plugged and the unit will not function well and will go through batteries very quickly. Right after a battery change it has a lot of power, as the month goes on, not so much. Water resistant, works in the shower or over the sink. Given what I save at the dentist, I would get another one.</li>
            <li> I like my Panasonic oral Irrigator.  I have used a Water Pik for years, (it is at least 20 years old)  and it finally got too leaky for me to repair.  This Panasonic has just as good jet power, and is very convenient to use, being that it is cordless. The amount of water it holds is good, and it is easy to fill.  The only thing I would change is to make changing the tip easier....the tip is difficult to pull out, making it inconvenient to share with another person.</li>
            <li> This is the best oral irrigator on the market!  Much better than the leading brand or any of the others.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I liked this product so much, I bought this second one.</li>
            <li> I purchased for use when traveling.  I have a Hydrofloss for home use, but it&#x27;s too bulky to travel with.  This does a very good job, actually better than I expected.  Well worth the cost for convenience.</li>
            <li> I bought the irrigator to replace a full-size irrigator because I didn&#x27;t want a tube that coils and collects mold.  This irrigator fulfilled that with its short, straight tube.  It holds enough water to do the entire mouth if you keep it moving. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is awkward to hold and maneuver in the mouth and shutting off the unit is extremely difficult once your hand and irrigator are wet from irrigating.  A push-button would have been a much better control.  All-in-all, I&#x27;m okay with it because I feel it is much more sanitary than most irrigators with the long, coiled tube.  It&#x27;s small and compact, so I&#x27;ll be able to take it along when I travel.</li>
            <li> I have become forcibly acquainted with a condition called xerostemia or dry mouth. My dentist tells me that a consequence of that is that keeping the mouth clean is both harder to do and more important than before. This little machine acts like a combination of dental floss and a power washer. It&#x27;s battery-operated and easy to transport.&lt;br /&gt;-lynn hoffman: [...]</li>
            <li> I use this product as a portable oral irrigator during my personal and business travel.  I have taken three (3) business trips of 5 days or more and could not be happier with the functionality and reliability of the product.  This unit replaces the very unreliable battery powered Waterpik Cordless Plus Water Flosser.  I have had 3 Waterpik units and all have died after 3 or 4 recharges.  They reside in the landfills in Shanghai, China.  From whence they came.  The Panasonic unit is reliable, has solid water pressure for a portable unit and is compact.  Because you can replace the batteries is a big plus for me after my experience with the Waterpik.   The only irritation is the cost of the replacement tip.  Come on...$9.15... Don&#x27;t space it out...  I highly recommend this unit for people who take oral hygiene seriously.</li>
            <li> This irigator is successor of Panasonic EW1270AC, which I bought 2 years ago. From my point of view the older model was better - you were able to store the nozzle inside of irigator body and save the space, which is not possible with new model. Also the two speeds are not an advantage - you will use only the stronger stream anyway.    Common problem of all these portable models is following: they loose their power as time goes by. So you have to buy a new one each two years. But for me as an often traveling person, there is no other possibility. Panasonic models are great, you will be satisfied with them for sure. The big advantage is use of standard AA batteries, so you will have no problem when you are traveling all around the world.</li>
            <li> Nice personal Oral Irrigator.  The true test will be if the results are what the dentist is looking for.  Feels the same as the other with the large tank.  Mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> This little irrigator does just what it says. It&#x27;s small, only holds a little water, but when traveling that&#x27;s just what you want. Powerful jet clear out any debris. My only complaint is that the nozzle edge is slightly sharp so keep it a little distance from the gums.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, I just bought my second unit. Had to buy another because our kitten got a hold of it and we can&#x27;t find the plug part for the water compartment, we&#x27;re using a cork.  That plug part could be designed better, it comes out of it&#x27;s hinges too easily and we had to keep popping it back in until we lost it.     I love having this as a back-up.  I usually end up filling it a 2nd time to complete my mouth cleansing (adult braces) but it IS a portable unit and when my braces are off, I won&#x27;t have to fill it twice. I have tried seven (yes, 7) different oral irrigation units including two Waterpik counter models, and none compare favorably to this little workhorse.  The waterpik portables I tried would have to be charged *before* and after each use - grrrrrrr. My second choice, if I couldn&#x27;t find this model, would be the Interplak Conair Rechargeable Portable Water Jet.  That is also an excellent product and I have that one, too. I travel twice a month to the same two destinations and leave one at each place in case I forget to pack one.     This Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A is very efficient with two pulse strengths, looooong battery life, easy to fill, easy to collapse for storage or travel.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, easy to use, and priced well.    Shipping is lightening fast and customer service is awesome!  :)</li>
            <li> This waterpick is so much better than the one I had used befor that I paid almost twice as much as for this one. The power of the water is strong enough, for sure, I like that it&#x27;s taking very little space on the counter. Another plus is that it does not leak water once you&#x27;ve used it. My other one used to make a puddle on the counter. The fact that this waterpick operates on batteries, not from the plug, is a big advantage, because you can travel with it, and even take it to work or friends&#x27; house, to use after meals. All over great product! I am thinking about ordering another one as a gift.</li>
            <li> wow, with 2 AA batteries, the oral irrigator pumped out apretty strong jet of water and that was at the lower of the two speeds!  I heard that this was better than flossing and I tried it and it sure could push out all the little bits of whatever between the teeth!  I was surprised how much stuff!  However, learn to keep your finger near the switch button since the water will squirt all over you once you move the mouth piece away from your mouth!  The base is quite large -not appropriate for kids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes mix the water with listerine to do two jobs in one!  I am really happy with it and so will my dentist!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005DC2E18 New-Oral Irrigator - PAN-EW-DJ10A]]    I bought two of them, they all worked very well (basically for travel).  The battery life was amazingly good.  you may need to leave the water cap open to avoid odor (depend on the quality of water).</li>
            <li> I have been using an oral irrigator type product for many, many years.  I loved the Waterpik handheld, rechargeable; but about once a year, the battery would no longer recharge.  After several years of paying too much for Waterpik, I then tried a Profloss 4190 Waterflosser for $19.99.  It also worked for about a year, hooks up to the water faucet so no batteries or recharging, but not portable.  Eventually, the water pressure from the faucet would pop the hose out of the connection to the faucet.  Recently, I was very excited to find the Oral Irrigator by Pure Enrichment, $29.99, which uses double A batteries, but I quickly discovered that it had absolutely no water pressure whatsoever so I have returned it.  My quest to find a portable, battery powered oral irrigator is now over.  After reading many reviews, I purchased the Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.  When I read the complaints that the pressure was too hard, I knew this was the one for me.  I&#x27;ve only used it for two days, twice a day every day, but I love everything about it!!!  The collapsible (for travel) water reservoir is completely adequate.  It does not spray all over the room if you keep it in your mouth.  The on/off button is perfectly located.  And the water pressure is to die for!!!!!  I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li> Great water flossing&lt;br /&gt;wish it have a 0.5 speed.&lt;br /&gt;Speed 1 makes a mess all over with the strong jets.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use. It seems to clean very well. It takes 2 fillings to clean whole mouth.</li>
            <li> It does the job suprisingly well.  It&#x27;s designed for travel,  but TSA made a very big stink over it. In hindsight I can see why.  Got through but Suggest  putting  it in checked baggage to avoid the public interrogation.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I need to irrigate regularly and this was so convenient for a recent 11 day trip where the standard electric irrigator would have been very inconvenient. Did an excellent job most of the time with one filling, but occasionally needed two fillings after a rich grainy dinner. The two AA  batteries last the whole trip and were still going strong at the end.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as the model I was using is no longer available. It has 2 speeds and he really thinks it does the job. He had some type of gum issue that this model took care of it. He really likes this Panasonic Oral Irrigator.</li>
            <li> Although only about 2/3 as powerful as a plug-in, it still does a very nice job.  The reservoir is large enough for a good clean, and is easy to refill.  It all packs into a convenient travel size.</li>
            <li> Works very well on batteries and does a good job.  I would like the water capacity to be greater; but it is the right size for travel. Find it a little harder to maneuver than the standing irrigators.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different makes/models of portable/travel oral irrigators and this is the best by far.  WaterPik was the worst...no pressure, I can spit with more force that WaterPik portable.  This Panasonic unit gets very respectable pressure from 2 AA batteries. If it lasts, it will be one of my better purchases.</li>
            <li> gets the particles out that dental floss, picksand all my other devices could not. uses +-2 batteries / week to do it. will eventually end up buying a rechargeable device.  am afraid to store it all neatly put together as advertised.  i read about the black mold issue that Panasonic just could not address, so it sits out in 2 parts on my counter. not at all attractive. perfect size for travel. i bought it for my small bathroom as well but that, as you read, can&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through two waterpik products in less than two years - work great initially - then gradually fade out and won&#x27;t accept a charge.  I&#x27;ve had the panasonic now for about 6 weeks - works great.  Stream is actually more forceful than the waterpik.  With batteries, no problems with unit accepting a charge.  Very portable and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been a WaterPik user for a number of years and got fed up with my machine breaking. After going through 3 purchases, I decided to try something else. The Panasonic has worked well so far. The water pressure does not equal the highest setting of the WaterPik, but the highest of the 2 settings does the job. It has more power with new batteries. We&#x27;ll see what my dentist has to say at the next visit.</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the best products I have ever bought.  It works great.  It&#x27;s so portable that it encourages you to use it.  I love it.  If anything happens to it I&#x27;d buy another one in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> We use a Waterpik at home and had a travel size for years which was great.  We bought it overseas and cannot find one here.  This product barely gets the job done but burns up batteries in the process.  Unfortunately there does not seem to be a good alternative, so it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery on the product.  This irrigator gets to all the places a toothbrush or floss cannot.  A must have for anyone with dental appliances.</li>
            <li> Works better than a waterpik. Portable. This model has the replaceable AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the chores of flossing and has been constantly reminded by my dentist to make such good habit for dental health reasons. I first came across an advertisement in 2009 on the use of Oral Irrigator which sells the idea of an alternate replacement to flossing. This is definitely a convenient and efficient way to maintain dental health to me. This led me to purchase my first cordless waterpik in Oct 09. It serves me well and I begins to develop the good habit of \\&quot;flushing\\&quot; the food debris around my gum before the usual brushing every night. However, the waterpik dies after half a year. Not knowing what exactly happens, I attributed this to my luck and make a second purchase in May 10. My second Waterpik has a longer life spans but stopped working after 14 mnths. This time round, I started to shop in Amazon which provides an excellent source of reviews by users. I am able to relate what other users complain on the short batteries life in Waterpik which affect the reliabilities of the product. I decides to make a switch to Panasonic Oral Irrigator. I find this is a better choice. The use of AA batteries boost its reliabilities and help to save space without the need for extra power adapter.  The power to flush is also stronger in comparison to Waterpik. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A has preformed very well and I am completely happy with it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an Oral Irrigator.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I highly recommend this product. Pressure is perfect and dont worry about the batteries I have been using it for 2 weeks, once a day, and still using the same ones.</li>
            <li> Panasonic oral irrigator is very good,and easy to use. For a battery operated it has the power to irrigate btween the teeth and your mouth feels clean and refreshing. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Too large. Billed as a travel size but it&#x27;s much too large for travel. I fly every week for business and this takes up too much room in my luggage. I know there are smaller ones out there.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s cheap considering its nice function. It&#x27;s portable, which means it could be weaker than full-set machine. But, it&#x27;s strong enough to clean all things on the teeth and between the gum and teeth. I like it!</li>
            <li> Item was just as described, great price, great product.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just keep it in your mouth otherwise it will shoot water across the room.  Great for keeping my gums, teeth area cleaned.</li>
            <li> After having this water pick for just over a month it stopped working.  At first I thought it was the batteries but not the case.  It barely pulsates and water does not come out.  I don&#x27;t even think it is worth the trouble having it fixed.  Even when it was working was not very good.</li>
            <li> I have been using the device for about 3 weeks now and am very satisfied with it.  It is exactly as described in the ad.  I can put it in a tote bag if I want to take it with me, and it fits nicely inside the vanity cabinet.      In a few seconds you can have it ready to go and the convenience has made it possible to rinse after every meal which has dramatically improved the health of my mouth.  I can do a very quick rinse with one filling, but for morning and before bed I go ahead and refill it a couple more times which takes a couple of seconds and is not a problem for me.    I only use water in it, as is suggested.  When I put it away I leave the fill tank plug open to dry and the unit has remained very clean.  My only suggestion for the manufacturer would be to include a take along bag for it, for buyer convenience, but it wasn&#x27;t difficult to come up with one myself.  I do recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine just about every day for 2 years now and counting. I use the lithium batteries  designed for digital cameras. I keep it in the shower, great unit.</li>
            <li> After using on an extended trip (3 months) both my husband and I were very disappointed.  This unit sucked up batteries like crazy.  The only time it produced a decent jet of water was when batteries were new - then they diminished in power until it was useless, usually in about a week.  It was hard to fill and messy to use.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have both portable irrigators, the Waterpik waterflosser and the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A. The waterpik was recommended by my dentist. I was amazed at what it did, just what the dentist wanted it to do. However, after about two weeks the unit wouldn&#x27;t charge I contacted Waterpik support, I still haven&#x27;t got a reply. A search on the internet revealed that I wasn&#x27;t the only one with the charging problem. I noticed the tip was plugged so I unplugged that and it starting charging again. After 5 months of regular use it stopped charging and will no longer charge the unit so it is only useful for a doorstop. The Panasonic unit uses AA batteries and there is no charging problem. The pulsating action is less vigorous with the Panasonic but it seems to do the job and I am thrilled with it and so is the dentist. He will no longer recommend Waterpik</li>
            <li> I ordered two of the Panasonic Oral Irrigators..... One for my wife and one for me.....We use them every day and it works so much better than even flossing......handy and portable......so far...Great.......</li>
            <li> It works well. A bit clumsy but manageable. Might have to refill if you have a big mouth. Easy to pack when traveling.    Good price.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  The water jet is quite strong, I would say as strong as my home water pick.  I travel a lot and I was pleasantly surprised.  I defenitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although the pressure of the water is not as strong as Waterpik, it is portable and wireless. You don&#x27;t need to plug in and out frequently.&lt;br /&gt;As most users mentioned it must be filled with the water more than twice while flossing.</li>
            <li> My old unit was great until the on-off switch stopped working. This new one is even better. Panasonic clearly makes improvements based on the Customers wishes. (now has two speeds)</li>
            <li> I always have been taken care of my mouth and, of course,I&#x27;ve been looking for the best way to accomplish my goal. I found it when I discovered Panasonic Oral Irrigator.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t floss my teeth, and because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in front of my sink I have not seen how it works, but the first time I used it I had a funny taste in my mouth which I think was the gunk between my teeth. So I think it works. I use it everyday and I&#x27;ve noticed my mouth with better taste because of it. I find it easier than flossing, although I&#x27;m not sure that it is a substitute for flossing. The water tank doesn&#x27;t hold enough for a single use and I tend to refill the water tank about one or two times. Being battery operated is more convenient because I only have one power socket in the bathroom which is in use. It is recommended to change the nozzle every six months and I have bought a packet of [[ASIN:B003OC74SW spare nozzles]] which are relatively inexpensive and come in a two pack. Panasonic always has high quality products and I think this is worthy of the brand.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Worth buying for someone like me who relies on an oral irrigator to keep gums in shape.  Used two insulated foam can holders to protect in luggage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using waterpik after every meal. This product is better than Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is okay after week and + usage. Love this product. Recommended to travelers.</li>
            <li> It took nearly 5 years to wear out the first one I bought - so I immediately ordered another one. It runs on batteries, doesn&#x27;t take up space on the counter, it travels and I haven&#x27;t had any dental or periodontal work done, other than cleanings, since I have been using it.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I need this kind of device when traveling - you simply can&#x27;t fly anywhere with a full Water-Pik unit in tow.  It stows the nozzle in the side of the case and protects the switch when closed.  It does not hold very much water and has 2 speeds - \\&quot;Very Weak\\&quot; and \\&quot;Weak\\&quot; - the most powerful of which is about the same as my AC -powered home unit set on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  A good item for traveling, but find something else for home use if you have serious dental irrigation needs - say for bridgework, etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent device. I never realized how important flossing is until I used this item. No gum bleeding, bad breath or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I am a sweet kisser!</li>
            <li> Took it on vacation for 10 days.  It works but battery gets low in 10 days of once a day use.  It is clumsey as water spills from your mouth all over the unit when using it.  If the mouth piece was on a 12 to 18 inch tube it would be much better. I use a waterpic-WP-100wc at home and am very satified with it.</li>
            <li> i presently live out of the States, in a country where oral irrigators are not available, though recommended, at least by my dentist.  i have bought several in the last 2 years  on trips or brought be visitors)and each lasted about 2 months.  i tried to have them repaired by several &#x27;experts&#x27;, to no avail. this Panasonic is the model which has lasted me the longest (over three months). i find the strength of the jet adequate (negative comments in some of the reviews). yes, the batteries have to be replaced but to me that is a small expense to be able to do what a toothbrush cannot do.  i just decided to consider oral irrigators a disposable item and go with the one which lasts longest.  i have not found a difference in usage between this Panasonic and the ones i used previously.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I just got 3 of these here at Amazon.  I think I had \\&quot;prototypes\\&quot; in the past, though this model is very much the same.  The 2 speed switch is silly, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using the low power setting.  The stem is a little short, and I almost have to stuff the unit in my mouth to get behind my back teeth.  Other than that, this is the best irrigator you can by IMHO.  I stand by all I said in my previous review below.  --  I use this (or very similar) type waterpik for 5 years, and find that they usually last a year or so (at 2-4 quarts/day).  I think the rubber rings on the piston wear out, and you know the \\&quot;end of life\\&quot; is near when there is water in the battery compartment and the pressure is slightly reduced.  I am very happy with the product - BUT ONLY AFTER MODIFICATION!  I take off the silly little tank, and then attach a 2-3ft vinyl tube with an inside diameter the same size as the outside diameter of the unit&#x27;s tube.  I then fill a gallon jug with water, and insert the vinyl tube into that.  Works great!  I love the low hassle and easy storability of the unit.  Batteries last about 3 gallons.  My experience with the original Water-Pik(tm) is that they are utter pieces of junk!!!  They break and fail and are engineered like a cheap piece of crap!!!</li>
            <li> If you love your smile and care for your teeth than you need to invest in this Panasonic Oral Irrigatior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by Suheiwa</li>
            <li> Great find. I travel and love the way it slids together for packing. Have used other slimilar irrigators that have to be plugged in for charging. Rechargable battery wore out too quickly. This Panasonic uses regular batteries. Two power settings. Soft or firm water flow. Have been using it for several months on one set of batteries. No ugly cord laying on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to clean it as the instructions states not to damage the tubing.</li>
            <li> Tried different brand with a lot of frustration in the past. Finally, I found this Panasonic one from Amazon. My god, it&#x27;s just that good in design. I don&#x27;t understand why other companies cannot learn the design from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Took a couple tries to use it without spraying all over.&lt;br /&gt;I use with two drops of the PerioCleanse Concentrate.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I made this purchase.  My teeth and gums feel very clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Now it is very easy to use and I like the compact size of the Irrigator.</li>
            <li> The best travel size oral irrigator. I have a waterpik (home version) but this item does just as well. I recommend this to anyone looking for a more convenient sized version.</li>
            <li> This is a great oral irrigator that does what it says it does. I find the high speed is more than adequate - after all, you don&#x27;t want to blast your teeth and gums too much. It&#x27;s well-designed and easy to use, and a AA battery lasts at least a month, in my experience. I had intended to use this just for travel and had bought a full-size Waterpik for my home, but found this one works just as well there, too, so I sent the Waterpik back. So why only 4 stars? I would like to see a model with a rechargeable AA battery. And the spray nozzles cost a lot to replace. But I agree with other reviewers that this is the best out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oral irrigator almost immediately after I got my braces.  I was specifically looking for one that was portable, didn&#x27;t require charging, and had a decent size reservoir.  This one exceeded all of my expectations!  It&#x27;s a great option for anyone in the market, but particularly for those who travel or want to use it \\&quot;on the go.\\&quot;  Mine worked flawlessly and efficiently for about 15 months, then the water pressure gradually decreased to a level that was ineffective.  Cleaning the unit and replacing the batteries had a negligible impact.  So, I tossed it in the trash and ordered another one (yes, exact same model).  I gave this oral irrigator a solid 5-star rating because it did exactly what I expected it to.  On average, I used it at least three times per day and it performed very  well for over a year.  For a $25 truly portable oral irrigator, I don&#x27;t think you can ask for much more.  I&#x27;ll be pleased if my new one performs as well for 15 months!</li>
            <li> ON/Off switch is not user friendly.  Turning the water flow down or off becomes an anxious process.    My suggestion is to have the flow of water stop flowing when it is removed from  the mouth.</li>
            <li> Great value.  I bought one for my everyone in house.  Really no need to re-fill tank.  Portability is great, will take on vacation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now. Works very well. Not having a cable is a plus. Doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful as some of the bulky water flossers out there but gets the job done. 4 stars is because I wish there was one more stronger setting to remove really hard to remove stuff.</li>
            <li> I had a countertop irrigator for a long time and although it worked I hated the cleanup and dust collection factors.  This goes neatly into a drawer and is easy to clean, so that&#x27;s a winner.  The surprise was the amount of power it had.  If it weren&#x27;t so bulky to hold I&#x27;d give it a 5, but it&#x27;s a solid 4 for functionality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks but this thing is great!!! I looked for water piks for month but couldn&#x27;t see spending $50 on one that seemed very awkward and troublesome. This was simple, easy to use and now cords. I love it.</li>
            <li> i really needed an oral irrigator as my last 2 became inoperable because of the same defunct part. this one seemed like a good deal for the money. it is a bit messy but works well.</li>
            <li> The porduct works well and gets the job done. This is worth the money and would buy it again. I have bought two of them for my one for each of my kids. They have braces powerful and gets all the stuff out of the braces cleans between there teeth.</li>
            <li> This thing is terrible, really annoying to take apart and replace batteries. Get a rechargeable one, immediately return this. Buy  &#x27;Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser (WP-440)&#x27; by Waterpik</li>
            <li> This is not so good. I was hoping from the other reviews that it would be as good as my countertop Waterpick, but it has half the power, and is not as easy to use.  I will use it only for travel.</li>
            <li> My dentist advised me that I have dental pockets as deep as 11 mm!  Most of my teeth are 4 - 7 mm.  One tooth is the one with the 11 mm depth.  The tooth was so bad that it moved if I touched it with my tongue.  After I floss and brush, I use a salt water rinse.  Then I use this Irrigator for the final cleaning.  The first week I used it, I could not believe the horrible tasting crud that was hiding under my gum line!  After 2 weeks, I notice my gums are stronger, because - instead of being able to fit 4 strand of dental floss between some teeth, I can only fit 2 strands.  My gums are no longer red and swollen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great WHEN it works.  I bought this product September of 2013.  It is November 1, 2013 - and it has totally quit working.  I only used it 2x per day, and always drained the water.  Initially I noted the batteries would die very quickly, then the volume of water being pumped decreased - then this morning - it totally quit working. Because of lack of durability, I downgraded the rating.  Extremely disappointed in Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 30, 2013 - Update&lt;br /&gt;I closely examined this product, and noticed there is a tiny filter on the bottom of the intake tube.  I partially closed the unit.  I used the curved nozzle tip to gently move the tube outside of the chamber.  Sure enough, the bottom of the filter was clogged.  I took a sewing needle and carefully removed the clog, making sure not to damage the filter.  I have upgraded my rating.  Got it to work like new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 6, 2014&lt;br /&gt;My tooth hardly wobbles!  Love it.  This unit is still working, however I noticed that the water stream was weaker, even if I changed batteries, so I replaced the nozzle.  It works like New!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 20, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded the Stars because the unit is still working beautifully.  I am going to order another one for traveling.</li>
            <li> This is an item I can&#x27;t live without. Even after flossing I&#x27;ll get additional food out of my gums and in many cases this is the only device that can remove painful food jammed underneath my gums. The whole thing collapes for traveling, is the only unit I know of that has replaceable batteries,and with new batteries has a very powerful spray. It is also very easy to refill and I liked that the engineers designed the cap to snap on and off instead of breaking off. I bought one and liked it so much I&#x27;m buying one as a gift for other people.</li>
            <li> I do travel so this fits in. First time use of an oral irrigator, and bought 5 for family. I can fell the cleanliness of my teeth and gums now. And I use it as a nasal irrigator too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over a month now and so far I have been completely satisfied with it. It&#x27;s easy to use and has ample power to get rid of food particles that cannot be removed with a toothbrush. It is also good for flushing out food particles that get caught in gum pockets.    I mix my own concoction of warm water and mouth wash even though the instructions say to use just water. My mouth feels totally refreshed and that&#x27;s what I am looking for in an oral irrigator. I have always owned a Waterpik which is also a good product however I like the fact that this product uses plain batteries which eliminates the need for a charging adapter and it also collapses for easy storage. I am glad that I made the decision to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> So far so good. very lightweight and portable. just be careful not to aim at your gum, it really hurts.</li>
            <li> Great product but a bit too powerful for a person that has a lot os caps. Had to pass it on to my husband who uses it every night</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best; Battery-driven, Stays strong  a long time, the Exchange nozzle doesn&#x27;t fall out during use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a good way to use this. When the oral irrigator is extended for use, it is taller than my sink is deep. The on off switch is difficult to use when water is pulsing out of the irrigator. This means that When I use it, I get my bathroom and myself wet. I am going to try it in my much deeper kitchen sink.  I am going to look for another item that performs the same function without the mess.</li>
            <li> This water flosser does not deliver. It is weak &amp; low quality. Would do much better flossing with regular dental floss. I use it only because I paid $35+ for it...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my best friend - she absolutely loves it.  Very pleased!  Planning to buy more.</li>
            <li> I think Panasonic tried hard to make an acceptable portable appliance for cleaning between teeth,  this is a nice try,  but no cigar.  Calling it an \\&quot;oral irrigator\\&quot; was not far off,  it simply sprays water on your teeth without a chance of  getting anything done between the teeth.  It is a toy if compared to Phillips new Airflosser ....  which itself has some bugs...but works well... when it works.</li>
            <li> I received this pretty quickly for Super Saver Shipping.  I am really impressed with it.  As I&#x27;ve aged my teeth have become very crooked and it was hard to clean in between with just brushing.  My bathroom is very small and I have no counter space, just a Pullman style sink.  So, this is perfect for me, as it works very well and does not require much space.  I am amazed at how well it cleans my teeth, and even after brushing, it removes particles that my toothbrush missed.  When it arrived, I inserted a dollar store AA battery, which has lasted almost two months.  I just replaced the battery for the first time.  I use the irrigator at least once a day and often twice a day.  The contoured box it came in provides a great place to drain and store it in between uses.  This was a really good buy.  Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/25/15: I just wanted to update my review with a cautionary note.  I&#x27;ve used this every day since I bought it in 2013 and it has been a wonderful addition to my oral hygiene.  My gums are a lot healthier than they used to be.  However, mine just died and it was my fault that it did.  I periodically soak it in a weak bleach water solution to rid it of any mildew that accumulates.  I don&#x27;t have to do this often as I saved the inner cardbaard packaging which allows me to leave this open after used and let it drain.  However, at times, it does get some mildew under areas where parts overlap.  This last time I soaked it, I forgot to close the battery compartment, from which I had removed the batteries.  It got wet and now doesn&#x27;t work.  My fault!  It has worked well and faithfully for the last two years.  I&#x27;ll let it dry some more and see if it starts to work again.  If not, I will definitely order another as it has become an essential part of my daily routine and makes such a difference in my oral care and health.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to replace batteries which last longer than expected.  Stronger than expected current. Does the job and without cord or taking up a too much space.</li>
            <li> Shipping has now confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;Better than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Good !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I can not believe it  and you will not either ,I first  saw this  item in a magazine  then several magazines . I decided to  check this out at Amazon just to see if they had it ,they did and wow was it alot less  inexpensive than anywhere  else  on earth. I&#x60;am so glad that  I purchased  the Oral Irrigator  by Panasonic.It is the  best water pick  by  far than  many others and  I have the Oral-B Hydro Floss and I still prefer the Oral Irrigator  by Panasonic. It does a fantastic job on the teeth and gums my Dentist remarked what a  terrific job I was doing ,she said keep it up. I will  cause it is so easy .I still can not  get over how much  I saved ,I saved a total of $23.00 without shipping,from Amazon .I am so glad I checked out Amazon,usually  I take the seller for their  word . Not any more. Thankyou  Amazon .com   Terry Merrill</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was very skeptical when I bought it but I&#x27;ve seen many good reviews so I decide to just give it a try. I used to use other brand but it died after a year of using it. I hope this one last longer. Anyway, I have no complain. It is very portable and great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this teeth cleaning device. I love that it is portable. I carry with me everywhere. I put some mouthwash in it along with the water and my teeth have never felt cleaner! I would recommend this device to anyone. it is so simple. I love it.  [[ASIN:B0027LSEPS Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A]]    4/8/2016  Hasn&#x27;t worked for 6months :(</li>
            <li> very good, i bought for my parent, they love it. and i also have o&lt;br /&gt;ne for myself just for traVel.</li>
            <li> Works for me! I am satisfied and would buy again.</li>
            <li> We bought ehis particular model since we travel often between Germany and the USA. Therefore we don&#x27;t have to worry about plugs, adapters, etc. Just buy or take batteries with you. It works wonderfully and packs easily.</li>
            <li> After trying 3 different water picks, I decided to try one last time to find one that was compact (great for travel), easy to hold, and had more than one speed ( the low is more than enough pressure for my mouth.) Battery operated (my last one was re-chargeable but the connection between unit and charger was compromised by water and corroded) I look forward to this being a long term addition to my oral healthcare!</li>
            <li> I like the choice of pulse rates. The shape is easy to hold. The only design flaw seems to be its water capacity. I have to fill it twice to complete upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that there were only 2 power settings.  I would have preferred continuous options between the highest and the lowest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, water began leaking from the device when it was stored.  So, I had to empty it each time I used it.  This wasn&#x27;t terrible, just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited too long to return the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d explore other options if I had it to do over again - or return it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel Benjamin</li>
            <li> Great item to have when you&#x27;re traveling. Very powerful irragator that worked very well cleaning teeth. Only caution, use the low speed at first until you get used to it. It can rip your gums and cause bleeding as it had withme. Using regular batteries is a lot better then having to recharge proprietary batteries which only last a year or two then the unit needs replacing. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Just got the Panasonic Oral Irrigator and tried it out. I&#x27;ve never used one of these things before, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other brands. This review is based solely on my experience with this one product. My first thought on turning it on was, \\&quot;Yikes, this really is messy!\\&quot; I&#x27;d read other reviews that said it was messy, but I figured maybe it was just clumsiness or user error (no offense). What I mean by \\&quot;messy\\&quot; is that you&#x27;re going to get water everywhere. I got water all over the mirror, my shirt, the bathroom counter, the walls ... everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design Flaw&lt;br /&gt;I believe the Panasonic Oral Irrigator suffers from a major design flaw: the power switch. It&#x27;s a locking switch, which means when you switch it to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position, it stays on until you switch it off. So, you open your mouth, aim the irrigator, and flip the switch and water begins pulsating out of the nozzle. If you&#x27;re not expecting the ensuing mess, you might frantically try to turn it off again. But you&#x27;ve probably moved your finger away from the switch, so you have to find it again while simultaneously trying to manage the watery mess. A better design would have been a button like most blenders have that must be held down to keep the power on. Once you let go of the button, the power should cut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a few months and since I&#x27;m now willing to say \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;, I&#x27;m upping my rating to four stars. With practice I&#x27;ve gotten better at handling the power switch, though I still accidentally spray a stray stream of water around the bathroom once in a while.</li>
            <li> I received this item for less than a week and very please with the product.  It&#x27;s cordless, compact, easy to use and as effective as the ones with cord.  I wish I had known this sooner.</li>
            <li> Works well does the job!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic oral irrigator is terrific. It is easy to use and portable. But most importantly, it clears out food particles that brushing and flossing miss. My gums feel much better. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Saw this and decided to try it because it is much more compact and easier to handle when traveling. It seems to work as well as the full size pic. It does take a bit of getting used to. I found it a bit tricky to use because it must be kept upright in order to keep the line in the water. The standard water pick has a flexible line that can be turned at any angle which makes it easier to use. Overall I would purchase this again for travel but keep a standard pic for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I know since I purchased this item there are now better travel oral irrigators that are probably much nicer than this one; however, I was so pleased with mine that I ordered an additional four to give to my adult children.  They seem to be very pleased with using it.  I like it best for:&lt;br /&gt;travel&lt;br /&gt;no need to hook up to the faucet or fill a vase&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t have to sit out on the counter&lt;br /&gt;the mouth piece disconnects for cleaning and sanitizing.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic Oral Irrigator to bring to Thailand since it&#x27;s gotten excellent reviews on Amazon. I was not disappointed. The unit had more than enough power with the two different power selections...I was a bit skeptical about this but it definitely held it&#x27;s own. I used this at least once a day during my two week vacation and the battery is still working strong (it requires two AA batteries) even with the generics ones it came with. I would imagine the batteries could last over a month with daily use. I love the fact that it uses disposable batteries since I&#x27;ve had poor luck with rechargeable portable irrigators from Waterpik (they have two different models and both were horrible) and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the different voltage other countries use. With the collapsing water reservoir, this unit stored easily in my toiletry pouch. It also had a little storage compartment for the pick jet. This is quite an ingenious design. Kudos to the designer(s) at Panasonic. Amazon has these for sale for under $30 which is truly a bargain...the only drawback is that it won&#x27;t be in stock for at least another month. I&#x27;m going to order another anyway...I highly recommend this for people with braces :)</li>
            <li> This works O.K. as a travel unit, but it really doesn&#x27;t hold much water, and I found it frustrating to start and stop flossing just to fill the tank.  It is certainly not a substitute for a full sized model if you are serious about flossing.</li>
            <li> works very well. carry it in my back pack.</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget. I have the regular counter model WaterPik and I liked it but it is too big to take with me on a trip and I have to travel a lot.  This one is awesome.  It has good power with a new battery and cleans between teeth really well. I am married to a dentist and he likes it too. Packs up small. You can also add antiseptic mouthwash to the water and get even cleaner!</li>
            <li> Love this. This is my second one. First one is still going after 10 years but I lost the water tank closure.</li>
            <li> Great product, powerful and does a great job, small enough to easily pack down for traveling.  My husband had new crowns and dental implants recently and this really gets in and cleans the area well. Vary simple design, less to break down love it!</li>
            <li> I received the product in good shape&lt;br /&gt;It works just like it supposed to (no surprises)&lt;br /&gt;I like it just fine&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on this product on Amazon that helped me make the decision to purchase this product&lt;br /&gt;One thing it could have (a recharging system)</li>
            <li> Every one should have it if you want to avoid cavities and if your gums bleed using regular thread floss. Since its battery operated. No hassle to charge it, and also does it job very well.&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye dentists :-)</li>
            <li> Works well as described. Light and water proof. The power is just right for the gum so that water pressure clean the space between teeth and massage gum. Water cartridge is the right size. Easy to fill water too.</li>
            <li> Great item. Works much better than the waterpick. Battery has lasted 3 weeks so far with every day use. Great pressure and water tank size. Priced right. My waterpick would die every year guaranteed.</li>
            <li> I guess for a travel usage it&#x27;s OK.  It&#x27;s not as good as the Water Pic.  I would not order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, powerful and uses AA sized batteries so you don&#x27;t have to keep charging it or have yet another charger plugged into your wall. My whole family loves this teeth cleaner and we rush to see who can use it first in the morning. If we&#x27;re playful we&#x27;ll spray each other with it if someone tries to grab it first. We all like the way it spurts in your mouth cleaning everything between your teeth. Sometimes we all line up and wait for the person ahead get finished. I figure by Christmas I might have enough money saved to splurge for a second unit to reduce the number of fights we have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of using rechargeable batteries to see if there&#x27;s any difference. Rechargeable batteries are usually 1.2 volts, not 1.5 volts like alkaline batteries are so with 2 batteries installed it would mean the unit is getting 0.6 less volts than if alkaline batteries were used. I&#x27;ll update my review after I do some testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, to play a prank on my wife I filled it full of vanilla extract. She noticed right away and squirted me with it. All is well though because we kissed and made up. I liked the vanilla taste on her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. So does my wife and five kids. Oh yeah, instead of taking our dog to the vets and spend a fortune to have its teeth cleaned we use this unit instead. The dog likes it because we fill it with water mixed with a few drops of liquid beef bullion. I kind of like chicken bullion the best but everyone has a preference.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this is an item what I wanted. This is the newer version and I found it to be much better than the older version. It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design. i am very much satisfied and Happy with it. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my girlfriend, who had recently been fitted with braces.  She loved it, as it got a lot of the gunk out of the braces and was also quite compact (relatively speaking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  However, after going through batteries quickly, I switched to rechargeable batteries and they work great.  I think that you&#x27;re not \\&quot;supposed to\\&quot; use rechargeables, but there&#x27;s no reason not to that I can see.  I used the Sanyo Eneloop batteries, but I recently bought my girlfriend rechargeable Evereadys and they too work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my last visit to the dentist&#x27;s office, she said I was doing a good job flossing.  I told her that I had started using this oral irrigator and she was in favor of it.  However, she was quite clear that it is not a replacement for flossing.  But she thought that using this device along with flossing, brushing with Sonicare and then using a good mouthwash (Listerine) was a good routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that you can open the device for cleaning by very gently pulling the upper housing from the lower tank.  You&#x27;ll obviously want to clean the thing from time-to-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open the battery compartment with a quarter or the like.  If you turn it enough, the cover will lift from the lower housing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the Panasonic Oral Irrigator and use it daily.  It&#x27;s well-built, works great and is inexpensive.  5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit big to hold in your hand.  Tends to make it more drippy.  But, it does the job, was good price and I can take it with me. All those are pluses.</li>
            <li> I use the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser at home to clean my teeth, but for cleaning my teeth at work after lunch, or for those times when I&#x27;m travelling, this Panasonic Oral Irrigator can&#x27;t be beat. The reservoir chamber is small, yes, but it can be easily refilled. I fill it twice for each use -- once for my lower teeth, and once for my upper. I also add a liquid \\&quot;soap\\&quot; to the reservoir -- a mixture of mouthwash and toothpaste (the toothpaste is liquified in the mouthwash). So far the irrigator has had no problem pumping this \\&quot;soap\\&quot;.    I purchased mine about 8 months ago and started by using two, AA alkaline batteries. The irrigator was good at removing food, but not perfect -- I had to use the Waterpik at home to get rid of the deeper stuff (including the plaque stuck just under my gumline).    Despite the warning against using rechargable batteries, I went ahead and starting using NiMH rechargeable AA batteries, but I noticed the unit wasn&#x27;t pumping as hard as with the alkaline, and so I had even more difficulty getting the daytime plaque removed.    I decided I needed more voltage. I purchased a lithium-ion 14500 battery (very close in size to a AA, but the nubby tab is reduced in height). That comes out of the charger at 4.0 volts. Couldn&#x27;t use two of those, so I made a dummy battery out of a #10 bolt, #10 washers, and fasteners (to keep the washers attached) and ground the dummy battery down to size. That made the irrigator too powerful, and I felt like my gums were being laser-cut away. Also, the lithium-ion battery started to fade after about 20 seconds (the power of the irrigator went down). To get the lithium-ion voltage down, I made another dummy battery but with two bolts connected to a central plastic tube and two diodes in parallel (taken from an old AC adapter) to reduce the voltage -- it connected the two bolts together. They reduced the voltage by 0.3 volts, and after trying again, the irrigator no longer felt like it was cutting my gums away, but the diodes would heat up, and the 14500 li-ion battery would fade as before, plus that battery would only get through two days of lunch cleaning before it needed recharging (I could use the NiMH batteries for two weeks without problem).    My recent attempt now is using PowerGenix NiZn rechargeable AA batteries. They are advertized at 1.6 volts, but I measured them out of the charger at 1.8 volts. Now the irrigator is at the same pumping power as the li-ion battery was with the diodes, but the NiZn batteries don&#x27;t fade, and no more hand-making dummy batteries.  Time will tell how long the NiZn batteries will last, but so far they are the best match with this oral irrigator.    Oh, I should mention the irrigator is also great for returning to work after a dental visit. On low setting, I use it to flush out all the old amalgam bits the dentist left in my mouth.    UPDATE 3/12/2011  The NiZN batteries, while performing well in the Panasonic irrigator, have resulted in a little too much pressure in the long term. The increased water pressure has forced an opening under my gumline between two front teeth causing bleeding. I&#x27;m now using one NiZN battery with a Duracell low-self discharge NiMH battery. This has reduced the pressure enough to stop cutting open the gumline in the one spot while giving enough pressure to effectively clean my teeth and gums. I think ultimately this irrigator would do better with a strength setting from 1-10 much like the Waterpik&#x27;s plug-in model, then I wouldn&#x27;t have to experiment so much with different battery combinations. Despite all of my high-voltage experiments with this irrigator, it has held up and continues to run fine.    Update 5/31/2011  I continue to use one PowerGenix NiZn battery with one Duracell NiMH battery for the best balance of power without tearing up my gums. In this setup, I can use this irrigator for a week in my lunchtime cleaning before having to switch out batteries. I keep another pair of NiZn/NiMH batteries ready to go, so I&#x27;m never without good power. At the end of the week, I take the used NiZn/NiMH battery pair home and recharge them (each in their own chargers, I have to use the special charger that came with the NiZN for the NiZN battery).    I also switched from a toothpaste/mouthwash cleaning solution to a Dove soap/mouthwash cleaning solution. The toothpaste has micro-fine silica, and I was afraid that in a pressure washer like this irrigator it would blast away enamel and dental work. It may have contributed to that pocket in my gumline when I was using two NiZn batteries in the irrigator.    I take a cheese grater with a turn handle and insert the bar of Dove soap into the grater, then turn the handle many times to produce soap bits that land in a large,  microwaveable measuring cup. Then I fill the measuring cup with mouthwash and microwave the mixture to heat it up. I take one of those bamboo sticks that are found in the kitchen accessory sections of department stores and stir the mixture until all soap bits are dissolved. I then pour that mixture back into the empty mouthwash container. For dispensing, I have a used, plastic, shrimp cocktail container that I fill and use to squirt the soap in the Waterpik irrigator for home. For work, I use an empty, see-through, one-dollar shampoo container as found at stores like Target or Walgreens (meant for travel kits) and squirt a little soap solution from that into the Panasonic irrigator.    Despite using these various soaps and different power levels, the Panasonic irrigator continues to run fine.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my vaaction and I love that it does fold up pretty compactly.</li>
            <li> Mouth odor and gives a significant contribution to the gums healthy. Satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a day use of</li>
            <li> Use it every day and am very satisfied. After just two weeks gums are healthier just &amp;#34;feel&#x27;&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li> Looked funny in the picture but for the price had to try it, it is a solid little machine and once you find your way to hold it it works great. It has a lot of power to clean your teeth and most of the time I get done with one fill up. Great product for the money and you can take it with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use when traveling.  I would not find it effective for everyday use, but I guess it is OK for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Excellent alternative to the more cumbersome water-pik. Even though this is sold as a portable or travel model, it is the one I use daily. It is easy to use, effective, and does not take up much space. I take much better care of my teeth and gums because this Panasonic product is so handy and easy to use. A friend told me about this, and I have thanked him many times.</li>
            <li> Perfetc!    I buy this for my father, and he love it.    Strong construction,  very powerfull.    Recomended.    Don´t came with extra Replacement Nozzle like manual says, but came with batteries.</li>
            <li> Does the job but not put together any better than you can expect based on price and I don&#x27;t forsee and long relationship.</li>
            <li> i had this  same  item for 5 yrs and  it needed to be replaced, so ordered another......works great .......plenty of power ...</li>
            <li> This is fine for a portable irrigator - easy to use, though not especially powerful.  The two AA batteries wore out after about 2 weeks.  Cannot use rechargeable batteries--so will need to continue to buy AA batteries.  I may need to spring for a costlier Water-Pik to clean teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have found that a water pic flushing system is great for flushing out any remaining food residue after brushing and flossing.  I got the idea for this portable type from one of my patients who uses it for her developmentally disabled child.  It is easy to take on trips.  I have so many other electrical things plugged in at my vanity area (hair dryer, electric toothbrush, and vanity makeup mirror) that having this batter-operated water irrigator fit exactly what I needed.  I have learned that I need to move pretty swiftly around my mouth, but once I learned this trick I have been very happy with it. I definitely recommend this product.  Batteries last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my Panasonic EW1270AC which I&#x27;d had for a few years.  I had been really impressed with that model as the batteries lasted forever and it was quiet - something very important when new babies are in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up as a replacement but it&#x27;s seriously loud in comparison and on the first use the water container leaked a little - something I&#x27;d never seen before on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try and track down the older one as this needs some engineering improvements.  Making quieter for a start!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my father and mother-in-law. Both are using this often, and glad it works fine. however, the water container is too samll for daily use at home. it will be o.k. with travel.</li>
            <li> Needed a travel water jet device to help clean my teeth while traveling. Very happy with this one. Is compact and has the necessary water pressure.</li>
            <li> I had a \\&quot;wired\\&quot; model that my dentist gave me and it was so sloppy and cumbersome I threw it out. Ordered this and I just love it. It is just as powerful as the electric one I had and so much easier to use. I havent used it for traveling yet, but like that I&#x27;ll be able to. Totally pleased with this product, and, as usual, pleased with the delivery from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also have a waterpick and this unit is so much more practical. Cleaning it is easy and much too complicated with the waterpick.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan.  I impulsively bought this when it was on sale, mainly because I hate flossing my teeth and thought this would be a good alternative.  The actual device is nicely made, easy to use, compact ... I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of using it.  I always ended up spraying water everywhere, it made a mess of the bathroom sink area, and it didn&#x27;t feel like a comparable alternative to good ol&#x27; fashioned flossing.  It also ran out of water relatively quickly (I get it, the reservoir can&#x27;t be huge or it&#x27;d be really awkward and cumbersome to hold) -- between that and it creating a mess, I just didn&#x27;t find myself reaching for it as often as I&#x27;d hoped I would and eventually stopped using it.  Back to the floss!</li>
            <li> Worst piece of garbage ever. Panasonic should be embarrassed to put its name on this junk.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is a big disappointment. I am used to the WaterPik&#x27;s strong pressure. If you want good pressure, don&#x27;t order the Panasonic.  It does not thoroughly clean between my teeth, as the pressure is so low. Even with new batteries, there is hardly any pressure. I am tossing it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this atrocious product, donate the money to charity instead.  Panasonic design engineers must have phoned this one in. So stupidly designed because of a ridiculously small water tank/holder that you get about 20 seconds worth of water/spray.  A total waste of effort and money ...</li>
            <li> battery-powered portable oral irrigation /cleaning device works perfectly. Love the design. This purchase replaced another line-powered device which was not so useful. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have purchased 3 or 4 of this product, but at a much higher price.  I am delighted to have found it for approximately $20 cheaper.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the waterpik cordless at double the price and had problems with it.  I should have read the amazon reviews better and because of the good reviews the Panasonic got, I purchased one.  Tank size is adequate, love being able to use batteries which is great for travel as well as the size and shape.  The Waterpik had a cumbersome shape and there were many issues with the rechargeable battery.  Thanks to Amazons great customer service I was a able to return it and get another WaterPik when the first one would no longer work after 6 months.      For the price, you can&#x27;t lose and it&#x27;s quality is even better than those in a higher price range.  There are no extra attachment pieces and that is fine with me as they are not needed.  With my WaterPik I never used any of them as they serve no real function.      The only thing that could use a bit of work is the button design, it takes some getting used to and sometimes it is hard to shut off and easy to go from low to high but not low to off.  I can live with this minor quirk but if that were remedied it would be a perfect 5 star.  If you can&#x27;t live without an oral irrigator this is your model - it can&#x27;t be beat on either the price or quality level.</li>
            <li> The dentist likes the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this water flosser about two months ago only to have it die completely.  Thank goodness I got it on sale!  Save your money and buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Wow! was my first word after having tried out this miniature size water-cleaning device!....I have had counter top water picks of all brands , most do the job they are supposed to do, with a few of higher price doing a bit better ...but this little thing! beats them clearly!   1. compact ( I am a small woman) and length wise is no larger than the palm of my hand, width wise my hand almost goes around it (is&#x27;t about the size of a round hairbrush)   2. assembly and storage is amazing! all put together and ready for travel ... my cosmetic case is larger! (and I only have 5 items in it!)  3. the water tank holds and is sealed nicely, no dripping or water running out while in the suitcase if I did not have time to let it sit and drain.   4. Powerful! it gets all leftovers out! (gross to say ..but true!) if I do not have time to floss ..now I do not worry to go out an Kiss! give me 15 sec&#x27;s and zap!    5.WORTH THE MONEY I PAID!  ..some say pricey but ...my mouth speaks volumes and knowing nothing is left inside to be later spitted in someones face ..is priceless! :)  6. I will take it on an overseas trip and the best part ..NO CONVERTER needed!Runs on standard or rechargeable AA batteries ...so no need to guess what else to plug in your ONE usable outlet!   I could safely say ...this will probably give me more pleasure in my trip ...than having my ex with me! LOL  Buy it !</li>
            <li> It just arrived today.  I was excited to get it, only to find that to turn it on, I must turn it off, and to turn it off, I must turn it on.  Somehow, the mechanism must be installed improperly because it works in reverse and there is no second speed.  I went to the Panasonic website to figure out my next step (return to Amazon, or get replacement from Panasonic) only to discover that the Panasonic website works about as well as the oral irrigator!  ARGH!  Errors on submitting the form for an email response.  Errors on attempting to access the knowledge base.  It&#x27;s after hours, so I&#x27;ll have to wait until tomorrow to call the number and spend even more time on this.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I buy a new product, I actually expect it to work as advertised.  If I get this resolved I&#x27;ll come back and change my review.  But for now, this product does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> It does everything I wanted as promised.  Easy to use, easy to put together and I love that it is portable and uses batteries.</li>
            <li> This is an offensively bad product. Beyond awful. Do not under any circumstances buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral irrigators are, at their most basic level, a small water reservoir, some form of electricity, and a thin nozzle to spray high pressure water between your teeth. This product seems carefully designed to be the worst irrigator possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design flaws:&lt;br /&gt;1. For some unfathomable reason, this product is actually two moving pieces, you have to slide the two pieces apart in order to fill the water reservoir, but once you do, there is nothing keeping the two pieces apart. Which means that if you were to set the product down on the counter while it is full of water, the two pieces of it would slide back together, draining the entire reservoir onto the counter. That&#x27;s right, you can&#x27;t even set this product down without draining it completely&lt;br /&gt;2. In order to use it, you have to awkwardly hold the top and bottom halves of the product just far enough apart that they don&#x27;t collapse and spray water everywhere, but not so far apart that the hose inside the reservoir stops working&lt;br /&gt;3. The product is so long, heavy, and unwieldy that it is extremely difficult to aim inside your mouth&lt;br /&gt;4. The pressure is so high that if you miss your teeth (which you will a lot), it will hit the roof of your mouth, your tongue, and your uvula. This hurts, a LOT&lt;br /&gt;5. The power button is positioned such that it is nested between the two pieces and can&#x27;t be turned on or off without a lot of work. This is almost impossible to deactivate without looking, which means you have to take a high pressure water jet out of your mouth just to deactivate it&lt;br /&gt;6. The pressure is so high that unless you close your mouth entirely, it will spray everywhere. This product made a huge mess all over my counter, and the only way to prevent this was to get on my knees, kneel over the sink, and use it with my head in the sink bowl, which, due to the ridiculous length and shape, means that aiming the device was haphazard at best&lt;br /&gt;7. When I took the product out of it&#x27;s packaging, it smelled like moldy vomit. The stench was absolutely nauseating, and I had to spend 5 minutes scrubbing the outside and the inside of the product as best I could. I then drained three entire reservoirs worth of soapy water to try and clean out and rinse the tube inside, and even THEN, it still didn&#x27;t work. My mouth now smells like vomit, so thanks for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, to use this product, you have to slide it open, fill the reservoir, close the reservoir lid, hold the product vertically by both the top and bottom halves, keep them separated, put your head in the sink bowl, activate the device&#x27;s power without even being able to see it, then awkwardly spray the product around inside your mouth, frequently hitting and damaging the roof of your mouth and your uvula, occasionally choking and gagging when the high pressure spray goes down your throat, and having water occasionally spray everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the most important question is: once you get past the offensively bad design, does the product actually work? NO. It does not. I have several troublesome teeth where food frequently gets caught, and as an experiment, I used three full reservoirs worth of water trying to clean these trouble spots. Then I took dental floss and checked the result. The irrigator did absolutely nothing. It completely failed to get anything out of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a joke, it doesn&#x27;t even come close to working, it is designed so badly that I am stunned it ever made it out the door, and it came covered in something that smelled and tasted like rancid vomit. Look somewhere else, please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Original Panasonic portable oral irrigator purchased solely for travel purposes from Amazon March 23, 2012. Used on two vacation trips, the second of which significant motor slow down and minimal water pressure issues were experienced. Returned unit under warranty coverage to Panasonic Exchange Center in McAllen TX on November 29, 2012 (shipping at my own expense). Replacement unit (probably refurbished) received December 11, 2012 and subsequently used for short intervals on five more travel trips over next 15 months. During this period encountered low water pressure out of nozzle and noticeable water leakage between water tank and motor body when in use (seal not effective). Then early this year—after unit unused and in storage for approximately six months—motor would not turn on (completely dead)—unable to revive (kaput!). Just good for landfill now. Would rate zero stars if possible.</li>
            <li> Gross, I found black mold growing in the tank and Panasonic does not know how to clean this unit and told me I need to buy another! This is my second unit first one broke and I have bought one as a gift. I was shocked to find some black fungus growing in the tank. I take care to rinse and air dry my unit so I was really surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue is that their is no way to hold the unit without some of the water being rinsed from your mouth going back into the tank. Even more of an issue if you share with family members!! I tried to clean and disinfect without success. I still see black mold in the creases and the company offers no instructions to preventing this or correcting this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being disconnected several times due to being transferred to a non-working extentsion, I was told it was my responsiblity to call them and get instructions to blow dry the tank after each use. That will NOT disinfect the unit or the tubing. I was told then that I must replace the unit myself after it becomes infected which would be every several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not use this unit especially if you have gum disease you could be making it worse.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A, like to two levels of pressure. Batteries seem to last longer than earlier verion.</li>
            <li> So - it doesnt hold a lot of fluid, but the pressure is good and its so convenient that I use it daily - which is why I got it.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to keep teeth and gums squeeky clean.  The power is from two AA batteries and they last a good long time.  I have a small bathroom and this is the perfect size to keep in the drawer and no clumsy cord to fumble with.  I think Panasonic did a great job designing this water-pick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned three of the Panasonic oral irrigators. The first two units I owned were the predecessor model with the darker blue color. Both the old and new have some great features: A powerful motorized pump and a nicely sized water resevoir you can collapse for travel. Even the telescoping nozel can be removed and stowed away. Very cool. The current model has improved on the previous design. The resevoir is larger. This makes it possible to clean out your whole mouth by only filling the resevoir once.      One design flaw with both models is the hinged door on the resevoir. You swing it open to add water. However, I lost the hinge door on my first two units about a year. After a while, the plastic pegs that hold it in place weaken and the door comes loose. I expect the same thing to eventually happen with the unit I just bought since it is built the same way. Another way the unit can fail is the motor. On my first unit, the motor progressively lost power after a year or so of daily use.     Overall, the Panasonic irrigators are an effective tool for keeping teeth clean and I will continue to buy them. I once owned a Waterpik model and it was inferior to the Panasonic: A smaller resevoir, you could not collapse it for travel, and the water flow was weak. Panasonic offers a superior product.    As an aside, my dentist told me to continue to floss. The irrigators can remove large stuff stuck between teeth, but are not as effective at removing food that sits below the gum line.</li>
            <li> This is our second panasonic irrigator.  We really like this product. Our dental checkups have been much improved with it&#x27;s use.  It also leaves a wonderful clean feel to our mouths.  We read the directions this time, and use regular batteries instead of rechargeables. For the 2 of us regular batteries last 2 weeks with once a day use.  It has 2 speeds, but we always use the high speed (which is not really high).</li>
            <li> lower quality than expected.  Teeth and gum only.</li>
            <li> Had the original Panasonic (EW1270AC) since 2005 and still running great (6 years, used every day). Excellent quality. Beats Water pik many times over. I bought this newer model as a gift and they improved it, adding water capacity and it now has 2 speeds. Low speed is great for beginners, and high speed is more than powerful enough for long time users. I feel tempted to update to this model even though my original keeps on going strong. Don&#x27;t see great products like this too often!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product was even better than I expected. It works amazing! Brushed my teeth and flossed, but the Panasonic Oral Irrigator still removed more &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and made my teeth and gums feel amazingly clean. I bought two of these units and now I wish I would have bought one for everyone in my family. Got a great price on a &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34; special, but I would be happy to pay full price for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use this product, it can be a little intimidating. Even on the &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; speed recommended for first-time users and &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; cleaning, the water pressure feels weird at first. However, once you get used to it there are no issues. I experienced some slight gum bleeding on that first use as well, possibly because of using it wrong until I got comfortable with it, but from the second time I used it there was no bleeding. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to get a better clean at home.</li>
            <li> so much better than the  Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser (WP-440)&lt;br /&gt;this  Panasonic best for travel. no cord, only batteries. love it!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0027LSEPS Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A]]I purchased this because I don&#x27;t have the counter space for a full sized product. It took some getting used to. The spray is strong and when you are done I have to run the rest of the water in the shower or you will have water everywhere. It works well but is bulky because you have to hold the whole thing instead of just the tip when using the counter top type. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> the Panasonic Oral irrigator is wonderful for traveling. I use a Hydro floss at home but needed something less bulky for travel. This did a great job, but I wish it held more water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the EW-DJ10-A for about a month and think it performs well. If you&#x27;ve used a corded irrigator before there aren&#x27;t any real surprises.It takes a little getting used to the water tank and getting it positioned so it seals correctly. Not a huge issue. I got it for the portability. Uses AA Battery&#x27;s. (supplied) The tank quantity is small so you might have to refill the tank two or three times to complete your cleaning. It also takes some practice, as with any irrigator, to get used to a pattern of angling the tip as you go around your mouth. Two water jet speeds. Highest might be too much for some. All-in-all, cleaning takes 2-3 mins. Good value for the price of about $30. As a dentist would probably tell you, it works best when you floss first but is better that nothing if you don&#x27;t. No free lunch.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Good pressure. Inexpensive and effective alternative to flossing that&#x27;s easier on your gums. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic oral Irrigator for years without a problem. Just got this model for my wife. It is even better than what I have. Bigger water tank, and 2 speeds are nice features to have. I only suggest that you buy a charger and rechargeable batteries. Not only it is better for your wallet, but they last 10 times longer than regular batteries. I use Sanyo, but I am sure there are other good solutions.</li>
            <li> The unit I received must have been on the shelf for a while -- the batteries only lasted through the test phase. However, with a new set of 2 AA&#x27;s it works fine. Although it&#x27;s not as strong as my electric WaterPik and the reservoir must be filled a couple of times per use, it&#x27;s compact and convenient for travel, which is just what I needed it for. For crowns, braces, and/or bridges, an oral irrigator of some kind is essential to remove all the gunk stuck between and around them. Moreover, the dentist always comments on how healthy my gums appear!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this waterpick since a few month and it has been working flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;We use rechargeable battery, even though the doc says not too, and that still works fine. You need to dry it carefully before opening the battery compartment, so there would not be any humidity going in.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a set of replacement pick, so we have each ours; they have neat little color rings to identify them.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite convenient not to have any cable holding the contraption, and the power of the jet is plenty enough to do the job. And we take it with us when we travel.&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;After a bit more than a year of using this, some mold has appeared in the water compartment, which is impossible to clean. Especially at the o-ring, which started to leak.&lt;br /&gt;We asked if we could get a new o-ring from the manufacturer, but the part is not provided, so we could not open it and make sure it would close again.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, we threw it away and replaced it with another brand/model.</li>
            <li> The product is handy. The power is a little short and the battery life too.  But no worries with the power supply in various countries!</li>
            <li> it look like very good,Haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li> I use an oral irrigator that attaches to the faucet when at home, The faucet attached irrigator is not something I can easily use in a hotel room or on a camping trip. I was glad to find this unit for when I am on the road.  It has as much cleaning power as the faucet irrigator.</li>
            <li> 15 years ago I purchased a Panasonic irrigator that did not have much power, so I tried 2 other models from other companies.  I am really pleased with this one. It is exceptionally good for a battery operated model.  It effectively removes debris that one cannot get with floss and brushing, and is compact for travelling.</li>
            <li> I got this because I finally gave up trying to convince myself that I \\&quot;will\\&quot; start flossing on a daily basis.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now so it was time to give up on that fantasy and try finding something that will make the daily chore breezy enough to do so I will do it every day.  I got this one because it&#x27;s cordless and uses regular batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the people who say it&#x27;s messy to use.  I absolutely CANNOT use this without getting water all over myself and on the mirror.  So I have to wear my bathrobe whenever I want to floss so that I don&#x27;t get all wet.  this is ok for me because I take my shower at night and then put on my robe and then brush my teeth / floss.  I don&#x27;t know if other irrigators are just as messy as this one because this is my first one.  When I first used it my gums bled and it hurt!  But now after a couple of weeks of using it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all any more.  No more bleeding either.  Now if I could just get it to stop spraying water everywhere...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After a few weeks of use, I&#x27;ve managed to not spray water everywhere and am able to keep it off my clothes and just in my mouth.  Didn&#x27;t think it would be possible.  In my case it took a while to practice.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested using a water irrigator. This was about half the price of other products in the same category. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and am very satisfied. It does such a good job cleaning that I don&#x27;t need to floss any longer. I tried flossing a few times after using the irrigator and there were no leftovers. I&#x27;m considering buying another one for my wife.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but no cover for the head</li>
            <li> A nice portable device... It probably does not have as much power as some...but is small and convenient . Easy to fill.</li>
            <li> I feel this product is a good value for the price paid. It is not as strong as the plug in but gets job done</li>
            <li> What a great product. Thank Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I suppose that any product as dreadfully named as the Panasonic EW-DJ10-A is a product that&#x27;s likely to perform its intended task with single minded efficiency.  After all, if you&#x27;re going to let your engineers rather than your marketing people name your product, it&#x27;s pretty clear that you&#x27;re placing a high premium on functionality and somewhat less of an emphasis on form.  Sure enough, the Panasonic&#x27;s little irrigator isn&#x27;t the most aesthetically appealing product in the world, but it gets the job done.    Namely, it holds a respectable amount of water, shoots said water into one&#x27;s mouth, and in the process dislodges food particles.  So what more could one want in an oral irrigator?  Well, a little more power would be nice.  I also own a hydrofloss irrigator, and this little chap simply doesn&#x27;t compare in the pressure department.  It&#x27;s not bad at all, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the kick that the hydrofloss sports.  On the plus side, it&#x27;s MUCH  queiter than my hydrofloss, which sounds like it&#x27;s experiencing the mechanical equivalent of an epileptic seizure every time I hit the switch.  Also, in the unit&#x27;s defense, there&#x27; simply no way that a product operated by a couple of double AAs is going to have the same amount of power as a plug-in unit.  Which bring&#x27;s me to the Panasonic&#x27;s best point, portability.  It&#x27;s small size is simply perfect for traveling or when one&#x27;s away from the house.    Overall, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this unit.  The build quality is excellent and it does what it&#x27;s designed to do.  I can&#x27;t comment on reliability or battery life, since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far it&#x27;s been great.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This unit is battery driven and very weak.  It is very inconvenient to use as the bottle is attached to the spray unit.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to a regular water pic and this one is just not powerful enough to be satisfactory.  Also, the small plastic piece which holds the water n broke shortly after I purchased this item which means I have to hold my thumb over it in order to get it to work.  I&#x27;d rather swish my mouth out with mouthwash than use this item!!</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this product and since I have always been happy with Panasonic products, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try......It&#x27;s great and I&#x27;m very happy with it for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> The size was perfect for traveling and it did its job; would not use for everyday as needs to be refilled in order to floss entire mouth.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with the previous model which died days before the 2-year warranty was up, this irrigator works well. It does the job of flushing out food even after you&#x27;ve rinsed and brushed.  But this new model arrived with the cover of the battery compartment unable to be opened. It was stuck shut. The people at Panasonic suggested I try prying it open with a screwdriver! Since its plastic, that would have demolished the cover and still left it shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just returned it to Amazon, that wonderful customer-friendly company. Amazon is sending a replacement right away. If I can get the batteries into it, I&#x27;ll write a review of how well it functions.</li>
            <li> This is my go to floss that I can tote around wherever I go.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very useful, if the power of the water is stronger, it will be better. but for it&#x27;s small size, it&#x27;s power is good enough.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these for several years and like it.  My original one \\&quot;died\\&quot; and I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> This is must have for travelers. Great for camping too. Small, light, battery operated and strong enough to get the job done. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The product is useful, but not as useful as it should be. The water stream is not powerful enough to fully clean one&#x27;s teeth, particularly if one has braces. I suspect the device will help maintain oral hygiene, but don&#x27;t count on it being anywhere near as powerful as a plug in model, and don&#x27;t count on it to remove all trapped food particles.     Some reviewers have complained about the size of the water reservoir. It is true that the reservoir is limited, but this reviewer did not find this a problem; if needed one an always re-fill and continue.     Battery life is better than expected. I used one set of batteries for two-weeks. For optimum performance, batteries probably should be changed more frequently, perhaps weekly. If you are traveling you might consider using rechargeable batteries and bringing the charger.       Bottom line, the produce is better than nothing, but needs improvement.</li>
            <li> I thought it was weird looking but it definitely does the job. The irrigator head stores in the side of the unit. it has a 2 speed setting for water. I use it for mouth wash and water. It is battery operated. It gets everything i missed after brushing. I would buy it again. If anything goes wrong with it, i will update.   When you are done using it, the tip goes in the side and you push the white, upper part down into the blue part.</li>
            <li> Product fizzled out in about two months. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic Oral irrigator. The new one can be folded up and operated by battery, that is good for traveling. In additional, it has bigger water container, so I can clean up my teeth in one water charge.</li>
            <li> After maybe a year or so it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. It turns on and makes noise like it&#x27;s working but I&#x27;m guessing the pump is broken as even with a full tank of water nothing comes out. Before it broke I liked it well enough. This was my first water pick-like device so the pressure was satisfactory for me. A full tank doesn&#x27;t last long though so you have to hurry and then refill for a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item because I recently got braces on my teeth. I highly recommend this product, great power, and convenience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun-Oral B stationary water pick since 1999 and I&#x27;m totally satisfied with it. Unfortunately it was recently broken down after so many years of service. I wanted to buy it again, but the model was discontinued, perhaps because it was so durable and they couldn&#x27;t make a good sale out of it. After reading many reviews, I decided to buy this Panasonic portable water pick, keeping in mind that it has a disadvantage of being &#x27;bulky&#x27;, especially for my kids. I don&#x27;t mind this, because I&#x27;ve already ordered a WaterPick WP100 for them, as they are now a bit more grown up and stay on a different floor in our house.      The product arrived on time in a thorough packaging, though I believe the high quality of its plastic would not require such a thoroughness. Being prepared to see a bulky thing, I was not very surprised with its modest size when it was in the package. It was just 6.5 inches high. However, I admit that when I expanded it for use, I said \\&quot;wow\\&quot;. It became ~1.5 times higher, which is 8.5 inches. I&#x27;m now sure that my 8-year-old son wouldn&#x27;t love holding it in his hand. However, it should be OK for my daughter, who is only 6.3 feet height, because it is just right with me, who is not too much higher (I&#x27;m an Asian guy of medium size).     What I&#x27;m surprised most with this product is that its pulsated stream of water was just of the right size and power, the same like of the Braun-Oral B I used before. The only difference is that with Braun-Oral B I had the ability to adjust the power step-less. However, I always had to watch the dial to stay at the right low and high points that I later found other family members of mine also use. With Panasonic, the water is just right for normal cleaning when I turn it on, at the first speed. At the second speed, it is also just right for clearing of more &#x27;stubborn&#x27; debris. I can imagine how much research had the Panasonic engineers done to find out this point. Still, this is not everything. I must say that every detail of this product shows its quality and rationality. The pick is turnable so that you can adjust it at your right angle, but it sits tight enough to not rotate spontaneously. The hose inside the tank made the unit usable at any angle. The power switch and battery lid are very well water-proof. The lid of the tank is also very good. Once I rush to meetings and just throw the unit in my drawer without discharging redundant water. In the car, I realized that there were some important paper together with it, and I rushed back just to find out that nothing happened. There was no water leaking.    All in one, this portable water pick is paying off for its value of money. I would recommend it not only for travel, but also for use at home. It can even replace the stationary version, because thanks to the right size of its tank, you don&#x27;t have to refill it many times during one use.</li>
            <li> Easy, low tech, portable.  Have used others with more complex systems and like the battery system best.  Easy to carry on a trip/no outlets or cords.  Also affordable to replace every few years.</li>
            <li> Great price, and very nice product.  I looked into this type of product for weeks trying to decide on what to buy.  Even would go out to store to see them for comparisons.  This is compact and great to travel with and I like that it runs on batteries.  Takes up very little space on the counter and the water chamber is not an issue for me, just add more water. So far so good and hoping my dentist will see the  results.</li>
            <li> My husband has implants and religiously irrigates his teeth every night.  He wore out his Water-pik in 6 months and decided to try this Panasonic oral irrigator.  It delivers a much more powerful stream and unlike the Water-Pik does not require frequent recharging.</li>
            <li> I got this Oral Irrigator, and it does a good job. it&#x27;s a little or maybe a little more than a little Messy,over all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very good for traveling.  It is not as strong as   my electric water pic but very satisfactory  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a low cost way to keep my daughters new palate expander clean.  Most everything was double this price.  This is a portable unit so when we go on vacation it can come with us.  I&#x27;ve now used it for about 6 weeks and it works fine.  Easy to work with.  Does just what I needed it to do.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Runs on batteries, but still feels powerful enough to dislodge food stuck in your teeth. The only inconvenience is that I have to refill the water tank twice to complete cleaning of my teeth. But I can bear with that for the portability.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums from overuse of benadryl for sleep. I used this upstate in a cabin where I don&#x27;t have running water and it worked great for about 6 months then died. Improved my gums greatly. It does not however hold enough water and leaks. I would get the larger capacity plugin type.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product. Easy to store, looks great on sink vanity, full power, better than my old electric, perfect for travel. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Our biggest disappointment are the batteries - it does not come with rechargeable batteries and charger, which I found very surprising. I guess I should read product descriptions more closely. With two of us using it every night, they last about a week which is a total waste. It works, but not very easy to use without splashing water on yourself, though with practice we are getting better. Overall, I am not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure of these portable models but after reading many reviews, this model stood out to me the most. I tried it on several trips out of town and it really works well, great water pressure but not too much to be painful. I also get occasional tonsil stones, and this device is great for getting back in the throat to wash them out as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Lost pressure after 1 month of use.  Changed batteries but still not working.  Bis disappointment.  Besides, it&#x27;s so inconvenient to use 2 AA batteries.  I wish this product is rechargeable by itself.</li>
            <li> This device has greatly improved my oral health. During my last visit to have my teeth cleaned the hygenist said \\&quot;Whatever you are doing, keep doing it\\&quot;. I had no plaque along my gum line and my teeth looked great.</li>
            <li> I have used three times, this portable water flossing is very convenient, very clean , the most important is that it allows me to develop good habits.</li>
            <li> The AA battery operated Panasonic Oral Irrigator works better than the rechargeable Waterpik that I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light-weight, very portable, and it works great. Highly recommended. I&#x27;m very glad I bought it here at Amazon! Great price, great value.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for one time use. It&#x27;s big and hard to hold and re-position as you&#x27;re moving it around in the mouth. My old Water Pik was much better!</li>
            <li> Other than the water pressure being weaker than I prefer, this is a relatively well made product.&lt;br /&gt;The water compartment will be depleted in about 30 seconds of rinsing. So you will need to refill quite a few times per session.&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that the angle of the spray head and how you hold it will be slightly awkward.&lt;br /&gt;however, this is overall a decent product for the price point and the added convenience of travel utility.&lt;br /&gt;Runs on 2x AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Overall quality is decent.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, very easy to use.  When I use it once per day, batteries have to be changed monthly.</li>
            <li> Nice portable charger that is powerful enough to do the job. The only drawback for me is the battery power, but it efficiently manages power and will last for weeks using the same battery</li>
            <li> Have not used a waterpik type device in decades but decided to do a better job with the teeth and this thing seems to do the trick. I like the idea of replaceable AA batteries, which are holding up well after a month of use. (I refuse to buy any product you have to throw away when the battery dies) And although I feared this bulky design would be harder to use than the old pik only appliance I had used as a kid, it&#x27;s not too bad. Not sure about the collapsible design. I don&#x27;t travel much so of little use to me. And a bit clunky. But it works. Water tank size is ample for me clean all my teeth. Not sure why others are complaining about this unless they are spending a minute or two on each tooth. Probably runs for about a minute, which is enough for cover all the territory. But even if you need to reload more water, its a very simple thing to do. This is a very simple device designed to do one thing and it does it pretty well at a reasonable price. Can&#x27;t ask for much more</li>
            <li> I am handicapped and can only use one arm,  You definitetly need two arms or there is mess and splatters all over the plce.  There was no indication of this .  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t do with out this on trips as I need to be vigilant about dental care. Tried the rechargable PowerGenix AA batteries and like the extra power boost from the batteries slighly higher voltage and significantly lower interal inpedance (lets the battery source higher current for more powerful operation).</li>
            <li> In the past I have had a Waterpik plug-in oral irrigator taking up more counter space than I care to spare.  I got one of these over ten years ago and it finally wore out so I replaced it with this one.  Same design.  Does a good job and travels easily. I hope this one is as reliable as the last.</li>
            <li> runs out of water very fast</li>
            <li> Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;good!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid the 123 people who gave this contraption a 4 or 5 star review, seem to have no clue as to what a good dental irrigator is all about. The water pressure, even at the high #2 setting is pitifully low, compared to, say, a Waterpik or similar electronic type. The water reservoir is so small, it has emptied out after 30-40 seconds - meaning that for a good irrigation job, you end up refilling it four or five times. Even with water in it, you have to keep moving your wrist around to keep the water jet going properly. To top it all off, the water reservoir leaks, should you not use the irrigator right away. In other words, don&#x27;t fill it up and put it down for a bit, because you meant to do something else, however briefly. The worst appliance I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower daily after dinner while waiting for my moisturizer to kick in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to keep my gums clean.</li>
            <li> Got this for travel, but like it so well I&#x27;ve used it daily for 3 months.  Just had my semi-annual cleaning and the hygienist said my teeth and gums looked the best she&#x27;d ever seen them.</li>
            <li> We switched to this brand once our relatively-new water piks died after only a couple years. The water pik before that lasted more than 10 years.  So we were looking for something more durable than the current crop of badly designed water piks.  This Panasonic one is not that item.  The second one of these finally died after only about 18 months of sporatic service.  We got this one because the reviews seemed to indicate it would last.  I came back to write this review for posterity so it&#x27;s clear they are no better than the current crop of poor-durability water piks.  Planned failure of consumer devices is a pox on our culture these days.  Thanks for nothing Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I would buy for everyday use, but its great for travel.  It easily packs and works well in the shower. Relatively low pressure, but sufficient.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing so my dentist recommended a water pik.  I read the reviews on Amazon and settled on this one because of the reviews, the price and the fact that it is compactable for travel.  I use it in the shower and I&#x27;m sure this may lessen the life of the product, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues yet.  I go back to my dentist in a few months, so hopefully it will look like I&#x27;ve been flossing.  Very happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but the amount of water flow during use seems a bit excessive.  Could be that I just need to get used to using it.  Physical size seems a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> Leaked all over the place, and sent water everywhere. An awful mess! After one day of trying to find a benefit in using it, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it. Back in the box it went, and Amazon took it back. Might have been a bad unit, not sure. On the return form I called it defective. If it&#x27;s actually designed to send water everywhere, then it&#x27;s a defective design!</li>
            <li> I am in love! I have braces so being able to floss with this is amazing! It does the job and makes your mouth feel very clean. The only thing is that because it&#x27;s so powerful, water splashes on the mirror. But regardless love it.</li>
            <li> I expected the stream from the irrigator to be a lot stronger and more precise, more like what the dentist offices have.  I usually end up getting water all over my clothes but hopefully as I refine my technique, this won&#x27;t happen.  I do like it, however.  It&#x27;s faster than floss. I bought the irrigator after having wire mesh placed across six of my teeth which had come loose because I fell on a sidewalk and my jaw was also broken. I think the water is a gentle way to care for this injured area.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different water flosses but they either had very little pressure or only lasted a very short period of time.  I travel weekly and need one that is compact and reliable.  This one is lightweight and has 2 levels of pressure.  I also like that it takes regular batteries so I don&#x27;t need a charging cord that may or may not charge a unit.  Definatly worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am new to water flossers. I was referred to the WaterPik and did quite of bit of research before buying this one. I wanted a portable one so that i could use it in the shower. Panasonic was rated better than the WaterPik one. It comes with a 2 year warranty compared to WP&#x27;s 1 year. I kept reading about WP&#x27;s battery issues and didn&#x27;t want to have to deal with it. Panasonic uses AA batteries so its easy to replace. It folds come to the size of deodorant which makes it much less of an eye sore if left on the counter. I am very pleased with the pressure (not sure i would want it any stronger), the cosmetic looks, and its ease to use. The water &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; holds enough water to clean my entire mouth, no need to refill it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a water flosser.</li>
            <li> Size is very nice. I use this everyday to clean teeth after brushing. It works great in removing debris between teeth that my oral b toothbrush can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> IT IS FABULOUS --- GOT HERE PROMPTLY  AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I really liked this water pick until the motor gave out last week.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it just puts out a very weak stream (after changing batteries and cleaning the flow tube).  it sounds like the motor is going to totally die.</li>
            <li> This works great and is inexpensive.  It really gets the job taken care of.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> For the price I pay it&#x27;s awesome, you must or preferably use during shower, tend to splash a lot due to its power, for traveling it&#x27;s the best thing you can own, really helpful. A must have item</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product,after 2sec of use-mouth full of water but nothing cleanse up,and need to fill with water so many times to finish whole mouth</li>
            <li> Purchased 5 months ago and I use it every morning.  This is the best way to massage and clean the pockets around your teeth for healthy gums.  Yes you still have to brush and floss.  The great thing about this unit is that you can use it in the shower.  I add a splash of mouthwash to the reservoir for extra freshness and to get fluoride in between my teeth.  I replace the batteries once a month.  I had been using this water flosser for 2 weeks when I went in for a cleaning.  My hygienist was very impressed because after years of having pocket measurements that were borderline high, I now have no inflammation around the gum line and all measurements are normal.  She had been pushing me to use an electric toothbrush and was not aware of this device.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Easy to use and a nice finish after brushing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this piece o&#x27;crap. It worked for ten days and quit. I changed the battery. The thing turns on but no water comes out of the spout. I can&#x27;t even get the dumb thing apart to see if it&#x27;s plugged up. I swear, it doesn&#x27;t matter what brand of these things you buy. I&#x27;ve bought two Waterpiks in the past and they stopped running after about two months. I bought this because it was portable and cheaper, but it makes no difference. They don&#x27;t work short term let alone long term. Like a fool, I bought a second one. This one last about three months. Usually it just needed a change in battery. But tonight I changed the batteries, and it&#x27;s still acting like it&#x27;s on its last leg. I have braces. I have to use something. I suppose I will just keep buying these rip-offs until I get my braces off and that won&#x27;t be for another year. Why can&#x27;t someone make a good one of these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I first purchased this item, I have realized I need to check to make sure my batteries are new and work well. That makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when the product starts getting dirty, I submerge the whole thing (minus the battery) in a container full of hydrogen peroxide. I leave it there for 24 hours and then am able to clean it and make sure any accumulated crud comes out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disregard my prior remarks....this product is well worth buying (especially when you have braces)!</li>
            <li> I like it.  The battery lasts long time, and it cleans out very well.  You can also use it for other purposes, like watering flowers and trees in the garden and creating water fountains for your kinds etc. etc.</li>
            <li> Talk about a piece of junk!!  I strongly suggest you do not purchase this device.  It is not easily used as water squirts all over when trying to do small spaces and it&#x27;s very hard to handle.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this for 3+ weeks on the same 2 AA batteries and it works well.  I was curious about the other person writing about his son not being very tall and can&#x27;t use this, but now I understand.  It is quite long once extended, so if you are short, you might not be able to bend over your sink and use this device, but I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and have no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after trying several portable units.  They were either bulky or under powered.  This unit is neither of these.  Love that it can be compressed into a small carrier and that it works so well.  I do not think that it is any messier than your standard Water Pic and it is a lot more portable.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item as a replacement for my water pik.  Overall I like the design. It works well off of battery supply.  My only dislike of the item are the tips.  I personnally like the smaller tip design from water pik and panasonic does not have these.    If your looking for a travel oral irrigator, give this one a try.  It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at work to clean my throat, the pulse action is VERY strong, if that is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Just want to say I love the Panasonic Oral Irrigator. It is fantastic for traveling. Use a bigger one that I had for everyday use, but this is great for anytime especially travel.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Works as described. I was hoping that the item might be more compact to make it more suitable for travel. The reservoir is larger than expected.</li>
            <li> I have only had this item for a month.  I have changed the batteries one time.  The previous irrigators that I purchased had battery issues.  This brand uses AA batteries so if I do have a battery problem I am able to replace them.  My previous items lasted for a year or less.  Hopefully this one lasts longer</li>
            <li> excellent product-out Dentist recommended it!!!</li>
            <li> first water flosser iv&#x27;e owned &amp; it works great. my wife likes it too so i&#x27;ll be buying another one. just another amazon sucess story.</li>
            <li> Having used several water pic type devices, I decided to try this Panasonic portable one so I could appease my dentist. Have not actually traveled with it except to walk around the bathroom--you need a sink close by for the mouth drainage--but it is compact and could easily fit in a shaving kit.  I am still on the first set of batteries--AA alkaline--after several months.  The force is adjustable--2 positions, and the attacked \\&quot;tank\\&quot; holds enough water for one cleaning.  Nice not to have an additional cord on the counter.  The freedom of not having a water line, tank, and AC cord make this model more user friendly.  It is easy to fill the tank--have not used with anything except water and don&#x27;t feel a need to do so.  Was most surprised at the unpleasant taste I occasionally find hiding between teeth even after brushing. Disgusting but...</li>
            <li> In decided on this one because there&#x27;s not a lot of counter space in my bathroom. I gave away my bigger one because it took up too much room, and was a pain to deal with. This one has two speed/force settings, which is nice.  The top slides down into the reservoir making it compact and easy to travel with. However, there is nothing to keep the top up, so when you&#x27;re trying to use it the top slides down. Wouldn&#x27;t be a horrible event, except it blocks the on/off switch. When you pull it back up the entire unit is wet, now it&#x27;s slippery.</li>
            <li> This is my first \\&quot;oral irrigator\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and it didn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of it.  I think it has been useful especially when I forget to floss.  I think the pressure could be harder.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I purchased.  The on/off switch on the first intermittantly stayed on, so after a couple of years I bought another one.  The tip on the new unit is very tight and it&#x27;s a struggle to get it out of the unit for packing.  That is the only downside.  Found this product a couple of years ago after having  problems with Water-Pik rechargeable batteries not lasting more than a year.  This is a much better way to go.</li>
            <li> My dentists recommended that I try this specific device because I travel extensively for my work. I ordered it on Amazon and it was delivered the next day. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It is an excellent design. It is durable. It is high quality and most of all it works as good as any similar device.</li>
            <li> I bought an irrigator years ago at Sharper Image virtually identical to this one. I used it daily for years and carried it with me wherever I went. It finally bit the dust. I was delighted to find this Panasonic on Amazon. And, my dental hygenist was always impressed at the small amount of plaque on my teeth. Great product! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is VERY GOOD, although it could spray just a little harder.  It has settings of 1 &amp; 2.  A #3 would make this a 5-star product.  Maybe my countertop WaterPik Mod. WP-60W has spoiled me ?  Regardless, this is a wonderful unit for traveling.  WAY BETTER than not having one!  It is worth the money, just know that it doesn&#x27;t pulse-out water as forceful as some countertop units.</li>
            <li> Great product  so much better than. Waterpink as it ihas much stronger water force.  I have purchased for myself and friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know more after the next trip to the dentist, but for now the irrigator seems to be doing the job. I travel quite a bit and it is really nice to have a unit that is compact for packing. I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last, but it is still pumping strong after everyday use for 3 weeks. The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking it would be an alternative to flossing. Not so. There&#x27;s two settings, the first (low) setting doesn&#x27;t yield any results, and even after using the second setting, there&#x27;s still things that aren&#x27;t able to be reached and are unable to be removed other than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t floss, this is better than nothing, but otherwise, save your money and look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Works well and seems almost as effective as traditional flossing. The single control switch should be placed differently though - it seems rather poorly placed. Otherwise very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO US. THE BUTTON IS TO TIGHT AND YOU CAN&#x27;T CONTROLL THE WATER</li>
            <li> This is a good piece of equipment. It&#x27;s easy to use and very portable. I take it with me when I travel. It packs easily and can be used even in an airport restroom.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the speed of delivery.   The product itself was somewhat disappointing. After using a WaterPik with a bigger capacity reservoir, I filled the Panasonic at least 2 times trying to match the thorough job I was used to.  The pulsating was not as strong as I had had with my WaterPik. Therefore, I felt it wasn&#x27;t doing as well.  Since my WaterPik unit was years old, I thought I&#x27;d try something new (and save a little money). I also like the idea that I can easily take the Panasonic when I&#x27;m away from home.  However, it is important to me to have an oral irrigator which does a thorough job. That is why I then ordered replacement tips for my WaterPik(the original reason for my shopping for an oral irrigator was that all my old tips had broken). BTW, the tips were shipped from Goodman&#x27;s and delivered in record time.  Now I&#x27;m happy as a lark (how happy is a lark?) because I&#x27;m using my WaterPik and I have something that&#x27;s not cumbersome to travel with.</li>
            <li> Over the years I enjoyed using different Waterpik irrigaters. This Panasonic unit works as well as those and is more portable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after my faithful Waterpik  finally wore out.  I thought I would give it a try  mostly because it would take up less room on my  crowded bathroom counter. Mistake, it does take up  less room but is clumsy to use and does not have  enough water to do the job.  Might be ok to travel  with but that is about all.</li>
            <li> Why buy any other kind, including plug-in?   Simple list of benefits:  -No cords, therefore no tangle and no need to find a plug  -no base station and no un-serviceable internal batteries to wear out  -Small footprint  -plenty of power  -very compact when collapsed  -tip protected when collapsed  -inexpensive  -Been using 2 months with Eneloop XX[[ASIN:B004DW7S06 SANYO eneloop AA pre-charged NiMH Rechargable Batteries powerfull xx 2500 mAh Limited Quantity!! (4 Batteries)]] and have not needed recharge  -Heck, if you&#x27;re travelling, you can even use bottled water and just drink what you&#x27;re rinsing with [ok, that&#x27;s too gross for some of you, but think about it for a second]</li>
            <li> This is the best oral irrigator I have used. It does an excellent job. It met all of my expectations.  Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best and easiest products I&#x27;ve bought.  So simple to use and makes your mouth so refreshed.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me and I bought one on a lark. I am so happy with it. It even takes popcorn  hulls out of my gum line and when I mix a little mouthwash with the water it is very refreshing. Top notch and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is adequate</li>
            <li> all my family love this gizmo, much better than the wire!</li>
            <li> Had this unit for 2+ years thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Only two speed settings - mid or high. High is too painful for me, and mid doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough punch. Not really as good as the countertop Waterpik that has many settings.&lt;br /&gt;  Tip does have room to get all the way back there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Water runs out quickly. You can expect that if you&#x27;re carefully spraying in between each tooth, and along the entire gumline in and out, you may need 2-3 fillups to cover the entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Not easy at all to turn the power off with the finger/thumb while it&#x27;s being used. Thus, when going from one side of the mouth to the other, or top to bottom, your gums/inner cheeks get a painful spray. Else, you&#x27;ll have to take it out of your mouth and it&#x27;ll jet everywhere. Or, you&#x27;ll have to awkwardly hold it while you fumble for the off position, and that area of the tooth/gums get blasted a bit too long.&lt;br /&gt;  Expect to hold your mouth open over a sink all the time or the water coming out will go everywhere - mirror, sinktop, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Cleaning - simply dump water out from hole, wash outside with soap and water, fill hole with a bit of clean water, spray it until empty, pull unit apart, wash with soap and water, detatch tip, wash with soap and water. Dry outside on clean towel, shake out as much water as you can from container part, set out on clean towel in dry area to air dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;  Pretty much the only sure way to make sure the unit is DRY and CLEAN, which prevents mold/bacterial growth.&lt;br /&gt;  If you&#x27;re not happy with doing this each and every time you use the unit, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Otherwise, for a &#x27;portable pik&#x27;, it works decent for the AA&#x27;s it runs on.&lt;br /&gt;  BUT, given the money, if I had to buy only one, I&#x27;d go back to the Waterpik countertop used for decade+ for cleaning. Just works like it should and you always have one hand free to turn the spray on/off/up/down as you need to.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these about two months ago for my children with braces.  They are very simple to use, durable, and do not at all \\&quot;burn up batteries\\&quot; as one reviewer had it.  In fact, we have not even had to change the batteries yet!  My kids fill up the irrigator about three times in order to do a thorough job.  There is a big improvement in the cleanliness of their teeth as a result of using this.  These irrigators are really excellent for travel as well, since they are so compact and are batter-operated.  I recently bought one for myself since I was so impressed.</li>
            <li> I bought the original irrigator  many years ago, and it still works.  The intake tube on that model tended to get algae growing in it.  Running a strong solution of bleach through the system for a few seconds cleared that problem, but after 10 years or so I figured I&#x27;d  go with a new model.  The new one has dual speeds (very nice for sensitive gums) and the batteries last much longer.  Other than that, the case has a different color.  It looks more &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34;.  Same if not better performance, and a nice upgrade to the original.</li>
            <li> It works very well and removes any food particals stuck between your teeth.  I have dental implants and it keeps the space between the teeth and gums very clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good oral irrigator. It is cute and handy. Also, it runs by AA battery. So, I can bring it anywhere,  even when traveling abroad. The size of the water tank is adequate. But the grip for water force control is a little bit slippery.</li>
            <li> After using it nightly for a month, rinsing it afterwards then drying it, I have noticed a mildew-odor from the unit.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several non-toxic and non-abrasive solutions, all to no avail. It&#x27;s too bad because the item works well, just stinks from mildew.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted customer service but they said that I could not send the unit back because it&#x27;s 20 days past their warranty, even though the unit is guaranteed for 2 years for parts. Since the untit technically works, they offered no help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you know someone personally at Panasonic, don&#x27;t buy this unit.</li>
            <li> Easy-to-use, easy for traveling . . . great all-round!!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. I really love this cleaning machine. The batteries are very durable. It won&#x27;t cause the bleeding gums. Now I can&#x27;t live without this oral irrigator!Love it so much!</li>
            <li> Good quality, low price。。。。。</li>
            <li> it was exactly as described and the battery life seems to last pretty long.  I would buy another one and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Always trying to keep my teeth and gums in tip-top shape, I decided to purchase this apparatus.  The first time I used it, I opened my mouth and gave the bathroom mirror a nice wash. Before going to bed, I floss, use the irrigator, and then brush. Just be mindful that if you have just returned from the dentist and your gums are sensitive that you may feel some discomfort.  All in all this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Oral Irrigator works well.  I have owned this product for over one year. Reliable.  The tip should be replaced after one year to continue get the most efficient water flow.  Alkaline batteries last about 2-3 months with once a day use. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for travel -- rather than lug the big electric unit.  The problem: the portable waterpik is so WEAK as to be useless!  To be fair, I always use the electric unit at 10 -- full blast -- because my gums are used to that setting and don&#x27;t bleed.  So if you are considering this gadget for travel, forget it.  It doesn&#x27;t really do anything -- other than to maybe remove some food particles.  I never use it and should get my money back.  Useless.</li>
            <li> The flosser just arrived today and I was ready. I recently had to have a deep gum cleaning because my gums became inflamed. The experience was not one that I want to have again. My dentist  did numb my mouth for it but when he went over certain spots; it was the first time I was ready to run out of his office!&lt;br /&gt;So he recommended I floss more and he ordered some special mouth wash. The first few days after I was fine. Able to floss and brush out anything stuck between my teeth. But then I finally had some read meat and it was down hill from here. I actually considered returning to my Dentist for him to retrieve what ever it was.&lt;br /&gt;But after doing some research and reading other people issues their dentist recommended water flosser. I did not want to buy a gadget  that did not work. This Flosser was recommend and noted for gently cleaning around the gums. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had some beef, corn on the cob and I could feel that it was getting right into the problem areas. After eating I ran to this thing to use it for the first time. It did the job. I have no pain. I&#x27;m not taking Motrin because I picked my gums badly. Gum health is so important and I will water floss as long as I have my own teeth!</li>
            <li> Very good, worthy of promotion, especially have tooth decay teeth clean</li>
            <li> My wife and I each have one of these.  They work like a charm.  They were originally purchased 5 years ago and are used daily.  The battery operated pump on one quit last year and the second quit recently.  $30 for five years of outstanding daily service in my view is worthy of re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a handy product. I like it because it is battery operated and very easily portable.  It has very good power and does what it is supposed to do. I would recommend this product to anyone and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> So far it works well, enough to get the gunk between my teeth.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose but you should use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> I really like this Panasonic Irrigator.  I haven&#x27;t used a Water-Pik device in years but my dentist recommended one like this which is portable and can easily be used in the shower.  I can get by with one tank full of water on the low speed, but usually fill up the tank again for use on the higher speed. Overall, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, will drain out any left overs from between the Gums. I would highly recommend this for folks who have had wisdom tooth problems (food getting stuck in cavities &amp; in between the gums). Excellent for back of the mouth (2nd &amp; 3rd molars) where a normal tooth brush would not reach. When ever I travel I keep it with me because I hate poking a finger at the back of the mouth when some food is stuck. I would pour in a lid full of listrine for every time I use it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Portable, compact&lt;br /&gt;2. Great Power, just love the two power modes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Size: Fits in the right amount of water for a single use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A little hard to clean (but the benefits outweigh this shortcoming by a mile)</li>
            <li> Top half does not stay in correct position, I had to use electrical tape to hold it in use position.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works well, easy and portable</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling - nice and compact.  But like my Waterpik/Flosser for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Had to floss with regular floss after</li>
            <li> Good for travel when you can&#x27;t or do not wish to carry the large Waterpik.</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made.  Looks like it was made in China.  Not up to Panasonic  standards.  I hope it does  not break too soon.</li>
            <li> This product is compact. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Water Pik for years. It&#x27;s great but bulky and I have to bring it up from the storage to the counter.&lt;br /&gt;This irrigator is so compact that I can leave it out. But - It&#x27;s got plenty of power. Now I actually use it every day. Is my dental hygienist going to be happy!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much better product.</li>
            <li> A powerful little water flosser. Easy to assemble &amp; use at home &amp; perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Seems to do its job, but rather awkward and messy to use. I wish one could control the speed rate of irrigation flow more easily than&lt;br /&gt;the current two speed or off choices. (I do have cleaner mirrors now having to clean them after use of the flosser!)</li>
            <li> After a short while the mechanism to place and replace the tip wears out. The whole flosser is also difficult to keep clean; dirt gets inside the unit and is not able to be removed.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it was only battery operated.  Would have preferred that it was rechargeable. It is very powerful though and easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Started with the portable Water Pik. Expensive, but worked well for about a year. Then the recharging port failed, and after reading up on it, it seems to be an ongoing problem with the device, yet they continue to sell the same item. Bought this item, and it is perfect. Works great, folds up nicely for travel. Batteries last about 3 to 4 weeks, not really an issue for me. You could use rechargeable if you wish.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Has a powerful stream that takes a little getting used to, but it works great. A bit bulky but it&#x27;s portable, and we&#x27;ll use it on our boat.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy long ago an irrigator for an oral cavity. I have problems with gums. I liked this model. It is not necessary to be connected to an electric network. Portions of water perfectly suffice for massage of gums and washing of teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an oral irrigator as a means of reducing enamel wear from brushing too hard and as an adjunct to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic unit appears well made and works as advertised with the added convenience of using common AA batteries. I bought this unit based on Amazon reviews and not alternative branded 110v units because of obvious voltage differences here in Australia - Australian buyers of US appliances from Amazon should do their research a bit more carefully before complaining that their new purchase failed immediately when first powered on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I listened to my dentist, because although there is a bit of a learning curve if you&#x27;ve brushed and flossed most of your life, the effort is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a good battery irrigator.  So far so good and we will see how long the batteries last.  For some reason i thought it was rechargeable so that was a let down.  The water tank is small so you have to work fast at high stetting.</li>
            <li> I needed a battery operated irrigator for travel.  THis one is easy to use and has good water pressure.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works good for me and is great for travel.  Sometimes I have to fill it 2 times to finish the job.</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and needed this for work after eating lunch.  I received it in the mail yesterday and used it for the first time today.  WOW!  It has a powerful stream, just as powerful as my full size WaterPik that I have at home.  So far, I am pleased with my purchase.  The product is designed well and easy to understand right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson with these. Have had 3 (2 warranty replacements) in less than 3 years. What bothers me the most is that Panasonic&#x27;s warranty center in McAllen, TX takes up to 2 months to send the replacement. I had a customer service rep admit that when the center gets them they are not even examined but chucked into a bin for salvage/discard. You&#x27;d think that would expedite things. Google &amp;#34;Panasonic warranty service problems&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll find that this warranty service issue covers a myriad of their products. No more Panasonic for me!</li>
            <li> If you use a dental irrigation device at home, such as the WaterPik, you will love this product.  It does the same thing and is great when travelling, as it fits easily into your toiletry case.  It provides a decent stream of pressurized water that will flush food particles from between your teeth.  The batteries (two \\&quot;A\\&quot; cells) last a long time, several weeks of daily use.  For best results, I would recommend flossing your teeth first.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Panasonic irrigator.  I had a Water-Pik several years ago that took up too much counter space, and also quit working after several months (altho Water-Pik was very good about replacing it).  The Panasonic does its basic job well - getting food particles out, and is small enough to be taken on trips. I find one filling of the water reservoir is sufficient for each irrigation - I don&#x27;t have to refill as some reviewers have said.   One small annoyance is that the on-off-speed switch is a bit difficult to operate when wet which is most of the time when you&#x27;re using the irrigator.</li>
            <li> After having thrown out 3 or 4 WaterPics because the rechargeable battery would no longer accept a charge, I chose the Panasonic.  My first one is still working after 2 years.  The WaterPic lasts about a year.  One downside to the Panasonic is that it may be getting moldy, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m replacing it.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful waterpik, and small enough for travel.  Certainly outperformed my expectations.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to remove particles and debris from between teeth. Has adequete strength to really help in flossing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Waterpics for about 35 years.  All three of them have been of the non-portable separate tank variety.  While this portable units works ok it is a bit clumsy to use due to its size.  I have used it only occasionally when portability was desirable and found it to be effective.  It does not, however, have a very capacious tank and usually requires a second fill to complete the job.</li>
            <li> I have never owned an oral irrigator before so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to but I like that it is portable, has various speeds, and gets the job done. Some may find the reservoir on the small side, but it is not really an issue with me.</li>
            <li> Overall great product that has worked well over the last month. Initially some discomfort while using, but get used to it pretty quickly and it has been tremendously helpful in keeping my teeth clean. Surprised to see so many bits stuck even after brushing.</li>
            <li> I have a larger vanity top irrigator.  I purchased this one based on customer reviews.  It was solely purchased for travel only in and out of the USA.  The product preformed as I had expect.  The reservoir does take a couple of filling to completely rinse out the debris.  The nozzle does not rotate in your mouth as compared to other brands.  I prefer the battery operated ones since I used it primarily out of the country.  Make sure you use fresh batteries if you are going to used it twice a day for a week or so.  However, this unit will not replace my vanity top one as the pressure is not adequate for long term daily use.  It is an excellent travel item that packs neatly away with a slot for storing the nozzle in the unit.</li>
            <li> I spent a few hours researching these and settled on this unit. I&#x27;ve had it a couple of months now and it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is around a week and a half with two people using it.</li>
            <li> I needed an Irrigator that I could use every day, and still travel with.  This one fit the bill well.  This portable unit performs well on batteries, and can collapse to a reasonably compact size for travel.  Simple to use, but may not have the fine adjustment capability as a table top model.  Although it is recommended not to use rechargeable batteries, I have done so at times, and have had no problems with this so far (4 months of daily usage).  The main thing is to keep the top of the unit dry after use, so as to help reduce any moisture ingress into the battery compartment.  Overall, a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was surpirsed when I discovered the unit was battery powered but now I am very glad it is. It is portable and there are no wires to hide. It works great. I also like the two speeds.</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve used waterpix portables.  They would never hold a charge and were always breaking.  This runs on disposable batteries which last a long time.  The pulse action of the water is much stronger and has 2 speeds instead of one.  I highly recommend the Panasonic FW-D110-A.</li>
            <li> I have multiple crowns and bridges it my mouth, and my gums are always swollen no matter how much i brush or floss and i am always in pain waiting for 3 months to be over so i could go get my cleaning done. But omg with this water pick after the first time use, my pain is gone. My gums feel healthier and its just plain amazing.</li>
            <li> This item is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It doesn&#x27;t require being plugged in or recharged, simply uses a battery, does the work it is expected to do.  It has two different pressure choices.  I use it all the time.  I can even travel with it.  I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another one just to have a backup.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this one.  Runs on two AA cells, so completely self-contained.  Love the self-storage for the tip, and the included travel case.  Easy to use, nicely portable, decent price.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I like the idea that it doesn&#x27;t take up space and that it is convenient.  Oral health is important and the easier the equipment, the better.</li>
            <li> I just received my Panasonic Oral Irrigator, opened it up, assembled and used it without reading the instructions. It took about 2 minutes tops. EASY to use and very powerful just like my corded model from another manufacturer that I have used for years. I have three new dental implants and my dentist told me this is the best thing to do for them to keep them clean. Well, I can&#x27;t really carry a bulky, electric irrigator with me and after doing some research decided to try this one. And while it&#x27;s not ultra compact, it is certainly compact enough to keep handy while on the go! Got the best price on Amazon AND free shipping, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> love it have stock in batteries but for me this is the only way to go fast easy my Doctor says my gums look great, works</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised with the power in this simple and powerful water flosser. I like that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my tiny bathroom and you can&#x27;t beat the feeling of cleaning your teeth with such a device. The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Great little item....Works very well.</li>
            <li> It will take awhile to learn how to use this item as it sprays water quickly all over the place.  It does make your mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Flossing was never my strong point and now I&#x27;m paying for it.  I bought this water flosser at the recommendation of my hygenist and I must say, it does Not suck!  It really helps blast particles left behind out of my mouth.  It did take some getting used to and here is what I do now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Fill the water tank with cool (not cold) water&lt;br /&gt;2. Place the tip into my mouth, keeping my teeth together, but my lips slightly apart on one side&lt;br /&gt;3. Lean over the sink and turn the flosser on&lt;br /&gt;4. Trace along the gumline and inbetween teeth, letting the excess water spill from one side of my cheek&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased I got this, as it comes in really handy for dislodging dinner bits and such.  Easy to use.  Perfect that it is battery operated, so you don&#x27;t have to deal with cords.  I feel like it gives me a solid minute to two minutes of thorough flossing action.</li>
            <li> have just started using this it seems to do as what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> This has helped me big time. I have been using tooth pic but it was not helping me clearing food particles completely.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic water floss made it truly effective for my teeth. I use it once every night. Its very easy to carry in your travel pack too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used (multiple) rechargeable Waterpiks for years, and after being frustrated with their low quality I bought one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery power makes it such that if it&#x27;s low in power, you can just switch a battery and get full power restored, rather than waiting 12 hours or so for a charge in those other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength of the jet is satisfying. The unit collapses into a small enough size to fit into my cosmetic bag, so I can take it on extended trips without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a strong stream, small design, and I unexpectedly found I like batteries more than recharging...&lt;br /&gt;2 AA batteries last about a month.</li>
            <li> My mother in law recommended this after I bought a waterpik, and was unhappy with it. I should&#x27;ve bought this awhile ago! It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. Very easy to carry around if needed- in my case yes because I have braces. If you don&#x27;t want that bulky waterpik on your bathroom counter.. buy this! It&#x27;s small but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> For a cheap, portable oral irrigator, you really can&#x27;t beat this product. I&#x27;ve read where people don&#x27;t feel that the reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold enough water. Hello. It&#x27;s portable, meaning smaller. If you want a larger water receptacle, buy the big water pick or other large unit. In the meanwhile, when the water runs out, refill it. This isn&#x27;t brain surgery folks. It&#x27;s water. It&#x27;s probably right there in front of you...in the faucet. I usually mix some Listerine in with the water for a nice fresh result.&lt;br /&gt;If you have hard water with minerals in it that gunk up your unit, fill a clean 2 liter soda bottle with filter water from your fridge or Brita and use that in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;I got a couple years use from my 1st Panasonic, and then had to buy another one, but it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive compared to the &#x27;professional&#x27; unit the dentist just sold to my s/o for $140, which takes up valuable room on the sink, and which he will never use.</li>
            <li> Very portable slides in to itself for travel worth the money. Cons not rechargeable but it does take AA which are if you have your own set up hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> An easy and convenient way using water pressure to floss without the hassle and messiness of string.  The power from the water jet was not overly aggressive.  I use it in combination with brushing before bedtime and sometimes after meals.  If this came with a small soft carrying case, I would not mind taking this with me outside the home.</li>
            <li> This is very good while it lasted, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last too long. I am on line now looking for a new one, this will not be one of my choices. The motor doesn&#x27;t pump like it did when I first bought it. I have had it for about 8 months.</li>
            <li> I have used the water pik table top version for past 25 years or more, and always missed it when I went on vacations.  This one comes as close to the water pik table  top version that I have .  I had tried the portable water pik but never had liked it.  The water bursts were not that strong and the tank was very small and the battery failed to recharge within a few months of use.  This one is quite powerful and one gets the cleaning accomplished with the water tank that it has and when the power runs low , you can just change the 2 AA batteries that it comes equipped with.</li>
            <li> Super good for travel as well, could pack the upper part into the machine. I&#x27;m satisfied with the battery life.</li>
            <li> I have had this for several months now and it functions just the way it should.  It is now part of my routine.  A set of batteries lasts at least a month,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for travel. I could see how someone might disagree with only two pressure settings but for something this portable and convenient it&#x27;s ideal for the frequent traveler. It&#x27;s actually something I carry around in my work bag now. It&#x27;s a great way to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something not so great, it can leak a little bit. Not lot, just drops here and there. I think the latch for the water is not as secure as I would have liked but it&#x27;s a minor nuisance. I carry it in a ziplock bag and no worries here.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A for use as a travel accessory and just returned from a 10 day trip. It worked very well, had good pressure, and held a sufficient amount of water. I had their older model which had only one speed and didn&#x27;t hold enough water, so was pleasantly pleased with this one, and would definitely recommend it for travel. When collapsed, it is a nice size to carry in your bag. I use a larger counter top model (different brand) for in-home use.</li>
            <li> This Oral Irrigator is just as good as the last one I bought, exactly the same.  The reason for buying another one was because I lost the first one in a move.  Very convenient, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room on the sink.  Travels well....</li>
            <li> Works as stated.  Use it when I go out of town.  Usually have to fill it two times to complete the cleaning but it does work well.</li>
            <li> not worth anymore that 5.00.  very little power, doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job.  glad i got the discount otherwise i would have returned it.  i don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Failed w/ after 20 uses / 5 months.  Spray is barely strong enough to be effective.  Warranty folks at Panasonic wanted the product shipped to them, for replacement not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a battery powered irrigator but this thing is terrific.  Very well made, portable and with plenty of pumping power.  The high setting is too much for me, so I use it on low.  Love the way it folds down so you can easily take it with you on travels.  Takes up very little space on the bathroom shelf.  Panasonic did a thorough job engineering this beauty.  Your mouth will feel cleaner than ever after using this unit.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> delivered as promised</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this product.  Have been using it for about a year or so.  Can&#x27;t believe how much debris it removes from between my teeth and guns.  I still floss but this is the BEST i can for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not being able to adjust the stream type is a flaw here. I thought this would be good for a portable waterpik that you don&#x27;t have to plug in, but it&#x27;s just a piece of junk. Cannot recommend. Sticking with my traditional waterpik.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been waiting for. I&#x27;m love my Sonicare, but we camp a lot and I travel internationally as well.  A pain to keep charged.  This one operates with two AA batteries, is compact, truly portable and works VERY well.  I was thrilled to finally find exactly what I need and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> While not like the more powerful water jet machines this one did the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; on my recent trip.  It does take some getting used to, but once I did, which took about one or two uses,, it was fine.  It could get messy if you just jump into using it.  I did not want to be without a water flosser during my recent trip and this unit, as I said, got the job done.  Don&#x27;t expect it to work like your more powerful machine though.  Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;FAD</li>
            <li> Other than it&#x27;s limited reservoir, I just love this irrigator.  Use normal batteries and not rechargeable, and it is perfect.  I will probably buy another as a spare.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and chose this irrigator over the others because of the good accolades.  From these reviews, I learned you needed to use a dime or quarter to get the battery cover opened; that worked.  I tried every thing, to get the cap off to insert the batteries; even called Panasonic.  I also read you needed lots of batteries; I sure hope I can return these as well as I have no other use for the 48 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> worth prices paid. good value,fine products</li>
            <li> enough pressure.. does the trick. I have used it in my travels and really pleased with it. I can recommend it</li>
            <li> After storing mine for a few months (I take it on trips as a substitute for my countertop Waterpik) it no longer works after a couple years and minimal use. The pump runs but water does not flow. I&#x27;ve checked the tube, nozzle, and everything I can reasonably access, but no solution is evident. I&#x27;m careful with my belongings, and am disappointed by this device&#x27;s short life.</li>
            <li> It worked well until it broke. Water got into the battery compartment and it stopped working. Upgraded to plugged in Waterpik unit.</li>
            <li> got the irrigator liked it and realize it too had to be replaced so this operates the same and noone realizes how many particles one has beetween teeth before using ,but they are sparking white after</li>
            <li> lacking descriptive details,this oral irrigator is not a portable battery water pik. what is an oral irragator? ,how does it work?.right after i placed order i realized it was a mistake &amp; tried to cancel In seconds it was too late although Amazon tells me it can be canceled AMAZON LIES!!! FORGETABOUTIT AMAZON!!!!</li>
            <li> Simple to set up and use.  Water capacity is modest, but sufficient. I purchased this product in anticipation of a 3-week trip, and have tested it before putting in the suitcase.  It is relatively small and works comparably to the larger one that I use at home.  I can&#x27;t comment on battery life yet, but will update when appropriate. So far, I am very happy with it, and for the money I don&#x27;t think that you can go wrong.    Just returned from the trip, which was actually 5 weeks.  Worked wonderfully, and the batteries are still going strong.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters who are both in braces who share a small bathroom.  They have used larger oral irrigation systems in the past that required taking up a big chunk of limited counter space. They found this system easy to use for a number of reasons. The entire unit is hand held and battery operated making it very convenient to maneuver. Other machines power cords barely reached the sink.  It&#x27;s perfect for traveling even out of the country because there&#x27;s no power conversion to worry about. Lastly, the price was great!  I bought one for each daughter.</li>
            <li> My home version of this Oral Irrigator is too noisy and too big to travel. The Panasonic Oral Irrigator doesn&#x27;t have quite the same power as my larger home version,  but it&#x27;s plenty good for a temporary oral hygiene tool. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i like using a water pik. but it&#x27;s too big for travel. so i bought this, based on other reviews. although it&#x27;s not as powerful as my 110 volt home unit, its power using 2 AA batteries is quite nice for cleaning between my teeth in lieu of using dental floss, which is not nearly as easy.</li>
            <li> Works great, just as other reviews state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But would like that pit pocket attachment that gets bellow the gumline.. anyone know if this device has such an attahment that can be ordered?</li>
            <li> I recommend this oral irrigator over WaterPik as is much easier to use, transport, clean, etc.  And I can take it into the shower with me!  I went through 3 WaterPik&#x27;s using them in the shower.  This is my second Panasonic just so I can have a backup!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, since I was going on a trip, and needed a portable item. It meets that need. I was very unimpressed otherwise. It is awkward to handle, since you are holding the entire unit. There are only 2 speeds. I gave it three stars, but if it weren&#x27;t for its portability, it would have been fewer.</li>
            <li> I am very concerned about keeping my dental care and health.  After brushing several times per day and flossing, I follow up with this cleanser and find it still gets stuff out.  Much better than another brand I had (and which gave out).</li>
            <li> This is my second device. It is great. Much more power, easier to clean, more convienient, priced right. Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a, still working but older Panasonic, unit. This new unit has two pulsing speeds, rather than one on the older unit, and almost twice the reservoir capacity. We recently took it on a trip and we couldn&#x27;t be more delighted with it. I really cleans well and compresses to a convenient size for packing. I have nothing negative to say about it. It is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled when I found the Panasonic Oral Irrigator on-line. I have been using your Panasonic product for years. And I needed another one to use at our summer home. My lucky family members are all getting one for Christmas. And of course, my dentist is happy because I have healthy teeth and gums.  I want to spread the word about your great product!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully!  My dentist recommended getting a water flosser. I bought a water pic, but hated it. It took up a lot of my counter space and the cord was a pain. This runs on batteries and takes up no space. Battery power seems great to me. The only slight negative is it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water as the counter, bulky plug in types. I love it way better than the others. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This water pik worked great for me, it&#x27;s small, not cumbersome like some of the more expensive brands are and does the job!  It&#x27;s also easy to take with you when traveling.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure the first few times I used it but once you get the hang of it it is awesome. Initially I needed to fill it twice to get the job done and soaked the bathroom in the process. Once I got used to it, I can floss in one fill with no mess! I usually add a little mouthwash to the water and ensure the water is room temperature as my teeth are a little sensitive. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love this water pick.  My dentist noticed a difference in my teeth since I have been using this.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use! Momentum is very strong.Very good use. Second times to buy!</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and really liked having this portable one to take with me to work. It is a lot easier and quicker than using floss. Fills up easily, no issues. Speeds work for my purposes. It would be nice if it was more of a purse size, but considering what it does I bet this is as small as you can get it.</li>
            <li> My second time purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this water flosser! I love that it&#x27;s small and compact and fits easily out of sight in my medicine cabinet. Although the fact that it&#x27;s smaller means that I can&#x27;t do my whole mouth with one tank full of water. But refilling is quick and painless. It only has two settings but the weaker setting it strong enough for me. I was having issues with food getting stuck in my teeth that I could not get out with floss, which would then lead to swollen gums, pain, infection, etc, making it even more painful to floss the affected area. This little gadget little has solved those issues for me completely. I find it very easy to use, clean, and store, and it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li> It is everything that the product states would do. Toward the end of a cycle the batteries get a little weak. Be sure to use good alakaline batteries on this product. I like the portability. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Small and compact, this irrigator is easy to use and and store.  Same irrigating force as larger units.  Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough. Water runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very good, have more quality, it is suitable to go out with the usualVery good, have more quality, it is suitable to go out with the usual</li>
            <li> This item is fantastic. Perfect size for on the go! Does a great job cleaning the food particles out from my braces and off my teeth. Glad that I purchased! I am getting each of my kids one too!</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to use, the place with bad is too power-hungry, often should change the battery.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry,high quality.</li>
            <li> Love how portable this is.  Wish it had some kind of holder for the detachable spout, though.  I have to use a baggie.</li>
            <li> Great water pick to clean between teeth, a bit messy a times.....but ok once you get use to it...</li>
            <li> Mine completely didn&#x27;t work.  Not just user-unfriendly, it was user hostile.  Trying now to find out how to return it.</li>
            <li> worked well but a little cumbersome when filled - do not know how to fix the problem</li>
            <li> This worked great for travel.  I used for about a week.</li>
            <li> Old one lasted 5 years.  This is the last rating I will do! I refuse to be required to provide a specific number of words that don&#x27;t do anything but pad their ego.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase another.</li>
            <li> Too powerful of a stream on the lowest setting</li>
            <li> I was looking good Oral irrigator which is not too big to handle.  I read reviews and love Panasonic product, I decided to purchase it.  I am really glad that I purchased this one.  Very easy to use. strong stream, and size is just right.  Japanese are such smart people!!</li>
            <li> Three months and it quit. Changed batteries twice but no luck and of course past warranty. NOT OVERUSE BECAUSE ONLY USED FOR TRAVEL.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used the WaterPik portable one and returned it.  This one is nicer and better.  I like how it makes itself into a portable case and has a good stream of water as well.</li>
            <li> Love this ....just what I was looking for.....it has strong jet and does exactly what it claims. Delivery was quick...highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Kind of splashes unless you&#x27;re careful how you hold it but easy to carry and powerful for a portable.</li>
            <li> I like the size of this product because it is small, portable and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my small bathroom.  It works well and  removes food particles that flossing leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I do tried all kind of flossers, water picks over the last decade and this one is travellers,&lt;br /&gt;Workers dream, can not be better.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Dana</li>
            <li> It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design. Happy with it</li>
            <li> I hate flossing but does the same with water pressure that is pleasant and very effective.  Enjoy this product today</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure what I was getting with this product but it&#x27;s a winner, even better than the one I have at home which needs to be recharged by electricity.  I can recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  It very light and easy to use.  Arthritis limits my handling and weight baring capabilities.  I have no problems using it, and it does a wonderful job!  Kudos to its designer!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because it is messy. It is a self contained unit and water comes out every where.  It is wide and not comfortable to hold. I was expecting a little more power from the jet.</li>
            <li> I have issues with my gums and the dental hygienist recommended using an oral irrigator.  I chose this model as I travel a lot and it is battery operated.  I am sooo pleased with it.  It is amazing when I get done brushing my teeth then use this and realize there was still food particles caught under my gum, but with no pain in cleaning it out.  Hoping for a lot better check up on my next dental visit.</li>
            <li> I have used this device for a little over one month, an I am very satisfied with it.  After a couple of weeks of trying different techniques I am able to clean all of my teeth on both sides of the gums with one reservoir of water.  The device does a very good job of cleaning out trapped food in bridgework and between teeth.  The original batteries are still in, although they&#x27;re going to be replaced very shortly.  I particularly like the collapsible design which makes the device very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> No need to recharge hours just two AA batteries are good and working nicely&lt;br /&gt;I would love to recommend all of you</li>
            <li> My teeth make you healthy items. Currently I am using water picks, not as good as favorably portable items. Lacking a little amount of water, but the water pressure in portability and want to give 5 points.</li>
            <li> The water goes all over the place and is not controllable. I never once even got to aim it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I took this new flosser on a trip and loved it!  It takes up very little space and is very powerful.  I had bought a different brand a number of months ago that was a major disappointment due to the lack of power.  I love that it operates on batteries too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different water flosser devices and this is far and away my favorite.  Easy to use, compact and travels well.</li>
            <li> Great product, I received in todays!!!</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk!  This is the 2nd one (bought one in Dec 2012) I bought.  The first one just stopped working.  This one almost pumps water out, but not enough to be of any use.  No more Panasonics for me.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I bought.  It is good while it is last, but it can stop working anytime.  The water pressure in the first one came out right, the 3rd one is too strong.  All these portable ones don&#x27;t last very long.  Wish it is a better product.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It is compact and easy to use (just remember to put it in your mouth before turning it on!) I have a little spot around a back molar that grabs all sorts of food bits. I point that water stream into the area and I know I have dislodged things my floss and picks cannot grab.</li>
            <li> Well designed and portable.  Cleans my teeth better than flossing, collapses for easy storage and traveling.  Wish it had a rechargable battery.</li>
            <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is useful and convenient for my daily use.&lt;br /&gt;YOu must have to try it. Cool!</li>
            <li> The control switch is in an awkward position.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the water force of my old Water Pic - however the Water Pic would never hold a charge for very long so this Panasonic is an improvement over that.</li>
            <li> I used to see, I bought also my friend.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really satisfying products.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta do not have to use onerous dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this thing I feel after brushing becomes very clear.</li>
            <li> I found this product difficult to use and cumbersome.  Not to mention the water went all over and it hurt my gums even on the lowest setting.  A complete disappointment!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was a defective item or what but it would not hold the water. I returned this item &amp; purchased another brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Oral Irrigator to replace one after 15 years of use. The new model has a much larger water reservoir than the old one and a jet stream comparable to a full size WaterPik. I am very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very portable - great for trips</li>
            <li> It really is good product, but not the best. My 1st try was disaster, everything was wet, but now learned how to use it. Only thing i don&#x27;t like about this product is that there is no break or button to pause it, it just keep spraying all the time, if you wanna stop or change position you have to turn it off. But still very good thing for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> This is the first oral irrigator I&#x27;ve tried so i cant compare it to anything, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. If you can or have the room for the regular stationary type get one of those. I live in a 100 year old home so there is no plug near the sink. You do have to fill it up twice to get your whole mouth done. I Fill mine with mouth wash and that probably not recommended but my teeth and gums are great.</li>
            <li> I had been using this two to three times a day.  It worked great for the first few weeks and then it got clogged and when I figured out how to unclog, it still only worked for a few days.  Now the water will not come out at an appropriate speed and is useless.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t have a problem opening my battery compartment with a penny but i do share the have functionality problems. I soaked my bathroom the first time i used it. Water flew everywhere. How can us see if you closes your mouth. How the hell do you all use this without making a mess? The sliding power level is stupid. It&#x27;s hard to slide when holding this big square in your hand. It should have been a power sensing push button instead. The water tank leaks when i tip it over and tried to get a good angle to spray. I am not seeing myself using this much.</li>
            <li> I really like how this item works, however, after awhile it does tend to trap a lot of moisture which in turns leads to the awful smell of mildew or mold.  So, then I go back and purchase another one every 2 or 3 years.  I like this item because I do not like to leave bathroom items plugged in, nor do I like wires here and there.  This does a good job and is small enough be put into the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> useful but the flow is a little strong.</li>
            <li> I like this but the stream that comes out shoots way to strongly.  I feel like Im forcing a water hose in my mouth and more water sprays outside of my mouth than in it.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic irrigator I have used.  The first one began leaking water into the battery chamber and that really reduced battery life.  If there were replacement o rings I would still be using it.  I hope that this model lasts as long.&lt;br /&gt;The down side of this is the switch which feels clumsy to me.  That may just be that I&#x27;ve changed from one model to then next and I have to get used to the feel of the new one.  Otherwise it does a good job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> My wife has braces and it helps her to floss in between her teeth. It seem to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> just what I expected. Works perfect, batteries last enough, good quality materials and good water pressure modes. Easy to stre, I use it in shower, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to go beyond flossing. I like how it&#x27;s portable and battery operated (not bulky, like the plug-in ones). I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and use it everyday. The battery hasn&#x27;t died yet (AA batteries)! It has two speeds but I must say that it can be a little hard on your gums. My gums have bled from time to time due to the water pressure but you eventually get use to it. Every now and then when I put in the water, I add a little fluoride for a more refreshing, dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to remove bits and particles from between teeth.  Two speeds make it even more desirable then single speed on my previous irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;Buying through Amazon is always a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this.  It is very powerful, has a decent sized reservior, and does the job!  A couple things though.  As with any oral appliance, it has to be cleaned, which is understandable.</li>
            <li> This product eats batteries so it is very expensive.  It died after little more than one year.  I cannot recommend others purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun irrigator for a few years and I&#x27;m pleased with it. The one thing I had a problem with is its portability, which this Panasonic totally addresses. I love that it&#x27;s light and easy to travel and store. It&#x27;s a genius concept. But I do have an issue with the strength of the irrigation, it is so much stronger than the one I&#x27;m used to that it immediately hurt my gums and made me bleed. Now I keep it for travel only as it&#x27;s the best for that.</li>
            <li> Have one at work and downstairs bathroom. Reliable gadget for flossing. Easy to use. Should probably invest in rechargeable batteries. A little heavy for travel.</li>
            <li> This works very well for a battery portable unit, water flossing really is a bad term for this unit, this is too remove lodged food particles between your teeth only, for a heathy mouth you still must floss and brush to remove food debris  and film, because this will become plaque, and no amount of brushing can remove&lt;br /&gt;Plaque Only a dentist, in my Panasonic I use a little hydrogen peroxide too keep the unit disinfected, I had a water pic years ago and more powerful but that&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing because it can separate your gums from your teeth causing pocket and you will loose your teeth, so there you have it...</li>
            <li> Broke really quickly. Now the motor still turns on but no longer pumps the water. I had to mail it in at my own cost for the warranty service. Will update when I get it back.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower. The only problem is that it gradually loses its punch even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> This it a great item and has a good force. Much better than the rechargeable unit sold in Wallmart which is now gathering dust.</li>
            <li> While my teeth feel cleaner afterwards the power, even on the lower setting, is kind of painful. It&#x27;s INTENSE. I suppose that&#x27;s the point of it, but still. I also managed to shoot water all over my wall and ceiling trying to get it angled properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming from a waterpick counter top model 110v.  Here in the Philippines, we have 220v so I still use a transformer to use the waterpick.  It was very inconvenient to use so I rarely use it.  And then I saw this Panasonic Oral Irrigator and my problem is solved.  It is convenient to use and uses AA batteries which is perfect because I have a lot of rechargeable batteries.  Water pressure is not that strong as those countertop models but that should be understood because it just uses 2 AA batteries.  It works for me and that is what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> good quality, reasonable price... I bought it again for my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product, it works well and is not hard on batteries. A little bulky for small hands.</li>
            <li> This appliance seems to do just as good a job as the electric water pik I have at home. I like the way it blows food particles from between my teeth - even after flossing and brushing. . It has two speeds just in case you have sensitivity or need more power. Its water capacity is big enough to hit all of my teeth more than once. The unit seems a little big at first, but I got used to it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every day for the past month and it&#x27;s still going strong on lithium batteries.</li>
            <li> Works as it should - lightweight and yet powerful.. The liquid container holds enough fluid and does not require refilling midway through the job.  It is quiet as well!</li>
            <li> I had tried so many kinds / brands of electric brushes before. No of them cleans the food residue in between my teeth. This Panasonic Irritator actually jet out high velocity water and washes away the food residue. When I floss after that, I feel very clean and only minimum flossing is needed. And it&#x27;s quick: less than a minute. But be careful the water jet actually made my gum blood one time (there is a slower speed setting, great.)</li>
            <li> I have braces &amp; can&#x27;t live without a good water flosser! I was getting ready for a week long vacation &amp; decided to give this portable a try. It&#x27;s great, powerful enough for my braces! I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Portability&lt;br /&gt;2 - Children with braces struggle with the flossing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portability is a big plus for us.  We are an active family, often taking weekend trips on a whim.  Being able to easily pack this water glosser means that the children will bring it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads me to the second reason we purchased this item - braces and flossing don&#x27;t always work well together.  This product allows my children to remove copious amounts of food from their teeth which they admittedly shouldn&#x27;t be eating, saving us from further, more expensive dental work in the future.  Corn on the cob and braces are not meant to coexist, but this product helps!</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy! In six months, it&#x27;s full of mold. Followed instructions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. Panasonic will not stand behind this product. Customer Service rep says &amp;#34;this is the first I&#x27;ve heard about a mold problem, Sorry!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very adequate for travel when you have to leave your waterpik at home.&lt;br /&gt;Have a spare battery set in case.</li>
            <li> This is a good product!&lt;br /&gt;It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  No bells or whistles, like other brands, just good, solid performance.  Works, and keeps working, unlike the others!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with the product. Bought to use during travel.  I must admit so far I am satisfied with the product. I like the compact nature and water pressure. Together I also bought Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser which wouldn&#x27;t even start (something appears terribly wrong with the power switch).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a water-pik for several years, but after getting braces on my teeth it became an absolute necessity. Enough so that when I realized I was going on a week-long trip, I didn&#x27;t want to be without SOMEthing to clean out the gunk. So I grabbed this competitor from Panasonic to use for travel. It was good for a short trip, but I didn&#x27;t have the smallest temptation to replace the full size water-pik with this after I returned home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus points: The Panasonic Irrigator is fairly light, and it squishes into a relatively compact size. It does an adequate cleaning job (which is the most important point!). And it runs on batteries; portability is an advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t have anything like the control you get from the counter-top water-pik unit. It&#x27;s fast-or-slow, that&#x27;s it; and \\&quot;slow\\&quot; is rather slow. If you have the water-pik set to a strong setting you might be disappointed with the pressure. I&#x27;m fine with this for a trip, but wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with it for the long term. Especially since you&#x27;re sticking half of the apparatus in your mouth every time, and it seems like the unit has a tendency to get grotty. While a regular water-pik lets you share (I get the blue tube, you get the red one), this might be a very personal unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can comfortably given this 3.5-to-4 stars for a travel unit. But if I were judging it for daily use over the long term (in a \\&quot;gosh is the cheaper item good enough?\\&quot; way) I&#x27;d give it only 2 or 3 stars.</li>
            <li> hard to reach the back side of lower teeth.  If you tilt it too much, the bump can&#x27;t get water.</li>
            <li> The unit is nice to be portable and worked well initially. But it stopped fuctioning after 3 months of light use. No easy way to fix.</li>
            <li> I used a Water Pic (about $60.00) for a year or so and struggled with the low power/slow pulse cleaning process.  Recharging the battery made little, or no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $35.00 Panasonic unit holds more water, has a more efficient, 2-speed sprayer, and is easier to clean &amp; dry between use, since the spray tip is very easy to remove.  The non-rechargeable batteries might be only drawback for some people (but not for me).  This one is 5 stars, in every respect!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic oral irrigator was exactly what I was looking for: something that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, is easy to use, and does a good job cleaning my teeth.  Also, it is small enough to easily pack in my overnight bag.  The only negative thing is that removing the nozzle is not easy, requiring that you must pull hard to get it to come off.  The unit even has a storage space for the nozzle.</li>
            <li> My friend suggested the Waterpik but I trusted Amazon reviews and went with this and am Happy. it is portable efficient, the only problem i have though it lot of water gets spilled onto the mirror and i have to clean it after my job with this is done, still running on original batteries after two weeks of daily use. When I first used it i got shocked to see how much of food items that were left behind all these days</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading other reviews and was squally happy.  Product reduces to small travel size, user friendly, uncomplicated and performs adequately.  Do  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It pulses instead of having a continuous spray.  I initially believed the spray wasn&#x27;t as powerful, but I put my regular plug-in irrigator side-by-side outside and the spray distance was the same.  But other people might prefer the pulse, so I can&#x27;t ding it too much for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a tendency to smell if you disassemble it and put it up after each use.  I&#x27;ve been washing off the wand part with soap periodically, and leaving it out on the counter more, and that takes care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding it is also a bit of a drawback, as holding a big thing in your hand makes cleaning out your mouth more difficult.  I wish this had a base with a wand attached, but was still compact and ran on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advantage it has is when I drain out my regular irrigator to take on trips, it takes a while for the pump to prime and start using it.  This thing starts up immediately, and even the directions recommend keeping it running until the water has completely drained after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this as much as my regular plug-in irrigator overall, but this one is much more transportable, obviously, and it works well.  I&#x27;m now using this one because my regular one trips the electric outlet I&#x27;m using now, and it&#x27;s much easier to transport this one around, obviously.  So even though it&#x27;s not perfect, I&#x27;m very glad I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/20/12:  I upgraded my rating to 5 stars, since I&#x27;ve bought one for every member of the family.  And the bulkiness of it isn&#x27;t a concern once you get used to it.  I think I&#x27;ll stay with this version in the future instead of dealing with the plug-in versions.  Just be ready to switch out the batteries once they start to run down, as weaker batteries affect the performance a lot.</li>
            <li> Good for hard to reach places. Messy to use unless you do it in the shower. My wife uses it more than I and it is effective for her. Needs frequent sterilization from bacteria build up.</li>
            <li> Battery operated mouth irrigator works great. Small water reservoir is just enough for quick cleaning. Two settings for water jet are not too strong. Simple to operate and clean, but sometimes accidentally turning on irrigator while removing water reservoir causes water to spray all over. Don&#x27;t know about battery life, but has two kinds of batteries, so might be more costly to replace.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and good value. Very handy cause its portable and can be carried with you anywhere. One full tank is perfect for single use. I am glad I bought this. Highly recomended</li>
            <li> i use it around 3-5 times daily, as i quit using floss or tooth picks&lt;br /&gt;it is a good product to buy</li>
            <li> This unit works well.  The only reason I give it a 3 is the lifespan.  The unit I bought in June 2012 for home use, just died today.  Not a very long life for sure, but for travel, I will continue to use my second unit, which was purchased December 2011. In summary: the unit works well, but the lifespan is short.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, is full of water is not enough for half a minute on the run!</li>
            <li> I just did not like the other brands I tried.  This is simple to use and I am sure just as effective as the other &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34;.  It is holding up well (so far) and I really like the fact that it &amp;#34;collapses&amp;#34; small enough to fit in my medicine chest or suitcase!  I would like to find a case (soft or hard) to hold it for the times that I travel and to keep it clean and safe.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;Our second unit in two years.</li>
            <li> I bought this model because of the problem other water picks have, short battery life. I have had it for a couple months and still have the same interchangeable, disposable, batteries in it.&lt;br /&gt;The product works great, and the travel capacity keeps it from taking up a lot of room in my bathroom. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> IT WORKS WELL.  I HAVE HAD ONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  IT IS USED DAILY, AND HAS NEVER FAILED.  THIS ONE IS AN EXTRA, AS THE FIRST ONE WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL.  I USE ULTIMATE LITHIUM BATTERIES IN IT, BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER, AND OPERATE THE IRRIGATOR BETTER.</li>
            <li> This is far superior to the Waterpik that you have to plug in.  The pik never held a charge for long.  This Panasonic is wonderful.  Two AA batteries and it is lasting and lasting.  It has a strong pulsation and the ability to collapse it down cuts down on sink space.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son. He says it works and he likes it. He uses it to help clean around his braces.</li>
            <li> This thing is great for traveling. I prefer water flossing over regular flossing so I was ghlad to be able to take this thing on the road with me.</li>
            <li> very reliable.  works well.  battery lasts a good length of time.  of course it&#x27;s a good product - it&#x27;s japanese.</li>
            <li> I love this oral waterpik. It is really convenient for travel, and I always take a couple extra batteries with me in case I run out of power. I would recommend it for those who floss but also like a little extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oral irrigation device by Panasonic a few weeks ago and have used it numerous times. I fill the water container with mostly water and a half cap of mouthwash (against product recommendations) and have had no trouble. The water capacity it sufficient for me to clean my whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 2 speeds, decent water capacity, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: can be messy, not good for people with small hands.</li>
            <li> works well once you figure out how to lift the battery cover - I bought it because I didn&#x27;t want to clutter my vanity with appliances - good price, too.</li>
            <li> An good device to clean my teeth regularly toghther with my Sonicare. The water pressure is acceptable and I felt comfirtable after using.</li>
            <li> Very messy. Difficult to operate.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly. Works exactly as described.  The stream is neither too weak or so strong it will damage your gums. I like th i s product very much. I  especially like that it will be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I had problems with little particles getting between my teeth,  it was painful.  Flossing didn&#x27;t help. No more problems. Only takes a minute or two and your mouth feels so clean.</li>
            <li> This is an item I can&#x27;t live without now. It&#x27;s amazig how this technology help in your mouth cleaning. I can just say one word: A M A Z I N G!!!!! my dentist will be like crazy when she see my mouth! is again, amazing!</li>
            <li> it is good,it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> Nice product except for the fact that there is no way that I can see to take the base off to clean it out after multiple uses.  I like the portability but after about 8-10 times use, you need to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> Bought this about 7 months ago and it was great to start.  However the pressure is non-existant now and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work right.</li>
            <li> this thing is great. I use it as the water gun and also for cleaning the bathroom</li>
            <li> This Panasonic water pick is great and easy to use. I have nozzles for both myself and my husband. Yay!</li>
            <li> As an oral irrigator, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, get all that extra junk out of your mouth. I wish there was an extra setting, between the high and low, because I find myself between extremes. The plastic build of the irrigator will collect residue and succumb if not cleaned and dried properly after usage. I thought I could use rechargeable batteries with it, but the directions in the manual explicitly stated otherwise, so it was a bummer. The amount of water it holds is small in capacity, so I have to refill twice or thrice to get through my whole mouth (I have braces). But that isn&#x27;t so much a problem because I&#x27;d rather do that than to lug around one of those heavy machines. I really wish the tip was collapsible in some way or form, the tip remains jutted out and I worry about where it might end up at times.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good,I use it well.I hope it power more.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is small, so I needed something compact.</li>
            <li> For travel, can&#x27;t beat this unit. Much better than the Waterpik travel version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light, compact, easy to fill and empty and clean, batteries last a long time, powerful enough to get the job done. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. I have owned a few water pik water flossers in the past but this one is the handiest. It holds enough to do one quick cleaning on setting #2. Works fantastic highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;but It is not strong.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything else to say.&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> I floss and brush my teeth everyday and think I do a really good job of it, until I use my oral irrigator.  I&#x27;m constantly amazed at what flossing and brushing miss when I clean with it the Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  The only drawback one might have is the tank doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water, but I have found it to be sufficient for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s morepowerful than I expected. But the tank is a little bit small, but it&#x27;s okay for travel or carry.</li>
            <li> Pretty bulky but for the freedom from a hose and electric cord it is well worth it. Even after careful brushing I will still occasionally find debris removed by this unit. If your willing to put up with filling twice and replacing (2) AA&#x27;s after about forty uses then this will be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this. Not as powerful as a full size water pic, but it gets the job done for me. I love size, fits nicely in my hand. I purchased an extra one to pack for my son when he&#x27;s starts college this year, should be perfect for when he has to share a bathroom.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found this useful. Extremely messy. Thought product use might improve with time, but it hasn&#x27;t. Unhappy that product can&#x27;t be returned. Will pay closer attention to return policies in the future.</li>
            <li> Works great in the shower. It&#x27;s my second one. I gave the other one I bought 6 years ago to my brother to use.</li>
            <li> Very good product for travel and can also be used at home. This product Meets my expectations</li>
            <li> Suction stopped working after careful 8 months storage. So disappointed since now I can&#x27;t use on a trip and have to throw it away. Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased anther product by ToiletTree, it didn&#x27;t last a year and dint have a sound design.  The Panasonic model offers a much better product. The water reservoir is easy to clean and fill.  The battery function is much more durable and practical the the ac units.  Simple, efficient and great design.</li>
            <li> This is OK for lightweight packing but it doesn&#x27;t come close to my Waterpik.  Not nearly as powerful.  Batteries wear out pretty quickly.  I always bring spares if I&#x27;ll be away for a week or more.  It&#x27;s a lot better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel, and thought I&#x27;d buy a bigger plug in irrigator for home use. BUT, this works so well, I use it for both. The only drawback is that sometimes you need to fill it with water more than once during a cleaning, but this is not a problem for me. The water pressure is great. I find the lower pressure setting is strong enough for me, but there is always the higher setting for a more intense cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how long the batteries last, but I&#x27;ve used it every day for a few weeks and no sign or change in water pressure.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one (model ES1270) that finally gave up the ghost. The new one is about the same size but Panasonic cleverly incorporated a way to enclose the stem when the unit is folded for traveling. This one also has a two-speed switch; the speeds are 1) slow, and 2) normal. I find the slow speed useless. The tank holds just enough water for one good flossing. If you run out it refills easily in a couple of seconds. Normal alkaline batteries seem to last around a month but I always used AA rechargables in my old one and they would usually go for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Water Flosser is strong enough to get most of the food particles from between my teeth and easy to use, especially to fill it with water. It is light and easy to handle. I like the fact that you do not have to worry about water getting into the battery compartment because it is waterproof. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A very nice and very portable unit.  It has all the power I need, and is so easy to pack and take with me.</li>
            <li> I like that its portable and does not require electrical outlet. Using daily for months on same batteries.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for travel. Works well and is compact</li>
            <li> I bought it two.&lt;br /&gt;It was really good and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works reasonably well but I had the plug in waterpik before and my mouth felt cleaner. This takes two fill ups for me, I know, I&#x27;m picky.Having said that we will be away for a month and this will be great for travelling.</li>
            <li> This is a really great device and is very powerful for only running on 2 batteries (included in box).  I hesitated to buy this based on the price, certainly it can&#x27;t be worth it, but I read the reviews and took a chance.  I think this is an excellent option for an irrigator/flosser.  The fact that it is portable is a plus, and the price is just right.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I could wish for would be that it is rechargeable, but since it is portable, it balances out (I&#x27;ll just use my rechargeable batteries).  I have had this for about a week now, and use it every day.  I have not yet had to replace the batteries, so I am curious to find out how long it will run.&lt;br /&gt;It now takes me less than a minute to floss my teeth, and I can tell you the tartar build up has been significantly reduced in just this short amount of time.  I think I will try using it with the fluoride mouth wash to see what else it can do.</li>
            <li> Though I should buy it again for my friends,165 ml water tank is certainly not enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should get another type for home.</li>
            <li> Still working great after a long time.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good design neat storage ability. Has enough power to remove any foreign object from between teeth. Would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Battery operated, so understandably it&#x27;s weak. Water reservoir is small, so need refill 2 to 3 times for each use. I pack it for 1-2 day trip, but for longer trips, I bring the travel size waterpik that came bundled with the regular size purchased at Costco.</li>
            <li> thanks for delivering the package,i like the feeling so much ,anyway ,the storage water is so less that i can‘t wash my tooth smoothly.</li>
            <li> Thank you for good item and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to use floss to prevent my teeth from bleeding but it is so hard to use floss every day. That&#x27;s the reason I bought this and I found it a little hard to use it correctly, cleanning my teeth without hurting them. For days they just bleed after using the irrigator. The reason is I use it too close to my teeth root.&lt;br /&gt;After long term usage the battery will also be out and the power of irrigation will turn to too weak to clean your teeth effectively. The right way is to replace them after you use up 30-40 tanks of water.</li>
            <li> This was my second Panasonic Water Flosser. The first one quit working in 5 months but I ordered another anyway. Now after 10 months this one just up and quit one day.  I follow the instructions, change nozzles, change batteries and still they don&#x27;t last a year. I like the ease and look of this flosser but it is too expensive to keep replacing them every few months for no reason other than they just stop turning on. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Use this every day for a couple of years now. Strong product that I keep in the shower. Use a small amount of mouth wash in the water. This product has helped keep my gums and teeth in good shape.</li>
            <li> Much better than the kind with rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> easy to use, not so powerful as I expected</li>
            <li> This is the 10th unit I have gotten in since I bought the first one for myself in July 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have successfully introduced this gadget to 9 of my other friends who love it after they tried using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll strongly recommend this to anyone who have yet to own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty much maintenance-free, using replaceable AA batteries (I used the eneloop ones), and I can get the replacement nozzles at my local departmental stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++++ purchase!</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of Waterpiks over the years and the latest one I got is fine at home.  I didn&#x27;t want to pack it up to travel with so I got this one.  I am so happy with it!  It puts out a great stream of water and does the job.  No complaints.  Keep in mind it is battery operated and has small capacity compared to the big &#x27;uns.  It is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> It is an ideal device for travel. It uses two AA batteries which give me about three weeks use. When camping it is very convenient to carry it in bathroom kitbag to Community showers. I recently purchased a second one to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> This oral irrigator works well as I&#x27;ve owned a plug-in type waterpik in the past and it was quite cumbersome and took up too much space on the counter. So I went cordless, yes battery operated, but I take it with me on my travels and my oral health has improved and my teeth feel so clean. I&#x27;m on my second one in a couple of years as it will tend to collect minerals over time in using it and turn somewhat brown in color. The good thing is that you can pull the reservoir off and clean it and its most important to let it completely dry out between use. You can order parts if needed over time, however I figure its cheaper in the long run to just purchase a new one. I&#x27;m in on this and really like it! When the pressure or pulsating level is reduced, just replace the alkaline batteries.</li>
            <li> cleans under bridges &amp; crowns</li>
            <li> This is very nice, water pressure is strong enough, Compact enough to carry around anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it come with a carry case.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend me to use this due to all the mess that happen to my teeth. This product has improve my teeth cleaning experience i would Floss, brush my teeth and use this pick(oral irrigator) to finish the touch .. Thanks for this great product</li>
            <li> Great product. Very compact for travel unlike some other products that are labeled for travel. Used it on a recent trip and it performed as expected.</li>
            <li> it would be better, if it was rechargeable.  battery-run is not too powerful.  it&#x27;s a little big to handle, but i guess because of the water volume, it can&#x27;t be too small either</li>
            <li> I have had another irrigator made by Waterpik that is much more powerful.  Won&#x27;t buy it again but will keep it as it is needed.</li>
            <li> If it held a little more water, I would do 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Small enough to carry in your bag. Easy to put together. Forceful for such a travel size.&lt;br /&gt;Once I put it together, I don&#x27;t take it apart; just leave it on my sink with the little compartment door open so it can air.&lt;br /&gt;So much better than one of those big things that sit on the sink and take up room.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried the Water Pik for comparison but I don&#x27;t have to because I am quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I was using Waterpik before it died on me after 1 year of usage. Decided to get this oral irrigator after looking at all the positive reviews on Amazon and glad that it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is even better than waterpik in my opinion as it is portable and I do not have to worry about water splashing on the electrical socket area since it is battery-operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums &amp; teeth will be &#x27;happy&#x27; after the usage of this fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Solid water pick. I would prefer the pressure to be a little higher, and it is slightly bulky, but it seems to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Similar power to the major brands though less injecter heads. Compact, light, ease of use, good reach to all corners.  Great for travelling and small counter.</li>
            <li> Not bad.Could use more storage.</li>
            <li> I was frankly a bit disappointed in this. It is bulky and awkward to use and just not exactly what I was expecting. It&#x27;s probably a good enough value for the money, but that&#x27;s about all I can say about it.</li>
            <li> easy to use. folds up.  just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is just okay...I sent it back because for the money I paid...just a bit more with it and I can get a standard one  and they sometimes come with a travel irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine recommended it..he travels a lot and loves it.  I just don&#x27;t travel a lot so it was not worth it to me. Not a bad deal though.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this 5 stars but had to settle on 4.&lt;br /&gt;The good: it&#x27;s designed very well, the water capacity is adequate (approx 6 oz), there are two different power settings, fits well in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: it seems to chew through batteries (2 AA) fairly quickly and the power switch can be a little difficult to operate when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the collapsing design and the solid construction.  This would be the perfect travel companion and is probably intended for travel more so than as the everyday home use I&#x27;m using it for.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t hold enough water but that&#x27;s not been a problem for me.  I have had to replace the batteries once already and it&#x27;s only been a few months, which I thought might just be the batteries I used but the second set is starting to slow down already too.  The only other minor gripe is the power switch is a little tricky when it&#x27;s all wet and I&#x27;ve sprayed myself a couple of times, notr really a big deal.  Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and would recommend it especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my daughter was having trouble getting food out of her dental appliance.  It is very effective but a bit messy due to the attached reservoir.  Seems to have plenty of power and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Been using this at work and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Very good item, performs as described. Very portable specially for extensive travel.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very simple to use and cleans my teeth perfectly&lt;br /&gt;-Tip allows you to get between teeth and clean close to gums&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap and cost effective&lt;br /&gt;-2 adjustable levels&lt;br /&gt;-simple design and very portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-have to change batteries every 20 days&lt;br /&gt;-tank doesnt hold enough water&lt;br /&gt;-louder than i expected</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a more well known waterpik option. Very happy with the Panasonic. The battery life is excellent. The pressure works well...a bit lighter than the other brand but still effective.</li>
            <li> This oral flosser is portable, very easy to use without even reviewing the operation manual. Good performance as an accessory along with a ultrasonic toothbrush. The tank volume is a little bit small that I have to fill in 2-3 cycles every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has always made very good products and this is no exception. I bought this for my wife and she uses it daily. The fact that it is portable is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I ordered Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A from the seller Good As New Electronics.&lt;br /&gt;The description of this product on Amazon website is not clear, for example there is no origin of this product and no product warranty certificate.  Although this product carries &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34; name, when I opened it I found it is not &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34; quality but rather a low quality product.  I intend to purchase a product with &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34; quality not a product with just &amp;#34;Panasonic&amp;#34; name. After this product was opened and found with inferior quality, it was repackaged in the original box and never been used.  When I try to return this product this company (Good As New Electronics) refused because they claim the box is opened.  How can I inspect a product without open the box?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review will help anyone intend to order this product at Good As New Electronics.</li>
            <li> I travel quite frequently and I make certain to take this everywhere. I have bridges and implants and I can&#x27;t wait to irrigate after each meal. I bought one for my daughter also and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a great appliance for keeping your teeth clean.  It&#x27;s battery operated with plenty of power  to get the job done, I use this every time I brush my teeth. Well worth the cost!  My dentist will be pleased!</li>
            <li> very portable and impressed with how easy to use, compared to competitor&#x27;s products.  am hoping for longevity in use in the future.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICED ITEM IN ADDITION TO BRUSHING.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and cleans some hard to reach places&lt;br /&gt;I like this product</li>
            <li> Had it for a week on the road and loved it. The water reservoir is perfect size and does not take up much room in hand carry. Make sure you follow instructions for when not in use.</li>
            <li> I work very hard to keep my teeth clean so when I travel it is hard to carry the big irrigator. I got a battery operated unit that was not satisfactory. BUT, this one works well, holds more water and has enough water pressure to really irrigate between teeth.  I have to fill it twice, but that is OK. It does not charge to operate without electricity however.</li>
            <li> It works great and it&#x27;s really easy to use. I previously used the waterpik brand with the whole tank contraption. This hand held tank is much easier to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The product worked great when I first bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then then mold started growing inside. I tried using hydrogen peroxide to clean.&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth the health risks to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Save you money and do not buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be redesigned so that the water housing section can be separated (removed) to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This on the company website:&lt;br /&gt;_____________&lt;br /&gt;[snip]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Mandatory!&lt;br /&gt;Keep the appliance sanitized and use fresh tap wate ror&lt;br /&gt;warm water when cleaning the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to throw out the wate rinside the tank,and run&lt;br /&gt;the appliance for 2 to 3 seconds to drain the water after&lt;br /&gt;usage.&lt;br /&gt;Failure to do so could result in damage to your health if used&lt;br /&gt;without keeping it sanitized due to propagation of mold and&lt;br /&gt;bacteria. It may also result in odor and malfunction.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[snip]&lt;br /&gt;_____________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The do not give you anyway to pull off the water housing to let the product air dry.&lt;br /&gt;That little hole is not enough to let it dry out. It is always wet inside which causes the mold.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It works as advertised, it  takes a little practice. Worth the effort for your dental health.</li>
            <li> It is very good. I use it everyday. The water comes out very quickly. Because I only use it one week, I do not know how long it will keep well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, the work is satisfactory, but water less of it, one can not reach the expected effect, needs a lot of water, carrying in travel is a good choice, the overall situation of it I basically full.</li>
            <li> The answer if your a bad flosser.  It takes a bit to get use to, you will make a mess the first couple times. But it works great</li>
            <li> I had an older Water Pik that died.  This cordless Panasonic unit works very well.  The slot in the top of the battery compartment is shaped to take the edge of a quarter coin for opening and closing (not noted in the instructions).  The reservoir tank is easy to fill.  I found that using it on the lower speed, and with a reasonable speed in moving it along my teeth, a full reservoir is just the right amount of water to cover the front and back of both lower and upper teeth.  For travel use, the nozzle can be stored in the small indented space in the side of the upper unit - it is a tight fit, but I did manage to fit it into the space.  If used as directed, it should not irritate the gums.  This appears to be designed for adult use.  If is not clear how old a child should be to use it without adult assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would note that my dental hygienist recommends using this type appliance to remove food particles not easily removed by flossing.  She tends to disapprove of snack foods like popcorn.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product for travel.  It is compact and works very well.  Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of limited packing space.</li>
            <li> I love that this is so easy to get out and use, and that it is water proof.  I have a full size water pick, but it takes time to get out set-up and such a short tube from machine to handle, plus I have to stand there at the sink, making a bit of a mess as water squirts every where.  With this portable model, I can take it in the shower, so no mess, and since it&#x27;s hand held, no tube to limit my movement.  It does seem a little weaker than the counter model, but not a lot, and still more than sufficient to take care of my needs.</li>
            <li> Great Product Great Seller</li>
            <li> not a lot of pressure</li>
            <li> It works good, I will buy again if this one breaks one day.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was for the size as I live in a condo and have little counter space. I didn&#x27;t want a huge unit taking up a lot of space and know myself, if this wasn&#x27;t out, I wouldn&#x27;t use it. The compact size is excellent and the water pressure is great. However, this is my first water flosser, so I don&#x27;t have much experience here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water tank is good enough for one use. When I first started, I had to refill it once. But as I got better at using it, I can clean my teeth in one fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit works good with my rechargeable enloops and the pressure seems to be the same as the included alkaline AA batteries.</li>
            <li> I just received my second one of these little waterpiks, finally wore out the first one after many years of daily use.  I wish i&#x27;d known about these long ago, i probably could have saved thousands in dental work.  Only after I started using this did I finally realize that brushing is only a half measure (and wears your teeth - the dentist told me he saw groves from the brushing, even using soft brushes).  I will get a little grisly for a moment, Being the randy old fart that I am with all the attendant problems of such, I started using the waterpik because I had a pocket in the gums - that was storing food like a chipmunk in the fall, and not getting removed by brushing, the food was DECAYING (Ugh) and causing pain!  But three dentists I saw for this, would not tell me the gum pocket was the problem was (although they were quite happy to let me fill their pockets, one periodontist charged me $1000 for essentially doing nothing.)  This inexpensive contraption fixed up that issue perfectly.  When you can see the debris (food - yuk) that gets blown out of your teeth, I knew that brushing/flossing wasn&#x27;t getting the teeth clean enough.  Anyway, I give this product  5 stars because its cheap, it works well and it lasts a ridiculously long time.  The only problem will be supplying it with batteries (I  just ignore what the manual says on rechargables and use eneloops to keep the battery costs down).  And I sure wish i&#x27;d starting using this product when i was a kid -  if you don&#x27;t use a waterpik, you might not be getting your teeth as clean as they could be.using this years ago, do yourslef a big favor - buy one before they quit making them!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to carry, easy to use, and it works well.  At home I keep it downstairs for a quick cleaning without having to go back up to use the larger waterpik.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  Now if I can remember to direct it into my mouth!?&lt;br /&gt;Very compact and does not take up a lot of room on the counter.</li>
            <li> A great tool for keeping your teeth and mouth clean.</li>
            <li> Might as well take a bath!</li>
            <li> I have an Ocean Breeze for home use...bought this for vacation...it is wonderful! Since I wear braces, this now goes with me everywhere! It is easy on batteries, too. I have learned to value the freshness I feel when I brush and irrigate after every meal...actually look forward to it..</li>
            <li> Good product. Well made and relatively good battery life. Definitely improved my last visit to the dentist. I would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit about a year ago and was quite happy with it until I noticed black stuff growing in the seams at the bottom of the tank.  No amount of rinsing with hot water, alcohol, or hydrogen peroxide would clean it.  And I followed the manufacturers instructions and emptied the unit after every use.  And I used a mixture of either hydrogen peroxide or mouth wash with water about every third time I used it.  If it can&#x27;t be cleaned it will have to be replaced - not a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have braces and it has made my life so much easier.  It is definitely worth the price and it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Its not louder than an electric toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;- Does not take a lot of space unlike other brands&lt;br /&gt;- the water tank is perfect for that one use (and you&#x27;re supposed to empty it after every use)&lt;br /&gt;- it has two settings; 1 &amp; 2 so when you get used to the slower, you can move up to the faster.&lt;br /&gt;- portable (took it with on my vacation and it took no space at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- it has one tip so you would have to order more if more than one person is going to use it&lt;br /&gt;- wish it had more settings (faster setting)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this comment in a few months!</li>
            <li> Works great. Takes regular batteries.  Cleans mouth better than flossing and brushing alone.  I use it as the third step.</li>
            <li> I used one with a charger a long cord for more than two years. It did a great job, but it was a real pain to use and an eye sore to boot. I found this in Amazon and bought it in ten minutes. What a difference. The instructions tell not to use rechargable batteries. But being a tad cheap, I bought  a Battery and Charger Set (4 batteries) along with it. After using it every day, I turned it upside down and turned back on for 4 or 5 seconds to clear the internal water system.</li>
            <li> It works very well - easy to use and light weight and effective -  but do not get any water in the battery compartment or the unit will die an instant death!  Be sure it is completely dry before opening the battery compartment!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a well thought out and engineered portable packaged device. As long as it keeps running for me for a couple years I will be very pleased with it. It is surprisingly powerful for a portable battery powered unit. Works very well for the purpose and I am very glad someone makes something like this because my braces catch food all the time when out and about. I just keep it handy where ever I drive and always have a water bottle handy as well.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have bought three of these (they last about 2-3 years, depending on usage).  Although a bit awkward to handle at times (for petite ladies or a child&#x27;s hands), it still is the best oral irrigator for travel.  Very compact!</li>
            <li> This is a nice device, is seems to work well and assists me in getting food particles out of some difficult places with minimal trauma (flossing).  I&#x27;d recommend it.  The only problem noted is the on and off switch...its not at all easy to move with wet hands...which they are sure to be.  I think they could fix that with a minor redesign.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of finding the lazy way out of flossing. It&#x27;s not because I hate flossing that much, just more that I had braces in my mouth and flossing with braces is beyond frustrating and time-consuming. I used it, and it seemed to do the trick pretty well until I went back to the orthodontist and discovered this irragator wasn&#x27;t as thorough as I was hoping it would be. There was still some plaque buildup on my teeth. It wasn&#x27;t until after I removed my braces that I realized it didn&#x27;t irrigate out everything. So yeah, it&#x27;ll catch the stuff it can reach, but it can&#x27;t get to all of it. I am also running into the issue of it being sanitary. I leave the cap open and don&#x27;t compact it so the water doesn&#x27;t stagnate, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to sanitize it so it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual or mold or what have you. As far as water pressure, on a new battery it&#x27;s great, but once it wears down the water stream becomes noticeably weaker. Overall, I&#x27;d say buy it if you need to use it in lieu of flossing, but flossing is probably still best.</li>
            <li> This device works well but if it is used frequently the batteries need changing often.  It is an adequate alternative to flossing.</li>
            <li> More than I expected.  Delivery was excellent and the product is better than my home based unit.  Product was as described and reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li> I went and bought another larger model. But I can not use the one from Amiizon!! Will try another time</li>
            <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt;They are very well used.</li>
            <li> Amazing and deep cleaning water flosser!! Travels great!</li>
            <li> Was searching the internet for such a product to travel with.  It is great, but make sure you put in GOOD batteries (not the $1 store type) in order to get a good result.  Told this to my brother &amp; sister in law, &amp; they also ordered it!!  Great for on the go!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it ever since, try other products but not compare to this one.  And it is very portable for traveling too.</li>
            <li> This did the job I wanted it for.  It&#x27;s easy to pack and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Two draw backs: it needs refilling mid-use and the batteries run down quickly, so I&#x27;m careful to have extras.</li>
            <li> Great water pik. Was exactly what I was looking for since my gums have started bleeding more and more. My dentist recommended I get one and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it yet. Went back to the dentist after using for just 6 weeks and he said he already can see an improvement!</li>
            <li> The spray is weaker than my Waterpik corded.  Batteries lasted about 2 weeks of once-a-day usage.  Convenient for travel and seams to be well made.  I may not be typical user as my dentist has advised me to turn up my Waterpik to the max because of my teeth crowding.</li>
            <li> FAIRLY COMPACT WITH GREAT PRESSURE AND THE RESERVOIR IS JUST THE  RIGHT SIZE FOR A QUICK ON THE GO CLEANING.</li>
            <li> Works even better than my plug-in water-flosser.  Packs easily for travel.  That&#x27;s realIy all I  have to say about it.</li>
            <li> Excellent little machine!  I tried the original Water Pic some years ago and gave it away.  It was unweildy and made a soaking mess.  This little battery-operated device is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a portable.  Miss the power of my plug-in but the portable, battery operated is great for travel.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:73951fd98d4a2e986e372e3e3f673f46]] This item is very elegant, Panasonic is a very trustworthy company from my previous experience. It is my first time making video review, please bear with me if my skills were not good. Leave a comment if you have a question about it that maybe I can help, and like it if you find it useful! I wish it could be more clear but the file size has to be under 100 MB.    There are several pros and cons.    Pros.  1. It is very strong, the battery that came with it is manufactured by Panasonic as well, it is disposable battery, and the manual recommends no rechargeable battery.  2. The level 2 is even stronger than level 10 in the corded water flosser \\&quot;Waterpik WP-660 Aquarius Professional Water Flosser\\&quot;. I bought that for my mom, and I feel that is not as powerful as this one.  3. It removes all the things between your teeth perfectly.  4. Portable and looks very elegant, and can be carry everywhere, it can be smaller too by inserting the irrigator into the tank.  5. Consider this as an investment, it saves money compared to using the regular flosser. Still, the battery is an expense as well.    Cons.  1. The top where you insert battery is hard to open and close for the first time users. But it is understandable because it helps to prevent water from flowing in.  2. The tank cannot be detached from the irrigator, and the tank only has a little hole where you put water. This means it is hard to wipe the water inside using a paper. This can be problematic because if water is there for a period of time and you did not remove it, there can be mold as mentioned by other reviewers.  3. It only comes with one pick. The corded waterpik had all different types of pick for different use.  4. The tank is small and not enough for a thorough mouth clean.    I will put more updates if people find this helpful. Again, bear with me for my inexperience in making video review, I have to hold it one-handed.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s well and gets the job for me.</li>
            <li> It could have a pulsating speed option but so far I am really pleased. The last cordless flosser only lasted five months and the reservoir was difficult to fill and difficult to drain. Even though I had to fill this Panasonic twice, it is so easy to fill that it wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if it will only last longer than five months .....</li>
            <li> I thought the mouth piece was detachable- it was not which made it hard to use. You are supposed to clean from the bottom of the tooth up and this is very difficult with this unit.</li>
            <li> But I would not hesitate to recommend anyone who floss much. Think this is easier than flossing and cleans better. Of course, having a combination is also good, but the stuffs between the teeth are easily removed with this irrigator.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other buyers are talking about, but this product works great, and it&#x27;s really powerful too. It&#x27;s compact and its much more convenient to clean around braces with this product rather than using a floss.</li>
            <li> A great product if you are a frequent traveller and need a powerful irrigator.  Worked fine with one set of batteries for 16 days with at least once daily usage.  Would have been nice if it was rechargeable but still works well as is.</li>
            <li> This is the third one that I&#x27;ve owned over the years.  The first one lasted years until the pump started to loose power.  The second one lasted years until the pik-stem malfunctioned (my fault).  Now I&#x27;m on my third and I love it for so many reasons.  One is the convenience.  It&#x27;s so easy to pull out of the drawer and use instantly.  No bulky reservoirs and power cords.  Another reason I love it is because it is so easily portable.  Just collapse it and stuff it in your suitcase.  Lastly, I like it because of the power settings.  It has plenty of power in setting 2.  Just an all around great product that has created a loyal fan!</li>
            <li> This Oral Irrigator is simple, easy to set and use. It is portable and work great!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to everyone, your oral health will improve as well as your smile!</li>
            <li> I bought this intending to use rechargeable AAs with it, but the instruction booklet says not to because of possible corrosion. This was a disappointment for me and I may try rechargeables anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low speed is a nice option for dispensing ACT or other mouthwash to the gum line, but the reservoir is so small that you must work very quickly - note the instructions suggest to use only water and to always empty the unit after use). The on/off switch is extremely stiff though. Note that on high speed it is much less powerful than a standard Waterpick but still effective. This might be a good thing if you&#x27;re concerned about damage from the higher pressure Waterpick. Pulsing water pressure can dislodge restorations, mind you!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;(Reporting back in 2013) I used rechargeables now for some time in this without issue other than their very tight fit. They should work just fine for you too if you can make them fit. Respect the earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft battery cover can easily be damaged by the wrong tool to open it (a quarter did this in my case). I found though that a 5-cent nickle does the job nicely without damage. I keep one with the unit ready for battery changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the tiny reservoir though, I find I just don&#x27;t use it (I can&#x27;t get through my whole mouth without refilling it).</li>
            <li> This is the first portable I&#x27;ve used, and I was very disappointed in both the size of the tank (could not get more than one side done per tankful) and the force of the water. I&#x27;m used to the old Water Pik&#x27;s and this is a poor substitute.  Oh, well...sent it back. BTW, the Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks work really well, and have now taken the place of the hated flossing for me. My dentist is amazed. [[ASIN:B00156C2EU The Doctors Brush Picks to Remove Plaque and Food Particles - 120 ea]]</li>
            <li> This is a great solution for travelers that need a dental care solution. Two speeds and easy to handle, pack and use. Use in tbe home between trips. Has a small counter foot print, ideal for smaller bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Nov 6, 2012 Update:&lt;br /&gt;I reduce my rating to 3 stars because I discovered and bought a Redi-Breeze irrigator (from Amazon) that fastens to the faucet, that does a better job, not requiring battery changes, not subject to performance fall-off as the batteries decline, nor filling a reservoir or cleaning the unit.  It&#x27;s just a better system.  Its location on Amazon follows: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028OV2S0/ref&#x3D;oh_details.  However, I will take the portable Panasonic unit with me when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update a year later, April 3, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;I still rate this 5 stars, and am still using it. I haven&#x27;t kept a record exactly how long batteries last, maybe 2 months, but when I change them, I take it apart, clean it and let it dry overnight. It still works like new, and I use it three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: For years I have thought that a portable water pick would be a good idea, but never thought until recently to see if one existed. The reviews for this Panasonic unit were better than others for sale, and I ordered it for that reason. Coincidentally, my plug-in unit failed a day or so after the Panasonic arrived, so I use it several times a day, plus on a recent overnight motorcycle trip to Big Bear Lake, CA. The jet pulse stream is actually stronger than that of my former plug-in, and it has continued to operate strongly on the first set of (2 AA) batteries for about a month. The reservoir capacity is perfect for one usage. It  folds up very well to pack for a trip, with the jet piece easily removed and stored safely in the unit. A couple of days ago I looked for a replacement plug-in at Walmart. I found them all to be quite expensive, so I decided to continue to use the Panasonic portable all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this little dental \\&quot;irrigator\\&quot;. It suits my needs to a T and it hardly takes up any space at all on the vanity. It lives on batteries, so no long cord to mess with either.</li>
            <li> Excellent for keeping your mouth fresh and clean while traveling. Especially good for someone with dental implants.</li>
            <li> big improvement over the oral b irrigator.  larger water supply, more comfortable to hold, and single AA battery means no tangle of cords on the countertop. good purchase.</li>
            <li> I recently received this Panasonic irrigator and I find it to be superior to Water Pik in every category. Admittedly, I am biased towards Panasonic products but the quality of this dental appliance is quickly evident. I used to use a standard Water Pik, but it was problem prone. The Panasonic portable is every bit as effective as Water Pik, if not more so. And no counter clutter! The design I would describe as \\&quot;smart simplicity\\&quot;. Do your gums a favor!!</li>
            <li> I really love the idea of this, and it&#x27;s clear that it is a winner for most people.&lt;br /&gt;I just have 2 issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It didn&#x27;t hold enough water for me to clean my entire (normal sized!) mouth to my satisfaction.  I know that I can refill it, but ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) By the time I&#x27;ve gotten half of my mouth clean, the instrument is so covered with&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;water-spit&#x27; that I&#x27;m totally grossed out and don&#x27;t want to refill it.  Or touch it. I feel as though I need to wash the whole unit in hot, soapy water before I set it aside for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can perform the acrobatics necessary to keep the thing dry while cleaning your entire mouth, you&#x27;re my hero.</li>
            <li> I have a large WaterPik at home and also purchased a travel size. My travel one did not work very well and I was not getting positive dental check ups after multiple trips. I decided to look for something else and this Panasonic Oral Irrigator is what I found to try. The water pressure is exactly what I needed to keep the pockets irrigated and I am 100% happy with the results. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Quite satisfy with the performance of this Irrigator. A good buy for 30 dollar purchase. Using rechargeable battery without any problem.</li>
            <li> Just had my braces on for 2 weeks and this one came in. A total life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can take it with me everywhere I go. And no need to worry about food on my braces because it will clean them all!</li>
            <li> good product, cannot replace the teethbrushing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this device. It arrived the same day that i ordered it, had plenty of pep, and really did the job. I purchase one about every three months as the pump fails so often. I am hoping that this has a little longer life, but if it goes, I will certainly order again. The oral irrigator, dental floss, and brushing have been a must and I don&#x27;t think that I could managed without the water flosser. Great for trips. My previous models were battery hogs requiring replacement every three or four days. Too early to see how this one will do. If anyone finds a better model, I would enjoy hearing about it</li>
            <li> Had one of these before and after a few years it finally broke.  This one is a bit smaller but works fine.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the ease of handling and size.</li>
            <li> Nozzle dosen&#x27;t work for more than 1 week.The Oral irrigator is a lousey unit. I would&#x27;nt recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I don&#x27;t have to use boring flossing any more on my gums. Using this makes a lot funner. I would definitely recommend buying this product .</li>
            <li> I bought three of these, two as gift. Mine stopped working after 6 months. I have used Panasonic personal health care products in the past and none have been so disappointing.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s very good like it</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It replaces a WaterPic which replaced a WaterPic . . . Using regular batteries on this Panasonic Oral Irrigator causes the action to last much much longer and with more power than the WaterPic&#x27;s rechargeable batteries and there are fewer breakable parts. Our last WaterPic has the water refill opening on top, so when someone used the pick, their &amp;#34;mouth backwash&amp;#34; accumulated around the opening, some of it under the cover so it wasn&#x27;t noticed until the cover was open again ... ick! Did I say ick? I meant ICK.  This device is marvelous. The water compartment can be removed from the generator and in this state, it can be completely washed AND dried, something you can&#x27;t do when only a small hole is available for filling and draining. More amazing, it can be collapsed for packing. I am very satisfied with it, especially in comparison with a competing product.  Note that I drain the water compartment after use and leave its plug open so the compartment can dry out as I believe it is more sanitary.</li>
            <li> Great product. Small, portable, does a very good job considering its size.</li>
            <li> I bought this for when I travel and it&#x27;s okay but not as powerful as the one I use everyday at home.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the unit overall.  It is plenty powerful (two flow rates to choose from), fits easily into your hand during use,&lt;br /&gt;and collapses neatly when not in use.  The only suggestion for improvement would be a larger water reservoir (twice the size...maybe via some slick folding reservoir).</li>
            <li> strong flow...works well</li>
            <li> Bought the Panasonic Oral Irrigator for travel.  It&#x27;s OK but I like my regular size water pic better.  The Panasonic doesn&#x27;t have the force of water that my regular water pic has.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist was not terribly happy when I told her that I don&#x27;t floss.  She also wasn&#x27;t super happy to hear I was using a water pik type cleaner either.  She said she was worried about the force of the water.  I guess if you aim it wrong, you could do some damage to your periodontal pockets (?), but I think that would hurt, so probably doesn&#x27;t happen too much.  Just follow the instructions and aim the water jet at 90 degrees (or slightly towards the top) to your teeth, never forcing water into your gums and you should never have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t floss easily.  I have several bridges that make it very hard to get the floss in.  I&#x27;d have to thread the floss with a threader loop several times, and frankly, I&#x27;m not that ambitious and I don&#x27;t like the feel of string in my mouth.  So what I do is just leave this on the counter and use it once a week or two, and every time I use it, it gets some stuff out from under my bridges, etc. and my mouth feels nice and clean.  My dental hygenist was also impressed, and said I wouldn&#x27;t really benefit from flossing extra.  I do brush them well every day, which I&#x27;m sure also helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, no tool will make cleaning your teeth and gums fun, but this one makes it very little work.</li>
            <li> Bough three of these: 1 for myself that I was happy with, and soon after one for my mother. Both broken shortly after 1 year of use. I thought it might be a fluke, and since I was, overall, happy with the product&#x27;s performance, I ordered a replacement one for myself, which duly broke within the same time-frame. Overall it might be worth contemplating paying more money upfront for a more durable product than dealing with the frustration and expense of replacing this one. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Way better than WaterPik.</li>
            <li> The water doesn&#x27;t last long enough before needing a refill.</li>
            <li> Dentist suggested this type of item....after reading a zillion reviews....the Panasonic was highly rated and I couldn&#x27;t find negatives about it.  It is very easy to use (once you get used to the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34;)....and is easily stored!</li>
            <li> Okay but I wished there was more water pressure.</li>
            <li> This is the answer to the troublesome process of flossing. It comes with 2 pressure and is generally quite gentle on the gums. Even though the manual stated that some people might get gum bleeding during their first few usage, I was fortunate enough not to be one. Recommended for people who find flossing a hassle.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit on a hunch. Somewhere I saw that this unt had a very high pulse rate, so that interested me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did everything perfect - nice unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TaosGuy</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Takes up no space on my vanity. I took it with me on vacation. No charger. No electrical cord. LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years now and it still works great. It travels well as there is a place to store the pic in the handle. I use rechargeable batteries that power it all week with standard alkaline batteries - and longer if you use the lithium ion batteries. It makes my mouth feel really clean. i started using it when I had braces, but now I&#x27;m hooked! This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works better than the expensive ones</li>
            <li> This item worked about one month and then failed.  I have used them before with no problems.  It is too much trouble to return it, so I won&#x27;t buy these online anymore.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job. I bought it for my son with braces. The reservoir is a little small but fills quickly so no problem. He uses it in the shower. Lol. Much more convenient to use and store that a plug in with a tank and hose!</li>
            <li> I wear braces and I asked the person who cleans the teeth about how to floss when I am wearing braces.  She mentioned the oral floss.  I never knew this existed before.  This does a great job when you are wearing braces to thoroughly clean stuff in between braces and teeth.  However not taking into account the braces, regular in between the teeth flossing, it does a good job, but I can&#x27;t compare it to a regular floss with a thread.  The thread is better for regular flossing in my opinion.  But I might still stick with this, because of the time it takes to do the flossing.  This one will cut down the flossing time at least one forth compared to doing with thread in my opinion.  Somehow I like the fast cleaning.</li>
            <li> A good personal,portable oral irrigator that does the job for a good price.  I don&#x27;t have space for a larger  irrigator that may be more powerful.  I like this one because it does have 2 settings which are just fine for me..I use the harder setting.  You have to fill up the resevoir  twice, once for the upper teeth and once for the lower..not a big deal...I use it after brushing and flossing and it does get some more debris out on occasion even with good flossing.  I recommend leaving the water cap open after use to air out.  The only drawback is the on/off button which is not very tactile especially when your hands are wet and I often have to use a washcloth to turn it on/off because my fingers are sliding all over it.  Howver, this is a portable unit and I am using it as my main unit.  Glad I bought it and we will wait for my next periodontal appointment is 3 months to see if there is an improvement.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have heard so much horror stories about oral irrigators not working. I love this one as it really is portable - which is great for someone like me who travels a lot for work. I actually have only been using the lower power level as the other one is too strong for me. So far, I can&#x27;t find any cons.</li>
            <li> Only problem I have with the Panasonic EW-Dj10-A is the switch location and style. The switch needs to be redesigned to not only to fit into the existing cavity but a larger thumb push is needed, because of the amount of water splashing about the hands are wet and therefor it is difficult to use the switch.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that small problem I found it good value for the amount of money paid</li>
            <li> Except for the on-off switch I really like this compact unit.  I do wish it had come with a travel case.  Otherwise, now complaints.  It is a good adjunct to the home based Water Pik I use.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a person with limited use of one arm and hand.  It has proven to be wonderful.  The water jet is powerful enough to really do the job, and the irrigator is easy to handle with only one hand.  It would be great for anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I have braces. I highly recommend it for people with or without braces because it works awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the newer version and I found it to be better than the older version (Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator). It has 2 instead of 1 speed setting and the tip has a better design. Happy with it. :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptics at first, but this thing is great. I mix mouthwash in with the water and it is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> After using an electricity powered water irrigator, was pleasantly surprised to find that this portable battery-operated irrigator does an equally effective job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cleans well.  Can be stored in the shower and used there as well keeping the bathroom mirror spot free.</li>
            <li> This oral irrigator is a great addition to oral hygiene. It removes particles between teeth, and maintains the health of crowns and implants. I love the fact it has 2 speeds. I can use the more powerful speed as well as the lower for more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an Oral Irrigator or a water flosser(as I like to call it) this is the best option, I used Waterpik and it didnt last more than 6 months, plus Panasonic is smaller to travel with. I thinks is great!</li>
            <li> Got this for a 13-year-old in braces, and the orthodontist was very pleased with the results.  Parents were also pleased because the 13-year-old does not resist using it!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing and they were very helpful. My dentist suggested I get a \\&quot;water pik\\&quot; of some kind so I tried this one. The first 4 or 5 days were a scream- as I tried to figure out how big or little to open my mouth. Water was flying everywhere but I&#x27;ve never had so much fun. WHO KNEW?  It&#x27;s amazing how much yuck gets lodged between your teeth. Once you start and see the results, you won&#x27;t dare miss a day. I usually water pik first - then brush. YOU WILL LOVE THIS!! CAUTION - Have a towel handy to wipe off everything within two feet of the sink. But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought for traveling.  A little large but works fine.  Needs a carrying case</li>
            <li> I took this out of the package and put water in it, put it in my mouth and WOAH! That thing is strong! I seriously almost drowned myself twice on this thing and sprayed myself with this several times. Made a mess in the bathroom! I would suggest making sure it&#x27;s all the way in your mouth and closing your lips tightly around the nozzle to make sure no water comes out. While you clean your teeth, turn off the product and spit the water out occasionally. If you don&#x27;t keep your finger on the switch YOU WILL GET WET AND/OR drown! Works very well though great for when you get food stuck in your teeth and a good substitute to brushing your teeth many times a day. Leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I rarely spend time to write reviews for products but I was so impressed with this item I needed to comment.I bought this item for travel. It&#x27;s great how it collapses with storage for the tip it take up very little space. The size of the water tank and the pressure of the pulses are perfect for cleaning with a single fill in my experience and it&#x27;s easy to clean and store. This is a well thought out quality product. The batteries that came with it are still going strong and I have used it at leat twice a day on a twelve day trip the pressure has not changed with battery age. I recommend this highly for travel but even for home use it takes up less space and cleans as well as conventional counter top units (less capacity but can be filled more than once if needed) and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> Great product! Glad I got it.  Very convenient to use, as there is no cord.</li>
            <li> My unit failed in 40 days. I used this item less than 10 times in 40 days.&lt;br /&gt;There is no return to Amazon on this item after 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending it to Panasonic at my expense, where the repair should be free.&lt;br /&gt;An interesting device, but should last longer than this.&lt;br /&gt;Craig</li>
            <li> Really works well... use warm water for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fast, even after brushing, sometimes small pieces of stuff are washed loose (mostly seeds from toast I have eaten). I figure it is getting out microscopic debris that I can&#x27;t see, as well. I look forward to seeing if it has made an impact on my oral health at my next dental check up. I actually have fun with oral care now--I&#x27;m even flossing more! Yeowza!</li>
            <li> bulky and had to refill 2 times for one cleaning</li>
            <li> This works very well. My recommendation is to purchase rechargeable batteries for it since it goes through them quickly.</li>
            <li> It feels very good, just started to use, gum bleeding, after a few times, if you just eat immediately after the use of the effect is very good</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve had three of the Panasonic travel units and two of the Waterpik ones.  I travel a lot. The Panasonic units have lasted a bit longer but neither brand is very reliable.  Right now I have three of the EW-DJ10 units on hand and two of them work sometimes.  I&#x27;ve tried to figure out what goes wrong but have been unable to do so.  Sometimes if you push very hard on the top of the battery cap, you can get the unit to run, but only while you maintain this pressure.  My units are plain EW-DJ10&#x27;s and not the -A model. I&#x27;m thinking to try the -A model and see if it is any better.  I wish there were another brand to try, but looks like I am stuck with deciding on the Panasonic or the Waterpik unit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this over a year ago.  It does a good job and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> works OK not a huge amount of pressure&lt;br /&gt;only true problems since you have to refill it each time the water is straight out of the tap and cold which hurts my teeth so I have to heat the water up first before using it.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other reviewers battery claims you need fresh alkali 1.5  batteries to get any pressure it starts to die off within a week&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten black mold inside before you have to store it with the trap door open I treated every once in awhilewith mouthwash and it took care of it</li>
            <li> Horrible.  No way to use it without getting drenched.  Putting it in your mouth before you turn it on doesn&#x27;t help at all.  Not worth whatever it might do to improve gum health.  I&#x27;m going to stick with floss.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, easy to use irrigator.</li>
            <li> Best travel flossier ever. Price was great and product performs well. Most of all it was easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Hard to figure out how to use at first. It took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Great portable water pick. Plenty of water capacity and power. Very satisfied with my Panasonic oral irrigator.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Way more powerful than I expected. Kids could have fun shooting the water at each other! Works great as described.</li>
            <li> Great for travel - compact in size but still close to the power of my big Water Pik model with 10 settings that I have for home use. Have to fill twice to get the job done, but no big deal. It has a storage space built in for the pick. I like it very much. I guess you could use it for home too.  I might not have both if I&#x27;d known about this model before I bought the bigger Water Pik.  One of my brothers bought a travel size Water Pik and complains about the low power.</li>
            <li> It is what I want, I like it very much, easy to use, it is an economical and applicable objects, the only problem is that the water is less, probably because it is portable items!</li>
            <li> I used this twice and that was it.  I carefully followed the instructions and wound up with water everywhere but in my teeth.  I just couldn&#x27;t get the mechanism to focus on the teeth instead of my forehead, blouse and bathroom wall.  Truth be told, I&#x27;m not much into gadgets, but I had tons of dental work done and felt obliged to try this.  It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t work, I just think it takes all kinds of practice - - then maybe it&#x27;s ok.  I got this one because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of $$$$ on a risk - -maybe I should have.  My advice is, if you want something that really does the job, go a little higher end.</li>
            <li> If you have an area that always gets food stuck between your teeth, this Panasonic Oral Irrigator is just what you need to remove the particles that drive you crazy. It is good to use in addition to dental floss for hard to get areas.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I would have like but adequate for a battery powered item.  The thing I like the most is that the reservoir and the motor section come apart so that it can be completely dried out prior to storing.  The Waterpik unit I had did not and I have given it away.  I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I thought it would be, but does a decent job conveniently. Would have been better if it was slightly cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this irrigator after reading all the reviews on all of the irrigators available.  It is very easy to set up, and the irrigator tip is easy to insert.  There is a small cap that opens up the chamber to fill with water and/or mouthwash.  The first time I used this irrigator, I had fluid all over the sink and counter because I was not used to using it.  Over time, I finally adapted and was able to contain the fluid to the sink.  There are two speeds you can use.  The switch is easy to maneuver- slow, high, and off.  The tip easily rotates depending on what area of the mouth you are irrigating.  After using this for two weeks, I still cannot irrigate my mouth on one chamber-full of fluid because I am too slow.  I am sure over time I will become faster and more accurate. I really like the way my mouth feels after using this irrigator.  I am glad I purchased it.  By the way, it is easy to disassemble to clean every so often.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product functions well, which just matches my expectation when I bought it only for $18.</li>
            <li> Bought this to take the &amp;#34;waterpiking show&amp;#34; on the road. Wish it held more fluid in the chamber but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> The feature is that it collapses for storage, so would be a good travel unit.  It also runs on batteries, so no electric outlet is needed.  Good for camping, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part is that it is a poor choice for home use.  The two AA batteries are just do not provide enough power to provide a forceful jet stream, probably about a tenth of the force of an AC WaterPic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s useable, but a poor replacement for an AC unit for home use.  Not bad for travel, and about the only choice for camping or hiking.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first after reading some of the reviews-- someone had said the button was too hard to move and they had problems turning it off. I would say my device is the exact opposite and I accidentally sprayed myself in the face, and have sprayed my bathroom mirror more than once. I saw other people complaining theirs showed up broken, they didn&#x27;t work for whatever reason, etc. My irrigator has been great and other than accidentally spraying myself a couple of times, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how clean everything feels after I use this. I brush my teeth with a panasonic electric toothbrush every morning and night, and I follow up brushing with alcohol-free listerine. I added the irrigator to my nightly routine, I use it on the first setting (which is still a little painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I wanted something to help clean around my wisdom teeth. I still have all of them and cleaning can be really difficult at times. I use floss picks throughout the day, but they still had a tendency to be a source of bad breath for me. It&#x27;s not really an issue anymore since I began using this! My boyfriend also uses it to clean tonsil pockets (though he did say it was a little painful) but it works really well.</li>
            <li> Good size for traveling; good water pressure; good tank size - just enough water if I hurry. I like this dental irrigator for traveling.    Update August 26, 2014. I bought this same dental irrigator in 2009 and it worked fine. The next year no water could be pumped. I thought that was a fluke, so I bought this dental irrigator again in 2013. Again, one year later, in 2014, it wouldn&#x27;t pump water. My review was changed from 5 stars (for short-term use) to 1 star (for long-term use). Unfortunately a lot of people won&#x27;t read this review, but if you do, please keep looking for another irrigator unless you are willing to buy this one for only short-term use. I bought two of these, four years apart, and I had to throw both of them away.</li>
            <li> I have had Braun and Waterpik oral irrigators over the years and this little beauty is the best of all. No unreliable rechargeable batteries needed or cords so you can use it anywhere in the world on 2 AA batteries. The flow is surprisingly strong and it collapses for easy storage. You don&#x27;t know what clean teeth are until you have tried this. It is far more effective than floss and cheaper in the long term. You know how effective it is when you use it between your back molars and can smell the bacteria as they are cleansed out - disgusting but very reassuring - better out than in!</li>
            <li> This is powerful and easy to use.  I got it for travel and find it effective and easy to transport.  Did not give it 5 stars because it is not as effective as a non portable type.</li>
            <li> The pressure is pretty intense for my gums.  I hope I can get used to it because it hurts a little.  It&#x27;s my first time using a water pick and I prefer floss, so far.  The unit does work very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It travels easily due to the &amp;#34;built-in&amp;#34; self-storage compartment for the removeable water tip.  There are no electrical cords to tangle.  And, there is no shock hazzard since it uses a battery.  I usually use mine in the shower.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happy to own one, too.</li>
            <li> Powerful even on low setting, so not for sensitive gums.  Otherwise, good. The bottom part drains out the side instead of the bottom.</li>
            <li> I had radiation treatments to my mouth and now I need to clean my mouth after every meal and snack. This is easy to use and quickly rinses out all of the food particles between my teeth. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this water flosser.  It has a good-sized water capacity and is battery operated (no cords in the bathroom which are sometimes a pain).  It helps get to places that are impossible to get to otherwise - i.e., under a bridge which otherwise requires those stupid plastic needles that you have to thread under the bridge, something most people won&#x27;t go to the trouble of doing.  So this is an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. As a Panasonic product should be.&lt;br /&gt;Lance A.</li>
            <li> I researched these and found the panasonic to be recommended over the popular brand you see everywhere.  I like this product. I use it everyday and so far it&#x27;s fine.  Does the job.  It&#x27;s a little unwieldy at the base but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this 3+ years ago for home and travel use. It does the job and would happily recommend it. Relatively small and easy to pack. I&#x27;m still using it at home and on cruises.</li>
            <li> Excellent design. Powerful, portable and energy efficient. Best portable water pick out there.</li>
            <li> Will last a few years, This is my second</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as much cleaning power I thought it would have. It leakes</li>
            <li> Makes quite a difference in my tooth care...dentist said no evidence of tartar.  But be ready for water to splash everywhere!</li>
            <li> Nice and compact but way too powerful, even on the lower setting.  Also, it has to be held upright or it leaks all over.</li>
            <li> I needed something to travel with to do basically what the Water Pic does--especially now that I have braces.  It works fine and can collapse to be fairly small for packing.  It is so handy, I use it all the time now that I&#x27;m home.  It doesn&#x27;t have the power of the Water Pic, but works well enough.  Because it is battery powered, you can use it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Just a wee bit big, however, only need to fill it once and like the freedom of using it in the shower.  Was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get it right, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have owned over the past 20 years 4 Panasonic irrigators. It is an excellent product for travel. But it does not compare to my home based Waterpik.    The purchase process took me two hours because the Amazon web could not deal with my long absence from purchasing products from them. I spent over 70 minutes on the phone with a representative who was in the Philipines. I was successful in completing this purchase after I threated to purchase the Pansonic irregator from another supplier.    The sevice was appaling    J Lapides</li>
            <li> It is great to have this for the office or travel! I have a standard Waterpik at home and use this at work as part of an aggressive oral care routine recommended by my dentist due to gum disease. In combination with a sonic toothbrush and standard flossing, it did a great job of helping me to avoid an expected 2nd round of root planing.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, however, I am so appreciative to those before me who gave positive reviews which led me to buy this product, that I feel compelled to pay it forward for those who may be considering this purchase.  I originally purchased this product in preparation with plans to begin wearing braces.  I was looking for a portable Waterpik that I could carry in my purse and take with me everywhere. Well, the Panasonic Oral Irrigator is a product that I hope to have with me for the rest of my lifetime, long after my stint with braces has come to an end.  The product is amazing.  I find it to be comparably as powerful as the Waterpik Ultra counter-top model (on moderate settings) that I purchased at the same time, as long as the batteries are kept fresh.  My husband loved it so much, I purchased another within a few days so he could have one with him at all times. I rarely use our counter-top Waterpik these days because the Panasonic Oral Irrigator is simply more convenient and just as effective in my opinion.  I love to use mouthwash with it and wherever I go, it goes.  This is a truly outstanding product and a must for anyone who is striving for impeccable oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic waterjet is battery powered and would be great for travel or for a small bathroom.  The quality and performance of the unit are superb.  It is not as powerful as some of the plug in models and I do not use it for everyday home use.</li>
            <li> I think this is great. I have tried different travel water pics that did not work. I have bridgework, implants, and a temporary bridge so I have to do more than floss. I travel for a living and this is lightweight and compact enough to carry, plus I also use it at home. Keep the batteries fresh, carry extras to keep the power strong. I changed the batteries out in about 2-3 weeks to keep the power strong.</li>
            <li> Just a well made unit that gets the job done.  Has amazing power and seems to be built very well.  It does have an appetite for batteries though...</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using same model for years and my dentist says it does a excellent job</li>
            <li> I had a cordless, rechargeable unit from a competitor (you know, the famous name one) prior to purchasing this one. The rechargeable irrigator lasted about 6 months before the batteries died- on two separate units!  This one is not quite as powerful nor does it hold as much water. But..... it was less expensive and will probably last at least several years.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It amazes me that even after a thorough brushing and flossing, I use the little irrigator only to flush out a little piece of blueberry.  My dentist recommended that I get an irrigator, but I just don&#x27;t have a large area available on the bathroom counter, so I tried this one.  Excellent!  I just use the low intensity since a strong blast of water can actually damage the gums.</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and I&#x27;m using it with NiMH AA batteries. I tested it and it worked fine with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not OK with using devices that require disposable batteries when they could be powered by rechargeable batteries. The fact that the batteries are just driving a small motor using a good bit of current made this product a good candidate for MiMH batteries. The reason given in the instructions for not using rechargeable batteries - corrosion - doesn&#x27;t make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this regularly - several times a day - and I will report back if I have any problems with it or with using it with rechargeable batteries. I expect to get better battery life with the NMH batteries, to save a good bit of money by using them, and to avoid polluting the environment with used alkaline batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 2 months of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recharged the batteries twice. The unit is still working very well. I recharge the batteries when I notice a significant slow down and reduction in pressure.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is very efficient and has 2 speeds. With the gold deal price, it is quite value for money if you want an oral irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also bought together with the following:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OC74SW?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B003OC74SW&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;swiclu-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;E4T45XJV4ENHTXV4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product</li>
            <li> I use this at home and for travel to replace waterpic . I use rechargable nickel metalhydride because it gave  stronger jet and last a lot longer than alkaline on regular use .Don&#x27;t seem to harm it.I use this brand for many years and appear to be the most trouble free.I clean inside the cylinder periodically by using hypochloride bleach(Chlorox).Don&#x27;t seem to hurt it.This model(from China) is slightly noisier than the older model(from Japan) but now has 2 speed and improve connection for the tip but slightly less powerful jet. That why I gave it 4 star only</li>
            <li> Love this! Works great</li>
            <li> It was a little more powerful the I thought it was going to be but workes great at cleaning my sons braces after he eats.</li>
            <li> Not worth the investment</li>
            <li> The new Panasonic irrigator has a battery compartment and electrodes similar to the previous model (EW1270AC), so I&#x27;m sure the same comments apply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old irrigator gave out after 5 years of travel-only use. It occasionally wouldn&#x27;t switch on, finally wouldn&#x27;t switch on at all. Batteries were good. I scraped the (-) contact in the battery compartment cap and the (+) contact at the bottom of the battery compartment with a straightened-out wire coat hanger and it worked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These contacts do corrode. If you&#x27;re not going to use the device for a while, take the batteries out and leave the battery compartment cap off for a few days to let the contacts dry thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panny supplies higher water pressure than the old model but not as  much as my WaterPik (WP100) and I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for daily use. However, it&#x27;s great for travel. Note the WaterPik cordless models (WP360, WP450) have  a 110-120 vac charger rating rather than the 110-240 vac that all my other plug-in portable devices have, so the WaterPik can&#x27;t be used in Europe with a plug adapter; you&#x27;d need a (heavy and bulky) step-down transformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I wouldn&#x27;t use any dental irrigator as a substitute for daily flossing.</li>
            <li> My daughter was in tears when she was trying to floss when she got her braces.  A few days later, she want to a friend&#x27;s house, and her friend had the Braun version of this product.  I investigated the reviews, and this product received better reviews.  My daughter has been very pleased with this product.  She uses it once or twice a day, and the original batteries are still working.  We got it around Thanksgiving.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Small size is convenient to pack for travel.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Cheap and simple to use. Extra portable. I have always hated flossing. With two water pressure settings I have never needed anything more. This water flosser has truly made it worth my while.</li>
            <li> I owned 4 rechargeable &amp;#34;Water Pic&amp;#34; brand irrigators  all of which died in 6 months or less before I bought my first Panasonic.  First one lasted 2 + years.  IT&#x27;s reliable and travels well.  Cleans in the dishwasher.  I recommend you get rechargeable batteries as it eats thru a pair of duracell regular batteries in about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I now have a full-arch implant which requires cleaning by flossing and &#x27;water picks&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit provides a good clean even though the tip is a poor angle for irrigating underneath the ceramic plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noisy, messy and gets poor battery life - but- it&#x27;s very portable.  Which is why I bought it.  I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used this Oral Irrigator only for 2 months and I didn&#x27;t use it every day. But the battery chamber got rust! I realized the rust after it refused to work. It must have bad design. Not recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a great little teeth cleaner!  Compact, well designed and powerful.  Our first set of batteries lasted nearly a month.  I say our because both my wife and I use it daily.  We ordered an extra set of tips because the original order came with only one.  Power setting on high easily removes food from between teeth.  After a month I removed the battery lid and easily replaced the two AA cell batteries and we were back in the teeth cleaning business.  We&#x27;re very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Eats batteries like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. You are off buying an electric model you can plug into a wall socket.</li>
            <li> Only goes one way and the 2 setting do not vary hardly at all.. WAY too powerful to use-HURTS to use</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to holding the bulky machine but after some use, I felt comfortable with it. Good investment for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A] I do \\&quot;oil pulling\\&quot; (Google it). I spit the oil into a tiny plastic bag for disposal. The oral Irrigator works wonderfully! You&#x27;ll be shocked at what it \\&quot;irrigates\\&quot; out from between your teeth. My dentist was pleased! My children used an oral irrigator years ago when they had braces...don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing today! Of course I splashed myself &amp; the mirror with water a few times...learn to use it over the kitchen sink. Very good buy!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, excellent products</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great for travel.  My son is using it daily and really enjoys the massage of the water.  It is a lot easier to use and keep clean, than the full size water pik.</li>
            <li> Loved it enough I bought a second.</li>
            <li> I own two but the first one still hasnt worn out yet!  I ignore the manuf advice and use Eneloop rechargable batteries in it.  It gets used several times a day, EVERY day, and works great.  Unless you enjoy the dentists chair, by all means get one for everyone in your family and coerce, bribe, and threaten them to use it as this thing cleans better then any toothbrush could ever do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to take while traveling. It&#x27;s so great I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Like getting stuff out between my teeth</li>
            <li> Product works amazing! The only down part is that it can get a bit messy. So I would recommend using in the shower without getting the entire gadget soaked. When I say messy I mean water flying all over the place. The flosser is pretty strong! Doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums though.</li>
            <li> I read every review and based on the price,I got this one.it gives plenty of pressure and about one full does the whole mouth.I have a couple of bridges and crowns ,so this is perfect///and great for travel! folds up...well designed.</li>
            <li> So far this works better and is more convenient than the 2 Water Pik products I bought.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Love this product. My mouth always feels fresher and cleaner. I use a combo of water and mouthwash to rinse.</li>
            <li> Prefer this to the typical water floss that has an open tank.  I worry that this doesn&#x27;t dry very thoroughly between uses though...</li>
            <li> I prefer the somewhat more compact form factor of my ten-year old Panasonic which finally died, but this does the job.  Hope it is as rugged.</li>
            <li> This did not last more than a few months which was quite disappointing  to me.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for travel.  No complaints whatsoever.  I am considering using it as a replacement for my water pik when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> best purchase yet. i love this product. it really gets into every crevice. it&#x27;s easy to carry and not too heavy. i share the same prophylaxis bag with my cybersonic. i will order another to take with me rather than just having one.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Oral  irrigator works perfect.  It is nothing like any of the other oral irrigator&#x27;s and that&#x27;s the main reason that I bought it.  It lasted 3 1/2 years and that was with being dragged all over the country and using it twice a day.  It just died and I will be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> This product does not perform nearly as well as my Waterpik but is OK for travel.  It is compact and fits well into toiletry kit.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these......... Don&#x27;t ask me why I ordered the second one.&lt;br /&gt;They both stopped working just after the available return date for a credit.&lt;br /&gt;Just annoying............</li>
            <li> Good cleaner, got the other one on the market and this is much better.&lt;br /&gt;Could ad a little texture to the switch but smooth is easier to clean.</li>
            <li> very good! work as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at home and on the road. I got two of them. Still using the first one for over one year now.</li>
            <li> its okay, still works,</li>
            <li> works as advertised, gets stuff that floss can&#x27;t.  buy it especially for back molars</li>
            <li> Batteries died quickly, not very powerful</li>
            <li> I love this battery-operated irrigator!  Works great, holds a lot of water, and is easy to fill.  It collapses into a super compact size for travel.  Before this one, I used a rechargeable waterpik for 3 months before it crapped out and stopped holding a charge.  This one has a much smarter design, no additional accessories needed.  And the best part is, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it dying on me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks for years, but have had battery issues (rechargeable) with every one I&#x27;ve purchased.  I also wanted something smaller and portable for travel.  The Panasonic fits the bill.  Regular batteries, good  power and closes up nicely to a travel size.  .</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Best on the market.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about a month and then went belly up.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say I love it. I do love the idea but it runs on batteries and they don&#x27;t last so it&#x27;s basically a waste of money and resources! Bummer! Wish it plugged in or had rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> This product is inadequate to clean gums and between teeth amd it is doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to get the job done with jist one fill of the reservoir. Wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it</li>
            <li> If you need a reliable irrigator for travel or temporary use, this one is a perfect choice. Simple, durable, powerful, &amp; EZ to use.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:df6342abcdccbcb00e4d03574fb21403]] This is just perfect for travel and also using it for around the house where portability is needed. It works really well and holds enough water for one long water floss. The stream is quite good and has two speeds (I recommend the slower speed for kids and the faster one for adults). The battery (requires 2 AA, a very common battery) lasts a long time (about one full month with multiple daily uses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is very well thought out and you can disassemble and reassemble quickly to either take on trips or to clean periodically with a vinegar solution, which works well. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This system is the greatest way of cleaning between your teeth without having to use complicated and messy floss&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the worst water pic, and it gets dirty inside.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all.  I would love to get my money back!</li>
            <li> I really liked it but it only lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li> Have been using daily for not quite two months yet and the nozzle broke off and cannot be reconnected. I would have expected at least 6+ months of usage. While it was working it was a great product!</li>
            <li> Better than the water pik portable.</li>
            <li> It works well. It makes a bit of a mess, and it sucks battery life fairly quickly, but my teeth and gums do feel cleaner and healthier</li>
            <li> My origional one was &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; in the hospital. So, I immediately ordered a new one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as I love my Panasonic water pick, and when I travel, it always is packed and usEd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wherever I am  :-)</li>
            <li> A good product, given the current options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of overall power, I prefer the Waterpik. However, the rechargeable battery on the Waterpik gets less powerful over time, and only seems to last about 4 months before I&#x27;m forced to toss it and buy another device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic has the same problem, but I can just replace the batteries. I&#x27;ve had one for several years now.</li>
            <li> This is a nice device but the water jett force is weak. I installed  brand new batteries and after few days of use the pressure of the water jet goes down significantly.</li>
            <li> G r e a t! It&#x27;s so convenient It&#x27;s Small but have enough power to clean your inner mouth. Take this</li>
            <li> At first I had a little strange feeling when I used this irrigator, but now I very like it: it is small, power and really works!</li>
            <li> Works well . Fits well in the hand hold just enough water and has good pressure.  Puts away well and good for travel.</li>
            <li> Asked my Dentist about a product that would take my Oral Hygene to the next level. He suggested an oral irrigator. Choose this Panasonic battery powered one for its reputation (Panasonic namebrand rocks) and portability. The thing works! Pushed out a corn-on-the-cob fragment AFTER brushing, flossing, and gum stimulating the very first evening! Very convincing. Added cleaning gave me very kissable breath in the morning. Yeah!</li>
            <li> As a portable travel device, it is fine. It won&#x27;t do for regular use, because the reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to clean all teeth at the high pressure setting.  For regular use, I prefer my Water Pik Ultra countertop unit.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the batteries last about couple weeks only.   I wish it had other tips in addition to the one that comes with it.</li>
            <li> i am a dental hygienist and I love this product!  It is easy to use and does not take up much space.  I recommend it often to patients and friends!</li>
            <li> After wasting my time getting the WP 450, and returning it for no pressure to speak of, I bought this product. It is vastly superior to the WP cordless model. Decent power for my needs. Not a \\&quot;toy\\&quot; like the WP model. And this one is a lot less expensive, and has no charger to worry about. You just replace the batteries once in a while. Excellent product. IMHO.</li>
            <li> For a portable oral irrigator, this item gets the job done. I have had this for over a year. As an adult with braces, it is a necessity to get food out of my teeth, especially at work. This is small enough to carry in my purse and was very helpful when I first got my braces and was very self conscious, particularly in situations when eating out.  The batteries last a fairly long time and I like the fact that the attachment stores right inside the item while it&#x27;s collapsed. I even took this item with me on a trip last summer to Europe - it was nice not having to have another appliance to plug in.</li>
            <li> I owned and used the old Panasonic Oral Irrigator for two or three years and I used it until it stopped working.  I have teeth that have gaps between them and teeth that are too tight that won&#x27;t let me floss between them.  The Oral Irrigator takes care of all that and I use it everytime I brush my teeth.  This new version has two speeds and a new replaceable nozzle.  The trick to using an oral irrigator is to place it in your mouth before you turn it on and keep it in your mouth until you turn it off. I guarantee that your dentist will love your teeth if you use this product or one like it!</li>
            <li> Panasonic has made good electronics for years and this one is no different.   Compact, good size reservoir and not one (1) but two (2) speeds.   Though some might down it for the need for batteries I look at this way; no need for ANOTHER transformer/charger.   We&#x27;ll see how it lasts in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made all year.  It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, easy to store and works extremely well for my problems with my gums.  I would highly recommend the Panasonic Irrigator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this waterpik for 7 months and I really like it. I did my research before purchasing. Many people seemed to like this waterpik over others. So far it has lived up to the hype. It&#x27;s easy to use and it gets out food particles from between my teeth. The price is great,you can easily travel with it,and you&#x27;ll be left with healthier teeth. I strongly recommend this waterpik.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0027LSEPS Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A]]    The product advertises a 40-second run-time after fill-up. However, the run-time is closer to 20-seconds.    The water pressure is extremely weak or low, due to a portable battery energy source. Thus, the cleaning is ineffective. I have had the original WaterPik, which plugs into the wall, and it is much more useful.    Due to these issues, I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective oral irrigation product. I would, however, recommend the original non-portable WaterPik that uses an electric wall socket for power.</li>
            <li> Feels better than the Philips Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Airfloss which releases jets of waters in successive bursts, the Panasonic releases a constant stream of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both and the Panasonic gives a cleaner feeling. Being powered by normal batteries is a great plus for travelling (no need to bring chargers)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an oral irrigator for years and have tried many different models.  I thought this might be a good model to use when I travel, but it leaks.  Once it is used and has residual water in it, when it&#x27;s closed, it leaks.  That didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking for battery-operated, the other models I&#x27;ve used are all charged with an AC plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this one if you don&#x27;t need a battery-powered model: Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator with High Capacity Water Tank by ToiletTree Products. 2nd Generation Version. (Black)</li>
            <li> The Oral Irrigator is comptact and handy.However the tank is not large enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I decided to place a repeated order from my family.I found the unit price was increased from USD24.73 (with coupon) to 29.73(with coupon). It is funny that an open-box item in Amazon&#x27;s warehouse deal was also increased  to USD33.85,which is much higher than a brand new item(USD29.73 with coupon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon and was told that it is their price management.&lt;br /&gt;If an open-box item sells at a much higher price than that of a brand new item, Amazon warehouse is misleading  customers.</li>
            <li> This irrigator works very well, is light and compact and portable, and the batteries last me about a month, which is reasonable.  BUT, it can&#x27;t be taken apart to clean inside, so a lot of gunk gets deposited inside and is quite visible through the clear plastic, it feels most unsanitary to me!  I clean it out by swishing detergent and running it with detergent in it, and then desinfecting it with diluted Listerine about once a week.</li>
            <li> After 2 1/2 yrs., this Panasonic Oral Irrigator quit working.  The batteries never lasted very long and the pulsating just got weaker and weaker with time.  I kept it clean and handled it carefully, as I do.  I liked being able to travel with it....very handy size.  Today it died completely.  Ok, it didn&#x27;t cost a fortune, but I did expect it to last a bit longer.  Amazon is my &#x27;store&#x27; of choice.  Maybe they will send me a free replacement?</li>
            <li> Really love this.  It is so easy to use and pack up and take with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased ....because I love this item. This is a great because you don&#x27;t have to mess with a cord. I have not had to replace batteries yet after many, many daily uses. The power of the water that shoots out is very good. Not to strong to hurt your gums but strong enough to get food out and massage the gums. Like flossing you have a healthier mouth after using. I sometimes add a little mouthwash in the water to give a fresher feeling to my mouth. Great for travel because the design is geared for it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> able to get rid of the plague in between my teeth&lt;br /&gt;getting rid of the plague made my gums healthier</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I am thrilled with this product. At first I found it hard to use without spraying water everywhere, but I have learned now how to use it. The trouble is you have to keep your lips almost shut and do the whole cleaning by feel only. The other problem is one container of water is not enough for me and it is annoying to have to refill it. I don&#x27;t honestly feel it is making any great difference to my oral hygiene which is disappointing as I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> This had more power than the older  model my wife uses.  I would rate 5 star if it were a little less bulky.  It works well.  I use Sanyo eneloop batteries based on an earlier user&#x27;s comment.</li>
            <li> This works really well and love that I can take it when traveling. Can be taken apart to clean it. The resevoir is large enough to irrigate my entire mouth. Getting an extra since like it so much!</li>
            <li> Works great; easy to use with a little practice so you don&#x27;t squirt yourself. Does the job well; I&#x27;m a dentist and I bought it when my water pic broke(they don&#x27;t make them anymore.</li>
            <li> Glad to see than dentists are recommending the use of these again.  Used to use Water Pik years ago but hated the ugly thing sitting on the bathroom counter.  The Panasonic Oral Irrigator is perfect! It works great and collapses down for travel and storage (ya can&#x27;t do that with those big machines). I refill the tank twice each use and the tip rotates making it easy to direct. It uses 2 AA batteries and is plenty of power. For under $30, even if it has to be replaced in a year, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> My portable Waterpick lasted about 9 months before the battery began to fail.  At that time I need to charge it more and more often until I gave up on it and purchased the Panasonic Ew-DJ10-A.  Since the batteries are replaceable I should never have this problem.  Construction seems to be well thought out.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few months and am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> seems like a good product,  works as described,  like the battery operation a bunch better than the corded models !!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy about the Panasonic Oral Irrigator unit. But it does do the job and very well. It really flushes all debris from your gums and teeth. I also like the fact that it is portable and easy to pack and travel with.</li>
            <li> I have braces and needed a water floss to remove particles from them.  It does a good job for that.  I don&#x27;t have any other product to compare them to because this is my first oral irrigator. It has been great for my personal use.</li>
            <li> works fine, wish a bit cheaper</li>
            <li> Panasonic products have never disappointed. Their oral irrigator is no exception. I like the portability of it. You don&#x27;t need to keep it plugged in and one tank of water lasts about 40 seconds. I wish that it would include a travel case.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas present, having owned one for several years now.  Portable!  A great product!  Amazon&#x27;s exemplary service, a given!</li>
            <li> Works great. Better than expected. I read they don&#x27;t recommend rechargeable batteries, but I&#x27;m going to try anyway. Overall, very nice design and it&#x27;s pretty powerful - better than simply flossing!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts long (I only replaced it once in 6 months of almost daily use), gets what regular string floss doesn&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> Does a great job! This thing is almost perfect! It gets junk from between my teeth even after I&#x27;ve brushed and flossed. I use the lower pressure setting because it has such great pressure. People who are complaining about the unit growing mold must not know that the reservoir pulls off of the top part. I take it apart and air dry it every night. No problems with mold at all. Water pik is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> efficient travelling irrigator.  love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent irrigator! Bought this one for a back up and haven&#x27;t had to use it because the first one I bought is still going strong!</li>
            <li> Works great and runs on batteries, so easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> It does work to irrigate your gums as an added step after brushing and/or flossing. It has a short squirt-time because the reservoir is small -- so you fill it twice if you want. The main asset is convenience. It&#x27;s small footprint is welcome in a tight bathroom, and it will pack very well to travel. I had problems getting the battery case to open -- it is really tight and you need to lean into it while tuning with a coin. Still, the minor issues aren&#x27;t very problematic. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This product really hurt my gums after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> Love this. Fits in hand nicely, switch is in just the right spot. Like the high low feature.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement would be to make it a little lighter for travelers. I will also use this at home.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long the batteries last, so far 2 weeks with multiple daily uses.&lt;br /&gt;Before I travel I will insert new batteries.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace and oral B portable irrigator (not enough room on bathroom counter top for the bigger one).  Unfortunately, the pressure is not as good and it leaks all over the counter if you fill it and stand it up while waiting to use it.  i am not returning it, but have purchased another oral B for daily use.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that I&#x27;m still practicing with it, and soaking the whole bathroom. Otherwise, I like it - it provides that wonderful fresh feeling that I only got in the dentist&#x27;s chair up until now.</li>
            <li> This is a tremendous value. The marketplace has so many expensive, high-end models to choose from that this product doesn&#x27;t garner the attention it deserves. It does an excellent job blasting away debris between my teeth, offers two pressure settings for those with and without sensitive gums, and is small enough to be bring on over-nights and vacations. The small compartment that houses the nozzle when collapsed and not in use is a clever idea that will ensure it never goes missing. I also enjoy that it&#x27;s battery operated. I always have spare batteries on me (either in my house or car), so there won&#x27;t be any cases of poor timing when I want to use it but it&#x27;s not charged. And although it warns against the use of any liquid besides water, I prefer to mix a cap-full or two of mouthwash in as well for additional advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one inherent drawback is the bulkiness of the device in your hand. Because the tank is hosted within the handheld, it will take a few uses before becoming accustomed to holding it comfortably and learning how to best maneuver it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many positive reviews of this product before I purchased and it met all of my expectations. I highly recommend this tool for everyone trying to take better care of their teeth and gums, but especially for those unwilling or unable to invest in the less cost-effective alternatives.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the rechargeable one I had.  It took me about a week to pry open the battery cover.  Now it&#x27;s running weak after just a few months of use so I see I will have to be switching out batteries a lot.  I will keep my eye open for something better in the future.  This one will do for now.</li>
            <li> Great product, just wish it had a battery indicator and tha it holds more water!!! Still recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I just love this thing. No batteries &#x3D; no cables &#x3D; awesome. It&#x27;s amazing how much you can get out of your teeth even after a good flossing!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love it!  My husband has one and I purchased my teenage grandson one for his braces.  It&#x27;s a number one hit for all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is portable, runs on two AA batteries and I highly recommend it. I would definitely  purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great price. Works well but the battery drains fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a few problems popping up with my teeth, that said, I pulled out my ancient WaterPik that was messy and user-UNfriendly but still worked. I tried this to keep my sanity intact. Couldn&#x27;t see forking out a lot of $$ for a new big klunky WaterPik. This model is very user-friendly, and just plain old works. Easy, Easy, Easy! Love, going to buy another for the downstairs bathroom. Wish it came with 2nd tip though! And you do need a nickel to open up the battery door.</li>
            <li> A very nice product I used to replace my moldy water pik.  It works great and does a wonderful job to remove food stuck between braces.</li>
            <li> Waterproof, battery operated, easy to operate, strong irrigation.  You just need to change batteries often, but hey, it&#x27;s the best in the shower anyway - having the corded one would just be too crazy at the sink - especially when trying to get the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for nearly a year and I&#x27;m really happy with it. I&#x27;m a terrible flosser so I figured this would help fill in the gaps with my flossing. I use it about 3 times a week and haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet, which is pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made me choose this over the Waterpik or a product similar to this is the size. It&#x27;s very compact. I live in a small apartment with no counter space so any of those products with a reservoir wouldn&#x27;t have worked for me. This shrinks to a size that fits in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that the pressure isn&#x27;t super strong. I feel like there could be an additional level added onto it with a bit more power. Otherwise I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> this works great as a portable water pick.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that just turned out to be a great success. It was a little awkward. It also was rather messy to use. It ended up under the bathroom sink we&#x27;re headed back for a long time. Would not recommend. Perhaps we were just not diligent enough with this</li>
            <li> Excellent tool if you have bridge work and cannot get between teeth, also strengthens gums. Bought this for my wife and she doesn&#x27;t want to be without it. This is our second one so she can keep one in our camper when we travel.</li>
            <li> Operates on AA batteries, simple and does it&#x27;s job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good and cheap product from panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could have included more nozzles though.</li>
            <li> As an adult I have bracers now, since I can afford them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want one of those old water piks where you have to set them up, fill a big container, and they take up counter space. I was skeptical about this but I must say it works, and works very well. Nothing removes the debris from bracers (and teeth) like this, and it is compact and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The water container folds up into the device, which is very small when self contained.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower since the spray can get the bathroom counter soaked. It works well. I use the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Four years and it is still working.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Completely satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My old water pik started leaking into the battery case so I purchased the Panasonic Oral Irrigator on Amazon. I was very pleased with the speed of delivery. The irrigator came with two AA batteries and is very compact. But the size does not affect the performance except in a good way. This item puts out a pulse of water with a lot of pressure. I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure why I purchased this. It was an &amp;#34;oh I want to try this&amp;#34; type of thing but I can say I&#x27;m glad I did. After comparing several different types I decided on this one because of it&#x27;s compact size and being cordless. It doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space but is still pretty strong for its relatively small size. The battery pack slides into the water reservoir so it ends up being about half the size. I use this in addition to flossing and find that it gets to the back teeth better than you ever could manually. It may take your gums some getting used to but after a couple of weeks of consistent use I find it to be strong without being painful and I have sensitive gums. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or bleeding and also leaves your breath fresher for longer. A word of caution though, don&#x27;t stand the same way you would while brushing your teeth. The splash is amazing. The first time I used it it ended up all over my mirror and the walls. It wasn&#x27;t one of my brightest moments. If you lean forward over the sink and cup your hand over the top of  your mouth you can use it easily and quickly if you don&#x27;t have the time or desire to use it while showering. I am definitely pleased with this and would purchase another should anything ever happen to this one.</li>
            <li> Still using it over a year later.</li>
            <li> This the second one of these that has broken within six months.  Just not worth the money for something that breaks so easily,</li>
            <li> A little weird for me, but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> The only con I have is that the batteries don&#x27;t last long in this thing. Maybe I should be taking them out after every use? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I always ensure I have a couple of extra to use on the go and also pack.  I&#x27;ve ordered and used these for over 4 years.  Haven&#x27;t found anything easier.  I put my mouthwash in for the liquid which kills germs below the gum line.</li>
            <li> Does the job  but requires 3 refills per flossing. Small however so a trade off versus larger counter models.</li>
            <li> A wonderful piece of devise, highly recommendede</li>
            <li> Works well with fresh batteries.  However, runs through batteries pretty quickly, so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is an okay irrigator.It does what it is supposed to. Period. It is a MUST to clean it Often!! If you don&#x27;t you will get gunk built up &amp; it can be Really Very Gross. You Must make sure to leave the cap open when not in use or you can get mildew buildup in there. I use rechargeable batteries in mine. I really don&#x27;t use mine out of my home. Tried it several times but it is just too messy to carry in my purse. When this oral irrigator dies I plan to look into a different one....</li>
            <li> I only have room for a small machine so first I tried the single speed Panasonic Oral Irrigator which was OK. It lasted about 2 years &amp; then I got a Waterpik Waterflosser. This was a waste of money. It&#x27;s rechargeable, but over about 4 months it held less &amp; less charge until it barely worked.&lt;br /&gt;This 2-speed Panasonic Oral Irrigator is the closest I&#x27;ve found to a full size Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Compact and effective.  Don&#x27;t let the size fool you. This unit has a nifty motor that pumps at a powerful but comfortable rate.</li>
            <li> Great portable machine with right amount of spray pressure and size.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really great stuff, but I still not really used to it. However, I like it. It&#x27;s good for teeth!!</li>
            <li> I was using a Water Pic and hated the way the tubing wore out and it dripped and sprayed all over the place, so this was worth a try in that it is rather inexpensive.  The spray is not forceful enough to really do the job and the batteries need to be replaced often. It would be worth the cost if it were just a bit more powerful</li>
            <li> works well with granddaughters&#x27; braces</li>
            <li> No charger, only batteries! Serious feature lacking in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;I would love a travel size irrigator, however, I don&#x27;t like the hassle of buying/changing batteries. Give me a charger!</li>
            <li> I have bought this item twice. Once in August 2010 and again in August 2011.  The first one lasted 1 year and the 2nd one 3 years.  I use it when I travel so I&#x27;d say about 4 weeks per year.  Overall the product is good, but the durability leaves something to be desired. When I&#x27;m at home I use a more powerful, plugged in WaterPik, to rinse out the gunk between my teeth.  The Panasonic is battery operated and not quite as powerful but certainly helpful when on the road.  It is also more portable as it is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that is lasted longer and that I knew of a way to clean out the grime.  My first one stopped working after about 1 hour of use and the last one after about 3 hours of use (over 3 years).  I&amp;#34;m sure it&#x27;s possible to clean it with bleach or something, but I didn&#x27;t want to leave any residue in the water compartment that may end up in my system.  It does get a little gross after a bit of time.&lt;br /&gt;Decent product overall, and probably decent value as it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li> I like this flosser.  I hate flossing and the DDS is always all over my case to do it, so I got one of these.  It is kind of forceful when the batteries are fresh but there is a lower speed you can use then.  Batteries last a month with once a day use. I is a little hard to turn off when you are done and your hands are wet.  It is a bit messy if you don&#x27;t keep it and your arms over the sink, the water can run off your elbow onto the floor.  I think it does a good job and gets out stuff regular flossing and brushing might miss.  At least the DDS has gotten off my case about flossing so he must see a difference or maybe just gave up.  LOL</li>
            <li> We now have two (2) in our family!  They work great. They are reasonably priced to be competitive with water pic (methinks), and the quality is above average for sure!</li>
            <li> A very good product, teeth and gums are well protected，I think I will introduce a friend to buy, share the good stuff</li>
            <li> Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A very good product. Does exactly what its advertising says about it. Suggest others try it out and see for themselves.</li>
            <li> HARD  TO HOLD while  using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s battery operated and gives good pulses of water. Have dropped it once on the bathroom floor and nothing broke. A nice alternative to flossing.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It&#x27;s battery operated.  It can travel.  It does the job it&#x27;s meant to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the latch is flimsey and broke so I must purchase a new unit.  The fact that I did so speaks to the product&#x27;s utility and reasonable cost.  If it happens again, the product will need to be downgraded.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Much more comfortable and miles less noisy than the Waterpick that sounds like a sledge-hummer next to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this product. Haven&#x27;t had it very long, but already can see a difference in my oral health. It makes my mouth feel so clean, and does a great job of getting in the hard to reach areas of my mouth. The stream of water is definitely strong enough for me, and I love the fact that it is portable, and small enough to fit in a purse or overnight bag without having to take apart a large machine. It takes up very little space on my bathroom counter, and holds enough water to do a very thorough cleaning job. Love!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those that travel abroad a lot. It&#x27;s very compact when collapsed down. I don&#x27;t have to worry about using voltage converters when I&#x27;m abroad, since AA batteries can be bought everywhere. It does use up battery power quite fast as it noticeably gets weaker after about a week. This only becomes a problem if you have very tight spaces between teeth which require the maximum power to get trapped stuff out. And you gotta leave it in a well ventilated area for it to dry or else you can get nasty mold or orange gunk growing on your irrigator.</li>
            <li> This is my very first oral irrigator.  I purchased this after having a dental bridge placed in my mouth.  It works well.  There is a learning curve with the spray.</li>
            <li> 9/5/14 just took it out of the box. In it&#x27;s closed up mode it reminds me of the size of those slender &amp;#34;ENERGY DRINKS&amp;#34; cans.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reviewing from a mature woman&#x27;s perspective.  You&#x27;ll need scissors because it comes with the 2 batteries (nice perk)..and they are shrunk wrapped. Then to put the batteries in place you need something with width because you need to turn this nickle size white plastic screw on top to the word &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;.  After using several women &amp;#34;thingamagigs&amp;#34; I went and got hubby&#x27;s flat head screw driver and 1 stern twist and we have lift off.  I inserted the batteries and replaced the screw thingy.&lt;br /&gt;Went to the kitchen sink area to test out my &amp;#34;dentistry&amp;#34; skills.  FILLING was a matter of flipping open the tab, (you&#x27;ll see it) and running&lt;br /&gt;some water into it...I used luke water as suggested, so as not to have a first time shock.  It takes 3 seconds of water intake to fill it, hence the 40 SECONDS OF RUN TIME. So i proceeded to test out my &amp;#34;dentistry skills&amp;#34;.  Well it wasn&#x27;t in my mouth all the way or a good angle, and my left ear got a nice irrigation.  (TIP: HAVE TOWELS HANDY and HAIR IN TURBAN).  The reviews asking about the noise is meaningless as it only runs for 40 Seconds.  By the time I was done with 3 refills to work on techniques, my ear, hair on left side, and kitchen cabinets needed a wipe down. Oh, it has a low/high water pressure switch and adequate instructions and pictures...yeah!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll master this enough, and it&#x27;s several months before my next cleaning at the dentist, so I&#x27;ll update again.  Good Luck :)</li>
            <li> Better than using the old flossing string. I made a mess the first time I used it because I didn&#x27;t aim correctly and water went every where. I have to say practice makes perfect and my teeth are super clean and white. I use to worry about my breath and use the strips etc, but not anymore because this definitely keeps your mouth clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price, super fast delivery.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> A good attempt but some things just are not destined to be portable. I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;It is too bulky to comfortably handle in-use. It pumps with enough force to work as a flosser but runs through batteries quickly (one session, in my case). The reservoir emptied quickly, also, but really couldn&#x27;t be any bigger and still be portable. It is very messy but that may lessen with practice.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering &amp; shipping was quick and easy as I expect with Amazon.</li>
            <li> useful as additional dental appliance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda satisfy :-)</li>
            <li> This the second Panasonic Oral Irrigator I have owned. I like it better than other irrigators I have owned  because I does as good a job at cleaning and spews less water around than they do.</li>
            <li> works great, portable, easy to use, no cord!</li>
            <li> does the job. small, compare to other waterpiks.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought this.  Strong flow only when batteries are fresh. Mouth never feels clean. Difficult to drain for cleaning. Manual floss is better by far excoet for the strands breaking all the time. But I&#x27;d put up with that again.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a while, but has a noticeable drop in pressure fairly quickly.  Cycling rechargeable batteries might help.</li>
            <li> but it is still some defections compared with home use flosser like waterpic. The contain is too small. You have to keep one posture or it won&#x27;t spring water at all. However I like it.</li>
            <li> I use it for travel and it works great.</li>
            <li> You can brush your teeth, floss, rinse and then use this tool to remove quite a bit more food stuffs. I was surprised to find out there was so much more crud/leftover food bits in my mouth.  You have to use it at a certain angle, but the tip is adjustable(it twists). Depending upon how long it lasts, I&#x27;d buy another one.</li>
            <li> Light weight,easy to use, reliable.  Not quite as forceful as a sink top model.</li>
            <li> addictive better than flossing!</li>
            <li> I loved it, It was very useful.Thank!</li>
            <li> Excellent travel companion. The repalcement tip is hard to get and expensive.  Therwise it will have a5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts quite awhile with lithium batteries. Don&#x27;t ever drop it though---the tip breaks off easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this when i travel. This is powerful flosser. easey to store and clean. I think it cleans better than my water pik i have.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 yr old son who has braces and its alot easier for him to use than floss. He&#x27;s found his own technique to use it so that there isn&#x27;t water squirting everywhere. We hope the orthodontics people think its working too. As its battery operated we can take it away with us. I like it.</li>
            <li> I have tried to open the battery cover, but I just couldn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t seem to move at all. Anyone can help me?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I must say that I really enjoy using my Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  After reading all the reviews I found myself anticipating the arrival, which was less than 7 days.  A litle messy at first until I got use to it but now I&#x27;m an old pro.  Neitherless to say, this is a great find!!</li>
            <li> The oral irrigator has very good water pressure and less bulky than others I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s compact and great for travel.</li>
            <li> The directions say don&#x27;t use rechargeable batteries, and they mean it. Rechargeable NiMH (Nickel metal hydride) batteries put out 1.2 volts per cell, compared to 1.5 volts for alkaline throwaways. With the rechargeables, the irrigator does pump water, but it&#x27;s too weak to do much good. I&#x27;m getting about 15 to 20 uses out of a set of throwaways. At that point, the irrigator is still working but getting pretty weak. (The batteries still have enough juice to power a LED flashlight.) I think Panasonic could add a voltage regulator circuit that would enable you to use rechargeables and would extend the life of throwaways. That would increase the price, no doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the need to use throwaway batteries, I&#x27;m satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> I needed a waterpic under the recommendation of my dentist.  I order the Panasonic, because it was battery operated.  I had read  horror stories about the rechargable batteries not working afer a couple of months on other units.  This product works great.  It is compact and is very easy to operate.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the amount of water the pick holds, just enough to get a good clean. Love that it folds up so I can travel with it easily.  Not a great fan of the operating button.  It is a bit shallow, and hard to push on with one finger.  But, bottom line, I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Generally good product. Be aware of the location of the switch where it is before flossing.  The switch is slippery when it is on and off. I think push on off button is better to use it.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with regular flossing: bleeding gums; minor irritation. Water flossing massages the area around a weak tooth and leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Panasonic over the years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oral irrigator because it was the only one that could be used in the shower.  All of the other irrigators have ports for the rechargable battery that could get wet.  I love it!  It is very easy to use and collapses for travel.  Because of its size, I do have to refill the water reservoir once during cleaning, but its not a big deal and only takes a few seconds.  I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all!</li>
            <li> This product works well for the price.  I was surprised actually that it had such good power and it&#x27;s easy to use and has two speeds. I like it also because it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my bathroom.  I don&#x27;t use it every day and if you don&#x27;t use it a lot you have to remove the batteries.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a waterpik rechargeable version of this product and after about 3-4 months the battery stopped holding a charge. This model seems much better built, becomes compact for traveling (even protecting the tip) and runs on rechargeable or alkaline batteries, which can be purchased anywhere. For a travel product, Panasonic seems to have hit a sweet spot. Should this one die, I won&#x27;t think twice about buying it again-there just isn&#x27;t any competition at this time. If you want it for home only, you might be better with something you plug in; for travel/home use, don&#x27;t bother trying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;Despite the instructions saying not to use rechargeable batteries, I&#x27;ve been using quality NiMH (eneloops) for a week with no appreciable loss of power. While they don&#x27;t have the initial \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; of alkaline&#x27;s, after about 4 uses, the alkaline loses its advantage and runs at the same level of the NiMH. So I will continue using my eneloops. I would caution you though, they didn&#x27;t last long with my energizer rechargeables.</li>
            <li> I like this product - it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, as long as you have fresh batteries in it.  I tried rechargeables, but they weren&#x27;t powerful enough.  Perhaps I need new rechargeable batteries as the ones I used have been around a while.  However, when I use fresh disposable batteries, I only experience optimal performance a few times before it turns into the \\&quot;little oral irrigator that could.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like having it - it&#x27;s amazing how it gets out what brushing and flossing can&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m really hoping Santa brings me a more powerful RECHARGEABLE oral irrigator this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Much better design than competitor.  More compact, easier to dry after use, batteries can be replaced, easier to fill water container.  I think it is great for a portable cordless unit.  I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> Very well designed and compact. Plenty powerful for travel and easy to keep clean. I highly recommend this product for anyone that travels.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve really liked our Panasonic &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; for several years, but this replacement doesn&#x27;t seem as good as our old blue one. It&#x27;s still a good product, but water jet not as strong. We&#x27;ll keep it, just wished it was the same as the older one.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth oral irrigator, three Panasonic and one different brand. The Panasonic lasts longer with better pressure than the other brand. The Panasonic is also easier on the batteries.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing.  Does the job well.  Got it on a lightning deal.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> good enough for travel, a bit awkward to hold because it&#x27;s bulky.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the structure and function of this item. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I can easily take this to the gym and do my teeth in the shower. My dentist has me doing the Waterpik thing, so I trust that it is a good idea.</li>
            <li> Great product and a great vendor</li>
            <li> Bought the Panasonic Oral irrigator in December 2011 from Amazon and it stopped working July 2012. Although the product has a two-year warranty, sadly, it only lasted 7 months.  It was a good care product after brushing and flossing but just didn&#x27;t have any staying power.  Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/12: Although it took quite a while, once I actually reached the Panasonic Customer Service Department, they replaced my irrigator with a new one.  It is a great tool for dental health so I added a star.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is great. It&#x27;s compact enough to be carried while traveling. The water reservoir holds enough water to irrigate one side of my teeth (so total cleaning will need 4 refills) which is acceptable. It has 2 power setting, and I normally use the low power, should be enough for normal usage. I&#x27;m buying another one for my wife.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product. Here&#x27;s my breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Nice and compact when it is folded up&lt;br /&gt;- Fully waterproof, good for use in the shower (may be a good place to use this as you can make a mess with the water pouring out of your mouth over the sink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Wish the reservoir held a bit more water but this would detract from how compact it is&lt;br /&gt;- Wish it had a third pressure setting. 2 is good, but one more a bit higher would be nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I researched air &amp; water-based electronic flossers, because I recently attained orthodontic braces. I finally decided on this one &amp; I am quite pleased. It provides strong bursts of water into hard-to-reach spots, &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any problems with gum irritation. However, regular dental floss is still necessary, because it doesn&#x27;t remove the plaque that has built up throughout the day, when I use this after brushing. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s convenient, the tank is the appropriate size to use on my entire mouth without refilling. I prefer using it while in the shower, because it can get messy since the water is spraying at a moderately quick and powerful level. I have only had it few weeks, so I can&#x27;t comment on battery life, but as mentioned, I&#x27;ve been impressed with the power of the stream, so I won&#x27;t be too surprised if the batteries don&#x27;t last a long time. Overall, pleased with the purchase, and even my husband who doesn&#x27;t have braces has started using it, because it is quite refreshing. Love to add a little mouthwash to the water, but I may find that clogs the scope in the future as well.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how well I liked this, it is strong, but not too strong! It got stuff out of my gums and I think my dentist will be pleased. It is definitely a learning curve sprayed the bathroom mirror first time, and I don&#x27;t think it is a sharable item, we will be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is great at removing particles from between my teeth. Flossing hurts and often misses food. The irrigator gets everything...even when I think there is nothing to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums feel massaged every time I use it!  Rather than feeling assaulted like they do when I floss, the irrigator makes my gums feel good. I&#x27;m due for a dental appointment, I&#x27;m interested to see the results.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my very old and dirty Waterpik. I choose this Panasonic model because it has less footprint compared to the Waterpik, very portable and costs less than the other portable brands. It works great with a full charge but gets weak about near the second or third week of use (I use it once a day) Contrary to what the instructions tell you, I use a rechargeable battery and I find that this one is the only one that works for the unit: Duracell rechargeable preCharged AA/HR6/DX 1500 NiMH 1,2V /2000 mAh . I have another rechargeable Duracell battery but it does not work on it. I use it while in the shower but not directly under the spray, but I am sure it&#x27;s water proof. Be sure to clean the tank regularly too.</li>
            <li> catches dirt very easily. Need to clean it everyday.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy with it, is a very good one. is powerful and nice to handle it help me to keep tooth clean and shine</li>
            <li> After reading a number of reviews for oral irrigators, I settled on this Panasonic one.  Now, I have nothing to compare it to, but I love it!  I have had it for a year and it is working just fine.  I have rarely gone a night without using it because it leaves my mouth feeling so refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;  There are two speeds and after a few days I think most people will only use the higher one.  It is made just for water, and though I have read that others add mouthwash to it, I have been satisfied using just water and swishing with mouthwash separately.&lt;br /&gt;  The only downside is the battery life.  It requires two AA batteries which work at their maximum potential for about two weeks.  After that, you get medium potential for a while.  But,  I do like the product well enough to put up with it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> battery not rechargable..and only has good power with fresh batteries..otherwise i like it alot.</li>
            <li> this is awesome. I have a lot of problems with my teeth and was going on a trip to Europe and wanted something that was battery operated as we had enough things to plug in with computers, phones and cameras.</li>
            <li> I just received this recently.  Purchased it for an upcoming trip.  Did a trial run with it the other day and it works great!  There is plenty of pressure on the #1 speed for me.  Doubt I&#x27;d ever need to go the the second.  Noticed complaints that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for some people.  I do not find this to be a problem as I use a proxy brush, then floss, then use the water flosser so I only need a small amount of water to do the trick.  In my opinion, if they made the unit to hold more water, it would become too large for travel.  Think I&#x27;ll enjoy this a lot when I travel.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill, I use it in the shower. Maybe not quite as powerful as a corded if the batteries aren&#x27;t new and I wish it came with two heads. However for the price I paid on a gold box deal, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice unit. My only complaint is that the water runs out so quick...but it is, afterall, a travel Irrigator, so I kept 5 stars</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a portable water irrigator versus the countertop model. I also tried a shower model (you add it to your shower head and divert water to the irrigator--leaks unless you are a whiz with teflon tape. I&#x27;m not. And then I had to install a thing to mount it on the shower stall wall. Eh, too much trouble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just what I wanted. You load two Double-A batteries in the compartment underneath (opens with a coin.) You fill the blue part with lukewarm water by opening a little hinged door and simply running tap water into it. Then you put the nozzle in your mouth (first, lest you want to squirt up the mirror) and turn it on. Aim the nozzle around your gums and go. Very pleasant. There are two settings, low and high. Ultimately as you get used to the pressure, you&#x27;ll use high. It isn&#x27;t as strong as the countertop models unless you aim the stream directly into the gumline. But I was able to use the highest pressure immediately (maybe because I floss and use an electric brush.) It feels great and it gets the gunk out between your teeth and gums. Now, I&#x27;m wondering if there is a purse case for it, because I&#x27;d like to have it with me after lunch. I hate having food stuck in my teeth after I eat and you know, when you&#x27;re dealing with the public, spinach on your teeth is a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for convenience. Could have come with a spare tip, I think. A minor quibble.</li>
            <li> I love it. My teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Compact and effective.</li>
            <li> This worked well for the first couple months, but then it started leaking out the side during use.  Also, there was some odd suction action with the tank during use that would force the tank up as the water emptied, which forced the water to leak even more.</li>
            <li> Very slight difference from old model.. I have usedPanasonic for twenty or so years. It  used every day. Much better than any others on the market. If I don&#x27;t use it every day, gums start to give  trouble.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s great for travel.  It is not as powerful as a larger model but works very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Oral Irrigator for my son who has a small bathroom and does not have enough room for the Waterpik brand.  The Panasonic is very compact - the perfect size for a small bathroom or traveling.  I have tried it a couple of times and am quite impressed.  Ordinarily, I use the Waterpik which I really like. However, in comparison, I find the Panasonic Oral Irrigator to offer the same water irrigation speed as the WaterPik and to be equally effective with mouth/teeth irrigation.  While I did read one review that described the awkwardness of having to hold the entire Panasonic unit to use it, I did not find this to be true.  Actually, the stationary nozzle on the Panasonic is more flexible than my Waterpik nozzle with the hose, which is prone to curling and thus, difficult to maneuver.  You do have to make sure the Panasonic nozzle is in your mouth before you turn it on because it does not have a control switch like the WaterPik.  I like this Panasonic product and have already ordered a second one for my travels.</li>
            <li> For my home use this is a great product.  It is small it holds plenty of water for 1 bath and it folds up to be even smaller.  It irrigates well. Also great for traveling.</li>
            <li> wanted a travel waterpic but this one doesn&#x27;t have enough power.  Other wise it is OK.  The water holder isn&#x27;t very big but you can refill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this irrigator for about a month &amp; my mouth &amp; teeth have never felt so good. For over 10 years, I used the Waterpik Ultra Cordless &amp; was fed up replacing them about once every year &amp; 1/2 for approximately $45. The only improvement that I suggest is a more contoured shape.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a WaterPic whose battery died.  No way to replace and it was just outside the warranty period.  This product uses AA batteries which can be replaced and this product works far better.  Lighter and more portable because there is no power cord to carry around for re-charging. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> while it does the trick this model is a bit awkward to use without squirting water all over the bathroom. The on off button is in the wrong place. Otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have lots of trouble with food getting caught in my bridges between implants. I have my Waterpik at home but it drives me crazy when I travel and can&#x27;t take care of the food even with dental floss.  I read the reviews on travel Irrigators and this one rated the highest.  It lives up to expectations.  The only thing I would suggest - Panasonic should provide a travel bag with it.</li>
            <li> This is great !  It&#x27;s reasonably priced, battery operated and totally portable.  My dentist is as pleased as I am!</li>
            <li> The little door on the unit keeps falling off  Works fine, but the door to the tank keeps coming off  IF they could make it without that recurring it would be great product</li>
            <li> Good reliable product.  This is the second one I have had.  The only problem is that when using it, it is sometimes hard to find the on/off switch to turn it off.  I have used other brands and had reliability issues.  This is especially true of rechargeable battery models.</li>
            <li> i purchased this as a gift because i like mine so much. this is compact, EASY AND COMPACT FOR TRAVEL, and works well.</li>
            <li> I have had Panasonic irrigators since they were sold at Brookstone (or was it Sharper Image?) many years ago. Anyway this product is a big improvement over the last one I bought that didn&#x27;t work and I failed to return it within the return period. This one is working great. Amazing how much debris that it removes over brushing. I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive product which does the job well. If you don&#x27;t like flossing this is a great alternative and your gums will thank you (try adding a couple of drop of oregano oil to the plain water)... Your gums will thank you...4 out of 5 start is because one of the springs became lose after a year of use (this is why I am buying another one)</li>
            <li> Loved it so much, that had to get it as a gift for others and everyone loves it.  Takes a little bit of getting used to the handling at first because of all the squarting, but don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li> First oral irrigator I have used (so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others), but the product seems great. It&#x27;s easy to set-up and use. It&#x27;s not too bulky.</li>
            <li> If you are used to use waterpik irrigator, u can&#x27;t live without this when travelling. The size is not that small but it&#x27;s collapsible and pretty handy. The best thing that I like about this product is they use a normal AA battery so that you won&#x27;t run out of battery. Just buy a typical rechargeable batteries and have extras so that you won&#x27;t ever had it run out of &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34;. Taking stars out because the tip seems to be pretty fragile, they need to see how waterpik make theirs.</li>
            <li> This Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A is in a compact size and very handy to use. Only one drawback is the expensive accessories.</li>
            <li> I was not so sure before buying this product because it does not look so &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as some other counterparts. And it&#x27;s powered by 2 AA batteries(does not even have A/C adapter). However, after the first use of this product, I started to LOVE it! I cannot even stop me from using it very often. It does have many pros, such as:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smart and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use batteries, which is very portable and handy.&lt;br /&gt;3. Very comfortable when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it does have some cons too:&lt;br /&gt;1. Only 2 strength switches. For lots of people it&#x27;s ok, however I do need a tougher one when needed:-)&lt;br /&gt;2. Only batteries available. You cannot even buy an A/C adapter because it does not have one.&lt;br /&gt;3. The water tank is a little bit too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is an excellent product and I love it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was not that pleased with this item. I thought it would be a little better constructed for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> the best product ever, be carful when use it cuz it my make u bleed between ur teeths, thanx panasonic</li>
            <li> I use a water pik at home regularly, and wish I had some place to use a plug in unit at work, but I don&#x27;t.  I had hoped this portable solution would do the job, and for the basics it does, but with some drawbacks.  First of all, because of it&#x27;s small reservoir, you have to refill it several times to do your whole mouth.  Secondly, the water stream is moderate, but not what I would call strong.  If you like it strong as in number 10 on your plug in water pik, then this is more like number 4 at the most.  It is definitely better than not using one at all, but only if portable is all you can find room for; as in traveling and living out of a suitcase.</li>
            <li> small portable, and comes with a set of batteries.  Great for someone who needs counter space.  a a a a</li>
            <li> What a great product.  I purchased this irrigation system to assist with cleaning with my braces.  I just got braces at age 56 and I am so into flossing and cleaning my teeth, that I was going crazy trying to keep food out between my teeth.  This is great for after a meal or snack to help get rid of the  food particles between flossing.  It is easy to use, and small enough to take with you when you head out to dinner or to someone&#x27;s home for dinner.  This will be traveling with my on any trips.  It is a great value for the price, too.  I would recommend this even for your teens who are wearing braces.</li>
            <li> I use waterpik. It is nice product. The only problem is, every time I use it, I have to connect it to the electricity and it is a little bit bulky to carry. So I bought this item. The water pressure is not so strong as that of the waterpik. But Panasonic is battery powered, so it is tolerable. Except this problem, I have no complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase 3 of this product about 6 or 8 months ago and 2 of it not working,first I thought may be the batteries was low so I change it,but after replace new batteries stll not working.I &#x27;d like to know if there is a one year warranty on this product?&lt;br /&gt;Catherine</li>
            <li> Works well. Haven&#x27;t had any issues and I love the size. Definitely better than flossing. Would recommend for any one looking for an irrigator.</li>
            <li> For close on seven years, since I had dental implants inserted, which support both upper and lower arches of teeth, I have been using the Braun/Oral B brush and irrigator system. I seldom used the brush attachment, preferring a manual brush.  When the water pressure side of the system ceased to perform satisfactorily, I bought the Waterpik, which I have reviewed in that section.  There was no portable version of an irrigator available in Australia so - when travelling - I relied on a needle-less syringe to remove particles from under the bridges - a somewhat tedious exercise, as you might imagine, and only partially satisfactory.  (I do, of course use super-floss to clean implant posts and under bridges)&lt;br /&gt;It was while perusing Amazon for the Waterpik that I came across this little gem.The Panasonic irrigator seems the perfect travel-mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - It&#x27;s compact, light, and easily packable.&lt;br /&gt;  Strong jet&lt;br /&gt;  Top section stores in the water tank, along with the jet&lt;br /&gt;  Comfortable to hold when using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - As a previous view pointed out, the water cannot be completely emptied from the tank when packing.&lt;br /&gt;  Although  the tank appears clear of water, it should be placed in a sealed plastic bag when packing for&lt;br /&gt;  travelling  - not really a huge problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other have commented on the difficulty of filling the tank - Personally, I don&#x27;t find it a problem.&lt;br /&gt;A tank full of water doesn&#x27;t last for long but hey! The unit is meant for travelling and for that, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;There have been complaints about the unit failing after a short period of time and parts breaking; my unit is very new, but - if it lasts a reasonable length of time, I&#x27;ll just replace it - the unit isn&#x27;t covered by warranty in Australia and it&#x27;s cheap enough!&lt;br /&gt;In fact, providing it hasn&#x27;t broken down by the time I return from a forthcoming trip,(and because my bathroom bench space is limited)I&#x27;ll be storing my Waterpik for use if the Panasonic does break down and while waiting for a replacement!</li>
            <li> very useful water floss, comfortable and soft. It has 2 levels - you can start with 1 and move on to 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not great. The container for the water is smaller than expected. Sometimes I have to refill it. It&#x27;s convenient for travel since it runs on batteries.</li>
            <li> I have braces and purchased this irrigator to use while traveling the Australia. I considered this model because of the great reviews I saw online. The product exceeded my expectations. The two batteries that came with the unit lasted my entire 3 week trip! I used the unit one to two times a day. It was compact, easy to operate and performed wonderfully. I highly recommend this model over my last irrigator, the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W.</li>
            <li> I always pack this for any trip!  We travel a lot and it&#x27;s a great substitute for the one I use at home.</li>
            <li> Very good Oral Irrigator. It&#x27;s small, compact and powerful. Owners manual advises against using rechargable batteries but i have been using such batteries with no problems. OEM batteries died to quickly. All in all, its a great product and recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a water pick before so I was really glad to see how it worked.  It has greatly improved my dental care.</li>
            <li> Great DEAL OF THE DAY price!  Works okay, but will take some practice using... pumps water all over the place if you don&#x27;t watch what you are doing.</li>
            <li> This thing is great and fun to use. It blasts food out of your teeth -- and I was told it is &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than flossing. maybe it is better for your gums than flossing, but I tried flossing after using this and there was still some food in there! so this thing is great, but still think flossing is necessary (though maybe not every night??). I&#x27;m no dentist / hygienist!</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and have recommended it to many of my family and friends.  The best thing about the product is the fact that it is small enough to travel with. I do quite a bit of traveling and cannot imagine not have the irrigator with me.  It of course does a fantastic job in the irrigation department.  I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and when it gives out I purchase another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you.</li>
            <li> First Dental Check up confirmed my review! I have a permanent retainer and it makes flossing really tough! This was a great tool for me to reach those spots that floss is tough to get to! My only complaint is that it gets a little messy. The strong jet fills my mouth up quick and I usually end up with a puddle of water on me and on the sink- therefore it is part of the night time routine! Definitely recommend it overall- worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a fellow traveler. We are now on a trip and it&#x27;s just what I needed. My home irrigation system was too bulky for travel. This fits perfectly along with my sonic travel toothbrush. It&#x27; does such an excellent job that I might use it at home on a daily basis. Not  having to bring along a charger was also a big plus when packing. Just threw in some extra batteries and I haven&#x27;t had to change them yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this but I will keep it.  Do not use it on the high setting as you will have to refill every 30 seconds.  It makes a mess too the first time you use it lol.</li>
            <li> It works great and its easy.  The only thing is I wish it was a little more powerful.  But I use it on the 2nd setting and my mouth feels really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The best ever  Great for travel and powerful for battery</li>
            <li> It works well to floss the gums and reach between crowns.   I like that it works on batteries--no power cord.  And I can take it on trips.  The green section is what holds the water, that you pour in through a closable hole.  The top part can be collapsed down into the water reservoir for traveling--with storage space for the tip.  I purchased the extra tips, but don&#x27;t actually know why I would need them unless I were sharing the use of the Flosser with another person.  The batteries that came with the item worked well for 2 months and resulted in softer water pressure that helps you get used to it. The new batteries resulted in much stronger water pressure and I am using the first and second setting--which is fine.  You know the batteries are drained when the water force becomes weak at the third setting.  I estimate the new batters should last at least three - four months.</li>
            <li> Works great!! We have had this for a few years and it&#x27;s still working great! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Water Flosser is lemon&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t open battery cover at all&lt;br /&gt;God damn how can I use it withour battery?</li>
            <li> works perfectly, just like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I did not like it. Water had to be refilled twice and it was not strong enough.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Oral Irrigator is a great device for making sure you get all the small food particles out of your teeth. It is very easy to set up and ready to use. My teeth feel very fresh and clean after using this every morning. I highly recommend this as a teeth cleaning aid after brushing your teeth and flossing.</li>
            <li> Give to my friend as a gift. She loves it. Its powerful enough when the battery is new. however after few weeks it&#x27;s weaker but than you can change the battery !</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would be good for traveling. Mistake, it does not hold a charge. I will not recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Nice travel size and easy to use. Problem: the force of the water is extreme and splatters all over when using it. Be prepared to clean your sink and mirror area with each use. It does the job nicely though.</li>
            <li> Holy cow! An incredible little machine. Mouth feels like I just left the dentist office!</li>
            <li> I just discarded my second Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  Both worked beautifully for about 60 days.  Great size, sufficiently large reservoir, and plenty of power.  After about 60 days, however, both began to lose power (yes, I put in new batteries) and were no longer effective.  Maybe I just had bad luck, but I am now shopping for a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.  My first irrigator (same model) lasted several years and was still working very well.  However, over the years the water tank began to have an unpleasant odor.  I had put diluted mouthwash in it, as well as diluted bleach to remove the odor.  I decided to dispose of it and buy a new one.  The new one works very well, also.  I leave the cap open after I use the irrigator to make sure it stays dry and doesn&#x27;t have a chance for mold or other odors to form.  I like this model and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Great Product &amp; good delivery&lt;br /&gt;Seller provided product as specified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the first version of this irrigator for years. This newer version&lt;br /&gt;is a little bigger but, works just as well.</li>
            <li> My previous experience with &amp;#34;Oral Irrigators&amp;#34; was that they are &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; and splash water all over the bathroom.  This is battery operated so I use it in the SHOWER where I can be as messy as I want!!!&lt;br /&gt;The EW-DJ10-A works very well and is strong enough to do a thorough cleaning job.  No more lectures from the Dental Hygenist about not flossing enough (I hate flossing and I have very bad teeth).  As for the savings in Dental Bills, this thing is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;My first one lasted two years, then stopped working so I bought another one, figuring that for the price as opposed to Dental Bills its a real bargain.  Turnes out there was nothing wrong with the unit I replaced.  I just cleaned the battery contacts and now I have TWO working Units.  One for each bathroom!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  The only complaint (if I want to be really picky) is that I sometimes have to refill it before I have completed the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;.  Big Deal!</li>
            <li> This product worked better than I expected. Only two downsides; it runs out of water because of the small tank (although that is what makes it portable) and it puts out a large volume of water in a short time which makes it necessary to get rid of the water which is accumulating in your mouth several times during use.&lt;br /&gt;My oral hygienist recommended an oral irrigator for my back teeth. It works well.</li>
            <li> Forget the flossing!!!!  Oh my goodness, my dentist told me about this product and how I would not have to floss anymore.  It works wonders.  I used to have issues with my gums and have not had a problem since using this irrigator.  WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Since I travel, I wanted a product that was easy to pack. This was the one!&lt;br /&gt;Have not used an irrigator system since I was a kid. At 60, more pockets in the teeth I guess, but even after flossing, rinsing and brushing, specks of food still get washed out. I am 100% delighted with this product and the results. I hope to never havve anything more than x-rays from a dentist ever again because of the care I now give my teeth.</li>
            <li> the item worked as stated but the batteries which were included with the order did not work....had to buy 2 AA batteries</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well. Wish the tank was just a bit larger.</li>
            <li> I use this every day after lunch at work.  Was more powerful than I expected a battery operated device would be.  It is very easy to fill with water and would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Fantastic irrigator.  The thing I like the most is how small it is and how travel ready it is.  Small enough to pack in a purse and works great.</li>
            <li> Only weakness is the amount of fluid it holds. Need to fill twice to finish cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great for travel although I would like it lighter !</li>
            <li> i make it every day,i believe my tooth well better</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one of the two EW 176 models I have had for a number of years.  The newer design is sleeker and doesn&#x27;t have a cap on top that only trapped water and invited mold.  But, like so many other things, it has been supersized: the new model is much bulkier than the old one.  It is ovoid rather than round like its predecessor and I find it much harder to hold onto and just too big for something I want to tuck into my carry on bag. (The photo in the ad is misleading because it shows it on end, and you don&#x27;t realize that if you rotated it it would be nearly twice as wide.)  When you are talking portable, size matters, and bigger isn&#x27;t better.  The older model was made in Japan, and this is a Chinese product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 2014:  Now that I have had this for about 6 months, I really hate it. Its little door falls off and is hard to put back on. It&#x27;s hard to collapse and hard to open fully.  It is not ergonomic, not made for the human hand, and every time I try to rotate it, to turn it off without spritzing my face, I wonder if they tested it on any fairly small people, or just gorillas.  I&#x27;m going to Europe this summer and no way will I bring this clunker with me.</li>
            <li> Was excited to find this product on line. Unable to locate it in any stores. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Awful! My old one finally stopped working after 2 ,years of constant use. I thought this was the same but not the case. It didn&#x27;t work properly initially.  You had to hold it a certain way to keep it from collapsing but I figured that it was easier than returning a :$27 product. Besides I know from experience that unlike Amazon, Panasonic doesn&#x27;t stand behind their products. Going to look for a better brand</li>
            <li> Before we bought this read reviews of comments of the different brands.  This had the highest number of positive reviews.  Very easy to use.  Folds up really small for traveling.  Cleans teeth and mouth completely -You will be happy with this product.  Price was also right.</li>
            <li> We researched this for some time - this is a winner...Easy to use, lightweight and gets in between tough teeth perfectly.</li>
            <li> I can recommend you this product. The power is not as strong as the one I used to have but this is portable. The battery live is very long, one month and even more using it one time a day.</li>
            <li> This is my first oral irrigator so I don&#x27;t know how this compares to the larger ones. My dental hygenist recommended I get this since I have a few teeth that are close together and seem to catch food despite flossing.  I wanted a product that was easy to use and did not take up a lot of space and this product does that exactly.  It is easy to use, easy to fill, easy to empty and is small enough and attractive enough to store on my bathroom counter without looking ungainly. I still floss every day and I don&#x27;t think this product is intended to replace flossing.  However, it is a good follow up to brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> This new irrigator seems to have less power. Can&#x27;t imagine why lower power was added. Filler cap fits tighter, doesn&#x27;t fall off like original cap.</li>
            <li> No more heavy tubes full of water in big containers to sit on the countertop. This is a nice handy effective tool. It has excellent pressure and is easy to use and take with you.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I failed to use it every day.  If I had, I&#x27;d have known more quickly that it would only last for 5 or 6 uses, and returned it immediately.  As it is, the option to return EXPIRED 5 days ago, and I&#x27;m stuck with a dead hunk of plastic.</li>
            <li> it is cheap and effective device that I use often. I would definately recommend this product for those who struggle with cleaning out their teeth.</li>
            <li> I used one of these before, and lost it somewhere.  I decided it was time to get a new one.  It does everything that&#x27;s claimed for it, and it packs up easily.  Worth the money.  A good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great irrigator.  The best portable I have used. It also helps and lessons your need for flossing.</li>
            <li> I had used my first Panasonic Irrigator for 2 years and was pleased with the results. When it was time to replace it I reordered the same product expecting the same results. My second one broke a month after warranty expired. I then bought another and this one lasted just after warranty expired. The battery door is flimsy and breaks off hinge and the irrigator itself lasts just enough to get through the warranty period. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> excellent battery powered water pick. powerful enough, compact size and perfect for travel. leave it to Panasonic to make great products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this waterpik to take on trips with me particularly overseas.  It is great not having to search for a plug or deal with any kind of adapter.  Just carry some ordinary double AA batteries and you are set.  It does a good job of cleaning food between teeth.  I found it reliable and extremely convenient.  I packed it in my overnight bag on the flight over.  Easy to use in any bathroom, even on the plane.  I have had it on several two week trips and it is still running on the same batteries.  I store it with the removable nozzle in a ziplock bag.  It is so less bulky than the counter waterpiks.  With the two speed settings, it is easy for my 7 and 9 year old to use and sure helps them do a better job than just brushing alone.  I recommend it as a great travel pik.</li>
            <li> If you are used to waterpik, this option is a lot weaker than waterpik</li>
            <li> I purchased this water pic when my dentist suggested i begin the use a water pic on a daily basis for 2 problem areas in my mouth. I read the reviews and based on the reviews I ordered this water pic. Arrived on time, well packed but I was unable to remove to battery cover and I did not want to damage the product by forcing open the battery cover so I returned it immediately. Apparently the unit is so waterproof that you can not access the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of replacing a larger countertop unit that takes up a lot of space in my tiny bathroom.  Was a bit disappointed with the power supplied.  It is not as strong as my other unit on the lowest setting.  I know it is supposed to be gentler on the gums to use these units at a lower pressure, but this seemed really too low for me and I could not get used to the change.  Obviously, it does not hold much water either, but I figured if I had a unit I could actually put away after each use, it would be worth refilling it once or twice if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have been so bummed about it&#x27;s low pressure output that it is in the cabinet more permanently.  I decided to keep it anyway and will still use it for traveling though.</li>
            <li> I delayed writitng my review on this product as I wanted to see how it performs. I bought this mainly because I have implants. After more than 5 months of almost daily use, I feel my mouth and teeth are actually cleaner. I say this because after brushing and gargling, I thought all remaining food had been removed. But when I use the flosser, there are still food debris that are removed every time.&lt;br /&gt;The manual stated not to use rechargeable. Well, since I bought it, I had been using rechargeable batteries and have had no problem with it up to this time.&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this product though is that you have to get use to holding a larger flosser compared to a flosser where the water container is separate from the handle. I am use to it now though.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for those who have implants and travel a lot as it is very portable.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has an expander.  Tis is a very useful tool to keep it clean and is easy for her to use.  We also like that its battery operated so we can take it with us wherever we go!</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I use it every day!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0027LSEPS Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A]]O-ring swelled and I cannot close the water compartment. Replacement o-ring is not listed in manual or web parts list. Called Panasonic and got routed from tech support to parts and  still no one knows how to supply a replacement o-ring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other oral irrigators that haven&#x27;t held up.  This one is convenient and works great.  Portable and travel friendly.  It&#x27;s an advantage to use replaceable AA batteries rather than a rechargeable internal pack that eventually wears out.  When my grandson developed cavities, I sent him one of these.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly now because of my braces.  It takes a lot of battery life!  If you used it twice everyday, you would need to change out the batteries by the end of the week if you wanted the same amount of power of irrigation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the power that I would like to really blast stuff out of there and the capacity isn&#x27;t large enough for me either. But, for short term use, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I got this after trying &amp;#34;Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator with High Capacity Water Tank by ToiletTree Products&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s innovative design which occupies less space.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s thin steam of water jet with pulsating action removes all food particles from narrow gaps between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;3. Two AA battery operated means it&#x27;s handy to take anywhere with you.&lt;br /&gt;4. Water Proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;1. Sharp edges of the plastic parts may hurt if your hands are sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;2. Switch should have been softer to control the jet pressure.&lt;br /&gt;3. Water filling hole should have been at the top of bottom tank so that, even if the lid damaged, you can still use the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s the best for it&#x27;s price and features.</li>
            <li> I could not get the battery compartment open and the instructions did not help a bit. Finally a neighbor managed to overcome the obstacle.</li>
            <li> After years of neglect I have been diagnosed with gum disease. I had a root scaling and planing and continued with my bad habits thinking that the problem will disappear. Later I was told I should have gum flap surgery. All four quarters. Scheduled the very next week. 12mm pockets. $5,000. Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went home and started researching the disease and treatment options. As a result I canceled that idiotic surgery, decided to drastically change my oral hygiene, had another root scaling and planing, and made an appointment for a LANAP procedure. My routine included now brushing (with a [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]], every time with a different all-natural fluoride-free toothpaste - I&#x27;ve tried several brands and settled on 5-6 of them), flossing, using [[ASIN:B005LF0QZI Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks, 275 Count (Pack of 4)]], chewing xylitol gum (again, tried several brand and settled on Epic (like this one but I buy in bulk from their website - [[ASIN:B006609MBG Epic Dental 100% Xylitol Sweetened Gum, Peppermint, 12 Count (Pack of 12)]]), replacing all sugar with xylitol, etc. etc. and of course using an oral irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] initially. And when it broke I bought another one. And when I had to travel I realized I have to get something more portable. So I found this Panasonic irrigator. And it shortly became my main irrigator, as the Waterpik collects dust somewhere in a closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great unit. I have had it for 3 years now, and it still works perfectly. It works for a very long time (3-4 weeks) with one set of batteries - I use it with Eneloops. It becomes very compact when collapsed, so it is great for traveling. It is very maneuverable, much more that the Waterpik (limited by the hose lenght and rigidness). It is very easy to clean, as it comes apart very easily, and it has a very short water circuit (with the Waterpik I would always run it for a few seconds before using it because there was stale and stinky water inside the system - oh, the junk that took out of the Waterpik once!!! imagine that inside your mouth!!!). The reservoir is good size - could be a little bigger but it would defeat the portability purpose, so it&#x27;s not bad - just fill it once more! It has 2 power settings, and the water pressure is adequate, not only for a battery operated unit, but for a water flosser in general. Some people complain that the Waterpik (which is more powerful than this one) is not powerful enough. Well, unless you are trying to unglue your gums or dislocate your teeth or clean your bathroom with it, this is more than enough. I am a firm believer that the irrigator has to be used in conjunction with other means of oral hygiene, and not replace them entirely. So I floss, use the brushpicks and the irrigator (very often with a distilled water / hydrogen peroxide mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the above I used religiously after every single meal. I became almost obsessed with the hygiene to the point that I would avoid snacking if I knew I couldn&#x27;t clean my teeth afterwards. But it all paid off! Within a few months I went for my LANAP evaluation and was told that there is no need for a full scale procedure anymore, only localized for one single deep pocket. Imagine that! Now it&#x27;s 3 years later and I am free of any gum disease, and all my pockets are 3mm now. I still continue to employ most of the above techniques, and this Panasonic is an integral part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a highly recommended item!it for a few seconds before using it because there was stale and stinky water inside the system - oh, the junk that took out of the Waterpik once!!! imagine that inside your mouth!!!).

            <li> This is such an amazing product and really makes your mouth feel fresh and clean by removing all debri.  I also purchased another for my daughter - she loves it as well!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I own a Waterpik plug-in flosser which I love.  I thought this smaller unit would work for travel.  I find it harder to control and more likely to irritate my gums.  I am disappointed in the unit and can not recommend it.</li>
            <li> not a very fancy machine, the water speed is not very high, as a result, the cleaning result is not very satisfying.</li>
            <li> The two included AA batteries provide a lot of power. I selected the first of two power settings because the second setting was a little too much for my gums. I wish the order information had included the number of nozzles included (there is only one) so I could have ordered the replacement package at the same time (which, another surprise, contains TWO nozzles although the photo shows only one). Now I&#x27;ll have to reorder only the $8 replacement package and either pay the shipping or wait until I need something else that totals more than $25 to qualify for free shipping. I like this irrigator, its ease of operation and the great job it does. I marked it down to 4 stars because of the lack of information about the number of nozzles included with the irrigator and the number of nozzles in the replacement package. That seems like basic info Panasonic needs to include.</li>
            <li> The item looks solid &amp; well designed. Used once since received. The speed of irrigation of water could have been more aggresive, but ok for beginners. This one should be used along with regular normal floss...not an alternative of regular floss. I am happy with the purchase &amp; would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This oral irrigator is great! Very compact, works like a charm, and uses AA battery replacements. Would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> The Panasonic EW-DJ10 is a great product. Advantages:  compact, powerful water-jet action, holds plenty of water to enable complete rapid flossing (without having to refill reservoir). I only tried it once so far -- to see how it compares to my plug-in Waterpik Waterflosser. Verdict:  It is quite comparable and useful for travel. The Waterpik is better as a home model (but not by much), and it, of course, holds a lot more water than any portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  didn&#x27;t like having to use string floss during travel (the water-floss tools are so much better), so I was looking into a portable-type water flosser. The Waterpik Waterflosser is top notch as a plug-in model-- but too bulky for travel.  The Panasonic -- while not yielding quite as powerful a waterjet as the plug-in Waterpik -- does a very good job.  If you like the Waterpik Waterflosser, you will likely consider the Panasonic portable as a good temporary alternative.  I shied away from the portable Waterpik waterflosser, because of its many bad reviews. And, it&#x27;s bulkier and more expensive than the Panasonic portable. For those people who are considering the Panasonic portable as their day-to-day at-home waterflosser -- it&#x27;s good. But I would recommend the more powerful plug-in flossers for day-to day.  However, I would recommend this portable flosser over the Interplak (Conair) plug-in water flossers any day. That product does not hold a candle to the Panasonic portable or to the Waterpik Waterflosser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, just turn to the first speed that has effective clearing.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing. I bought this product because it was a &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34; &amp; the price was great. So glad I did! I use it daily &amp; love the results! My gums look &amp; feel healthier. This has become a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I got it half price as the deal of the day and it is OK to use. I would not have bought it at full price. It gets water all over when my husband uses it in the sink, but if it is used in the shower it is OK. It cleans teeth well.</li>
            <li> Returned it. Awkward and uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Worked okay for about a year, then just stopped.</li>
            <li> yeah it does its job.</li>
            <li> I have had this now for many months - it works REALLY great &amp; I really like that it uses regular AA batteries so if I am traveling I don&#x27;t need to take a charger! I like the fact that I can use it in the shower so there is really NO mess to clean up I just rinse down the shower. I use 1/2 water 1/4 peroxide 1/4 mouth wash for a GREAT clean. I DO rinse the unit out with clean water and turn it on to clean the inside with the water only.</li>
            <li> I got one of these for myself and my husband.  We like it!  I put warm water in it and use the high power.  #2setting, not #1.  It is easy to fill and easy to use once you get the hang of it.  I am very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> very deep cleaning sensation, Love it.</li>
            <li> had one once before but couldn&#x27;t find a replacement until now.So convenient I love it!</li>
            <li> Great travel water pick. Pretty big, but much smaller than a mains-operated unit.</li>
            <li> Took this water pic with me on vacation to Europe. Didn&#x27;t have to worry about finding an electrical adapter because this runs off batteries. I used it two weeks, twice a day and did not have to change batteries. Works like a champ. Made it thru security easily. I would recommend this to anyone with denture implants because you can rinse underneath them very easily and throughly.</li>
            <li> This is keeping me from getting gum disease. Before I started using it, my teeth hurt because flossing was not getting the food out.</li>
            <li> This does a really good job. The oval shape is a little awkward to hold since I have small hands but will fit nicely in my purse or bag.</li>
            <li> An updated version of what I had before. It does a good job of cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> A little weak and runs out of water quickly.  It is also difficult to fill in the shower.</li>
            <li> i love it... the only difficulty is cleaning the inside.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose just right</li>
            <li> Finally, a waterpick that I can use. It is compact, portable and effiecient. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Just got adult braces and travel often, so this was a great find. Dont know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> Although it is smaller &amp; more portable, it does work nearly as well as another brand that I replaced. Off/on switch hard to use with my arthritis. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Portable ,small, easy to use, and works very well  I would recommend this to all I know</li>
            <li> Great way to keep your teeth in top condition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so eager as now to write a review for when a good review is so well deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having a dull toothache for months now and have been putting off visiting a dentist. My lower molar has a deep pocket and perhaps aggravated by the fact that it has undergone a root canal treatment. It was catching all the debris without fail. First I used floss after every meal and then used an interdental brush but both seem to exacerbate the pain - they were just too abrasive since I have to do it everytime I eat (which is often since I&#x27;m a grazer and snacker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got this irrigator when I heard a speaker mention about amazon.com and this product he brought from amazon in particular. He was raving about it, I checked the price which was okay and decided to order one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what a relief I got! After using this for about three days, my dull toothache disappeared! I loved it so much I&#x27;d bring it with me during training and workshops (I&#x27;m a lecturer myself). And the great thing about it is that it&#x27;s so portable. It folds onto itself saving about 40% of the size and the pick is removable so it fits into my small bag. Plus, I don&#x27;t have to bother about carrying a charger when travelling because this uses batteries. Like the other reviewer, I use rechargeables and I don&#x27;t see any problem in using them - yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a real great buy. I like it so much I&#x27;m ordering another one for use when I travel so that I have another one here just for my home bathroom. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. i have used it, and its earlier models, for several years. It is small and takes up little space in my luggage.</li>
            <li> The item is perfect to me and my family i&#x27;m very Satisfied with the product, i&#x27;m recommend this product to use.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is perfect for people who have braces it helps keeping your hardware a little bit more clean. The battery lasts a while too!</li>
            <li> It,s,okay .I am glad I purchased it , I have to fill  it twice before I am finished but it is nice that it does not take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> I find the Panasonic Oral Irrigator to be compact and powerful - excellent for traveling. Good value for money. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had trouble with my impacted wisdom tooth. I could brush 5-10 minutes with my gums bleeding and still not get food out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though on first use, panicked and pulled it out of my mouth. Remember to switch it off first.&lt;br /&gt;Might want to practice without batteries first.</li>
            <li> Uses up capacity quickly so work fast!! Small capacity/high output ! Does a good job cleaning, powerful for size. A little awkward to use, the tank is the handle, time will tell how dependable it is. I have found Panasonic products dependable over the years.TDC</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use it for myself but my brother like this. It will reach the space that toothbrush can&#x27;t reach. Good</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds..I use the &#x27;high&#x27; mostly.</li>
            <li> While these irrigators do not last forever, I am very happy with the results and was pleased to find one to replace mine. My gums never bleed any more. And the price was right.</li>
            <li> WorKs great.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have to sit out.&lt;br /&gt;I can travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A learning curve, the mirror has been sprayed more than once.</li>
            <li> The oral irrigator has two different settings which is nice.  I personally like the high power setting because it cleans between the teeth better.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is very portable and easy to maintain. The battery life is a bit on the low side of units I think. I use it daily and the batterys last me around 2 and a half weeks on average.</li>
            <li> It is the only irrigator that is portable and reliable!</li>
            <li> Use and is not used any more once</li>
            <li> Sometimes the water splashes all over the place, I guess I just need to learn how to control it better!</li>
            <li> This is such a badass product. Makes you feel like your own dentist, without all the BS and assistant jabbing the back of your mouth with the saliva sucker. Have to fill it up twice just for one session though.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it works pretty well.  The nozzle swivels around a little which makes it easy to reach the nooks and crannies.  The power is pretty impressive for a little battery powered machine.  Just be ready to turn it off because it holds more water than your mouth can, so if you&#x27;re not paying attention, something is in for a shower.  Keep your finger on the switch!</li>
            <li> Works amazing for those wearing braces.</li>
            <li> Probably the most major problem braces wearers have is tiny food bits getting stuck in your teeth that just swishing can&#x27;t dislodge.  If you just brush without rinsing, the brush has a tendency to simply re-deposit food on the brackets.  While at home a countertop WaterPik-like device works great to solve this problem, the portable WaterPik-brand irrigators are simply huge.  This Panasonic irrigator is sturdy, compact when not in use, has a generous resevoir, and it has no nooks and crannies for gunk to get stuck in.  The resevoir is just big enough to rinse off the brackets on both arches.  As a bonus, the tip stores in a little channel on the side so you don&#x27;t lose or break it.  It runs on a pair of AA&#x27;s, and if the lack of a built-in rechargable battery bothers you, you can just get a pair of rechargable batteries and a charger for ten bucks or less at any drugstore.  (Make sure you get the kind that don&#x27;t self-discharge; they&#x27;ll be marked as \\&quot;pre-charged\\&quot; on the shelf.)  Personally I like the fact it runs on AA&#x27;s; it means that if I&#x27;m out and about and the batteries are dead, I can use batteries available anywhere to get it going again.  I have one of these at my desk at work and another that goes around in the car with me wherever I go.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!We use the whole family.This is a great product at a great price!!!Using the bathroom is the most good, as there is water splashing.</li>
            <li> I really like this tool. It is nice and compact for travel, and holds enough water for my whole mouth, when used on the lowest setting. I find the highest pressure to be a bit much, and the lowest pressure to be perfect! I bought rechargeable batteries for it too.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day even though it is meant for travel.  It has a lot of power for getting food out between your teeth.  It is easy to store, easy to use, and a comfortable size.  It uses batteries but they do not wear out fast.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased one and liked it. Over all it is a nice product, very clean, works just like other reviews described that I read before I made the purchase. For a portable tool it is very good.</li>
            <li> My wife gave this to me for Christmas and it lasted through 3 months of every other day use. Ill designed (I am an engineer) gets dirty in hard to clean crevices. Died after too brief a life. Panasonice deserves a slap on the head for this waste of money. Too bad as it was a great idea, albeit put together in a non-lasting manner by idiots.</li>
            <li> my wife bought one of these to try some two years ago, and i&#x27;ve been using it regularly since. it finally died on me few weeks ago. i found out from other reviews, it&#x27;s not recommended to use rechargeable batteries. i started using rechargeables in this unit few months ago, and i noticed the batteries really started to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; inside after a while. i can&#x27;t say this was 100% the cause, but it seems like a logical possibility for the unit not turning on anymore. but considering the price, two years was a pretty good duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;design-wise, this irrigator was truly portable, where the nozzle came off easily and fit nicely inside the casing when not in use. the switch was in a place that got easily turned on by accident, which i see is a possible place for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so aside from slight design flaw and rechargeable battery problems, i was quite happy with this item. i just ordered a new one, after trying an oral irrigator by toilettree products ([[ASIN:B00E6AR2J2 2nd Generation Professional Rechargeable ToiletTree]] which died on me after only two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this after having Braun Oral-B Electric Toothbrush to keep up with the teeth hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given its compact size and portability in using battery, this shall goes in to my luggage while travelling as well. Have used it twice and its good so far except for the initial gum bleeding which has mentioned to be normal.</li>
            <li> Like this alot.  It is great for traveling, works well, wouldn&#x27;t travel without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Much more convienient than taking the large irrigator system.</li>
            <li> I bought this to compare to the home use Waterpik I already have, and I must say that the two speeds are &#x27;very strong&#x27; and &#x27;blast the gunk off stuff strong&#x27;. The Waterpik has much gentler options that actually let me use it on the lingual/palatal surfaces of my teeth, whilst this oral irrigator must be held upright else it won&#x27;t work, and thus cannot be held at any angle that allows you to clean the lingual surfaces of your lower teeth (I suppose it might work on your upper ones as the angle is not so bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it, I stand over the sink, but the water splashback is so strong it hits my mirror, goes running everywhere... and this is on setting 1, not 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it&#x27;s better than nothing, and it *is* doing it&#x27;s job - just very messily, and not quite as well as a competing product. Maybe I&#x27;ll get the Waterpik traveller&#x27;s one, and use this to clean the grout in my bathroom?</li>
            <li> It was so good, someone stole it.  I tried once and it more than met my expectations.  I truly liked it.</li>
            <li> Way more fun than flossing. I got it for 20 bucks. It works.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss and every time I go to the dentist, I get a lecture and lots of scraping off tartar. After using the Panasonic Irrigator my dentist noticed an improvement in my gums and much less tartar. A larger electric irrigator would hold more water and possibly be even more effective. However, I don&#x27;t have a large bathroom and I travel so this compact design with disposable batteries works well for me. After I use my Sonicare toothbrush and think my mouth is clean, I irrigate and watch the food particles missed by brushing swirl down the drain.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to carry a wall charger while travelling so this is perfect as it runs on batteries. Tip fits within when compacted. Not as strong a power washer as home, plug in wall, tank unit, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a fine irrigator. It seems to have adequate pressure for my needs and I had no problem directing the water flow to where I wanted it.  And, surprise, it comes pre-loaded with water! I cannot see where the package advertising reveals that the irrigator might be reconditioned or returned, but mine clear was, unless water is part of the usual packaging.</li>
            <li> If you have braces, don&#x27;t look back and just purchase this now. It works so well that my orthodontists thinks I am doing a great job flossing daily. Little did he know, I&#x27;ve quit all that once I got this item. It travels really well!!! Make sure to buy a big bulk of QUALITY batteries as you may need to replace them every other month or so. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with this item after almost two years of use. What a well made product, Panasonic!</li>
            <li> It is not easy to use and there should be more speeds than just two.  You have to be very careful not to spray water all over.</li>
            <li> Panasonic this product for my teeth ache alleviate the problem, now after every meal I will use it, he really effective basically replaces the toothpick, but sometimes still need to cooperate with the pressure line, but for me this is really a good stuff!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. Difficult to use, small reservoir.  I ended up buying a small waterpik.batteries impossible to replace.collapses on itself during use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want a big clunky machine sitting out on my bathroom counter. I&#x27;d never used an &amp;#34;oral irrigator&amp;#34; before, so didn&#x27;t really know what features to be looking for... this has NONE. the tip isn&#x27;t adjustable, there is no hose, so you&#x27;re holding the whole thing up to your mouth to use it. Awkward to say the least. Trying to do the backs of my teeth, I sprayed water literally all over my bathroom. I laughed at myself, thinking I had to get used to it,  but it really did make a mess.  By the third usage(and clean up), I knew I wanted to return it, and thought due to the nature of the product that it would be nonreturnable. Contacted Amazon and they took the return, no questions asked. Loving Amazon, hating this product...Spring for $40 and get the real Macoy by  Waterpic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about two years ago. I thought it would be a good alternative to having a unit sitting on my counter and that you can take it with you on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It does a good job cleaning the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;  Battery lasts about a month before changing the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The inside can never totally dry out and then you get mold.  You have to leave the door open but still that doesn&#x27;t help. So even if you want to take it with you, you need to put it in a baggie so you don&#x27;t get water in your suit case.&lt;br /&gt;There is not way to totally clean all the mold out the grown inside the water tank because you cannot take it apart.&lt;br /&gt;So buyer beware because you can get sick from that mold.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised at how well this works.  My teeth feel just as clean, if not cleaner, than traditional flossing.  I resisted getting a water flosser for a long time because of the price, but then this model came on Amazon Deals and I had to get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:  Use a coin to twist open the battery cap (trust me, your finger nails will thank you).  Fill up with water before attaching the flosser tip because it fits in your sink less awkwardly.  Click on the flosser to use it.  Start with the lowest setting and key point here: DO NOT POINT AT BACK OF THROAT WHEN TURNING ON!  or you will seriously injure your throat if you are accidentaly on a high setting.  when done, run the flosser till all the water is out, and then open the tank to get rid of what remains. Remove the flosser tip by pressing the button on the side (I was lazy and didnt read the instructions and was freaking out because I couldnt get it off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend because its fun and it works!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  It&#x27;s a travel one.  It travels from the upstairs bathroom to the downstairs bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic water irrigator and I love how well it cleans my teeth and mouth EXCEPT they both broke. The last one only made it about 3 months before it started to sputter and die.  I am waiting to see what Amazon says about refunding it since it clearly did not last a reasonable period of time. So, great super product that dies really quickly - you decide if that is what you want to buy?</li>
            <li> Replacement for older unit that lasted 5 years</li>
            <li> Thank goodness Amazon has such a great return policy. After trying for several hours to remove the top of the battery well, I gave up. You can&#x27;t use it without batteries and the top seemed to be glued on. Nothing: screwdriver, paring knife, butter knife, banging it--nothing could budge that top. And yes, I had it on &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;. I guess I just got a defective one. But I&#x27;m not going to try again. I need something with more consistent quality.</li>
            <li> I love it! Panasonic Oral Irrigator exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Purchased this irrigator at the behest of my dentist. Not this particular model, but told to get one. I needed something small as I have a very small counter and sink; I would have preferred a plug in model but they all seemed to take up too much counter space. Works simply enough: fill the \\&quot;trough\\&quot; with tap water, put the mouth piece in your mouth at the angle to clean around your teeth and turn it on. Be sure to keep your mouth closed or you will have water spraying all over the place . . . takes a bit of practice . . . It does not take long (a few weeks) for the battery power to weaken and the spray weaken along with it--my first complaint. My second may come later . . . it does appear to be cheaply made and I have little hope that it will last me a long time--but it may surprise me. It does get out food debris that brushing may not get --seems to be a good thing to start off with as part of your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing.  I dont even know how to do it properly.  Now especially with braces, this has become a chore.  With this product, it makes it so easy! and it really gets my mouth clean.  Plus, its easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> this well designed, compactable, nesting and powerful enough irrigator gets used twice a day. dont feel clean with out it. far superior to flossing. gets out stuff that brushing cant even hope to reach. best 30$ ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;any nay-sayer doesnt know what they are talking about, or they got a faulty unit. if they are smart, and know how to use it correctly, and arent a complainer by nature, there is nothing bad that can really be said about this particular unit.&lt;br /&gt;by the way its WAY better than the oral B irrigator, and the ora-jet which I bought first at CVS.&lt;br /&gt;this one has been the right solution for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my dentist&#x27;s reccomendation to buy some type of oral irrigator to clean around my braces.  This thing is nice, on two AA batteries, it pushes a lot of water through your teeth (be careful not to hit your gums to directly though - it&#x27;ll hurt!) This thing keeps my braces clean without much hassle, and it folds down into a convenient travel size - which means I can bring it to work on days when I have appts., etc. and not have to worry about it.  The tank is enough to go around the inside and outside of my teeth with some to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - it does chomp down on batteries quite a bit, although I can say I&#x27;v gotten three solid weeks of use out of a set of Duracells - and that&#x27;s with twice, sometimes three times daily use, but you can hear the difference in the pump between when they were new and now.  I would like to try some rechargeables to see how they do.</li>
            <li> Perfect for on-the-go teeth cleansing! It just gets messy with water everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful. Battery life is decent and manual states use Alkaline only, although rechargeable do work.</li>
            <li> Great product, bought 5 so far for myself and family members!&lt;br /&gt;Hmmmm... Cannot think about anything to complaint this oral tools!</li>
            <li> Great design product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the Irrigator is doing what it is supposed to do, but it is messy to use. Just will take some time to master</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this now for over a month and feel like the pros don&#x27;t substantially outweigh the cons.  The hassle of drying off the parts, assembling, disassembling, make it not a convenient daily device.  Brushing and flossing is enough.  I just don&#x27;t see the value.</li>
            <li> Wish the reservoir was a bit bigger, but it&#x27;s wonderful to have this in a handheld version without the bulky bin and tubes like some of the older models.  Great power and use it every day!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all.  The off/on switch is very hard to use.  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted the money</li>
            <li> Just got this and have used it for the past week. I&#x27;ve never used a waterpik before, but this is great. I like the size of it, and color. I&#x27;m still using the level 1 water pressure setting, as my gums aren&#x27;t really tough yet. So far, it&#x27;s a great buy for my money. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this little water pick. It is amazing and very easy to use, always handy with out taking up a lot of cainet space.</li>
            <li> Not the best I would buy a different model. Probably would pay more for somthing nicer unless your useing this for vacations or away from the house only...</li>
            <li> This works great if you are going to be away from home for any length of time.  Lightweight and compact.</li>
            <li> The batteries are used up after only very few uses, then the effectiveness is reduced.  It is better than nothing, but I will try to find something else.  I also notice that mold is building up on the inside of the water container, and not exactly sure how to get it out.  Probably a mixture of water and bleach.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use and travel! I can&#x27;t believe it doesn&#x27;t leak with the collapsible design!  Good purchase!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Much better than using the floss, and also more efficient. BTW, it takes me some time to figure out how to open the batterty cover. First turn it hard and the cover will rotate like 30 degrees, then turn it really hard and it will finally open.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a very old Panasonic Irrigator.  This is great.  I especially like the two settings.  Much better than my old one.  Price was right, too.  Cannot go wrong with Amazon.  A great company!</li>
            <li> Irrigator I liked him. They are easy to use, this is an excellent massages and cleans the mouth. After using only pritno sensation. I recommend to all buyers!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and gives your between-teeth gums a nice massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is I really don&#x27;t know when to replace the battery. At this point, it&#x27;s still shooting, but I cant&#x27; tell if it&#x27;s weaker or not. I wish there was some sort of percentage indicator, even if it was rudimentary, somewhere on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USEFUL TIP: Clean it in your bathtub or shower stall, so it doesn&#x27;t spray all over your sink/counter/mirror. Tilt the whole thing upside down, rotate it, turn it from side to side, while it is on, to get all the excess water out from all parts of the device. Otherwise, if you are like me and prefer lukewarm water to be jetting inside your mouth, you will have a nasty surprise of COLD older water for the first split second when you use it the next time! ACK!</li>
            <li> I like this water irrigator , it works well and I much prefer it then flossing, so I use it 2-3l times a day. My dentist found my gums in good health. Practical and pleasant, very effective in removing all the food debris and keeping mouth fresh. It was good while it lasted , but after a few month it totally lost power, even with new batteries makes only much noise. Too bad, as I am now in Europe might not be worth returning it, even if it has 2 years warrantee.</li>
            <li> This was our first oral irrigator and chose it because of other reviews. It does a good job of cleaning after you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to take with you when you travel, the only negative thing so far is the cost of operation, you have to use the alkaline&lt;br /&gt;batteries, not rechargeable ones and they get costly after a while.</li>
            <li> Similar to a waterpik, not quite as powerful. However, it&#x27;s low price and convenience/portability factor make it a super buy. I think it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> While the Panasonic Oral Irrigator works well, I have been disappointed in how quickly the batteries need to be replaced. Next time I would purchase something more environmentally-and financially-friendly.</li>
            <li> Great product , I travel extensively and this product works great. The only issue I had was that the box says there is a replacement nozzel with the unit and there is none.</li>
            <li> I originally owned a waterpik thinking that for such a pricy product, it had to be good.  False!  The unit died on me for reasons that affect many others if you read the reviews.  The charging system is poorly designed / manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Panasonic unit looking for just about any alternative.  So far, it has been about 9 months and it is running flawlessly. Portable, reliable, and can use any set of AA batteries (including rechargeable Eneloops).  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted a well designed oral irrigator,and this one, upon 1st impression, is a good design. I don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up in the future, but it works well NOW. The last irrigator,  a Water........  didn&#x27;t last very long.  Too bad...it did the job O.K., but after taking it back twice, it finally gave out, and that was the END for that Pic.To many return trips and no longevity.  Oh well, some are just better.</li>
            <li> Good product but mine failed after a few months.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Oral Irrigator  worked exactly as advertised - took it on Safari and to 5 different countries and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Since our bathroom isn&#x27;t big enough for the plug-in water pic, this is the perfect solution.  The Panasonic uses AA batteries.  I used the original portable waterpic and found it didn&#x27;t last very long.  My dentist is very pleased with the job this water pic does on my gums.</li>
            <li> Too hard to open. had to return it</li>
            <li> Love it...........couldn&#x27;t live without it.  is powerful and I clean it by soaking in a deep narrow plastic cup with water and a little bleach.</li>
            <li> I traveled most of this summer including overseas. It&#x27;s well designed. Easy to pack, Great water pressure. Battery lasted all summer long and still working without changing them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a junk! It stops working after three months, the total number of time I used is less than 10.</li>
            <li> Its a good addition to oral care. Doesn&#x27;t replace the floss but it is faster if you want a quick rinse of something stuck between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! After using this product  for couple of months visited my dentist&#x27;s office and hygienist was impressed with overall improvement!</li>
            <li> Great product my mouth has never felt so clean and healthy. You would be surprised what lies behind and under your teeth after brushing. The product works like a Gardner&#x27;s leaf blower. Fresh breath is everything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic Irrigator for a month and so far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. It has two speeds, low and high, but I &#x27;ve been using high speed exclusively. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to refill, but my favorite aspect is using rechargeable AA batteries. The instructions say not to use rechargeables, but I do anyway and it works fine. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smaller than a regular waterpick, it does not take up shelf space. It is not so powerful as to blast your mouth, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because it splashed me all the time.  I used it two or three times, and then stopped using it!&lt;br /&gt;MCM</li>
            <li> As strange as it looks, the ergonomics actually work.  Pressure is equivalent to &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; on my full size water pic (scale goes up to 10).  This is weak, but perfect for cleaning sensitive pockets away from home.  I have to refill 3 times for a full rinse.  More pressure and capacity would be nice, but are not possible with a highly portable unit running two AA batteries - I am satisfied with the compromises made in this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of the same irrigator from you; however, it is extremely dificult to clean water receptacle without dismantling the item.  I use peroxide allowing it to remain awguke to remove mild dew that forms inside.  White vinegar does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer has to provide correct instructions to perform this feat!</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a regular counter top model, but has a fairly good pressure. The batteries lasted a lot longer than I expected. It is a bit messy. Good for occasional use on a trip.</li>
            <li> This product arrived today and it might be a good thing, but the battery cover will turn to the open position but there seems to be no way to pull it out and insert battery. Panasonic support is closed after 9 pm Eastern time so I cannot ask them. Will update if someone enlightens me on how the heck they get the battery in.  The instructions need to be clearer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the answerer, keep turning the cap AFTER you are pointed to the open position and it will come up and be able pulled out. A nickel worked best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pressure seems comparable to the Waterpik \\&quot;portable\\&quot; which is much more bulky and had a plug in adapter. The amount of water it holds is adequate for me. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up in use and how often the batteries need to be replaced.  It will lighten my suitcase for my next trip.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time getting the placement right.  I didn&#x27;t know how to put it in the correct position . maybe I didn&#x27;t read the directions correctly.</li>
            <li> Very good. Fast delivery easy to use.</li>
            <li> A great portable irrigator alternative if you&#x27;re traveling, otherwise use an AC powered one.</li>
            <li> It is a lot better than waterpick 360 in which the battery can not hold a charge after only 6 months.. the Panasonic has stronger jets, looks better and it&#x27;s easier to carry around.</li>
            <li> great product, my wife and myself love it, small but does better job that the big one I had, plus beautiful price. thank Amazon</li>
            <li> I have tried several WaterPics and eventually water corrodes that battery pack.  This is powered by double AA batteries, and is not designed for rechargable batteries. Water is successfully sealed out of the battery compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does lose power as the batteries weaken, but the durability and longevity of this item makes it worth it.  I lost the first one and replaced it.</li>
            <li> Irrigator just as described. Arrived in good condition; promptly, too. Works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I don&#x27;t have a plug by my sink so this is very convenient for me.  This one uses 2AA batteries. I had one that you recharge but had to throw it out because it would no longer hold the charge anymore.  2 speeds and the high speed with a fairly new battery gives you a great amount of pressure.  Doesn&#x27;t hold much water but for me, it&#x27;s just about right.  What I particularly love about this unit is that it comes apart. You can clean the inside out.  After a while, even a little bit of standing water will get yucky inside and leave gunk especially if you have hard water.  I had other handhelds that you could not clean out. I certainly didn&#x27;t want to be putting yucky water on my gums. I&#x27;m trying to prevent gum infections.  All you have to do is just pull on it (you won&#x27;t break it) and you can wipe out the entire inside of the water container.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s good for travel, but possibly not for your main product. It is a little lacking in power.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. Because it is so lightweight I plan on taking it to Europe with me!</li>
            <li> I love this. I bought it because I recently got braces. It travels well and works just as well as a regular model. I gave it 4 stars because it can be difficult to open if the pick head shifts in its holding spot.  Other wiseworks great.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having to buy a new handheld Waterpik every 4 months or so when it would no longer re-charge. Pros for the Panasonic: easily replaced AA batteries, larger reservoir than the WaterPik while being partially collapsible for travel. Cons: recommended only for water (no mixture of mouthwash, as is recommended by my hygienist), it is not as easy to turn on/off and is not as powerful. Despite the negatives I see in the Panasonic, I would recommend it because the Waterpiks simply die young.</li>
            <li> my first water flosser. i didn&#x27;t know what to expect. it works very well. with the tank full it runs for about a minute. refill and take a different approach. messy but works. two speeds and one tip. smart design. runs on AA batteries, supplied.</li>
            <li> The flosser works well, but I do not like the way to fill it with water. I preferred older models, where the water was filled from a flap at the top, which was much easier to fill without spilling.</li>
            <li> Excellent function with good force. Unit is compact and light weight. Batteries last. Far superior to the Usual Oral B irrigators available in most drug stores which have weak batteries.</li>
            <li> Fair stream, ok for trip, best outside or in tup water leaks a little, have to move along or refill.</li>
            <li> Use this daily. Works flawlessly. 2 speeds are nice. Simple to use and keep clean. Wish the res. was a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> I am between love and like.  It really is very powerful and easy to use, once I got the batteries in.  I don&#x27;t know why but I have tough time with that.  I would buy it again and the price is great.  The only thing I recommend is that you use it in the shower or get out your wet dry vac.  It is impossible to use it at the sink.  There is water everywhere.  I think this might deter me but in the shower it is fine and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral Irrigator shortly after having my braces put on. I am here to tell you that this was the best purchase&lt;br /&gt;ever! The number one thing that bothers a person with braces is the idea of having stray bits of food stuck in your braces.&lt;br /&gt;This product eliminates that possibility. I purchased it after reading many horrible reviews on the portable Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;concerning the recharging of the product, the Panasonic is battery operated. Things I love about this product, because&lt;br /&gt;it is collapsible it&#x27;s so convenient to take with you anywhere, it fits perfectly in almost any bag. The pressure is strong&lt;br /&gt;enough to do the job. This product has taken a lot of the anxiety out of accidentally having food stuck in my teeth and braces.&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this product is that the manual says not to add ANY chemicals to the reservoir. So you can&#x27;t add any cleaning&lt;br /&gt;solutions in with your fresh water. Still not a good enough reason to not purchase.</li>
            <li> Once set up very easy to operate and shows very good results. I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s interested in keeping their gums and teeth healthy</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the water steam is very powerful. It came with two AA batteries and they never seemed to run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked at any negative reviews for this irrigator because I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with it, despite being nervous about making the great leap from string floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s not as powerful as the counter-top models but really, how strong does the water stream need to be?  I am cleaning my teeth, not pressure-washing the house.  Yes, I too would have liked a jet stream but I doubt it&#x27;s actually necessary. Once upon a time, I used to insist on firm, stiffly bristled toothbrushes.  It turned out that my aggressive brushing was hurting, not helping my innocent and sensitive gums. Sometimes things are just counterintuitive and I believe that&#x27;s the case with the water pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist had recommended a water irrigator instead of string floss but I resisted and finally confessed that I am incapable of keeping myself or my bathroom dry when armed with a WaterPik.  It was banished long ago to our appliance graveyard, for the safety of one and all.  Surprisingly, she laughed and told me she was just as hopeless until, through the miracle of technology, they had finally invented a portable, waterproof irrigator that could be used in the shower. Glory hallelujah, my problems were solved and at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it in the shower is ridiculously easy.  Yes, it has to be refilled at least once but who cares?  It&#x27;s a breeze to refill so I consider it a non-issue. I bring a bottle of water into the shower with me and can refill the tank in seconds.  If it held any more water, it would likely be less comfortable to grasp.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for awhile, I&#x27;m much more adept and am capable of using it at the sink without drenching myself or my surroundings, to the relief of my family and attire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained about mold in the tank but I haven&#x27;t had a similar issue.  Of course, that may be because I add some Listerine to my water.  It&#x27;s good for my breath and apparently, good for my irrigator. My last checkup was aces so I&#x27;m even happier with my device and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any of the counter-top models.p was aces so I&#x27;m even happier with my device and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any of the counter-top models.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this will hold up over the long run, but it has already lasted longer than my Waterpik brand that failed after two weeks - and I waited another two weeks for a replacement - and the replacement failed after another two weeks.  This unit is battery powered and produces a very strong pulse to clean between the teeth quite well.  It is very easy to hold and manipulate.  I really like the compact design because you can take it with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> first of these type of devices i&#x27;ve had. initially got a bit suspicious it won&#x27;t be strong enough, then once found it s stronger than you need, scared it&#x27;d be too strong for my gums. it&#x27;s not. 2 perfect set speeds and just simple and great to use. Good quality, no service needed, batts last forever... and priced perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have one and have purchased at least five more as gifts for friends over 50 who are starting to have gum issues. Every recipient has thanked me again and again. I use it exclusively rather than the space hogging WaterPik. Have tried all the portables. This is THE best. The rechargeabe types don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I like everything about it, except that it is battery operated. I previously had an electronic irrigator (that wasn&#x27;t portable) for about six years.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, holds just enough water to do a good job.  Packs up nice and small with place to store pic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine daily for several months and have not had to change the battery.  Because it slides down into the case it is easy to travel with so maintaining my daily oral hygiene is not a problem.</li>
            <li> perfect for travel and everyday use; received in good condition!&lt;br /&gt;excellent device for oral care and good hygiene. thank you for access to best deal!</li>
            <li> The Irrigator arrived on time and I started to use it. I hope the batteries will last at least three weeks before I have to replace them which will make it worth the cost of changing the batteries. The product works great and will be good for trips and vacations. ..Thanks</li>
            <li> It works, but it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power as an electric one and the battery live is not terribly long.</li>
            <li> Works well for me; irrigates and removes debris; water capacity just enough water to do the job;cordless and portable; great for travel.</li>
            <li> I chose this little portable irrigator because I have very limited counter &amp; storage space.  I have to fill it  twice to cover all areas but that&#x27;s not really a big deal.  I love that it collapses into itself &amp; self stores the tip.  I will definitely take it along when I travel as well even though I initially purchased for use at home.</li>
            <li> No real shortcomings. I took it on the road and was able to use the batteries about 2 1/2 weeks. That was the equivalent of 2 tanks per cleaning session every evening.  It has two power settings, at first the low was almost too high, then after a little use (the battery voltage dropped) and it it was about right on the low setting. After the battery level dropped more I switched to the High which was about what the Low was before.  Nice unit and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t flossed my teeth since using this product. So simple to use but so effective, I ended up buying another two for my granddaughters as they love using it. 5 stars from our family</li>
            <li> I really love my new water pick. I can use it in the shower because it is run by battery</li>
            <li> Just a little messier than I had expected and not all that easy to handle since it is rather large, but overall pretty good considering the price.</li>
            <li> So far, the water irrigator is working fine. Since I use it twice a day, I have to change the batteries every two weeks. In the long run it is probably more costly to operate than one that is chraged electrically. I do like the compact size, and the force of the water flow does clean.</li>
            <li> LOVE the ease of use, size, and aesthetically pleasing!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Deal of the Day for about $26, and for the most part, have been pretty satisfied with the performance of Panasonic&#x27;s version of the WaterPik.  This implement can be a little messy to use at times, but it does generate a powerful stream of water that can be quite useful in cleaning debris from between your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is collapsible so it can be easily stored or transported, and it has a compartment for storing the nozzle.  Once extended, the nozzle and water reservoir become accessible.  At either of the two power settings, the reservoir holds enough water to run for less than a minute.  During a typically cleaning, I usually have to refill the unit a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jet of water is pretty powerful, and does a good job of blasting out trapped particles.  I normally use the irrigator after I bush and floss my teeth, as the final finishing touch.  The cleaning process can get a little protracted, but it is well worth it if you can avoid an expensive dental procedure.  Cosmetic crowns, or a root canal, could easily cost over a thousand dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can also help provide advance indication about possible problem areas.  If your gums that are sensitive to a jet of water, there could  be something happening there that may require attention, and you can alert your dentist or hygienist to take a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the unit isn&#x27;t the most convenient to handle, and the power switch can be little hard to operate, particularly if your hands are wet.  Two AA batteries are required to power the unit.  Battery life is good, but not great.  Rechargeable cells are not recommended, but I use them anyway.  [[ASIN:B003OC74SW Replacement nozzles]] are available, so the irrigator can be shared.  Just be sure you are able to identify your nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the 1278th Amazon reviewer, it&#x27;s quite easy to for me give the Panasonic EW-DJ10 a 5 star rating, especially as I saved purchasing it on sale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but would like a little more pressure with the irrigation.</li>
            <li> Nice portable unit.  I keep in my desk drawer at work for those time when I need to freshen, especially after lunch!</li>
            <li> I like this guy. However I would like it more if it had a bigger tank. I have to fill it up twice for the cleaning I like and want. It works pretty decent to be battery powered tho. I use setting one. I think two is a lil strong for my liking...</li>
            <li> The water leaks and injection is very hard to control. That&#x27;s the reason they reduce the price as it cannot sell1</li>
            <li> We have had a Waterpik for years. Recently the tubing broke and after several attempts to repair it, I started looking for a replacement. When I saw this, I decided that it was worth try. It has been a huge hit. It is so much easier to use than the Waterpik because you don’t have the tubing to deal with and it store easily in the medicine cabinet instead of taking up space on the bathroom counter. I love that I will be able to take it with me on trips. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that it does have slightly less power than the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I got this for travel, since I have braces and obviously can&#x27;t lug my home WaterPic with me. It was a pretty disappointing experience: awkward to maneuver due to combination of size and weight, also it did not deliver much pressure relative to what I&#x27;m used to. Overall, it is adequate...but barely. No comments as to the longevity, as it&#x27;s only a month old.</li>
            <li> This is, in my experience, the best water flosser I have used to date. I am a dentist, and I have tested several water flossers, eventually giving up the use of them, to return to regular flossing. Until I found this product, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does exactly that which is mentioned in the product description -- floss quickly &amp; effectively without the mess and fuss that one would experience with regular flossing. (provided that the user is cognizant &amp; compliant with the user instructions provided with the irrigator). I have used several brands of water flossers, and this is, by far, the best. I am a person who flosses at least twice a day, and despite me being diligent and consistent with this, my first flossing session with this irrigator did cause minor bleeding in one area, which indicates that I was probably not flossing correctly in this area, despite all the effort put into flossing daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anybody that does not understand: The bleeding that one may see with initial use of this product is simply an indication of inflammation of the gums that was existent prior to irrigation. With proper, and regular use, this (initial) bleeding should subside, in which case you will know that the irrigator IS doing what it was meant to do. It would be a mistake to stop using the product when bleeding is evident. It would then be better to opt for the lower setting so as to get comfortable with the irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the only downside is that the product is battery-operated. I personally would prefer the rechargeable variety (to save on batteries), but this was hardly enough to lay me off from at least trying this product. And I have yet to be dissappointed. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a compact, easy to use dental irrigator. I would also definitely buy this product again, if the need arises.</li>
            <li> On initial usage, it caused a mess in my toilet, water splashing all over. After a few rounds, I finally got the hang of it. No mess, or maybe only occasionally, when i forget to close my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes me feel so clean, I now feel uneasy when I don&#x27;t get to use it :p</li>
            <li> We read the reviews for all of the competitive products. We chose to go with the Panasonic. It was a great choice. The batteries lasted through a 12 day vacation and are still going. It is compact, packs up nicely, and works just great. My son wants to use it every day now instead of his waterpik at home.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and this compact gizmo is a clever design and more powerful than other portable devices I have tried. Extremely happy with my purchase. Big healthy smile!</li>
            <li> I recently had implants placed in my upper gums for a bridge. A complete upper bridge supported by 6 implants, which I love. I bought a Waterpik in order to clean under it and it worked pretty good. The only problem was that it was big and bulky and not good to take if you are traveling. I absolutely LOVE this one.  It runs off of batteries so there is no recharging and it&#x27;s small enough to just stick  in my purse. I use it all the time now.</li>
            <li> Nice clean feel after using the irrigator! Yellow stains gone!&lt;br /&gt;Use in shower when naked! It&#x27;ll spill everywhere! Not suitable for using it at the sink.</li>
            <li> Harder to handle than I would like.  On/Off switch is awkward while you are using it.  Not unhappy with it, but not totally overjoyed either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted.  Small and effective and mobile.  Good fit for small spaces around the sink.  No need to find a plug to recharge the flosser. Just replace the batteries.  Reservior  small.  May have to fill twice to do a complete job.</li>
            <li> I like the irrigator quite a bit.  It is completely mobile and collapses when emptied and even provides storage for the tip when collapsed.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had a little more strength, but it does do the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s O.K. for travel use, but it doesn&#x27;t pack the power to do the job like a plug-in unit.</li>
            <li> The best feature of this product is that it has batteries rather than the rechargeable feature.  I owned a Waterpic and I never knew when it was time to recharge, and if you wait too long, it isn&#x27;t good for the battery, so after under a year, the thing died.  It was about $15.oo more than this Panasonic, and I expected a much longer life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way this Panasonic water cleaner works. It has two speed settings, and both settings really do the job.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month now, and all is well. Another nice feature is that it folds up into a smaller unit for transporting when you travel, and the nozzle fits in this neat little secure pocket so it can&#x27;t get lost.  The only negative is that it comes with only one nozzle so you can&#x27;t share it with your husband or wife. I suppose you could order another, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> Bought the Wateerpik big portable and didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t have enough force to clean my teeth and gums so I bought this.  It has plenty of force and a thoughtful, elegant design.  Problem is that a fresh set of batteries lasted less than a week.  That isn&#x27;t acceptable.  SO I guess I&#x27;m still in search of the best  travel irrigator</li>
            <li> Good but not great..I bought a waterpik which does a more thorough job with more water power.  That said, if you just want a gentle rinse, this is a good product and certainly better than not having one when traveling!</li>
            <li> After a week of usage, I would say it&#x27;s a good product. Water pressure is adequate for me as of now, and I am surprised how can any one want more pressure on their teeth! Major plus point is that it is extremely portable and everything folds to an adult palm size. This of course means that the reservoir is not adequate and I end up filling it 3-4 times on one use. I am okay with this as filling it up is very easy. A nice trick would be to put a little mouth wash with water (though the manual DISCOURAGES putting any chemicals except water inside).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product before and after brushing my teeth...I never see food particles come out or really feel a difference. I suppose it&#x27;s still doing something beneficial as opposed to not doing it at all but not really sure it&#x27;s worth buying. In it&#x27;s defense I do have tight teeth so maybe others will see better results?</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, the unit is compact and powerful and it gets out stuff you didn&#x27;t know was stuck in there.  Leaves your mouth feeling clean.  Probably best to use any irrigator before brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This item is suitable for use to bring in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;When I use this for the first time, blood came out from the gums.But was very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I would click &#x27;5 stars&#x27; except that I think it needs to hold more water; maybe another ounce? Also, the spout does not easily fit into it&#x27;s storage place at the side of the irrigator.</li>
            <li> Used only once. Super messy. If you floss, you won&#x27;t need this. I bought this to try to clean my kid&#x27;s tooth , but I cannot even clean my own tooth without massive splashing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I use it twice a day.  Keep your dental cost low by brushing, dental flossing, and water pick. Also protable so you can take it with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> We purchased this unit for our 6 year old who is having some early orthodontic work done to try to avoid future problems.  She recently got a palate expander installed that covers a few teeth and goes across the roof of her mouth.  We purchased a water pik type of product at the suggestion of the orthodontist to help us keep her teeth and the palate expander clean.  We wanted something simple that we could use at home or while traveling.  This had some features that we thought would work well for our situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;♦ Does a good job of helping her clean out her teeth.  Was able to get some sticky smores out after a girl scouts outing pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;♦ It is pretty easy to control for her (besides the switch).&lt;br /&gt;♦ Convenient for travel.  Folds up pretty small and has a place to hold the tip.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Waterproof.  We have her use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;♦ Switch is a little difficult for a 6 year old to work, but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Small reservoir.  It takes two fillings to clean out her whole mouth, even on the low setting.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Has a steady stream, but more of a pulsing action.&lt;br /&gt;♦ Extremely messy for a child to use.  We have her use it in the shower every night so that she doesn&#x27;t get water all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we are please with this purchase.  We didn&#x27;t want a counter top unit, so this was the next best thing that offered good performance and travel options.  It is extremely messy for a small child to use, which is to be expected.  We found that since it is waterproof, the best option for us was for our daughter to use it in the shower every night which makes for easy cleanup and no water all over the bathroom.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine having a 6 year old try to control this unit or even a counter top version made for kids outside of the shower.  It would get everywhere, so the waterproof nature of this product is perfect for us.</li>
            <li> Great flosser if you hate using the string floss!  It is very powerful and works well!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, dries well (better than reviews suggest), well-designed re on-off button placement, hand fit, weight, reasonable cost, etc.  Like not having to recharge, worry with a water device near a plug, etc.  And after weeks of use, still using original batteries.  Much better than old (and new ones too!) Waterpik on all counts.  Like others, the Waterpik just stopped working because rechargeable battery wore out.</li>
            <li> 这是个非常好的产品,能全部清除牙龈中的杂物,就是电用的很快.very good.&lt;br /&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li> I like the idea that it is small enough to carry with you when you go away.  Just remember to bring batteries with you. The base of the Oral irrigator keeps closing on me. And I know that I double check when I open the bottom part that it is secure.</li>
            <li> It does clean your teeth, but too messy. Splash everywhere. Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it yet.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product. Quick to set up and easy to use. It has two settings, high and low. The high is too powerful for my preference. Low is less intense pulsing but works effectively. It has never clogged and I add a little peroxide periodically.  But the best is its battery operated compact size, so no cord clutter. I love it.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is very efficient and has 2 speeds. With the gold deal price, it is quite value for money if you want an oral irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also bought together with the following:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OC74SW?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B003OC74SW&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;nealo10a-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;E4T45XJV4ENHTXV4</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it. My dentist wanted to sell me another version that was twice the price and only shot a spit of water out with each button press ... this thing compacts, has plenty of power to push out them meat chunks and is cordless. I use mine in the shower so the dripping water complaints down the elbow don&#x27;t matter. Takes less than a minute to do the job.</li>
            <li> Even the low speed is just slightly uncomfortable. it is a little large to be maneuverable. Overall it does the job, but the fluid only lasts a minute of squirting. Refill is quick and easy. Seems decently sealed - a good thing since the used mouth rinse runs all over it.</li>
            <li> The force of the water is much greater than our plug-in water pik. Actually painful, to my gums at least. I&#x27;m going to keep using it a bit and see if I get used to it, but I wish it had a lower low setting.</li>
            <li> Great irrigator, replaces an identical one used intensively for several years. Very good value. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t take rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> Works great exactly as described</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, does the job.</li>
            <li> A perfect travel solution to maintain dental hygiene. Using only 2 batteries, it&#x27;s better than rechargeable, more reliable and less to carry.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my ten year old daughter who has braces.  She uses it daily - and has no need for floss or picks.  It is a wonderful product - and I am considering getting one myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I wanted to occupy less space than the Panasonic oral irrigator --- so I bought this. It is the best I have ever had for a portable device, but nothing beats the larger version. Two months later, I bought the Panasonic and will use this one for travel.</li>
            <li> This thing does not work the way anyone would expect. It splatters all over the place and messes up the clothes. It seems that the stream is too thick, it should be pressurized in order to reduce the waterfall effect. I wasted money on two of these. Can&#x27;t return it because I expected it will work so I threw out the boxes.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing, so this thing is great.  One for the purse, one for the shower, one for the sink.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love that this little oral irrigator is low tech.  You fill the reservoir, stick the nozzle in your mouth, and away you go!  It&#x27;s easy to figure out. One fill of the reservoir provides the perfect go around for teeth and gums.  My mouth definitely feels cleaner after using it, and my dentist seems to be happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4 stars?  I don&#x27;t think the power is optimal for oral hygiene.  My gums have not bled or even been sore from Day One of using it, and the pressure doesn&#x27;t seem to be any greater than just a vigorous swish and rinse.  It&#x27;s comparable to the water jet dentists used to used to rinse one&#x27;s mouth after cleaning.  It&#x27;s pleasant, but not aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice addition to the oral hygiene arsenal, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the perfect one.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve had two previous versions and I went with this one because of the reliability of the previous models.  Both of the previous Panasonics I&#x27;ve owned did not die...they just get a bit &amp;#34;grungy&amp;#34; after a year or two of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some reviews and some Panasonic documentation suggests not to use rechargeable batteries, I have ALWAYS used AA rechargeable batteries in these irrigators and feel they work well, with no degradation in irrigator performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion for longer/cleaner life: take the reservoir, pump unit, and nozzle apart and put them in your dishwasher every month or so.  It will take care of any buildup, crud, etc.  Make sure to take the batteries out and put the battery cover back on so no water gets inside the battery compartment.  Also, take it apart after each use and lay on a paper towel near the sink...nightly drying out also helps keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great value and I see the great results in the dentist chair!</li>
            <li> Excellent travel &#x27;water pic&#x27; type device. Does a good job for away from home use. At home, I&#x27;d still recommend a good plug in unit with a larger water supply and a bit more power. I use a counter top Water Pic, but I&#x27;m sure there are other good units to be had. Away from home though, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a much better one than this Panasonic unit.</li>
            <li> This was my 3rd try for a travel oral irrigator - by far the best yet.  It is light enough for travel, I also take it to work,  and the water pressure is good - feels as good as when I use my electric water-pik. The irrigator tip stores in the side of the water tank to make it smaller for travel and a replacement tip can be ordered if you require a spare.  The batteries last too, I quite often have to refill the water tank  as I require more time - but this is no big deal as it fills quickly and easily.  I have used this regularly in the past 6 months and only just replaced the two batteries.  I liked this so much I purchased one for my daughter, and highly recommended to friends that travel. Perfect for gifting.</li>
            <li> This is the most poorly designed product I own. I followed the instructions to the t but when I used it my situation in the bathroom was like a scene from a slapstick comedy. Water sprays all over the place even if I hold it very close to my teeth. It also drips from the corners. I went in to the bathtub and after a very wet struggle with the device, I didn&#x27;t see anything better than a good floss could achieve. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several versions of the Panasonic Oral Irrigator over the past several years but this one EW DJ10A is by far the best one.  I like the 2 speed action.  I put a little mouthwash in the container.  It really does a good job.  it&#x27;s really easy to travel with as the nozzle fits quite nicely into its own little space.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Only real problem is its messy. Does it work yes. Good for travel. Just enough power to get the job don.&lt;br /&gt;Good price.</li>
            <li> These are great dental tools. This is my second. My first finally wore out after 3-4 yrs of service. I love it.</li>
            <li> It is light, handy. I using this for several weeks from now and I&#x27;m still happy!&lt;br /&gt;Only it is not so powerful as normal stationary irrigator but it dos job. Battery last for long. I recommending it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like water picking this is great - easy to use &amp; easy to take with you if you travel</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it could be.  After root scaling and planing for early periodontal disease,  I&#x27;d try anything to keep my teeth clean.  This is easy to use, once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I like this water pic because it is portable, inexpensive, cordless, and has the right amount of water pressure.  It doesn&#x27;t require special batteries (it uses 2 AA batteries).  The actual nozzle stays in place to ensure you get the water to the right place.</li>
            <li> A friend who uses the \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; product says this one isn&#x27;t strong enough but it is strong enough for my gums.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t require plugging in as I have only two outlets in the bathroom which are in use.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive, highly portable teeth cleaner. it uses AA batteries and a small amount of water to do a good job.</li>
            <li> When my son clicked this item by mistake, I soon asked to cancel it. I have confirmed it was before the order was processed to ship, and what they told me was just return it when I receive it. I therefore returned this item without open the box, but a shipping cost of 7 dollars was still charged from my account. Bad experience...</li>
            <li> Works just fine...no problems.</li>
            <li> Started using this end of December, 2014.  After sixty days, it weakened. June 13, 2015, stopped altogether.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and effective for travel.</li>
            <li> A little messy and a bit hard to manage at first but it sure does the job.</li>
            <li> I like this Irrigator because it operates on 2 batteries.  No need to make room on the counter for a charger.  The irrigator is portable and this model has a 2nd speed setting.</li>
            <li> I originally got this for travel use but it&#x27;s replaced my Water Pik for home use as well.  It collapses into a tiny, low profile unit that takes up very little space.  No need to mess with charging cords and AC adapters.  I thought having to replace the batteries regularly would be a chore but this turns out to be an advantage as a set of alkalines usually are good for a month or more, whereas the rechargeable batteries in my old Water Pik began to lose the ability to hold a decent charge after a year&#x27;s use, necessitating replacing the entire unit.</li>
            <li> The compact size and design make it quite suitable for traveling (although you feel compelled to pop off the tip to keep it from getting broken, and then I worry about losing it in the suitcase), but it is a little underpowered and, because of the way you have to hold your hand on the on/off button all the time, it is hard to keep water from running down your wrist and wetting your sleeve.  Better than nothing, though, so no real complaints.</li>
            <li> I have a waterpick but my wife and I used this device on our many road trips.  My wife uses it at home as well.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Love it! Compact for travel and for use at home. Holds just the right amount of water to irrigate and clean between  your teeth. Less cumbersome than the electronic models and just as effective.</li>
            <li> Have  2 other oral irrigators, Shower Breese oral irrigator that I use most every day as it&#x27;s most convenient, though the shower one doesn&#x27;t pulse and Waterpik hand-held cordless that my husband prefers.  This Panasonic is great though for trips because it is so small, not much bigger than a big bar of soap. The Panasonic pulses with vigor and cleans well with only one or two water fill-ups.  Any of them also work well for cleaning the water holder of CPAP machine.</li>
            <li> Reading some of the negative reviews of this item prior to purchase almost kept me from purchasing it.  I am glad I ignored the negative and focused on the positive.  This is my first water irrigation item.  It is easy to fill, easy to use, and easy to empty.  There are no cords since it is battery operated.  I had no problem putting the batteries in - have had it for a couple of months and have had no problems at all.  I think the amount of water it holds is sufficient for a good cleaning.  I think the two choices of speed are wonderful - I only use the low setting though because I have sensitive gums.  I guess they will get stronger over time :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first time using one of these things, the one thing that I was not aware of - simply because I just didn&#x27;t think about it - was the amount of water that comes out of your mouth.  Silly me...you squirt that much water in, you better be leaning over the sink so as not to get the entire front of your shirt soaking wet.  Yes, I did that! :))</li>
            <li> This is a very compact and easy to use device.  The instructions were simple yet clear.  My only question is how long it will last, as my other devices broke after only a year of use.</li>
            <li> this arrived and I was unable to open the battery cover to insert batteries. Long story short, the seller would not take it back, Panasonic said talk to the seller, and I eventually filed an Amazon claim, which was resolved in my favor quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have since purchased the device locally and really do like it but the other one seems &amp;#34;fused shut&amp;#34; and the seller lost any possible future business of mine</li>
            <li> Two great things about this unit, in addition to the fact that it&#x27;s powerful enough at the high speed to clean between my teeth perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It collapses down to fit in my toiletry kit.&lt;br /&gt;2) It uses standard &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; batteries.  Most of the other portable irrigators use a permanently installed rechargeable battery which usually start to fail after a year or two and then the thing is useless.  The batteries last a long time in this unit, and then you just replace them  and you&#x27;re back to full power.  Sometimes simpler is really better.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it is small, I can take it anywhere in the world and all I need are batteries. Waterpik offers something similar, but you will need a converter and the product itself is too big and too heavy when you have only limited baggage on a flight</li>
            <li> 1. I absolutely love the collapsible and portable design. I need to always have an oral irrigator close to me due to my dental pockets and the resulting severe consequences if I don&#x27;t clean them out in a timely fashion. This product&#x27;s compact design allows me to conveniently carry it in my backpack pretty much everywhere I go; not just on my frequent business trips but even for a day out in the city, for example. Plus, having blown out an AC power-supply based irrigator while traveling internationally, it&#x27;s good to never have to deal with that again. So this is pretty much a lifeline for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. In comparison to other similar products, it provides much greater accessibility to clean all the nooks and crevices. This is again critical since these irrigators tend to accumulate a lot of slime; and the idea of using a filthy product to spray water into tight spaces between my teeth doesn&#x27;t seem appealing or hygienic. This reason alone has led me to dump competing products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Unlike some other oral irrigation &#x27;systems&#x27;, this one does not come with a whole slew of different attachments. But having used such systems in the past, those additional attachments have felt gimmicky and a wasteful overkill anyway. By focusing on the essentials with this one, the designers have managed to keep the cost contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I did experience a loss of jet propulsion power 18 months into using it, which I tied back to the nozzle needing replacement. The replacement was not expensive and proved to be a good means to keep on with use of the product without having to buy new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. As far as uses outside of its obvious, life-saving use for people with severe and impossible-to-reach dental pockets, it also helps get out tiny particles that brushing or even conventional flossing can&#x27;t get to. But to be clear, it replaces neither of those other 2 activities; with each one (brushing, flossing, oral irrigator) providing its own set of  benefits. My daily routine comprises of all 3 at night-time; and if I have time, all 3 after lunch too. If I&#x27;m pressed on time at work, I may use this as a quick consolatory replacement for a full floss. Used this way, I can claim with satisfaction that I&#x27;m almost completely free of morning bad breath; and my dentist always gives me high marks for my oral hygiene as well..</li>
            <li> At first it has this plastic pipe feel out of the box , fairly large but works fine . Extending to open the area for water filling .&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks its still working nicely on the 2 batteries , good pressure and flow .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water is pumped out quickly in half a minute or so , enough to get the job done . Just as good as the bigger 110 v water Pik&lt;br /&gt;units with a little less spray pressure . For travel it can be packed together , I think this could wear out the spray tip .&lt;br /&gt;Just sliding it together works for home use . This one had the best reviews of the battery powered types .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit  After 2 years the unit needs to be pulled apart weekly for cleaning as food bits and mold can start quickly , even if the unit looks clean on the outside .Thankfully it  is outside the water cup below .</li>
            <li> Love clean and compact design. Need a nickel to open battery compartment. Works great so far! Purchased another one for my Mom.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these products for myself and husband..  They work great; however, trying to get the top open to replace batteries is nearly impossible; and secondly the batteries do not last but a few weeks at best (if you use it everyday). I would now opt for a rechargeable or electric irrigator.</li>
            <li> Not bad for its price, but needs more capacity of water for 1 time usage, I think.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m still having hard time to taking out the nozzle after using it. It&#x27;s not smooth</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, does everything and since it uses batteries was handy to use. Has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> I like this water filter but there&#x27;s a tube that  gets clogged with debris, so you&#x27;ll have to buy a replacement after a short while</li>
            <li> Very happy with this irrigator. It&#x27;s very handy, since it&#x27;s battery operated, you don&#x27;t need to worry about needing to have an outlet nearby. It works fine .</li>
            <li> An oral irrigator is a great aid to periodontal health, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this one in the short time I&#x27;ve owned it. It works well; one filling of water continues long enough for a full-mouth treatment, are the batteries are still holding their charge after three weeks of daily use. I worried at first that mold would grow in the bottom chamber, which never dries out completely, but that hasn&#x27;t happened so far—I keep it near a window for air and light.</li>
            <li> Cant believe how well this works.  Just like most Panasonic products this is wonderful.  We live half the year in our Motorhome and this fits in and works as good as my stationary one at home.</li>
            <li> This device is great for removing particles. the water pressure feels good but it is not strong enough to damage gums.  I have done damage to myself with water piks that plug in because the water pressure can be so strong.</li>
            <li> A portable water pic was recommended by my dental para professional.  I chose this one for my husband and me.  It woks well and is easy to use.  We travel a lot and I missed my regular water pic when I&#x27;m away from it.  I can now keep my teeth and gums clean always.</li>
            <li> I needed a waterpic type of device for an extended overseas trip I had planned. I thought about bringing my corded waterpic, but it&#x27;s large, hard to pack when wet, would need a voltage converter etc., so I opted for one of these battery powered machines. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have dental work that traps food in places where a toothpick just doesn&#x27;t work but this device really does the job. I was able to use it on the airplane with no trouble, and used it a few times a day for a month and a half while traveling. I changed the batteries once.&lt;br /&gt;Is it as powerful as the corded full size waterpic? No, but it does the job and when you&#x27;re finished using it, the device self stores in it&#x27;s handle making it perfect for your carry-on.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m home, I find myself using this device instead of my corded model if I need to use it in the middle of the day simply because it&#x27;s so easy to use. It is a well thought out, durable device that I am extremely happy with.&lt;br /&gt;I may just buy another and put it away in case this one ever breaks.</li>
            <li> This oral irrigator works very well, but I wish it were a little larger because I need to refill it before I&#x27;m done flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I like this little thing.. Don&#x27;t use it much right now, as it is not travel season, but it still has the original batteries in it and they are still working.. I used it for a month just after I got it and it is still running on the same set of batteries, the ones supplied. That said, I would love to use rechargable AA&#x27;s in it, but the company says I should not!! Said they could corrode!!! I talked to my phd electronics buddy and he tells me that should not be the case!!! So, who is being honest here!!!!!!!!!!!!! However, my engineer did say the rechargables would not last as long per charge as the Alkalines do. So, what, recharge them!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So.. Will see.. I think I will test the rechargable issue and see what happens!!! The little unit is really nice in that it folds up small for travel.. This is good.. and it is easy to clean, etc.. All that said, it comes with only one jet, or whatever it is called.. To get more, you have to order them.. I think you get two for 9 dollars or something like that.. One might last forever, but who knows.. I will be getting the extras to put in my shave kit, just in case. I like it and I suggest  you will too.</li>
            <li> This is a toy.  I bought practically the first one made and took it abroad.  It worked for about a month.  It was no better than swishing water in your mouth.  No strength or durability.  It holds less than a 1/4 cup of water., a waste of time and money.  It is in a landfill in Europe, where it belongs.  Maybe they have improved it by now, but the design is basically flawed.</li>
            <li> Small, convenient and does a good job cleaning the teeth. I love that it is NOt the regular bulky thing you would need to leave at your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I bought the Waterpik portable irrigator before I bought this one. The built-in rechargeable batteries in the Waterpik only last for 2 uses before needing a recharge, very inconvenient. I bought the Panasonic and I put Sanyo Eneloops in it and it just seems to run forever before needing a recharge. The Panasonic is also very powerful. It puts out a stream of water with force rivaling the top of the line non-portable Waterpik I use in my bathroom. The unit retracts into half its size for travel, which the portable Waterpik could not do, very convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for just a few weeks but I think if you turn the machine on when done and get all the water out as well as leaving the little door open you will not have a mold issue.  Also, do not collapse the machine as it will keep the machine damp as well.  I can&#x27;t believe that the owner&#x27;s manual recommends closing this up.  Anything will get moldy if you trap water inside!  So far I like this.  I previously had a Waterpik and I did worry about the mold issue as there really isn&#x27;t any way to keep that lid open without laying it on its side.  Also, the Waterpik did not last very long. I liked the way it cleaned but it lost its oomph way too soon.</li>
            <li> This product worked OK but had a short battery life.  I bought it because I&#x27;ve had bad luck with the rechargable water pik.  The fact that it folded was a selling point because I&#x27;m short on bathroom space and it fit nicely on the shelf.  Real bad idea.  It grew a disgusting black mold in the reservoir and smelled real bad.  I can&#x27;t imagine what kinds of bacteria must have been growing in it.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> Does not hold much water and hard to refill</li>
            <li> Much better than the older model. Two speeds, good design. No problems so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be subjective but it seems the battery life is longer than with the old version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor complaint - it&#x27;s too bad they changed the design of the nozzle so the old ones won&#x27;t fit. I&#x27;d take half star off the rating, but since Amazon does not offer increments of half star rating, I&#x27;ll leave it at 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my dentist told me if I dont I&#x27;ll lose two of my teeth. The product works great. It is easy to use and maintain. The seller was timely. A+</li>
            <li> This is a great portable device that beats my expectations. Easy to fill and operate and it works very well as an irrigator. I like it better than the Water Pik portable I had previously because this unit uses easy to replace batteries and there is no need to put it on a charger. It is also easier to clean and store. It is a great device for the price.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this item for my husband, whose teeth are so close together he has trouble using dental floss. He has a large, cabinet-top irrigator, but needed something he could use in the car when we travel. He reported that although the Panasonic Oral Irrigator didn&#x27;t do as thorough a job as his large one, it did a good enough job to keep his teeth from hurting after every meal eaten on the road. So far, it has fulfilled all our expectations.</li>
            <li> Works fine and is easy to use.  Seems to be as advertised.  Would order again if we need a replacement.</li>
            <li> much better than oral-B...great for travelling</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Oral Irrigator was a good buy for me, as it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room on the vanity as the tank variety with a hose. When fully assembled, it&#x27;s a little tall and the bathroom cabinet door doesn&#x27;t clear it, so I store it with the nozzle off and laying on the counter next to the unit. I&#x27;ve run it twice per day since Oct. 18 with one set of alkaline batteries and they&#x27;re just now starting to seem a little week. I expect to run it on rechargeables for a good long time, as well. I have braces on my upper teeth, so good cleaning is really important to me. My orthodontist says my teeth and gums look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, I bought replacement nozzles, but haven&#x27;t had to use them. I like that they&#x27;ve got colored bands on them so both hubby and I can use the unit (if he wants to) and we can keep track of which nozzle is ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deal! I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I works exactly as I expected. You fill with water and it lasts for maybe a minute to get empty. This is enough time to massage all your teeth.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy when traveling and camping.  Besides, hate to floss</li>
            <li> Previously I had a battery operated Conair InterPLak WJ3CS for years and it&#x27;s great, but wanted to try this one and the results are much better in the power department, it uses two AA batteries in contrast with conair which uses 3 AA and the stream of water is a bit more powerfull than my older conair with the option to go stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one downfall the water container is half the size of the conair , like 165 ml something like that, the conair has 300 ml and you can put a bit more. But is enough to do my top teeth refill and do the lower teeth. It takes less space in my sink area than the conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On how to operate this unit is not tricky, just use your common sense, otherwise read the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think this unit is sipping water with a straw, so you need to keep the bottom of the irrigator always down and figure out how to clean every single space between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody mentioned on a review to not use rechargeable batteries with this unit,I checked the manual and it is stated like so but I&#x27;ve used other products with Eneloop batteries, specially a waterproof shaver, my older Conair dental irrigator and never had a problem with these batteries, so I take the risk and use it with these batteries because this thing eats batteries alive. And I don&#x27;t want to become Duracell dependent.</li>
            <li> Great u delivered it spot on, on time. Thanks for that. The thinghy itself is a little flumsy... It&#x27;s ok i guess... It&#x27;s working fine though.</li>
            <li> Does the job, light weight and easy to pack. Great for traveling or not. Simple to operate and clean. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love to be able to travel with my water flosser.  You have to hold it a certain way for it to work. But once you figure that out it works great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t clean my teeth without it. Great portability</li>
            <li> Amazing! I want to get another one to keep at work!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with practice.</li>
            <li> good but pain to refill constantly but it works.</li>
            <li> Have you experienced cleaning with a pressure washer?  Similarly, this gadget dies the same:  thoroughly cleans up all nooks and... You know the rest.</li>
            <li> It is very good and I use every night and was felling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another one for my sister.</li>
            <li> good  that I expected,Panasonic always my favorite brand</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these for over 15 years (this is the third model). The motor brushes wear out in about 3 or 4 years, and cannot be repaired. We just buy another one. This model is the best they&#x27;ve made in terms of features. If alkaline batteries are too strong for you, start out with rechargeable batteries until your gums get healthier. Also, this model is two-speed. Also great for traveling. Biggest advantage is from flushing small food particles from under gumline -- there&#x27;s really no other way to get them out.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small unit that did not take up too much space on my counter top.  This perfectly fits the bill.  Yes, the initial battery is wicked powerful, and the replacements that I am using are not as strong.  In that, I agree with many other posters.  This does exactly the job it needs to and I am very glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Convenient travel size, uses batteries and does a great job! Easy to fill and use. Batteries last. Great if you have bridges and hard to clean spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> Great buy. User friendly and my teeth feel clean after using. Need a little getting use to to ensure that the sprayed water stays in the mouth. Happy to have bought it.</li>
            <li> -Portable and Easy to Use.&lt;br /&gt;-Spray can not be extended.&lt;br /&gt;-Better to separate the irrigator exit and water reservoir. Pump tubing is reach the bottom, when turn over the irrigator, no water goes out.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a plugin unit, but the mobility is really useful. Maybe AA lithium battery will improve performance.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this irrigator because Years ago I had bought one that you had to plug in.  Although I liked the fact that the plug in models are more convenient as far as not having to worry about changing batteries and power is always consistent.  I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it was so big and pretty much had to keep it out all the time because like they say out of sight out of mind.  So I opted for something that can easily be put away.  The system works well and the power is good...would like it to be a bit stronger...the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because batteries don&#x27;t seem to last very long...power diminishes after about a month.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My gums became stronger and less bleeding. I like to feel fresh after using this irrigator.</li>
            <li> Wore out two WaterPik 450 units in under a year. Used everyday in shower...WaterPik battery life dropped off pretty fast.  Had to recharge every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic is easy to use, strong jet power and batteries have lasted for 3-4 weeks based on daily use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip the WaterPik...not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Our teenager just got braces and my husband wisely suggested a water irrigation device.  She loves it, it is easy to use and portable.  He has the countertop waterpick, which is a real machine and not conducive to kids to use, fill the reservoir, etc.  This she loves - we bought a spare for keep at her dad&#x27;s house when she visits.  Very affordable - actually was free when you shop with your amazon card points!</li>
            <li> Now made in China.  Definitely not the same quality as my old one that wore out after many years of use.</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as the standard plug-in waterpik which I use at home but it is a great size for travel and the reservoir is sufficient.  On speed 2 it works well to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a WaterPik at home and use this Panasonic away from home. The only problem I&#x27;ve had with the miniature one is getting the spout out of the opening after using it. Must be a trick I haven&#x27;t mastered yet. But it works wonderfully and effectively. My dentist LOVES the fact that I use an oral irrigator. Great gums!</li>
            <li> For what it is - a battery powered dental water pick, it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now, and don&#x27;t have any complaints. Compared to a standard dental water pick, the capacity to hold water isn&#x27;t as great and there are only 2 settings - low and high - but that&#x27;s ok. This Panasonic Portable Dental Water Irrigator takes up less space when not in use and is much quieter than the standard countertop model I used years ago.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great! 6+ Months on a battery. I love this thing. 2 settings for speed, and it is extremely portable. If you need a travel water pick or even just an entry level one this thing is seriously the best i have had. I gave away my plug in unit and i only use this now.</li>
            <li> The best thing I have done for my mouth period! I needed this since I travel for my job and it ideal.</li>
            <li> Had the original model for many years but it became sluggish and actually needed to be replaced several years ago.  But could never find it again and was not happy with any of the other &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; travel models, because of their size and bulk.  And now Panasonic has come out with a new model that, if anything, is better than the original.  Kudos to them.  I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> love its portability and size.  Do not like the power of the spray is much less than what a powered unit provides and that the battery life, even with the most expensive batteries is less than expected.  With the lower pressure of the spray comes the added problem that it appears to clog very easily, from what, I do not know but requires significant &amp;#34;due diligence&amp;#34;  to be sure it will operate with out problems when you next use it.  I would recommend to others for travel purposes only and not for daily home use, as long as all preventative maintenance is carried out each and every time it is used.  Update:  motor still turns but unit stopped working after sitting unused in draw for some time......be warned to not let it sit unused as it may stop functioning all together</li>
            <li> It is pretty good.  For the first few years, it let me travel and water floss.  The minor and important design flaw is the water tank can&#x27;t be open up to clean inside.  So, after several years of use, bacteria grows inside wall of the tank.  Just have to buy one every few years, until they come up with a better design.</li>
            <li> It feels really good on your teeth, portable and easy to store even if you have a tiny bathroom. Don&#x27;t use cold water it hurts and its a little tricky to put the batteries in. Otherwise supper happy I got it</li>
            <li> I only had the unit for 5 days, but after double checking with flossing in some of the harder to reach areas, the water jet seems to work just as well as the dental floss tape to dislodge stuff from in-between the teeth. The irrigator also seems to have opened up the areas between the teeth since the tape is now getting in between the teeth a little easier (has never happened in several years of just flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is easy to use (got it going without even reading the instructions) and the tank lasts for half the mouth (meaning for ex. lower teeth, front and back) at the slower speed, which for me is not a problem since the tank is so easy to fill up. I personally felt the higher speed was a little too strong, so stuck with the slower one.  I&#x27;ve been using it with water only followed up by rinsing the mouth with mouth wash, same as when I did with regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, this is much more convenient than flossing, but will update review after I see my dentist again in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 6/19/14: Went to the dentist today. All periodontal readings improved, there was also almost no bleeding during the probing. Also the hygienist had much less trouble doing the cleaning - she usually has to be pretty forceful between the teeth, but today was quick and easy. At least to me the oral irrigator is proven to be a good replacement for flossing tape and the process takes maybe 1/3 or 1/4 of the time. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Correct and fast delivery. Very useful appliance for teeth and gums hygienе and protection</li>
            <li> Works great. Used it during travel and saved a tooth.</li>
            <li> tried once, worked good. Taking with travel and expect no less. Water tank is for single use only, makes sense. this is intended for travel, but may be used at home. will work on two-AA re-chargeable batteries. do not understand the instruction recommendation. must be conscious when the performance reduces, as when to change the batteries. Priced less than WaterPik for the same results. No complaint, so far.</li>
            <li> This item was great for vacation travel. I liked the fact that it was compact and did the job. I also liked the fact that it ran on batteries and didn&#x27;t need a charger. Of course it could have had more power, all guys want more  power.</li>
            <li> Works well, I usually fill it 2 or 3 times per treatment. And I love the fact that I can take it on trips easily.</li>
            <li> The tool functionally works, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it without water flying out of my mouth and making a big mess. The tank holds a large amount of water, which is nice. There is definitely enough pressure for the tool to work effectively.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s attractive (for a water pick), easy to use and easy to fill/empty.</li>
            <li> This works well.  A little awkward to hold and use but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> so far so good. Work well on braces, and it&#x27;s potable and compact compare to waterpik!!!nice design!!</li>
            <li> not as good as a regular water pic</li>
            <li> I have not used this item before but was recommended by my hygenest&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will get more comfortable as I use it</li>
            <li> The other 5 star reviews explain how I feel! I&#x27;m just confirming that it&#x27;s a great device! EVERYONE should have it! They will be Christmas gifts this year!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice improvement over the old model&lt;br /&gt;This model replaced one which I had had for at least 10 years and I liked it very much. This new one is bigger and gives a longer irrigation time and it even has 2 speeds. It&#x27;s still compact and does not take up much room on the bathroom counter. I have not used it yet for travel, but it will take a bit more luggage space than the old one did.  All in all, I prefer this one much more.</li>
            <li> Coming from using a WaterPik for years, I saw this was battery operated so decided to try a switch.  It&#x27;s inexplicably simultaneously more painful and less effective.  Water is a pinpoint so can make well-flossed and well-taken care of gums bleed.  But the power at the highest level is so weak it doesn&#x27;t get the stuff out from between your teeth.  I used my WaterPik as a confident replacement for flossing when I didn&#x27;t have time for both.  This you must continue flossing because it won&#x27;t do the trick.  It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s collapsable for travel but there have been many times that it would start collapsing while I was using it.  Gets very scummy inside over time and there&#x27;s not a really easy way to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going back to WaterPik</li>
            <li> There maybe other good products in the market, but with this price I think this one really worth it. It&#x27;s small and easy to carry. Haven&#x27;t found any problem yet after used for 1 month.</li>
            <li> Base holds enough water in the base to flush your whole mouth but is still compact enough to fit your hand and not take up too much room on your sink.  Easy to re-fill. Works well on two AA batteries.  Folds up nice and compact for traveling.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. You don&#x27;t need to charge it during your trip. I did recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> still works fine, had it 3yrs.</li>
            <li> My dentist insisted I get something like this, (water pick) to help my gums.  Its ok but messy.  It may be me but the water sprays all around.  My mouth feels nice after I use it.</li>
            <li> Leaving for a trip to France and didn&#x27;t want the hassle of using an adaptor for my electric water pik. This fits the bill completely. I find it to be powerful enough.</li>
            <li> works ok could be more powerful, easy to use, nice size for travel, the way it folds up is a nice size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had two of these little devices and they are awesome to use prior to brushing with my oral B electric</li>
            <li> I have one and love using it. I bought another as a gift so my traveling friend could take it on the GO.</li>
            <li> Bought it to spray my cat. Works great!</li>
            <li> This may be a good quality product. It may be a theoretically well designed product. But it is absolutely useless. It does not generate nearly enough pressure to even remotely approach the pressure needed to do the job. There is still no portable replacement of a plug in WaterPik</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these; both grow mold inside the unit, despite following the manufacturer instructions to drain and air dry the unit after use.  The second unit was redesigned which makes it a little easier to remove the tank and disinfect, although the manufacturer recommends NOT removing the tank.  However, even the second one is now growing black mold not just in the water tank but in between the plastic parts of the housing, which are not accessible.  I like the idea that it&#x27;s battery operated; yes it does eat through batteries pretty quickly as many other reviewers have commented.  But that I can overlook; black mold I cannot.</li>
            <li> This is great for one person. Not big. Sits on sink. Fill it up with warm water and wham. Wow, the stuff I first got out was gross. Happy with purchase. Great price. Does a wonderful job. Battery power is strong enough for a complete cleaning. It must be popular, because the price jumped about $8 since I purchased it a week ago. Shop around.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth clean at work. Getting food trapped in my teeth at lunch breaks was becoming a big problem for me. This is not as strong as a plug in irrigator but it is stiill effective. Rechargeable would be great but so far the batteries have lasted well anyway. The size is very convenient and packs away easy. Be sure to drain all the water out at the end of your teeth cleaning so it doesn&#x27;t drip in your luggage.</li>
            <li> arrived and loving it.. !!!</li>
            <li> This is a great oral irrigator and I have purchased a few for my wife and grandchildren. It has a two speed pulsating water flow and is very portable.  It is a good value and I think you would be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Had some products that has pipe and the pipe is easy to broken and hard to fix.</li>
            <li> I like it. It was recommended to me by my dentist. This model of the irrigator is very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> This product is convenient to use and does an adequate job. My criticism is that the batteries need to be replaced frequently -- or the force of the water becomes so weak that it does not do an adequate job. If you are satisfied with the low setting, you could replace the batteries less frequently. I have to replace them while they still have &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; because they are not providing enough power to produce a strong enough water flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I prefer this model to the ones that recharge through an electrical cord.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of pressure to get the job done and very portable. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> this is the second one I have owned. It is perfect for travel and everyday use. They seem to last for years.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an oral irrigator but wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it so this seemed a relatively inexpensive entry into the field. For what it is it works welll but can&#x27;t help but feel that a more powerful model with a greater water capacity would be better.</li>
            <li> His and hers. These are great for portable battery operated irrigators. I have used this type and brand for years. They seem to always improve on the model, and my mouth and teeth love the experience.</li>
            <li> At home and at our beach condo I use a Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush (WP-900 )  also purchased through Amazon Smile.  This oral irrigator allows me to &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; while away from home/traveling for work.  The water reservoir is not super large so often times I need to fill it twice to do my mouth as long as I do at home but the function is there.  Replacing the batteries every few months is needed and it is certainly not as strong/forceful as the Waterpik model but it does the job for a few days.</li>
            <li> Water pressure is weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mildew smell or.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too easy and use in the office&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove water, and then dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Not bad still getting use to it I guess.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking to get extra cleaning done.  The water on high is kind of messy but once I got the hang of it, I just used the low speed.  Yes, there are 2 speeds which is a good option.</li>
            <li> I have never used a device like that, and bought it from amazon since it was on sale at the moment because I was curious about it. It was easy to set up, I needed a coin to unscrew the battery compartment, then I had to pull out the green water tank, insert the spraying end, fill the tank with water and it was ready to go. The power button is conveniently located at the side, and I am able to use it without looking. It is a big slider, and it works well even with my hand being wet. There are two settings, I used only lower setting since I do have problems with my gums, and this is what the instructions suggest. YOu need to insert it in your mouth, bend your head down, and turn the appliance on. Keep your mouth slightly open so water has a way to go, you would not be able to hold the whole tank contents in your mouth! Even on low setting, the water stream is quite powerful. There is a learning curve on how to make sure you get to all your teeth without spraying the whole bathroom, but it is possible. Make sure you fully extend the water tank, or it might collapse when water gets low.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having another cordless one from Waterpik.  The problem with the Waterpik is that their rechargeable batteries are not replaceable.  Mine stopped charging after about 1 1/2 years and is now completely useless since it doesn&#x27;t even operate when plugged in (by design).  Waterpik does not sell any cordless models where the battery can be replaced so I opted to instead purchase the Panasonic one since you can replace the batteries. This Panasonic one operates and is just as effective as the Waterpik accept that the Panasonic is more portable.  I recommend the Panasonic if you want cordless but do not want to have to replace the entire unit when the batteries need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> excellent in handling the tube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular water pics for years and was tired of the mess and size.  This one is cordless(battery operared), handheld and stores in my medicine cabinet.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and after 5 months is still running on the same batteries. I only use it about 4 times a week.  i just put a little mouthwash in it and fill the remainder with water.  I would recommend this irrigator to anyone who has used water pics in the past and is tired of the mess and counter space they take up</li>
            <li> Second one for me. I had the previous model for almost 8 years and it finally gave out. l travel extensively and this is an accessory no road warrior should be without</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 12 year old son who has braces.  He used a Waterpik flosser on a daily basis and I needed something for him when he sleeps at friends houses or for sleepaway camp in the summer.  This is perfect.  He has only used it a couple of times but it is easy to use and does the job.  Nice and compact for travel.  It is kind of bulky to hold when you actually flossing but he doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem.  If you are looking for an inexpensive water flosser, then this is a good option.</li>
            <li> Nice travel size and for home use, stores away easily in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries have lasted longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Worked well. A bit clumsy to hold and the tip should be longer but is designed  to fit in the flosser when not in use which does compact nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I bought one about five months ago. As I recently noticed in other reviews, this thing can end up hosting mold that cannot be effectively cleaned/removed from the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I learned the hard way, apparently it can grow a mold that attracts ants. These ants are so enamored of whatever it is inside the device, that they will climb up the device, up the nozzle, and climb into the device. Did I mention I discovered this the hard way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I chucked the thing, and I&#x27;m going to have to find a more &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; water flosser.</li>
            <li> Very useful product. Excellent value, fair price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> love this water pick no tangling of tubing had for at least 2 years</li>
            <li> always wanted to try one of these things because sometimes brushing and flossing doesn&#x27;t seem to quite cut it. tried it and don&#x27;t like it. to use it properly, at least for my mouth, it&#x27;s hard to avoid spraying water everywhere. didn&#x27;t really seem to work real well either way. just not worth the money or the hassle in my opinion. not a terrible product or anything but just not for me.</li>
            <li> if you want to use the best oral irrigater try the panasonic ew-dj10a much better than a electric type i use mine every day the batterys have lasted for 60 days good stuff  later jim</li>
            <li> My husband and I both cannot live without this product.  We have tried several more expensive water pic and they always broke after a few months of use.  This one works just as good as the higher priced ones and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I am rating this 4 stars only because it&#x27;s a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this product so it&#x27;s hard to comment at this time.  Shipping was great and it was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised over the last month, using it once per day and 1/2 tank fill.  Sufficient power at higher setting and compact for a small counter space.  I use a mix of 1 part Listerine and 2 parts water, and then flush the irrigator with tap water to prevent potential damage by the Listerine.</li>
            <li> Great battery driven Waterpic and mush better than original rechargable WaterPik. Pressure is great and it folds up nice. Highly recomended for travelers</li>
            <li> Convenient, easy to use. Would like more settings.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, usage wise is quite good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;2 AA Battery can last for quite long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Feel that it can really clean up the teeth/gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;Not very durable, Item stopped working after I drop it&lt;br /&gt;Water also will go into the battery compartment. Not sure whether it will affect the component</li>
            <li> Works great to flush food articles away from my son&#x27;s braces.</li>
            <li> Great product !!!! I highly recommended getting this unit along with a rechargeable toothbrush and Glide Oral B Health Pro for a healthy smile.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mine for a little over 2 years and it is like new and with great results. It does uses a lot of batteries, but I like it better than the electric noisy units.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this and ordering a full size plug in waterpick. For the price of nearly $40 this is a disappointment. I used one for many years and then stopped, I don&#x27;t know why because I loved it.  This has a weak flow at the highest pressure setting and I have used it several times without being able to get all the way around my mouth, at some points I can&#x27;t even tell where the water is hitting because it is so weak. I came back to take another look at them and was shocked to see I had paid this amount for this toy. Another $10 &amp;I have a machine. I thank the gentleman for the video as I see it is what I was used to using with a small enough footprint that I won&#x27;t mind. I guess it would be better than nothing for travel but there&#x27;s no comparison</li>
            <li> It is a good travel water pick, but the pressure is not strong enough compared to a regular one.</li>
            <li> This the worst product I ever purchased from Amazon.  As the water reservoir empties, the on-off switch sinks into the reservoir, so that the user cannot shut off the irrigator.  We cleaned the attachment, and several family members tried it.  Everyone hated it.  I threw this away; I did not feel that I could return it used. I reordered the Waterpik Flosser, which my husband and I have used for years.  For not that much more money, the Waterpik removes an incredible amount of material from between the teeth.  It is well-designed, rechargeable, and made of high quality components</li>
            <li> I have a burning dislike to flossing. Takes to much time and to do it properly is on the wrong side of painful, but this irrigator blast the stuff out quickly and I&#x27;m done before I know it; sans pain.</li>
            <li> It died after I changed to second set of batteries. The life of this machine is too short. Not much money, but the quality is low.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is perfect for using in the shower.  I fill it with warm water from the shower head and there isn&#x27;t any mess in my sink. doesn&#x27;t get any easier!</li>
            <li> An economy version of the higher-priced models. OK by me.</li>
            <li> nice, works and cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> Shape makes it awkward do use, and the on/off switch is difficult to operate. Does the job, but design is flawed and could it have been much  much easier to use.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic Oral Irrigator. The first one lasted for 4 years with daily use. It works well and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Handy for travel. Not as powerful as I would like, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> So far it works quite well. My only complaint is that the batteries do not seem to last very long. It slows down and loses pressure when the batteries start to get low.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well -- gets out food that brushing and flossing don&#x27;t get to -- a must if you eat a lot of popcorn!!  I love it.  Easy to use - easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Hated this product.  Not even worth one star.  It&#x27;s very hard to shut off after used if you don&#x27;t use all the water you put in it, you will spray water everywhere.  If you tip it a little it spills too.  Waste of money, buy one with a hose for the water.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to purchase this while it was on sale, but if I&#x27;d known how much I&#x27;d love this I would have bought it sooner. It&#x27;s convenient because it takes up very little counter space, and doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now, used it daily, and the batteries are still going strong. It has 2 speed settings, although I find the first setting to be strong enough. I fill it once with just water, then I refill it with water and a touch of mouth wash. The results are a cleaner, fresher feeling mouth.</li>
            <li> I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. IT IS POORLY DESIGNED AND LEAKS WATER ALL OVER WHEN USED. THE BATTERY OPENING IS ALSO POORLY DESIGNED AND CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son, who has braces.  It works awesome, even for a 9 year old to clear food, etc.  Very happy at this point.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much worthless because it is so underpowered, delivering perhaps one-third the water stream that a full-size plug-in irrigator does, like Waterpik.  Yes, I know it&#x27;s designed as a portable device, but it simply does not do the job properly of dislodging food particles between teeth. I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great product, received promptly.</li>
            <li> SMALL BODY WITH AMPLE POWER TO FLUSH！ONE BIG PLUS THAT IT USES BATTERY SAVING SPACE FOR CHARGER.</li>
            <li> Just ordered another unit, to have a spare for travel. This is great unit at a fair price. Had a different brand previously, did not last long or hold as much water.  This works great.</li>
            <li> love it, but have to refill water frequently</li>
            <li> This is the second one  I&#x27;ve owned.  Takes a lot of batteries, but the convenience makes up for it.  I&#x27;ve had the plug in type and they are large and a pain</li>
            <li> Love this product. I love that is works great and Its compact. I wish I didnt have to buy more batteries and I do wish it was  rechargable. I havent used rechargable batteries just yet but its on my list to get. Def worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the best dental tool I have ever used. It gets out more debris than flossing.</li>
            <li> as always panasonic works great...........</li>
            <li> Was the first time ever I  used an Oral irrigator in my life and it felt violent in my mouth, but. went ok after the 2nd time - using not the highest preassure, but nr 1, it is still feeling like the job is done in a minute! I am using it so far at home, but it&#x27;ll go abroad with me soon... I enjoy using it! It does a great job in a little time and stimulating your gums(you even can feel it afterwards)  I feel using preassure nr 1 is good enough for anyone and in the middle of the night I used to feel crumbs, in the mouth, and now no more. it&#x27;s comfortable to use and personally, i love the color :). As  the recommended brushing time is 2 minutes - using an Oral Irrigator shouldn&#x27;t  take 2 more additional minutes because the mouth(or the gums) don&#x27;t naturally need so much work on them. so 1 minute of using the Irrigator is already enough for you to feel the difference. and you do feel it! It&#x27;s soft on the gums and taking all debris out, in just one minute. It does a great job and I love the product!</li>
            <li> Despite daily emptying and cleaning the inside casing developed blackish mold.  Not a product I kept for long.</li>
            <li> Great. Taking a trip. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than I thought, and doesn&#x27;t hold enough water (you will have to refill it at least twice), but I think it&#x27;s a good choice for the price. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s portable though... NOT small enough.</li>
            <li> I have dental implants and water flossing is a must to keep them healthy.  This is a great addition to my water pic, as it&#x27;s easy to travel with. The pic detaches and stores inside the device. It holds enough water to get thru your entire mouth without refilling.</li>
            <li> easy to use - no electrical cord like on most</li>
            <li> This works well and does the job. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to finish the job. I have to hurry too fast or refill. I am learning to get things done with one filling of the reservoir. I am glad I made the purchase as I love the fact that it is battery operated.</li>
            <li> Be warned: The battery cap was virtually impossible to remove when the item arrived. I&#x27;m a very experienced handyman but the cap had me stumped. If I was the proverbial little old lady then there is no way I could have gotten the cap off. The cause of the problem is that the cap has a rubber gasket that keeps water out, and that rubber welded itself to the walls of the battery compartment. If there were batteries inside, removing the cap would have been a matter of tapping the unit on a hard surface and the weight of the batteries would have forced the cap off, but with an empty compartment it&#x27;s a different story. There is nowhere on the cap to grip it with pliers and the cap is flush with the surface of the unit.</li>
            <li> Using the Irrigator twice per day I had to replace the batteries in 10 days. After two cycles of battery replacements the unit would not pump water out althoght I had even replaced with new batteries. Back to Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel and it works just perfectly!  I love that it can use AA batteries.  Great find and great buy!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Perfect for travel! Easy to use, and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially enjoy that it is cordless!</li>
            <li> I like it, used to buy similar one at Amazon, didn&#x27;t work only 2 weeks after I received it, Panasonic is an reliable brand, hope this one is better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for well over a year now, and it&#x27;s doing a remarkable job.  My dentist checkups have improved since using the waterpik.  I especially like that it is battery operated which makes it so easy to take on trips.  This has traveled with me to San Diego, Iowa and Mississippi; lightweight and easy to pack.  Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Like surfing with my teeth- Kowabanga!</li>
            <li> I used it in the office. It just perform quite similar to waterpik model which use at home. Just one thing, the stock batteries can last 4 times of use only. It took me $$$$$ to buy 1900mah eneloop batteries. sadly, they will last 5 times, but anyway they are rechagible.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would be effective and safe space.  This does the trick. Fits nicely on the counter with all the cosmetic items we women collect. The two speed are very helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the neatest thing! Very compact, easy to use and does a good job&lt;br /&gt; getting food out of hidden places! My teeth really feel clean now!</li>
            <li> Because of the reviews on Amazon, I bought this product.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  The power is very low and I really don&#x27;t feel any benefit by using this irrigator.</li>
            <li> It is better than nothing when you are on the road somewhere or far away from home. Not very powerful to clean between teeth properly, but not very weak either. I hope it will last long enough for the money paid for it.</li>
            <li> I had a water pic for years,but this is simply the best.Easy to use and no recharging.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy</li>
            <li> Works about as expected!</li>
            <li> Compared it to Water-pic: holds more water, sturdier. Penlite batteries seem to be holding up and lasting fairly long. Easy to operate. Inexpensive. Not a one, but a TWO year warranty. Pleased. Do not use to clean your ears.</li>
            <li> Been using this model for a year now and no problems. I do change the batteries monthly but its worth it. Should&#x27;ve bought 2.</li>
            <li> To keep it dry after use takes some time. It is messy to fill and even more so when using it so be careful not to take it out of your mouth until after you shut it off as, although it sounds like it is done, it isn&#x27;t necessarily and you may end up squirting the wall, mirror or floor! If you position it correctly it does a good job cleaning inbetween your teeth especially if you are dental floss challenged like I am. I don&#x27;t think a more expensive one would be any better performance-wise but the shape of this one is a bit bulky. I will continue to use it until something different comes along.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product but water gets sprayed everywhere</li>
            <li> I just received this product and immediately tried it out.  For someone who doesn&#x27;t floss (weird phobia of mine, can&#x27;t take the sound or feeling), this is perfect.  It cleaned between my teeth very well and only freaked me out a little bit.  The pressure was good, I even used it on the lower setting and it did its job.  It&#x27;s easy to refill, so the 40-second run-time is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I have braces on my teeth - ulk-I&#x27;m to old for braces, but anyway, I was taking a week long trip and since I love my oral irrigator I have at home, I knew I would miss it.  so I got this and it really did the trick.  I got all that crap our of around my braces and teeth.  It packs nicely.  the only problem - which I now know, is to clean the outside of the container before packing it up.  I must of had something on the side when I closed it and that got inside, and was a pain to clean.  But I still love it.</li>
            <li> I think I like it?  I don&#x27;t know.  After 3 weeks of using this thing, I still don&#x27;t have a comfortable way of using this product.  I have no pattern that works.  I have some gripes, but maybe they&#x27;re not gripes.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not a very good Oral Irrigator user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is big.  It&#x27;s cumbersome to hold and maneuver through your mouth.  I&#x27;m a big guy, with big hands, and it&#x27;s uncomfortable even for me to hold.  I feel like the design makes it difficult to move this thing to effectively clean all of my gums.  I can get the outside gums fine, but the inside ones are really difficult for me to reach, for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it&#x27;s size, this tank runs out of water quickly.  It says something about &amp;#34;45 seconds&amp;#34; in the product description, but that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re using the low setting.  If you&#x27;re using the high setting, it&#x27;s much less than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is collapsible.  The white section that contains the motor squashes down and is contained within the blue section for easier storage.  When you extend it, you&#x27;ll feel a little click that tells you the unit is locked in a fully-open position.....or so you think.  The suction from the motor drawing out the water from the blue tank causes it to kind of close down on itself in the middle of you using it.  That may not sound like a big deal, because you can re-extend it, but trust me, when you&#x27;re using it, it&#x27;s very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The function of the unit seems good, from what I can tell.  I feel like I have a very clean mouth when I&#x27;ve finished using it.  The design of this thing does make me think it&#x27;s going into my travel bag, and I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a different product with a larger tank, and more comfortable wand-type sprayer.</li>
            <li> This Oral Irrigator was recommended to me by my oral hygenist, and I guess I need to read the descriptions better - I was surprised to find it was battery operated!  2AA&#x27;s - come with it.  So - I&#x27;m not sure how long the batteries will last, but so far it&#x27;s 3 weeks.  Installing the batteries was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; in that the 1/4 turn battery cover was reluctant to spring out, but it eventually did, I put a touch of 3 in 1 on it to aid future battery changes.  Other than this all is well.  Plenty of cleaning power on the slow speed, haven&#x27;t felt the need to use the high speed.  The water reservoir capacity is adequate - I find I need at least two fills per cleaning.  This irrigator should be conevenient for those who travel because the top part can be pushed down into the water reservoir when empty, for compactness.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic irrigator was amazed at it&#x27;s capacity and force of spray and the ease of packing it in my suitcase.  Charles</li>
            <li> as title, and much cheaper than here, but not use it frequently as not get used to it yet. one suggestion is if you got a power toothbrush, this thing is not necessary for most people</li>
            <li> I was using a Waterpik which was in the ensuite, but during renovations to the ensuite there is not enough bench space for the Waterpik, so i got this. Works almost as well, but the tank doesn&#x27;t quite hold enough. Not a big deal as it&#x27;s easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;Nice and portable to take on holidays.</li>
            <li> not bad for the price</li>
            <li> This product is very good。Customer service is very nice，To help solve the problem！</li>
            <li> I have own two of this waterfloss so far. The first one last about a year until the motor is dead. It pumps out the water strong enough to remove all food paticles. My second one lasted less than a month. The water sipped into the battery chamber and blew out the whole unit and batteries in it. The retractable design made it prone to water damage.</li>
            <li> used it on our last travel.  convenient and easy to use. did not have to change the batteries even after using it 2-3 times a day for 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Even after flossing and using my new Sonicare toothbrush this Irrigator dislodged food particles lodged in and around my crowns and bridge.</li>
            <li> it works well, good quality but the water tank is a little bit small. (okay the 6 more words required.)</li>
            <li> excellent irrigator; it replaced a Toilet Tree irrigator that stopped working; batteries are replaceable too</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated flossing. It was painful, and since my teeth are slightly crowded I never felt I could be very effective with the flossing anyway. This is exactly what I needed. I do a lot of weekend sleepovers and go on occasional vacations so I needed something I can take with me. I really feel the water blasting through between my teeth with this product. I was using the low setting at first but now I&#x27;m up to the higher setting. I do have to refill it one time, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the portability of this tiny and powerful machine. Being able to use it in the shower is another HUGE plus. No yucky spatter all over the bathroom mirror and sink :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the power stayed super strong throughout the battery life, sometimes I feel like changing the batteries before they even run out!</li>
            <li> Great travel item.  Larger reservoir than older models is great.  Nice that it uses batteries so you do not need to pack a charger.  Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very well made portable irrigator.  Works as well as a sink top model.  However, the size of the thing it is a little awkward at first. The reservoir holds enough water to do your entire mouth.</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that it&#x27;s so easy to have sitting on the counter ready to use.  The bad thing (in my opinion) is that the pressure is way too week.</li>
            <li> with this irrigator, I got clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I have to use an oral flosser daily to prevent a recurrence of gun disease.  This is the perfect size for traveling.  Thank you Panasonic for making this product.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This works better than I expected. I have had it for a month and use it every day and haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet!!!</li>
            <li> After years with the earlier model, it slowed down, so I opted for this newer model. It&#x27;s not really much better. It serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Tried to make my life easier, but this device is not a true substitute for floss, it helps when you are lazy, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I will sometimes add a little mouthwash and really warm or slightly hot water when I have gingivitis.  I&#x27;ll hit that spot for an entire tank and typically, when I wake the next morning, the soreness is gone.  It&#x27;s simple home remedy that beats going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> received the product yesterday, packaging was good and within 20 minutes I was using the product in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;the pressure is definitely much stronger than I expected. This is the first time I am using the water pik or any such item.&lt;br /&gt;There was some initial bleeding since I was pointing nozzle right at the gum. But later on it was so good and it felt great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very usefull. I like it.</li>
            <li> For traveling where weight is an issues this irrigator is a good solution. Well made and functional just don&#x27;t expect the power of a plug in unit.</li>
            <li> The item works very well, easy to use. It is portable, which is what I was looking for. However on my first trip the gasket broke and leaked so I could not use it on my first trip. I was in a high altitude area and I dont know if that had any effect on the gasket. When I returned home the gasket worked and the item did not leak, it was fine. So I will still give it a 5 start rating even though I had a temporary problem with the item.</li>
            <li> This is my second oral irrigator.  Be careful of mold accumulation.  I like the product because it travels well and  it does not take up my bathroom sink space.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t cost much. It does the Job. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use , very convenient !</li>
            <li> This works really well but boy did it hurt the first few times. I will admit i don&#x27;t love to floss so I decided to give this a try. Its a bit messy but if you stick with it its gets easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> Worked fine at first - and the battery life was acceptable, but then a couple of times after putting in a second battery, the pressure suddenly dropped.  Thinking it was the battery, I tried a second and a third battery.  Still no change.  Still scratching my head.  Are all my batteries bad?</li>
            <li> Came on time.  Works reasonably well but is a bit uncomfortable to use due to the large size of the base.</li>
            <li> It does the job well!!!</li>
            <li> Great for travel. Easy to clean and carry in your bag.</li>
            <li> I am a dental professional and had never used Panasonic brand. I am very pleased.This irrigator was purchased to replace a very old style of oral irrigator. It was a gift for my 8 year old grandson who has orthodontics. He loves it and mom stated it is so easy for him to use correctly. I just purchased my husband one also.</li>
            <li> Love to have something that will contribute to keeping those oral pockets clean that I can take with me on trips.</li>
            <li> This irrigator is compact, easy to use, and not another bulky machine you try to squeeze on the edge of your bathroom vanity.  I have used it daily since I received it (usually fill the reservoir twice to make sure I get the entire mouth covered).  I have also added small amount of hydrogen peroxide to expedite the healing of my gums even though it is not recommended by the manufacturer.  For the price, can you beat it?</li>
            <li> Works great; just wish the water reservoir was larger so it could hold more water... it has to be refilled too often during use.  But it is designed to be portable, so... I guess I should have purchased the countertop version.  It does what it says it does, though!</li>
            <li> I bought this portable irrigator in March of 2013. It worked really well for one year and three months.  Now, it seems to have an issue with its motor.  At first, I thought it was the battery and replaced it with a new one.  Still worked very slowly.  Then, I replaced the battery with a lithium battery.  Still works very slowly--at about 10 percent power. When the unit was working, it was great. I wear braces and almost have to have an irrigator to use 2 or 3 times a day--even when I travel.  And this unit was my travel irrigator.  My main one is a Water Pic--and it is wonderful.  This one was great for travel.  However, seeing as how I used it only for travel and at our cabin in the mountains, I think its shelf life is not very good.  Will I get another? Probably--but only because I need a compact travel irrigator--and this one seems to be the only one I can find.  Let&#x27;s hope the next one lasts longer.  Are you reading these reviews, Panasonic?? I hope so.</li>
            <li> This is a great travel product. The stream is not as strong as I like it to be for daily use, but for a battery-powered travel irrigator, this is perfect. I love that it compacts down to a smaller size, and it is very easy to fill up with water. It is a bit bulky and may be difficult for smaller hands to hold as noted in other reviews, but I have not had difficulty with it. One issue I have run into is the water reservoir does not always stay extended - it sometimes likes to pop up while I&#x27;m using the device. It does not interfere with its operation that I can tell, however, so it&#x27;s usually a simply matter of just pulling it back down into place.  It does have self-storage for a head, but it can only store one head. If you travel with one or more other people and all wish to use the product, you would have to carry the additional heads separately. The reservoir is adequate for one person, depending on how much irrigation you need/want. For the most part, the reservoir has been sufficient for me to clean my entire mouth, but if I have had to refill a time or two after eating a meal that leaves more particles between my teeth. Regardless, this irrigator does a great job of getting stuck items out of your teeth and leaving your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Had this for two and a half years now, still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> l love this flosser.  It is portable and works well.  The battery does&#x27;t last as long as I think it should.</li>
            <li> Bought this one for a friend because I have used the first one for over a year.  Does the job and very portable.</li>
            <li> best part is, its portable...so when I travel and at work...i can use it..</li>
            <li> As for the workings, I loved the pick, but it lasted less than a year. The first batteries lasted about 6 months, the second set 3 months and the last set not even a month. I am going to switch to a little more expensive flosser and an electric one to see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> I love this water pik! Runs on batteries completely cordless. Works Great! Would buy again! I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> I have learned that a water-pic treatment daily will save many dental bills, &amp; promote oral health.  I bought this unit to take on trips, &amp; am completely thrilled with its intelligent engineering &amp; performance. I have been a fan of PANASONIC quality since I first used their radios in the 1970&#x27;s.  This little gem is so smart &amp; usefull. Unlike rechargeables, this uses batteries.This is good, because when traveling you can&#x27;t leave it on a charger. My trip lasted about a month, &amp; the batteries lasted that long. It is completly WATERPROOF, so you can use it in the shower &amp; not make any mess at all. it is easy to fill &amp; telescopes into its own reservoir for compact carry. NO BUYERS REGRET HERE!</li>
            <li> This oral irrigator has the perfect pressure. I have bought others in the past and they have so much pressure, they hurt. I would recommend this Panasonic Oral Irrigator, even for children.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an oral irrigator for years. This model has plenty of power and does an excellent job preventing a build-up of plaque or tartar at the gum line. It blasts away stains between teeth too.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this product suits our needs for travelling or use at home it is compact and easy to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Good--Cleans quickly and thoroughly. Good battery life.Simple to use.  Easily portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad--Unit is very difficult to clean. Both the pick compartment and the water tank become moldy with time. Haven&#x27;t figured out how to clean the tank and don&#x27;t want  to be forcing mold spores into my gums. Sorry to say, but I&#x27;m going to toss it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugly--If you like good industrial design (think iPad) this unit is butt ugly from its clinical blue to its ungainly shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could give it a better rating, but the mold build up is a real show stopper</li>
            <li> Very useful and handy in cleaning teeth. I use it daily at least once a day. very portable, thinking of keeping one in the office too.&lt;br /&gt;Speed buttons are a bit tricky to operate while using the flosser. when full extended for use, sometimes the unit does not lock firmly enough and slides back slightly when switched on.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does only a fair job of irrigating the teeth and gum line.  Even on the high setting the jet stream is mild compared to other products.  The biggest fault is that the batteries last only about a week so you need to buy them in bulk.  It is convienient for traveling as it can be collapsed into a compact size.  I like the convience of a cordless unit but I have yet to find one with the power of a plug in Water Pik.</li>
            <li> All my family use this. I purchased four of them. Easy to use and my mom and i use it everyday. I use this before i brush my teeth at night bc it actually cleanses the things that cannot be done by brushing teeth. I have some problem with my gum and it really helps when i use it consistantly.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  It has enough power to get the food out.  So far, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent for traveling or using at home.  No cords attached to the wall.  It uses 2 AA batteries.  Batteries need changing every 6 months approximately.</li>
            <li> Not so great. Shot water in my eyes first time.</li>
            <li> We have used this on trips for easy packing and convenience. I have to buy extra tip though because the unit has only one tip for one person</li>
            <li> Love this product and good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to purchase this instead of the more expensive brand. It&#x27;s powerful enough to blast food out in hard to reach places like the back molars, water capacity is adequate and also retracts to a compact size for travel.</li>
            <li> Use it once a day. Water power drops off with battery use.&lt;br /&gt;Compact with small footprint on sink counter. Does good&lt;br /&gt;job of removing particles from teeth.</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate more than flossing is visiting the dentist.  This unit is better than my waterpik and I can take it with me on the road.</li>
            <li> First off let me say I&#x27;ve owned a Waterpik home unit for several years and love it. I picked up their travel version and couldn&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic unit has a quick/easy refill, folds up and takes replaceable batteries (you can always put rechargable AA&#x27;s in it, at least they&#x27;re serviceable). Already way ahead of Waterpik travel.&lt;br /&gt;The attachment stores in the side of the unit and it closes up into a nice small size.&lt;br /&gt;2xAA batteries last a little over one month of daily use. As they wear down there is a noticable decrease in the waterjet power, at which point setting #1 or 2 both feel weak.&lt;br /&gt;It generally takes 2 fills per cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#x27;m guessing this rarely happens: one of the times I filled it and it wouldn&#x27;t spray for more than a few seconds, eventually figured out the filler tube in the reservoir was still curled up instead of resting on the bottom. Shaking it pulled it down. You can also pull the water reservoir off for cleaning or service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment pic it came with is different than the main Waterpik one. It has somewhat of a jagged design and I&#x27;m used to more rounded ends. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed it during use at all. This is probably intentional so there&#x27;s not too much water pressure on your gums. (I only use the #1 setting most of the time anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems of quality construction, especially for the cost. I expect it to last many years.</li>
            <li> A little hurt for the first few times using. But it really helps my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Use this on a daily basis for a couple of years and couldn&#x27;t do without it anymore.</li>
            <li> simple and good item. i use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I got this cordless irrigator on a sale for a good price and I have to say it works almost as well as a much more expensive one I had purchased on advice from my dentist which finally died after a few years. It takes batteries but I use rechargeable a and I&#x27;m happy with it. You fill the reservoir and I usually use about 3 refills each time and then I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s quite a good product and for the price you got a cordless pitiable product that is damn near as powerful as a much more expensive one.</li>
            <li> i actually like it very much, i don&#x27;t think the pressure is as strong as the Water Pic, but it still does a good job &amp; so portable.</li>
            <li> Love the portability and the price. Does a great job, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with battery life. I even put a weak listerine solution in it a couple times with great results. Even if it lasts only a year, I&#x27;ll consider it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought this a year back and stocked up one more and introduced it to my cousin. Best irrigator without the hassle of tubes and power cords.</li>
            <li> I use a water pic every night bu it was too bulky for travel.  This is a perfect solution.  Powerful and holds plenty of water.  Folds up into a small size (the nozzle fits inside the outer shell.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Okay travel flosser because it collapses but awkward to use. Toilet Tree is still the best cordless  flosser, but doesn&#x27;t collapse for travel.</li>
            <li> Having used Waterpik for years with the problem of each unit failing to hold a charge after just a few months, Panasonic has found the solution with a battery operated unit.  I immediately ignored the recommendation not to use rechargeable batteries, and it works fine, so that is an option too.  It is more compact, better looking, it performs better than Waterpik&#x27;s product, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with the wires, the plug and the ineffective rechargeable unit.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Returned it and purchased the Toilettree one, much better.</li>
            <li> Thats is a high tools for cleaning my tooth</li>
            <li> I purchased this water flosser to take on a trip to Europe.  I use a WaterPik at home and this product works just as well.  It is easily transportable and cleans between the teeth very well.  It is lightweight and fits easily into your carry on.  This product, for its price, works as well as the expensive ones.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great irrigator. I was worried than when I travel I won&#x27;t be able to use my water-pik. This product is great, elegant design, functional. Love it, its a joy to use.</li>
            <li> rather bulky -- small reservoir -- would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as I hoped. The reservoir is able to do less than half of your mouth if you aren&#x27;t racing through and doing a good job. So you have to fill it up 3 times to do anything decent.</li>
            <li> Bought a WP350 long ago .... was OK but always had to refill water for a cleaning session &#x27;cuz tank couldn&#x27;t hold enough water.  The Panasonic holds enough for one thorough cleaning session.  Had to recharge the WP360 unit frequently .... would do only 3 to 4 sessions.  I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic every night for about 2 weeks now on the 1st set of AA batteries .... still going strong.  Another annoying thing about a rechargeable unit is that eventually the rechargeable batteries fade and would not hold a charge long .... this happened in about a year or so.  And, with a charging unit, don&#x27;t forget to pack it for your trip, as had happened to me.  With the Panasonic, extra batteries are easy to carry and available everywhere in the world (and btw, the batteries anywhere are the same voltage ... no worries about current/voltage compatibility nor an adaptor plug ... hate those english outlets).  Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Good. I always use it in my trip.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this hand held irrigator. I knew I would not use a big and bulky one. I fill this up and use it in the shower. It does run out of water fast, but is very easily refilled. The pressure works well on low for me.</li>
            <li> Has the two key features I wanted--powerful and portable! I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now and am very happy that after extensive research I picked this one to buy.</li>
            <li> Works well and it is very portable. It gets food particles out even after I&#x27;ve used regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> I thought this would make a good item to have on trips, but it uses up a lot of battery life and gets moldy, to boot. Not pleased.</li>
            <li> Really good for those who travel a lot, small size and easy use. It is the first oral irrigator I have, the current is strong enough.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It works great and I would not be without it. It removes any food left behind by brushing and&lt;br /&gt;makes your mouth and teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> I just returned from a trip and enjoyed using it.  It was great not to worry about carrying an electric cord.  I used the lower speed and felt like it was doing a good job irrigating my mouth.</li>
            <li> Positve  Good pressure option for those who are sensitive&lt;br /&gt;light weight handy, and portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negaative:  lasted only two moths&lt;br /&gt;battery requirted makes for inconsistent performance&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In shdort;;If you are buying this for one vacation this is a good choice</li>
            <li> LOVE this ! Works great!</li>
            <li> Had owned a Panasonic irrigator before. It lasted over three years. Bought another brand which only worked for a couple of months then the motor kept getting weaker until it stopped after 6 months. This looks like a different design but hopefully will last as long or longer than my other Panasonic irrigator.</li>
            <li> I am traveling throughout 220 volt countries for a month and my reachargable  waterpik  only is rated for 110.  This battery operated unit does an acceptable job of flushing food remains.  Not a substitute for floss and not as strong a flow as the waterpik but it works as expected</li>
            <li> It worked well for about 2 years (warranty period), and then the internal tube became disconnected.  I cannot get it back into the flosser, so it is useless at this point.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. I have used it for couple of months. I found that it is very convenient for travel. I &#x27;ll recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Works really well and size is very good for travel.</li>
            <li> It actually work better than the waterpik portable one. I like the fact that it uses batteries instead of recharging it all the time. Very portable and small.</li>
            <li> Makes Irrgiation while traveling possible. A bit overpriced for what it is</li>
            <li> Have used it regularly. 2-3 x a day. Mainly because my mouth feels better than ever. Have found since aging food gets stuck between my teeth. Vigorous flossing does more damage. This works great. Easy, once I got used to it. Because I travel, this is easy to transport. Hoping it stays this way because I really am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Eliminates the need to take a transformer or cord charger. Great for camping as well. Good constuction. Compacts to fit in travel toiletries bag.</li>
            <li> works great in the shower</li>
            <li> Best water floss! Blow water pick  away easily, better design and build with quality material.</li>
            <li> Very handy for traveling and at home!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service.</li>
            <li> Love it - amazing how much is left after brushing - very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This portable flosser is a good tool.</li>
            <li> I have a bridge in my mouth &amp; have a difficult time flossing under it. Saw this as one of the deals of the day, &amp; thought I would give it a try. I went to the dentist the other day &amp; he said I was doing a good job keeping that area clean.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a few years.  it is perfect for travel...pressure of water great.&lt;br /&gt;Important part of oral care.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a deal of the day, not bad at the price I got it at..but it&#x27;s just alright!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two (2) of these irrigators in the past couple of years. They worked fine for around six months, and then gave out. The tip wouldn&#x27;t squirt the water properly and I am stuck with two unusable devices. Never again; I&#x27;ll pay a bit more and buy at Target.</li>
            <li> Good for travel, haven&#x27;t used it a lot....</li>
            <li> Only use this in the shower - water sprays everywhere!!  Guess I am a bit undecided about the usefulness of this irrigation, but it is messy, as water sprays from your mouth and goes everywhere!!!  It&#x27;s fine when I use it after showering since everything is wet then anyway. If it helps keep my gums and teeth healthy then I&#x27;m all for it - will tell at my next dentist visit.</li>
            <li> GIVEN AS A GIFT - the recipient said they liked it!</li>
            <li> Could spray a little harder but very nice overall.</li>
            <li> This arrived in 2 days and has been a good product. We would recommend it to those who need a good irrigator.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well and packs readily for travels.</li>
            <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t live without it. The big advantage: I can take it with me everywhere. Other&#x27;s have complained that the reservoir rune out too quickly. What are you kidding me? It take about 5 seconds to reload. Way better than a big clunky &amp;#34;Waterpic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> When I first put it together it seemed awkward, but it was designed for travel so can&#x27;t have everything prefect.  When I used it,  hmm kinda splashed water in my mouth (and everywhere else) didn&#x27;t really clean like I thought it should. Then it stopped working on the 3rd use. Amazon was great about taking it back, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since 2010. It does a fantastic job of getting &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out from between teeth and in the gums. It&#x27;s very portable and fits into a quart size zip lock bag for travel.  This has greatly reduced the time and discomfort when the dentist cleans my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank holds plenty of water (and mouthwash) for a cleaning. No cords is even better. I use Panasonic envelop rechargeable  batteries (the best I have ever used). A charged set of batteries lasts more than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually mix a capful of Listermint mouthwash with warm water in the unit. I think this keep the unit cleaner as well as my mouth. I also will clean the unit with a bleach (Chlorox) solution of less than a half an ounce per tank about 2x per year to kill anything that might start growing even though I use the listermint mouthwash in the tank. For the Chlorox cleaning, I fill the tank with the diluted solution, run about 1/3 of the solution through the unit. Let the unit sit for at least 1 hour and then run the rest of the solution through it. I then flush several tanks of plain water through the unit to clear any bleach residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and just got braces.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect and saw this pretty cheap as a daily deal.  It works great.  Really knocks the food stuff out of my braces.  It doesn&#x27;t get in the way.  I use it for only about a minute or so each time, so I don&#x27;t imagine the batteries will wear down all the quickly, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to find out.  But, if they do, I have plenty of rechargeables.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using panasonic irrigators for years, this model is lightweight, portable, uses 2 AA batteries, has 2 settings (for sensitive gums) you&#x27;ll be amazed at the stuff that gets flushed out you never knew were in there. the first few uses may cause a little bleeding but not to worry, its because the trapped food and bacteria causes irritation/ inflammation on the gums. when theyre healthy again they will not bleed when squirted so just keep at it</li>
            <li> Good product. Portable however it uses a lot of batteries.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS TO A DEGREE BUT HONESTLY THOUGHT IT HAD MORE POWER TO THE PRESSURE PULSES BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESNT PERFORM UP TO ITS STANDARD.</li>
            <li> This is the single best option, other brands can&#x27;t compete (specially in the battery section)&lt;br /&gt;Great flow and battery life also, great price!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I threw away a waterpik a year ago because it was such a hassle, took up too much space, needed to be primed all the time.  I love this panasonic and I think it does just as good a job!!  It takes up no space, has 2 speeds, and when the water runs out, you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase but being able to replace batteries rather than the entire unit sold me. This functions better than the portable name-brand that has just died because it would not hold a charge anymore -- nor would it work plugged in. This Panasonic portable is extremely easy to use and does an excellent job. Five stars, Panasonic, for making a terrific product at an affordable price. My pearly choppers say \\&quot;thanks,\\&quot; too.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about using another gadget even though my dentist urged me to purchase this oral irrigator. Only $30 or so from Amazon. So, I bought and started to use  it. Not that difficult; in fact it&#x27;s easy. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly and efficiently. Best of all my mouth feels really clean and wonderfully fresh. I&#x27;m a convert and recommend it to all my friends and family. See if you don&#x27;t agree.</li>
            <li> I bought this for it&#x27;s portability. I am very happy with the product and does the job as intended. Batteries last a decent amount but as they weaken the force of the water decreases as well.</li>
            <li> Teeth and I only just got this, but I must say it totally squirts water into your teeth and gums and makes one feel there cannot be a single microbe left.</li>
            <li> As an adult with braces in the past two years I became fanatical about keeping my mouth healthy.  In those two years I bought and used 2 different rechargable Waterpik flossers, both of which refused to charge after a few months (a common problem) and became expensive trash.  When replacing the second one I decided to go with a non-rechargeable model and purchased the Panasonic instead. I am very pleased.  It&#x27;s more compact, takes up less space in my bathroom, comes apart for cleaning, and packs a punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My braces are gone but I&#x27;m still using my Panasonic because it does a fantastic job and it helps to keep my gums healthy.  I like it so much I&#x27;ve bought another for my braces wearing nephew, and now that the price has been cut I&#x27;m going to order an extra for my home.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic upgraded irrigator with two speeds is a much improved version of the two others I have owned.  I like the disconnect feature on the units tip.  I like the reservoir that seems larger than those in the past.  But the real improvement comes in the two speed  feature that can be made more gentler while operating than it&#x27;s predecessors.  And the price has stabilized lower than earlier units.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic Oral Irrigator for about 10 years.  [[ASIN:B0027LSEPS Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A]].  I used several Water Pik products before moving to Panasonic, but I stopped using Water Pik products because they turned into junk about 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To extend the life of this Panasonic unit by 2 or 3 times, pull it apart right away after each time you use it.  That is, pull off the water resevoir, open up the plug where you fill it with water, and store the resevoir upside down, so it dries.  Then turn the rest of the unit on and let all the water squirt out of the body and pump.  Try to get out as much as you can.  Then store the unit that way until you&#x27;re ready to use it again. Don&#x27;t reassemble it again until you&#x27;re ready to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little vaseline or similar lubricant on the O rings every few months is also a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one other thing, even drying it out the way I suggest, mold still tends to grow inside the resevoir and in several places on the outside -- even on the Jet Pik handle.  Use an old toothbrush and some Peroxide to clean or wipe off any mold you see.  You can also soak the Jet Pick in Peroxide overnight to clean it out and help keep mold from growing in there.  And if you have a piece of wire or small enough brush to fit into/through the Jet Pik, use that too, to help clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow these tips and you&#x27;ll have a cleaner Water Pik that lasts a lot longer.  Good luck.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I liked this so much for travel that I used it for every day. I guess that was too much because now it only has half the power with fresh batteries. So I had to knock off 2 stars. And it&#x27;s a battery buster and says not to use rechargeables. So I got a waterpik and now use this only for travel. Tips: keep it clean always. It helps to soak the tank in 1/2 bleach and water for a few minutes after extended use. Be sure to read how to clear the water out after use or you&#x27;ll get a musty smell, especially if you store the brush with water in it. Perfect for travel because it&#x27;s light weight when folded up. Worth it if you travel a lot and don&#x27;t want to miss. Just don&#x27;t use it every day or it won&#x27;t apparently last as long.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones which are electric.  So much more convenient to use with batteries.  I can take it with me everywhere when I travel because it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my suitcase.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> This water pick is very easy to use and to fill, and I just keep it on the vanity next to tooth brushes. Just enough water pressure, which is amazing for a battery operated device. It does the job irrigating the way back areas that are hard to rech by just flossing. Very pleased with product and price.</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little more powerful. I like the size and portability. Uses aa batteries which is a plus. I like to use rechargables</li>
            <li> compared with other brands, this entry level irrigator is cheap and as good as the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use with 2 power modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it has a large water container to hold sufficient amount of water so that I can floss my teeth with just one time water topup.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who had just got his braces and was having issues using the special floss from his orthodontist. He loves it! You have to seal your mouth around the nozzle to keep from gettin water everywhere, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. The reason I chose a 4 is because it is a little bit awkward in my hand. Also it said there were two tips and I received just one. Goes through batteries much too fast. I&#x27;m going to try using rechargeables.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me about the Panasonic Oral Irrigator while visiting her in the states last Fall, so I tried hers and was sold. I couldn&#x27;t have a new one sent to me in Australia so I took hers and ordered her a new one from Amazon. So we&#x27;re both happy. Recently I read a review where the user said that hers was losing its power, even put in new, or different,  batteries, with no change in performance. I panicked since I don&#x27;t know how long my daughter had this one before I took it. Mine just recently started to slow down, less power in the pulsing. I put in new batteries and I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it now works like new. I always love the  way it makes my teeth and mouth feel. Plus it&#x27;s so easy to use and the price is right. If you&#x27;ve not had an irrigator and hesitate to invest in one, this one is great, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. You will use it and see particles when you rinse your mouth that your tooth brush missed. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was surprised. Some people had complained about the lack of power. We think the product is great a good buy.</li>
            <li> Having used 5 different oral irrigators and this one by far out preforms even those in the $50 to $100 price range. Use high output batterys to increase its performance and life.</li>
            <li> Great product! Bought it for my 12 years old daughter, for her braces. Much easier and faster than flossing. She doesn&#x27;t have to charge it every night. So less stress for me. Battery lasted surprisingly long... After 3 month still Ok. I think she is using at least twice a day. Easy to use, works great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I give this a 4 because I knew what I was getting by reading other reviews.  Reservoir is small, but so easy to refill, not a big deal. Plenty of power for my purposes.  Not nearly as powerful as the plug in kind.  If you want a lot of power levels and a pause button, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> convenient, small, portable, powerful; batteries run out in a month and have to be changed.  Better than bulky full -sized one that sits on counter and looks ugly.</li>
            <li> This is a great Product and very Portable as well. Would recommend owners to use rechargeable batteries for this water pik .</li>
            <li> Compact and simple to use.  Helps to clean out the little pockets between the gum line and the teeth, which no amount of brushing will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> NO wonder this Oral irrigator is recommended by dentists everywhere.  It is a must for dental hygiene and keeping your gums clean.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who recently got braces,it works very well for that,be carefull though this thing is powerfull and can hurt if not used properly</li>
            <li> I took this item on a recent trip and it worked very well.  The size is good and collapses well for travel.  Operation is straightforward and the reservoir is sufficient, although some people may need to refill it depending on how long they need to run it.  I have not had it long enough to go through a set of batteries, so cannot comment on battery life.  The manual states that the batteries should last for about 30 uses.  The only fault that I can find is that the jet is a little too powerful even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Works well, had it for months now. Good pressure, but it is not a substitute for flossing!&lt;br /&gt;Throw a little mouthwash in the tank with water for an extra clean feeling. Great for trips or at home and a good price.</li>
            <li> [Update: It just stopped working. And, like many products offered to the U.S. Consumer, it can&#x27;t be fixed or recycled, so it will end up in a landfill.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because my full size &amp;#34;Hydrofloss&amp;#34; product is too big and heavy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s inexpensive, portable, lightweight and works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s not as powerful as the the plug-in model I keep at home, but it will suffice for a one or two week trip.&lt;br /&gt;* If I were traveling for a longer period, I would schlep my full size model.&lt;br /&gt;* The little hinged door that opens for fulling is flimsy, I expect it will break after repeated use and Panasonic will not have a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;* If you want to be thorough, you may need to fill two or three times per use.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s a good idea to let this dry out completely before re-use, and clean periodically with vinegar to avoid bacteria build-up.</li>
            <li> Messier tha a traditional water pick. But it serves the purpose when you are away from home.</li>
            <li> GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;I own this water flosser. It is so much easier to use and encourages you to floss when you are lazy or rushing. It is not as effective as string based (polytetrafluoroethylene or nylon) flossing. So, a combination of both is better for oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD:&lt;br /&gt;* As battery runs out, strength of the water jet also fades gradually.  Electronics design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;* I came across users complaining about mold and mildew issues for other models (where water is stored permanently and flosser plugged in to the wall socket). I always empty my flosser and let it dry. Yet I noticed pink mildew inside my nostril. It is hard to see. Put a torch on its outside surface and see through the hole.  Fix is simple. Get regular cooking vinegar from your grocery store. Immerse the nostril in vinegar for a day. It cleans itself. Note, this is a common issue with all water based flossers.</li>
            <li> This one is not as good as the dark blue one that they used to produce.  What I don&#x27;t like, is where the on and off buttons are which makes it uncomfortable to use.  They are too low and should be higher for easy access.  It just doesn&#x27;t fit in your hand well. What I do like is for traveling it&#x27;s easy and convenient and it does do a good job!</li>
            <li> I have 2 implants and this has helped to keep food out of them without flossing.  Sometimes even after I brush my teeth with the sonicare and use this, I still see foot particles come out in the water.  It is a wonderful product.  Very handy for traveling as well.</li>
            <li> works like it should.</li>
            <li> was not sure at first because of the small water tank but lasts long enough to get the job done. very pleased. 4 stars because there is only one nozzle. there&#x27;s room in the device to potentially store more</li>
            <li> Very good for small size.  Plan to use for travel.</li>
            <li> this has a nice water jet with 2 speeds and works well,  but its a little hard to clean thoroughly</li>
            <li> The product worked well for about 10 days. It became sluggish and had very little pressure after that. Thinking it would be resolved with new batteries i exchanged them. The problem was not resolved and now I&#x27;m left with a low pressured automatic water gun.</li>
            <li> My gum was swollen because my braces were tightened and since I started using this a week ago I have already noticed significant improvement. Although it&#x27;s kinda yucky, it feels good seeing food particles trapped in between teeth and gums getting flushed out so easily with this wonderful irrigator. This irrigator is best when you can&#x27;t floss yet because of time constraints (or you&#x27;re just being lazy like me). But I&#x27;d recommend combining the use of this with conventional flossing for an optimal result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t really go wrong with the quality of its performance compared to its price. It&#x27;s portability is also an indispensable feature if you&#x27;re on the road all the time. However, this may not be for the picky ones as this doesn&#x27;t have all the fancy tips like Waterpik. For beginners and those wearing braces, this is a very good place to start with oral irrigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning the water chamber, I have yet to find out how. (It says in the manual that came with it - but who reads it?)</li>
            <li> About 90% of the oral irrigators on the market are designed for families sharing family-size bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us living alone - about 28% of all Americans - finding a place on the counter-tops of our typically tiny bathrooms for these behemoths is a major challenge.  Plus, we also have to be concerned about where to plug them in.  In short these irrigators just don&#x27;t work for singles living alone in small spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it was discontinued about 4 years ago, I happily used the battery-powered Water Pik Traveler 350W.  Key feature was the reservoir which - for traveling - inverted over the base power unit.  The irrigator tip was connected to the base with a hose which neatly coiled, and stored in the reservoir, when not in use.  Measuring only about 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot; x 1,\\&quot; the 350W could almost fit in palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my 350W gave out, (plug-in models simply are not an option for me), I&#x27;ve tried probably every battery-operated travel irrigator.  There are a couple available with separate reservoirs.  But none compare to the old 350W with respect to power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the currently-available travel models have done away with the hose and attach the tip directly to the battery case atop the reservoirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find these bulky units very difficult to use - as has been commented on by earlier reviewers.  Hard to hold onto.  Nearly impossible to direct the water jet to where you want it.  Especially hard to get to the backs of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, like other reviewers, I find the unavoidable drip of used water spit onto the unit and sometimes down my arm very distasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, agree with other reviewers, the Panasonic is impossible to clean.  Can&#x27;t imagine what the designers were thinking.  Once you deal with the mold problem in the bottom of the reservoir, all kinds of nooks and crannies need to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I change the batteries - about every 3 weeks - I remove the reservoir (don&#x27;t be afraid to pull really hard) and soak it in bleach.  I clean all the crevices with toothpicks and Q-tips. Takes me about 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have also learned that the Panasonic must be kept vertically at all times since the battery section is not water tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - if you angle the unit - for example, while trying to get to the backs of your teeth, you will be compromising the life of the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learned after a couple of trips to remove the batteries completely - unless you can figure out a way to keep it vertical the entire time you are in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two Panasonics I&#x27;ve had died after about one year.  The pumps just stop working.  But in each case, the Warranty has been honored.  Keep the box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.... the Panasonic is the best of the Travel irrigators currently available.  It&#x27;s the only one I have found which has any power at all.  But that&#x27;s the best I can say about it.  Wish someone would bring back something like the Water Pik 350W.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I would highly recommend it!  I was actually looking for something very compact for traveling, however, to my surprise was much bigger than I thought it would be, but I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It was usable from arrival until Feb 16, 2015 when it ceased to operate. I reinserted batteries after a long flight - would not respond. Batteries were tested in a flashlight, still effective. I returned home March 8, now responding to your review request. Need to reread original documents. Returnable? Replace?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month, using it nightly, and I&#x27;m pretty pleased. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, as it is my first irrigator. One downside is that it is pretty loud, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The reservoir is enough water to do my entire mouth.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ONLY BEEN 2 WEEKS SINCE I STARTED USING THIS .......... SO FAR GREAT....... VERY EASY TO USE ... WATER RESEVOIR  IS LARGE ENOUGH..... YOU CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE AFTER USING IT .... CLEANS VERY WELL...... QUALITY WE SHALL SEE I&#x27;M GOING TO GIVE IT SOME MORE TIME THEN I WILL WRITE A NEW REVIEW...... WORTH EVERY PENNY ! OK .... ITS NOW  4/17 2014  AND IT STILL WORKS GREAT ONE THING DON&#x27;T USE CHEAP 99 CENT  BATTERIES THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE ENOUGH VOLTAGE TO RUN THIS UNIT WELL ...OTHERWISE WORTH EVERY PENNY  !  AS USUAL PURCHASING FROM AMAZON ...............  THE BEST !  5  STARS .....................  JONRICK</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL FOR BEING SMALL.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  GREAT SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Not quite as powerful a water jet as I expected, but the unit works okay.  It is sensitive to the angle you hold it at -- you can not turn it sideways without uncovering the uptake tube.</li>
            <li> I bought this water flosser because I travel alot. In fact I will be going to the UK for 5 weeks this summer and as it takes a couple of AA batteries I don&#x27;t have to plug it in any where or charge it up. I just carry it in a ziplok bag. Like I say if you wear braces this really helps, I also carry a bottle of water. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband and I each took one of these to Europe with us recently and they worked great. Since the rechargeable irrigators only work with 120 current, these were a perfect answer to traveling abroad with an irrigator.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit because it was small,relatively light weight and used replaceable batteries.  I was going on a 45 day trip and could not lug my home irrigator.  It did exactly what it was supposed to do and I am very pleased and would recommend it for what it is intended.  I did not expect it to be the same as my much larger home irrigator but for it&#x27;s size it did better than expected.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands go to for traveling with braces.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well, easy to use, and does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you have braces</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased. The first two died after about a year after buying (motor failure). This is terribly annoying since we like these and they do a good job - and most importantly, we take them along when we travel. Now I have to fork out another $30 for our 4th Panasonic oral irrigator. You would think Panasonic could do better on the quality part. They need some strong competition in this niche market.</li>
            <li> Fill with a mixture of mouthwash and water - really makes your mouth feel more refreshed and cleaner than just brushing, flossing and gargling.  Could use a little more power but at least this way it&#x27;s never uncomfortable and you can&#x27;t damage your gums.  Just make sure you keep the spout in your mouth while turning on and off with your lips closed around it, otherwise you will have spray everywhere!</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN THE ORAL B ONE I HAD THAT THE BATTERY GETS WET AND CORRODES, NICE PRESSURE, GOOD DESIGN, EASY TO FILL</li>
            <li> Not the strongest on earth but wonderful. It gets stuff out of your teeth. I have tooth pain from fillings slowly falling apart. This gets the mystery pain and moves it away. The plug in ones are definitely better to the point of pain on a 10. But this is so incredible at work or for kids that can&#x27;t keep themselves plugged in.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product for travel - compact size but full-featured!  Would highly recommend it for the road warriors.  Great Panasonic quality as always.</li>
            <li> I have tried other oral irrigators, but this one is the best.  Compact, no cords, no hoses and the battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent pressure and portability. This is my second one and am very happy.</li>
            <li> Works great, reservoir could be a little bigger but no big deal. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Easy to easy, compact and convenient for travel or every day use. Battery life is good. Works as well as my old plug in model.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but it died three months after purchase. I don&#x27;t think that i can return it but i may buy another in hopes that the death of the first one was a fluke.</li>
            <li> I bought it two months ago. I used it less than 10 times. I found out the motor dead. It didn&#x27;t work at all, even replace the new battery.</li>
