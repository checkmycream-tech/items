            <li>This sound might be a great sensory experience for some kids, but in a school setting it is distracting and we had to remove it.</li>

            <li>He&#x27;s a strong chewer</li>
            <li>My son has mild autism and often chews on his shirt for sensory feedback, when we see him start we offer a chewy tube and he seems satisfied with that instead of the shirt.</li>
            <li>They were great when the back teeth were coming in.</li>
            <li>These Chewy Tubes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are great but the red one would be the one for my child&#x27;s age</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>and he quickly discovered how to make a whistling sound with it.</li>
            <li>I just need to remember to keep a clean Chewy Tube on hand everywhere we go.</li>
            <li>Our special needs son loves these,</li>
            <li>I have a special needs son that loves to mouth and chew on everything.</li>

            <li>Each color is a different firmness and width, my boys love them!</li>
            <li>The chew tubes are well worth the moneh.</li>
            <li>Love these, bought them for our son and he has not been able to chew through them as he has with some other brands.</li>
            <li>My children love these more than any other product like this that they have tried.</li>
            <li>However the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Getting these has very much helped.</li>
            <li>it helps with the teeth grinding, ive tried everything and this helps a lot, there are only so many lolly pops i can give him,</li>
            <li>Exactly what my son needed</li>
            <li>CAUTION though, these are noisy and I don&#x27;t recommend sending to a classroom as it would be very disruptive!</li>
            <li>One of the first &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34; that he likes to hold and chew on.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more chewy tubes in the future</li>
            <li>Works exactly how we need.</li>
            <li>Very durable and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>My child loves them, regular teethers suck in comparison, these are way better.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sensory U!</li>
            <li>He loves to chew on them and they really help!</li>
            <li>Work very well with the right child.</li>
            <li>The different textures and density of the tubes, the easy to hold shapes are so good for little ones with sore gums.</li>
            <li>When I had a child of my own, I struggled to find a &amp;#34;teether&amp;#34; that was soft enough to chew on yet durable.  </li>
            <li>They are very durable.</li>
            <li>She has a very overactive gag reflex.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these for chewers that NEED to chew!</li>
            <li>this has really held up and even if a piece did come off</li>
            <li>delivery was prompt and the price was reasonable...</li>
            <li>My daughter likes the red, green and blue the best.</li>
            <li>That being said he doesn&#x27;t use these very often either.</li>
            <li>old who has oral issues right now, but my 10 mo.</li>
            <li>The necklace ones are nice but don&#x27;t seem to last long</li>
            <li>And my older kids like to use them as whistles.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for child with oral sensory issues.</li>
            <li>He loves tha green ones the most.</li>
            <li>His favorite was the green one with the dots.</li>
            <li>For a child with major mouth sensory issues, these are really helpful.</li>
            <li>Right now I am using the smallest (yellow) one with my 7 year old son.  </li>
            <li>6 month old boy loves them!</li>
            <li>old loves them too!</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old son LOVES these!  </li>
            <li>really helps calm her down when she is upset.  </li>
            <li>And so far, we are please.</li>
            <li>and I use this with a 7 year old with ASD.  </li>
            <li>Since buying these my 2 yr old has stopped chewing up his toys</li>
            <li>When he starts to have a tantrum and we redirect him to use his chewies it helps calm him down.</li>
            <li>Initially got these for my 5 year old son with Autism, but my 11 year old son with ADD immediately took to them too.</li>
            <li>The blue is very thick and would probably be ok for an adult, but not a child.</li>
            <li>My baby and my 3.5 year old both love chewing on these, sticking the short end completely into their mouths, blowing on the ends to make a little whistle (not loud enough to be terribly annoying), and generally making great use out of them.</li>
            <li>The green and blue are super though and he hasn&#x27;t chewed thru yet after 6 months.  </li>
            <li>My little one needed harder chewy tubes and for the cost of these four it is totally worth it.</li>

            <li> Initially got these for my 5 year old son with Autism, but my 11 year old son with ADD immediately took to them too.</li>
            <li> The blue is very thick and would probably be ok for an adult, but not a child.</li>
            <li> My baby and my 3.5 year old both love chewing on these, sticking the short end completely into their mouths, blowing on the ends to make a little whistle (not loud enough to be terribly annoying), and generally making great use out of them.</li>
            <li> The green and blue are super though and he hasn&#x27;t chewed thru yet after 6 months.  </li>
            <li> My little one needed harder chewy tubes and for the cost of these four it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace a lost green chewy tube for my 3.5 year old.  </li>
            <li> My son has delayed motor skills and loves putting things in his mouth for oral sensory stimulation due to his medical condition.  </li>
            <li> We are not new to the benefits of chewy tubes.  </li>
            <li> And where he eats the hands off action figures out other little plastic &#x27;nubbins&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Iv noticed that after buying these toys, he&#x27;s less likely to chew his toys now.</li>
            <li> My son is 5 years old and chews on them hard.</li>
            <li> The downside is that it&#x27;s hollow inside</li>
            <li> so money well spent.</li>
            <li> My 2 yr old autistic daughter loves it, it relaxes her when frustrated especially loves the green one because of the different texture, I received pack on time exactly what I had seen online.</li>
            <li> my three year old with autism chews on this when he gets a little anxious.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I expected but not too small that child can fit&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> He has tons of other toys</li>
            <li> My son has an oral &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; due to some developmental issues.</li>
            <li> Got them at the recommendation of my sons OT, helped him stop chewing other things.</li>
            <li> The knobbies start to break down</li>
            <li> My daughter who has down syndrome grinds her teeth.</li>
            <li> My son is autistic and has some issues with putting things in his mouth to chew on them.</li>
            <li> It may save us a few books from being gnawed to death.</li>
            <li> The yellow ones are quite thin and not recommended for a heavy chewer.</li>
            <li> I also sometimes have him wear it around his neck, but he usually takes it off.  </li>
            <li> (I usually have to give him the chewy - he&#x27;d rather bite his nails).</li>
            <li> He has always had a need to chew and had a hard time giving up a pacifier.    </li>
            <li> My daughter chews HARD!</li>
            <li> It wouldnt choke her but still not a pleasant thought.</li>
            <li> Her grinding has decreased a ton by doing this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid he chews through them, eventually they start breaking apart unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> and Im afraid she will swallow one.</li>
            <li> And we were going crazy with frustration when telling him to stop (</li>
            <li> He chews on these like crazy and then doesn&#x27;t need to chew on anything else.  </li>
            <li> He has even figured out that if you blow on the base of the tube, it becomes a whistle...</li>
            <li> i know it doesn&#x27;t have nasty chemicals in it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We bought these and I thought our son who loves to chew on things would ignore them. He loves them and they&#x27;ve made a difference in his behavior</li>
            <li> my three year old with autism chews on this when he gets a little anxious. it helps with the teeth grinding, ive tried everything and this helps a lot, there are only so many lolly pops i can give him,</li>
            <li> My son is autistic and has some issues with putting things in his mouth to chew on them. These chewy tubes are a wonderful option to help deal with that. We simply hand him the tube and tell him \\&quot;chew on chewy not your toys\\&quot;. Wonderful product and they hold up pretty good as well. He has chewed on the same tube for months now.</li>
            <li> Work very well with the right child.</li>
            <li> Love these, bought them for our son and he has not been able to chew through them as he has with some other brands. I like that they come in a pack of 4 with different chewing surfaces and the price is good as well on these.</li>
            <li> My son is constantly chewing on things - toys, his fingernails, etc.  Now, when I see him chewing something, I hand him his chewy.  It works great - I also sometimes have him wear it around his neck, but he usually takes it off.  My only wish would be that he would like it enough that he would seek it out himself (I usually have to give him the chewy - he&#x27;d rather bite his nails).</li>
            <li> Exactly what my son needed</li>
            <li> Excellent sensory stimulation item for children on the spectrum</li>
            <li> My son has multiple disabilities and always had his fingers in his mouth or toys. Getting these has very much helped. He loves tha green ones the most. When he starts to have a tantrum and we redirect him to use his chewies it helps calm him down.</li>
            <li> Great for sensory issues.</li>
            <li> The Chewy Tubes have been perfect for our son with autism. He has always had a need to chew and had a hard time giving up a pacifier.    We got the combo pack because we weren&#x27;t sure what he would like. He seems to prefer the red one the best.</li>
            <li> Great sensory product for kids with chewing difficulty</li>
            <li> My son has sensory needs and adores these!  The T shape seems to work well for him, he likes the ones without much texture so this pack was perfect for him.  I&#x27;m afraid he chews through them, eventually they start breaking apart unfortunately.  They start getting pieces off so may not be advisable for someone who might want to swallow the pieces that come off.  Overall this is an asset in my home.</li>
            <li> Initially got these for my 5 year old son with Autism, but my 11 year old son with ADD immediately took to them too. Using as a soothing technique for their stemming as they both tend to chew on their shirts or pencils while concentrating on school work. They are very durable. And so far, we are please. CAUTION though, these are noisy and I don&#x27;t recommend sending to a classroom as it would be very disruptive!</li>
            <li> My daughter chews HARD! These hold up quite well except the &amp;#34;knobby&amp;#34; ones. The knobbies start to break down and Im afraid she will swallow one. It wouldnt choke her but still not a pleasant thought. The yellow ones are quite thin and not recommended for a heavy chewer. Red is the best one in my opinion. Perfect mix of strength and quality. The blue is very thick and would probably be ok for an adult, but not a child.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s daycare introduced me to these &#x27;chewies&#x27;. They were great when the back teeth were coming in. She has stopped teething but at times still enjoys chewing on them. They have stayed in great shape.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I expected but not too small that child can fit&lt;br /&gt;it all in mouth.  It works for what it is made for so I am happy and&lt;br /&gt;so are my niece and nephew.  Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> These have been a great tool for both my sensory seeker and my teething toddler.  I like the assortment this comes with and have already ordered these twice.</li>
            <li> My son was chewing on anything he could get his hands on so we bought him these and now he can chew on things without me telling me to stop. My son is 5 years old and chews on them hard. We have had them for about a month and don&#x27;t see any wear at all.</li>
            <li> Our special needs son loves these,</li>
            <li> 6 month old boy loves them! One of the first &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34; that he likes to hold and chew on. He has tons of other toys but this is his favorite!</li>
            <li> My son liked the bright colors and chews on them instead of sucking his finger.  The 4 pack is helpful since we leave 1 in the car, at day care and home.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter loves them.  She is always putting stuff in her mouth so these are just perfect.  She likes Chewy Tubes!</li>
            <li> My kids say they taste like sweet tea! They love them. Has helped tremendously with my son&#x27;s shirt chewing habit.</li>
            <li> My son didn&#x27;t take to these BUT I think they are great. I wish I would have ordered the one pack before buying all four. His favorite was the green one with the dots. It&#x27;s softer than the rest.</li>
            <li> Shipped roght away and theye were as described. Just what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> Works great for my grand son.  He was chewing on his clothes until they were ruined.  The chew tubes are well worth the moneh.</li>
            <li> I am a behavior therapist and I use this with a 7 year old with ASD.  He loves it and it serves the function of offering stimulation.  The downside is that it&#x27;s hollow inside and he quickly discovered how to make a whistling sound with it. This sound might be a great sensory experience for some kids, but in a school setting it is distracting and we had to remove it.</li>
            <li> They are good quality, but not the best. However the price is right.  I will be ordering more chewy tubes in the future</li>
            <li> CHEWY TUBES ARE GREAT BUT I wish thier was a smaler size  also  the red chewy tube is a big jump from yellow  you should freeze them all in all great product.</li>
            <li> These work great for oral motor therapy.  Right now I am using the smallest (yellow) one with my 7 year old son.  We work on chewing exercises.</li>
            <li> These Chewy Tubes are fantastic. My daughter has stopped chewing on her hair, clothing, toys, etc. She loves chewing on these. I just need to remember to keep a clean Chewy Tube on hand everywhere we go. She also uses them at night when soothing herself to sleep. So glas I chose the 4 pack...she likes the variety. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> My baby and my 3.5 year old both love chewing on these, sticking the short end completely into their mouths, blowing on the ends to make a little whistle (not loud enough to be terribly annoying), and generally making great use out of them. Great for teething, and for older siblings who want to &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; like the baby does!</li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;re are many chewy options for kids, but these Chewy Tubes are still the best &amp; my nephews favorite. I recommend every person that needs oral simulation use these.</li>
            <li> Just what it says, they are chewy tubes!</li>
            <li> These are the sturdiest chewy tube we have bought and believe me we have bought many. The necklace ones are nice but don&#x27;t seem to last long but I did make a necklace out of one of these and it worked great</li>
            <li> Great therapy tools. Excellent for working on jaw strength.</li>
            <li> Helps my son stop chewing his fingers!</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace a lost green chewy tube for my 3.5 year old.  She has some sensory integration issues and the chewing really helps calm her down when she is upset.  I am so happy I found a 4 pack just in case one gets lost again!</li>
            <li> These are great for kids who want to put everything in their mouth. Worked as a great replacement for pacifier too.</li>
            <li> The mixed pack allows you to determine which texture and size works best for your child. Each color is a different size or texture.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my autistic kiddos that are very oral.</li>
            <li> They are great but the red one would be the one for my child&#x27;s age and he won&#x27;t chew it because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;not as chewy&amp;#34; as the yellow one. So we use the smaller size for him. (Age 7)</li>
            <li> My 2 yr old autistic daughter loves it, it relaxes her when frustrated especially loves the green one because of the different texture, I received pack on time exactly what I had seen online. very happy with the product</li>
            <li> These tube were suggested by the speak therapists. They work awesome.  Our granddaughter works with them. She has a very overactive gag reflex. These are helping her</li>
            <li> great item for my five and three year old</li>
            <li> We have ordered this multiple times.  Works exactly how we need.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 4 pack not knowing if we would need to move up in sizes but the yellow one was the only one my son ever used.</li>
            <li> EVERY child needs a chewy tube.  Bought for my 4 yr. old who has oral issues right now, but my 10 mo. old loves them too!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product at a great price!</li>
            <li> My children love these more than any other product like this that they have tried.</li>
            <li> My son has an oral &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; due to some developmental issues. We put it on a string and he wears it around his neck to chew on instead of his shirt or a binky</li>
            <li> Every teething child should have these. They are the best. The different textures and density of the tubes, the easy to hold shapes are so good for little ones with sore gums. And my older kids like to use them as whistles.</li>
            <li> Worked great! My child enjoys chewing on them, and whenever he starts to chew on his fingers I just give him a chewy and it keeps him satisfied .  Would highly recommend for child with oral sensory issues.</li>
            <li> The boys love to chew these and blow air into and make a light whistling sound too. Got them at the recommendation of my sons OT, helped him stop chewing other things.</li>
            <li> My 4 yr old son LOVES these!  He was chewing on toys, straws, his fingers, etc... And we were going crazy with frustration when telling him to stop (and so was he). He seeks out the oral input and is now able to use the appropriate tool to satisfy his oral needs.  Hurray!  He chews on these like crazy and then doesn&#x27;t need to chew on anything else.  Thank you!  Highly recommend these for chewers that NEED to chew!</li>
            <li> The green and blue are super though and he hasn&#x27;t chewed thru yet after 6 months.  That is unheard of for him.  Yellow and red are softer and haven&#x27;t tried yet. If u have a child that eats paper, fabric, etc this is a great alternative.  And where he eats the hands off action figures out other little plastic &#x27;nubbins&#x27;  this has really held up and even if a piece did come off and he eats it...i know it doesn&#x27;t have nasty chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> These are great! Very durable and totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a special needs son that loves to mouth and chew on everything. We love chewy tubes, because that is what they are for and they are practically indestructible. It may save us a few books from being gnawed to death.</li>
            <li> great help for children with the need to be always chewing on something</li>
            <li> My daughter who has down syndrome grinds her teeth. This works wonderful. When ever she starts to grind her teeth we have her chew on one. Her grinding has decreased a ton by doing this.</li>
            <li> great chew toys for sensory needs</li>
            <li> Came quick and quality product. My kids instantly wanted them.</li>
            <li> We are not new to the benefits of chewy tubes.  our students love it, and we love it.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was prompt and the price was reasonable...</li>
            <li> Although my son doest not have autism, he does have an oral fixaction everyonce and a while &amp; loves to chew things. Iv noticed that after buying these toys, he&#x27;s less likely to chew his toys now. The size of the toys are perfect as well &amp; they are very durable. He hasnt been able to break one yet.</li>
            <li> I am a speech-language pathologist and use these daily with my pediatric patients with jaw weakness.  When I had a child of my own, I struggled to find a &amp;#34;teether&amp;#34; that was soft enough to chew on yet durable.  So, I purchased these.  My daughter LOVES them!</li>
            <li> These are good quality, and the price is good compared buying individually.  My daughter likes the red, green and blue the best.</li>
            <li> My child loves them, regular teethers suck in comparison, these are way better. Bright colors make them easier to find.  Good assortment of sizes and textures and stiffness vs softness.  For a child with major mouth sensory issues, these are really helpful.</li>
            <li> My son doesn&#x27;t love them as much as I would like him to.</li>
            <li> Very happy to receive these. My little one needed harder chewy tubes and for the cost of these four it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed! Each color is a different firmness and width, my boys love them! Great for therapy.</li>
            <li> My son (non-verbal, ASD) loves these therapy chews. He&#x27;s a strong chewer so we have a lot on hand. Thanks Sensory U!</li>
            <li> My son has delayed motor skills and loves putting things in his mouth for oral sensory stimulation due to his medical condition.  These tubes specifically are my son&#x27;s favorites.  They have helped him with feeding therapy, motor skills, and cause/effect skills.  He has even figured out that if you blow on the base of the tube, it becomes a whistle... so now it&#x27;s a toy. : )</li>
            <li> My brother loves them,  things have been slot better  now that he has the chewy tubes to help with those new baby teeth coming in</li>
            <li> My son had sensory integration and his OT mentioned these. He loves to chew on them and they really help!</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter needed for my grandson.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a request from the two feeding therapists. It&#x27;s clipped to her like a binky on her clothes. We&#x27;ve started using the yellow as it&#x27;s the chewiest of them all.</li>
            <li> Since buying these my 2 yr old has stopped chewing up his toys so money well spent. That being said he doesn&#x27;t use these very often either. I think he just respects the fact that we provided him with an alternative for his self comforting habit.</li>
            <li> My son has mild autism and often chews on his shirt for sensory feedback, when we see him start we offer a chewy tube and he seems satisfied with that instead of the shirt. We have also used them with our teething toddler.</li>
            <li> Great chewy for oral motor.  My child loves the different textures.  They are easy to clean.  Great for kids who like to chew or for oral motor strengthening.  We also use them for times where extra focus is needed.  I would recommend.</li>
