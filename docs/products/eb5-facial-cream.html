            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for me, and I strongly recommend giving this product a try!!</li>
            <li>It smooths the wrinkles on your face and it is great for sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li>Thanks so much for your good service!</li>
            <li>It is made by a pharmacist (several generations) and my mother used it and had beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I asked her if this product was good, and she conveyed that she couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>and that is accurate.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a fantastic wrinkle cream.  </li>

            <li>ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>This site by far offers the best price, and is fast in delivery.  </li>
            <li>Normally, amazon reviews are very accurate</li>
            <li>I searched the net and was THRILLED to see that it was still available online and have been using it again for almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>The thing that influenced me to purchase the product was reading the reviews by customers who had been loyal to this brand for years.  </li>
            <li>I have been using EB 5 for more than 20 years and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I find EB5 to give me the right amount of moisture for my skin.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is inexpensive, soaks right in, does the job, and I don&#x27;t react to it.</li>
            <li>I realized that this cream had diminished my fine lines better than other products I have used,especially the lines above my top lip.</li>
            <li>The service was very fast and this is the same cream that I have enjoyed for years.</li>
            <li>I have used EB5 for many years and still prefer it to all facial creams I have ever used -</li>
            <li>I have used this product since it was first on the market..  </li>
            <li>I buy eb5 facial cream for my mother, who has used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly to use on the face.</li>
            <li>Face looks refreshed and healthy after using it for a short time.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, people ask me all the time what I use on my skin to keep it looking so young and smooth.  </li>
            <li>THANKS FOR HAVING IT IN STOCK</li>
            <li>You can feel it lifting your skin gently as you sleep.  </li>
            <li>That is very encouraging.</li>
            <li>I have tried others and they always leave my face very greasey.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before but didn&#x27;t really appreciate it until I ran out.</li>
            <li>Really does do it all.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many other formulas on the market and have found nothing that even comes close.  </li>
            <li>People compliment my skin condition and I am sure it is largely due to the use through the years of this product.</li>
            <li>I had been using olay moisturizer, and was satisfied, but tend to vary my routine to try other products.  </li>
            <li>It is a high quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old, and my skin is so youthful thanks to EB5.  </li>
            <li>I am sorry that others love it so much as that impelled me to purchase this product, but if you are used to a more quality mosturizer (one that actually feels like lotion, not sandpaper), then you should shop on.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S UNSCENTED AND IT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER MY SENSITIVE EYES!</li>
            <li>each were cheaper than one large jar at 8 oz., so ordered the smaller jars.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, steer clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old and have often been asked if I&#x27;ve had a face lift.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t pay attention to any negative comments that I read on the internet with regard to this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used Eb5 for at least 6 years or better.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs it well and makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li>This product will last much longer, so that is a money saver.  </li>
            <li>I am 62 years old.</li>
            <li>When I am anywhere with my 41 year old son....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost afraid to post this review, for fear that too many people will race to buy it and it will be out of stock when I need to re-order!!</li>
            <li>One day, while I was shopping in a local Walgreen&#x27;s pharmacy, I stopped at the EB5 display at the cosmetics counter and this complete stranger came up to me and grabbed nearly every EB5 item on the shelf!!  </li>
            <li>One was fine; the second one was half full and dried up.  </li>
            <li>and I think it has kept new wrinkles from starting.</li>
            <li>When met by old friends at my son&#x27;s wedding last year, they were just amazed at the youthful appearance of my face.  </li>
            <li>I am 31 years old, used this product last night and this morning and already noticed a difference.  </li>

            <li> I am 31 years old, used this product last night and this morning and already noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> So, this product will last a really long time.  </li>
            <li> Now approaching my second decade of use and have minimal wrinkling!</li>
            <li> My  Mother is 95 and has use eb5 for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I like the larger jar better, but the two little jars were less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been using EB5 since my late 30&#x27;s, early 40&#x27;s, or as long as it&#x27;s been on the shelves.  </li>
            <li> I tried different ones after being unable to buy it locally anymore - and have gone back to EB5 since I found it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in this creams results compared to the usual vitamin E cream I use.  </li>
            <li> I have been using eb5 Facial Cream for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> In comparing it to other products, the thing that stands out other than it&#x27;s performance is that you need so little.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very thick and not natural.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of other creams and lotions and even had some prescribed to me by my doctor, but NOTHING compares to this!!!  </li>
            <li> In the past I have also tried products by clinique, neutrogena, mary kay, say yes to carrots among others.  </li>

            <li> eb5 has been a trusted Facial Cream since mid 1980 for me. When JC PENNEY discontinued the product I was in a panic. It made my day when I found it on amazone.com.  I would appriciated if I could get notifications when the cream goes on sale.  Thank you,  Marianne Robinson</li>
            <li> I have been an EB5 user for over 20 years.  I find EB5 to give me the right amount of moisture for my skin.  And it&#x27;s a fantastic wrinkle cream.  When met by old friends at my son&#x27;s wedding last year, they were just amazed at the youthful appearance of my face.  I love the stuff and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using EB5 Heldfond cream for years and love it.  Have tried many other formulas on the market and have found nothing that even comes close.  Used to always get it at JC Penney; however, it is getting more difficult to find.  Accidentally found this product on Amazon.  The two jars of 4 oz. each were cheaper than one large jar at 8 oz., so ordered the smaller jars.  The service was very fast and this is the same cream that I have enjoyed for years.</li>
            <li> I have used EB5 for many years and still prefer it to all facial creams I have ever used - I tried different ones after being unable to buy it locally anymore - and have gone back to EB5 since I found it on Amazon.com.  I think I&#x27;ve used EB5 for at least 40 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using eb5 for 30 years now and swear by it.  I&#x27;m 70 years old and have often been asked if I&#x27;ve had a face lift.  I would never use anything else on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have been using this EB5 cream for many years and I am very pleased with the results.  I believe it does what it claims to do.  Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I was a devote Chanel skin care user for over 30 years.  One day, while I was shopping in a local Walgreen&#x27;s pharmacy, I stopped at the EB5 display at the cosmetics counter and this complete stranger came up to me and grabbed nearly every EB5 item on the shelf!!  Of course, I asked her if this product was good, and she conveyed that she couldn&#x27;t live without it.  We began to chit/chat and so I ended up purchasing the duo pack of moisturizer/eye gel.  WOW, I was so impressed, I went back to purchase the soap, cleaners, toner, body cream and another duo pack to give to my sister.  The compliments are still coming my way, 2 years later.  I am 51 years old, and my skin is so youthful thanks to EB5.  I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t pay attention to any negative comments that I read on the internet with regard to this product.  It&#x27;s good enough for me, and I strongly recommend giving this product a try!!</li>
            <li> I have used eb5 Facial Cream for years.  This site by far offers the best price, and is fast in delivery.  Signed up with the recurring shipping program so I don&#x27;t have to keep looking for best buy.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> HAVE TRIED MANY CREAMS BUT THIS IS THE VERY BEST.......THANKS FOR HAVING IT IN STOCK</li>
            <li> I have used this product since it was first on the market..  Now approaching my second decade of use and have minimal wrinkling!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in this creams results compared to the usual vitamin E cream I use.  Most of the great reviews are from people that work for this company.  As they say, you can get a person&#x27;s money once.  Well they got mine but never again.</li>
            <li> I buy eb5 facial cream for my mother, who has used it for many years.  She is 85, and her complexion looks wonderful.  This price is excellent, and the service is great.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my Mom and had it shipped to her.  She received it in good time and was very pleased with the item.  Thanks so much for your good service!</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick and not natural.  It does not moisturize as described. Normally, amazon reviews are very accurate but it was not the case for this product.</li>
            <li> If you like pasty like moisturizer that smells like mildew, then this is a good product.  Otherwise, steer clear.  I am sorry that others love it so much as that impelled me to purchase this product, but if you are used to a more quality mosturizer (one that actually feels like lotion, not sandpaper), then you should shop on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for this!!! And found it just in time for Christmas. My  Mother is 95 and has use eb5 for as long as I can remember. But when our local jcpenney stopped carrying it we have had a problem finding it. But now we are on Auto Delivery!!!! Yea she will be a \\&quot;Happy Camper\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li> Received 2 jars of EB5 facial cream.  One was fine; the second one was half full and dried up.  Would like to have a resolution.</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial creams, usally expensive, over several decades but none compare to eb5!  What makes it even better is the bargain I found on Amazon.com. If you&#x27;re looking for a great moisture cream that&#x27;s not greasy and fights wrinkles at a reasonable price, eb5 is the one for you.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over five years now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t discover it sooner!</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic.  You can feel it lifting your skin gently as you sleep.  I like the larger jar better, but the two little jars were less expensive.  Great Cream!</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old, used this product last night and this morning and already noticed a difference.  Cant wait to continue using it.  I love that so many people have commented they have used it for 25+ years.  That is very encouraging.</li>
            <li> I have been using EB 5 for more than 20 years and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  It is a wonderful moisturizer that is quickly absorbed into the skin.  It is a high quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of very expensive moisturizers and I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of things. This moisturizer is inexpensive, soaks right in, does the job, and I don&#x27;t react to it. All for a fraction of what I was paying at the department stores. Good job!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cream! I started using it in 2000 (in my 40&#x27;s)and the results were so drastic that EVERYONE I knew, noticed the difference! In 2007-08 I was unable to find it as the stores where I purchased it no longer carried the product, so I was without it for almost 2 yrs.  Again, friends and family noticed the difference and told me my skin was not looking good. I searched the net and was THRILLED to see that it was still available online and have been using it again for almost 3 weeks. Again.......the compliments just keep coming!!! IN JUST 3 WEEKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is just a great, great GREAT product!!!! I have tried dozens of other creams and lotions and even had some prescribed to me by my doctor, but NOTHING compares to this!!!  I&#x27;m almost afraid to post this review, for fear that too many people will race to buy it and it will be out of stock when I need to re-order!! I hope they NEVER discontinue this cream!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using eb5 Facial Cream for the past 3 years. It has definitely reduced the wrinkles I did have and I think it has kept new wrinkles from starting. I also love the way it moisturizes my skin and sets it up for makeup!</li>
            <li> do not use anymore good product thought</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 20 years and have found it to be the best one I ever tried.  People compliment my skin condition and I am sure it is largely due to the use through the years of this product.</li>
            <li> THis is a wonderful product that is great for sensitive skin and for those women who have allergic reactions to many OTC facial creams.</li>
            <li> It is made by a pharmacist (several generations) and my mother used it and had beautiful skin.  I am a nurse and had a 96 year old patient with beautiful skin who also said she used this cream.  I have used it for years and love the way it makes my skin feel.  I am 62 but people think I am in my forties!</li>
            <li> eb5 is a great product. I have used it for years and plan to continue using the product.  It is exactly to use on the face. The cream is smooth and feels good on the face. It will  last for hours. Face looks refreshed and healthy after using it for a short time.  Thank for the great service and delivery of this product to my home from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Eb5 is the only face cream that I use. I have tried others and they always leave my face very greasey. I have used Eb5 for at least 6 years or better.For my face it is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but didn&#x27;t really appreciate it until I ran out.I realized that this cream had diminished my fine lines better than other products I have used,especially the lines above my top lip.It&#x27;s very hydrating but doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or feel heavy or waxy.My skin absorbs it well and makes my face feel soft.This is an excellent cream for the price.It works much better that oil of olay.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Really does do it all.  Been using it for 10 years and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have used it for many years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I had been using olay moisturizer, and was satisfied, but tend to vary my routine to try other products.  In the past I have also tried products by clinique, neutrogena, mary kay, say yes to carrots among others.  I decided to give eb5 a try.  The thing that influenced me to purchase the product was reading the reviews by customers who had been loyal to this brand for years.  The face cream does perform well, it is not greasy.  I tend to use it at night since it does not contain a sunscreen.  In comparing it to other products, the thing that stands out other than it&#x27;s performance is that you need so little.  The directions state to use the amount the size of a pearl...and that is accurate.  So, this product will last a really long time.  The olay product I was using, \\&quot;olay regenerest night recovery cream\\&quot; comes in a 1.7 ounce jar and I had finished it in 4-5 weeks.  This product will last much longer, so that is a money saver.  I will be purchasing more when needed.</li>
            <li> MY MOM HAS USED THIS CREAM SINCE SHE WAS IN HER 30&#x27;S AND NOW SHE IS IN HER 60&#x27;S. SHE LOOKS GREAT FOR HER AGE! HER FACE NEVER WRINKLED. I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT ON MY EYES SINCE I TURNED 30 AND I HAVEN&#x27;T GOTTEN ONE WRINKLE (now that i&#x27;m 35)! IT SAYS TO KEEP AWAY FROM YOUR EYES, BUT IT&#x27;S UNSCENTED AND IT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER MY SENSITIVE EYES! ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> eb5 is an excellent face cream, and I&#x27;ve tried them all!  Weather you wear it all day or to bed at night, it saves you the time and expense of buying a number of products because you can use it as a day cream and a night cream.  You can use eb5 on your face, under your eyes, and your neck.  Thankfully, people ask me all the time what I use on my skin to keep it looking so young and smooth.  I have recommended eb5 to everyone who has asked me.</li>
            <li> i love this face cream and use it all the time. this is so easy to order from amazon.com and i do ship in 6 month intervuls. love it.maddy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using EB5 for over 20 years and people can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 65 and have virtually no wrinkles.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product and not outrageously priced.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cream to put on under your make-up or you can use it at night.  It smooths the wrinkles on your face and it is great for sensitive skin.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old. I have been using EB5 since my late 30&#x27;s, early 40&#x27;s, or as long as it&#x27;s been on the shelves.  I use it every morning faithfully under my makeup and honestly I haven&#x27;t any wrinkles. When I am anywhere with my 41 year old son.... people we talk to think I am his girlfriend. I love you EB5.  GOOD JOB!!</li>
            <li> I have been using eb5 face cream for years and have seen a dramatic difference on my face since I started...I used to have dark spots on my cheeks that I hated with a passion &amp; could not get rid of them even after trying all kinds of skin lighteners.    After I started using eb5; within a very short time, they disappeared!  imagine my delight &amp; surprise!   I will stay with eb5 forever.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 15 yrs.  I SWEAR by it.  I have received so many compliments from many people about the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing..&lt;br /&gt;It will take years off your face...&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m with my daughters&lt;br /&gt;People think we are&lt;br /&gt;Sisters..&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Been a user for  30 plus years...</li>
