            <li>The gel is easy to use, you don&#x27;t need a ton.</li>
            <li>However as for weight loss I think Sweet sweat works better because I sweat even without a wrap.</li>
            <li>It seemed like what it was promising was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, this one has a very strong hot cinnamon smell</li>
            <li>The products seems to smooth the skin on that are though.</li>

            <li>then it gets really HOT!!</li>
            <li>Best Cellulite Cream With Intense Thermogenic Action from First Botany Cosmeceuticals...</li>
            <li>It feels great when applied liberally over muscles after a long workout or a stressful day at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the hot, soothing feeling of the jelly cream when applied.</li>
            <li>im was not disappointed..</li>

            <li>The gel rubbed in easily and was quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this makes my muscles feel better.</li>
            <li>I like to think of the cool tingle as a way to know it’s working.  </li>
            <li>No bad smells.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to tell if the results were placebo, the product, or a great massage, but I felt a lot better after using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the minty fresh smell, very relaxing.</li>
            <li>the Hot Shot Slimming Gel does more then just tighten, it also is good for relaxing tight muscles.</li>
            <li>long is the appropriate massage for a better result</li>
            <li>Received to review and sample and tried it the first night!</li>
            <li>Within minutes the heat kicks in and it can get really hot!</li>
            <li>They are not jiggling as much!!</li>
            <li>I really got this for the relaxing properties and the fantastic ingredients, not the slimming effect.</li>
            <li>Great Product, Made FromGood Quality Materials, Not Cheaply Made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed my before and after photo speaks for itself in just two days of trying this deep absorbing skin toning and detoxifying gel with intense Thermogenic action.  </li>
            <li>I hope to see real reviews for this product in the future because if it is a good product it would be a shame to be tainted by beefed up reviews.</li>
            <li>It will be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>It will be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I love this gel so far, I wanted to test this product with the use of wraps to see if I could achieve a slimming effect.</li>
            <li>So worth buying</li>
            <li>The name HOT SHOT is completely true..</li>
            <li>really well I&#x27;m excited to completely use it and hopefully get more</li>
            <li>Hot Shot felt great on my tired leg muscles and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Really love this product feels great only down fall is used it once and 1/4 is already used up.</li>
            <li>I used it right away when I received this,</li>
            <li>First I love that this jar comes sealed with a clearly readable label dated with both manufacture date and expiration (2 years out).</li>
            <li>I first noticed the gel instantly makes my skin warm.</li>
            <li>I am usually against using creams or anything like this, but though this would be a great time to try</li>
            <li>I can compare this with Sweet Sweat and this cream does not make me sweat as much.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery</li>
            <li>Thanks First Botany!</li>
            <li>I will update more if there is any changes about my cellulite issues since I only used this for 2 days  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Or should not shower after i use hot shot massaging gel</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the color.</li>
            <li>wanted to try this Botany&#x27;s Hot Shot Slimming Gel.</li>
            <li>So first I massaged the gel on both my knees.</li>
            <li>Even the people that videotaped a review seemed to be looking at the product for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Gel is hot, soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have heard of the Hot Shot Slimming Gell from one of my coworkers and when i seen it up for review i had to try it.</li>
            <li>Enter Hot Shot.  </li>
            <li>it gives you a shot of hot</li>
            <li>I just received this product yesterday and used it for the first time after the gym.  </li>
            <li>I tried out the hot shot gel, and immediately noticed the menthol ish type smell and feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar I noticed first off that it is an orange-ish color.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it.</li>
            <li>I try a lot of gels and lotions that promise to work on my cellulite and/or provide relief for muscle pain, but none come close to HOT SHOT!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first applied this to my tummy area, butt, and thighs as that is where all of my fat and cellulite sits.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was a coincidence at first, but now I believe it has something to do with burning the fat cells.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to lie down comfortably without the aches and pains I&#x27;ve been experiencing for months.</li>
            <li>In general, the gel is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really strong, my brother could barely stand it</li>
            <li>I will need to review more for the anti-cellulite part because I don&#x27;t have much to see a big difference.</li>
            <li>It gives you an icy hot feeling to soothe aching muscles and joints but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong obnoxious odor!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, so while I cannot honestly attest to any cellulite reduction, I can surely attest to the way it calms and soothes my muscles.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the strong menthol smell.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent that lasts several hours.  </li>
            <li>The package is rather large</li>
            <li>I didn’t want to have very high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a very cooling gel.</li>
            <li>It really did work.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much it helps with cellulite.</li>
            <li>This gel really helps my neck &amp; hands.</li>
            <li>With winter around the corner, my hands will really appreciate this.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to use it during the day when you can hydrate very well.</li>
            <li>THIS SLIMMING GEL REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I really like the discount I got</li>
            <li>I have the money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li>I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check.</li>
            <li>I love the product I can&#x27;t wait to start seeing results other than what I&#x27;ve seen so</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed that the one arm was visibly better than the other.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming like other menthol products like bio-freeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Essential Oil, Ocimum Basilicum (Sweet Basil)</li>
            <li>Essential Oil, Ocimum Basilicum (Sweet Basil)</li>
            <li>The ingredients start to dilate blood vessels and break down the fat cells, leaving a supple and more toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients start to dilate blood vessels and break down the fat cells, leaving a supple and more toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product mainly for relaxing my muscles and pain relief.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>After a few minutes my muscles begin to relax and feel better.</li>
            <li>If swallowed, get medical help right away.</li>
            <li>The next thing I noticed about Hot Shot was the odor.</li>
            <li>The next thing I noticed about Hot Shot was the odor.</li>
            <li>Shot Slimming Cream contains a blend of natural and organic ingredients that will help you to fight the excessive body fat and control your weight to achieve a slim and healthy body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on your hands much and feels watery even though it&#x27;s thick, this is a plus because it&#x27;s easy to spread on your skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large jar so it will last a while</li>
            <li>Again I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Gel has minty, medicinal scent and a naturally occurring orange color.</li>
            <li>Also remember the thermogenic action of this gel varies from person to person.</li>
            <li>natural anti-cellulite gel warms upon contact with the skin to jump-start sluggish circulation and send cellulite on its way.</li>
            <li>Avoid direct contact with eyes.</li>
            <li>but it is still early</li>
            <li>surprised at the results so far and will update after I&#x27;ve used it over a longer period of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to products that heat or leave a cooling effect</li>
            <li>flexxor issues was looking for a natural ingredient gel that would let me use it for both massage and pain</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to products that heat or leave a cooling effect</li>
            <li>There was no sticky residue left after, just a very tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>far as it working....</li>
            <li>I applied the gel to my right arm only for several days.  </li>
            <li>Its cold at first then it acts like a heating pad and it can get quite warm.</li>
            <li>To use as an anti cellulite, simply apply Hot Gel to the affected areas twice daily.</li>
            <li>To use as an anti cellulite, simply apply Hot Gel to the affected areas twice daily.</li>
            <li>45 lbs later, I realized that it was not the weight that was as much of an issue as the skin that was left after dropping all the weight.</li>
            <li>I’ve lost a lot of weight, but my arms are still really flabby with a lot of loose skin.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was clear and crips and simple to read.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE</li>
            <li>Essential Oil, Origanum Vulgare (Wild Oregano)</li>
            <li>Essential Oil, Origanum Vulgare (Wild Oregano)</li>
            <li>First off, it smells nicer than your average soothing gel of dimension</li>
            <li>when you fist smell it, the mint and pepper is the first one you&#x27;ll probably recognize the menthol, black pepper, cinnamon,  eucalyptus and basil...</li>
            <li>I tried using it at night and woke up  with really dry lips (not normal for me) like super dry chapped.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look in a few months as I keep up with exercising and using my hot shot gel.</li>
            <li>After that the smell really tones down.</li>
            <li>and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> Best Cellulite Transdermal Cream With Intense Thermogenic Action  </li>
            <li> The gel is easy to use, you don&#x27;t need a ton.</li>
            <li> However as for weight loss I think Sweet sweat works better because I sweat even without a wrap.</li>
            <li> It seemed like what it was promising was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, this one has a very strong hot cinnamon smell</li>
            <li> The products seems to smooth the skin on that are though.</li>
            <li> filled my house once I opened the jar.</li>

            <li> then it gets really HOT!!</li>
            <li> Best Cellulite Cream With Intense Thermogenic Action from First Botany Cosmeceuticals...</li>
            <li> It feels great when applied liberally over muscles after a long workout or a stressful day at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the hot, soothing feeling of the jelly cream when applied.</li>
            <li> im was not disappointed..</li>
            <li> gel is smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> gel is smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> The gel rubbed in easily and was quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my muscles feel better.</li>
            <li> I like to think of the cool tingle as a way to know it’s working.  </li>
            <li> No bad smells.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to tell if the results were placebo, the product, or a great massage, but I felt a lot better after using it.  </li>
            <li> I love the minty fresh smell, very relaxing.</li>
            <li> the Hot Shot Slimming Gel does more then just tighten, it also is good for relaxing tight muscles.</li>
            <li> long is the appropriate massage for a better result</li>
            <li> Received to review and sample and tried it the first night!</li>
            <li> Within minutes the heat kicks in and it can get really hot!</li>
            <li> They are not jiggling as much!!</li>
            <li> I really got this for the relaxing properties and the fantastic ingredients, not the slimming effect.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Made FromGood Quality Materials, Not Cheaply Made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed my before and after photo speaks for itself in just two days of trying this deep absorbing skin toning and detoxifying gel with intense Thermogenic action.  </li>
            <li> I hope to see real reviews for this product in the future because if it is a good product it would be a shame to be tainted by beefed up reviews.</li>
            <li> It will be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> It will be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this gel so far, I wanted to test this product with the use of wraps to see if I could achieve a slimming effect.</li>
            <li> So worth buying</li>
            <li> The name HOT SHOT is completely true..</li>
            <li> really well I&#x27;m excited to completely use it and hopefully get more</li>
            <li> Hot Shot felt great on my tired leg muscles and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Really love this product feels great only down fall is used it once and 1/4 is already used up.</li>
            <li> I used it right away when I received this,</li>
            <li> First I love that this jar comes sealed with a clearly readable label dated with both manufacture date and expiration (2 years out).</li>
            <li> I first noticed the gel instantly makes my skin warm.</li>
            <li> I am usually against using creams or anything like this, but though this would be a great time to try</li>
            <li> I can compare this with Sweet Sweat and this cream does not make me sweat as much.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Thanks First Botany!</li>
            <li> I will update more if there is any changes about my cellulite issues since I only used this for 2 days  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Or should not shower after i use hot shot massaging gel</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was the color.</li>
            <li> wanted to try this Botany&#x27;s Hot Shot Slimming Gel.</li>
            <li> So first I massaged the gel on both my knees.</li>
            <li> Even the people that videotaped a review seemed to be looking at the product for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Gel is hot, soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have heard of the Hot Shot Slimming Gell from one of my coworkers and when i seen it up for review i had to try it.</li>
            <li> Enter Hot Shot.  </li>
            <li> it gives you a shot of hot</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday and used it for the first time after the gym.  </li>
            <li> I tried out the hot shot gel, and immediately noticed the menthol ish type smell and feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar I noticed first off that it is an orange-ish color.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of gels and lotions that promise to work on my cellulite and/or provide relief for muscle pain, but none come close to HOT SHOT!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first applied this to my tummy area, butt, and thighs as that is where all of my fat and cellulite sits.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was a coincidence at first, but now I believe it has something to do with burning the fat cells.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to lie down comfortably without the aches and pains I&#x27;ve been experiencing for months.</li>
            <li> In general, the gel is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really strong, my brother could barely stand it</li>
            <li> I will need to review more for the anti-cellulite part because I don&#x27;t have much to see a big difference.</li>
            <li> It gives you an icy hot feeling to soothe aching muscles and joints but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong obnoxious odor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, so while I cannot honestly attest to any cellulite reduction, I can surely attest to the way it calms and soothes my muscles.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the strong menthol smell.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong scent that lasts several hours.  </li>
            <li> The package is rather large</li>
            <li> I didn’t want to have very high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a very cooling gel.</li>
            <li> It really did work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much it helps with cellulite.</li>
            <li> This gel really helps my neck &amp; hands.</li>
            <li> With winter around the corner, my hands will really appreciate this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to use it during the day when you can hydrate very well.</li>
            <li> THIS SLIMMING GEL REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I really like the discount I got</li>
            <li> I have the money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li> I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check.</li>
            <li> I love the product I can&#x27;t wait to start seeing results other than what I&#x27;ve seen so</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed that the one arm was visibly better than the other.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming like other menthol products like bio-freeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Essential Oil, Ocimum Basilicum (Sweet Basil)</li>
            <li> Essential Oil, Ocimum Basilicum (Sweet Basil)</li>

            <li> The ingredients start to dilate blood vessels and break down the fat cells, leaving a supple and more toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product mainly for relaxing my muscles and pain relief.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> After a few minutes my muscles begin to relax and feel better.</li>
            <li> If swallowed, get medical help right away.</li>
            <li> The next thing I noticed about Hot Shot was the odor.</li>
            <li> The next thing I noticed about Hot Shot was the odor.</li>
            <li> Shot Slimming Cream contains a blend of natural and organic ingredients that will help you to fight the excessive body fat and control your weight to achieve a slim and healthy body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on your hands much and feels watery even though it&#x27;s thick, this is a plus because it&#x27;s easy to spread on your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large jar so it will last a while</li>
            <li> Again I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Gel has minty, medicinal scent and a naturally occurring orange color.</li>
            <li> Also remember the thermogenic action of this gel varies from person to person.</li>
            <li> natural anti-cellulite gel warms upon contact with the skin to jump-start sluggish circulation and send cellulite on its way.</li>
            <li> Avoid direct contact with eyes.</li>
            <li> but it is still early</li>
            <li> surprised at the results so far and will update after I&#x27;ve used it over a longer period of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to products that heat or leave a cooling effect</li>
            <li> flexxor issues was looking for a natural ingredient gel that would let me use it for both massage and pain</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to products that heat or leave a cooling effect</li>
            <li> There was no sticky residue left after, just a very tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> far as it working....</li>
            <li> I applied the gel to my right arm only for several days.  </li>
            <li> Its cold at first then it acts like a heating pad and it can get quite warm.</li>
            <li> To use as an anti cellulite, simply apply Hot Gel to the affected areas twice daily.</li>
            <li> To use as an anti cellulite, simply apply Hot Gel to the affected areas twice daily.</li>
            <li> 45 lbs later, I realized that it was not the weight that was as much of an issue as the skin that was left after dropping all the weight.</li>
            <li> I’ve lost a lot of weight, but my arms are still really flabby with a lot of loose skin.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was clear and crips and simple to read.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE</li>

            <li> Essential Oil, Origanum Vulgare (Wild Oregano)</li>
            <li> First off, it smells nicer than your average soothing gel of dimension</li>
            <li> when you fist smell it, the mint and pepper is the first one you&#x27;ll probably recognize the menthol, black pepper, cinnamon,  eucalyptus and basil...</li>
            <li> I tried using it at night and woke up  with really dry lips (not normal for me) like super dry chapped.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look in a few months as I keep up with exercising and using my hot shot gel.</li>
            <li> After that the smell really tones down.</li>
            <li> and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I also use it at night when my back is really achy and stiff but to get the warming effect I have to wrap the area.</li>
            <li> It is extremely unpleasant but the smell is nice and this feeling only lasts about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Granted, it’s not a miracle, and my arms have a long, long way to go, but there is definite improvement.</li>
            <li> Of course, the first thing I want to do is sit down, but then my muscles get stiff if I sit too long.  </li>

            <li> (Ginger) Root Essential Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit)</li>
            <li> But, it’s definitely not an ‘old person cream’ smell.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for as long as it works for me!</li>
            <li> I spread it all over my belly and waited for it to dry.</li>

            <li> Essential Oil, Piper Nigrum (Black Pepper)</li>
            <li> I have been working on toning, but needed a little extra help.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this at home where you can wear as little clothes as possible until the heat wears</li>
            <li> , I don’t have any results (granted only been using it for a few days).</li>
            <li> The part that made me curious were  undernotes that were neither flowery or fruity, but a combination.</li>
            <li> There are a few types of chamomile, pink grapefruit, juniper berry, rosemary and several others.</li>
            <li> It had a relatively strong, menthol, or mint smell, but it was not over whelming or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It had a relatively strong, menthol, or mint smell, but it was not over whelming or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this over any other muscle crème I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two things I have noticed over the past week of using this product twice daily (morning after shower &amp; evening before bed).&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>

            <li> Okay I know this product is for slimming body fat but I am using it for the relief of pain. I was in a terrible car accident many years ago. I have neck and shoulder pain still. This is a very cooling gel. It is not runny so it is easy to apply. It is not overly think and does not clump up. Instant soothing for sore muscular areas. I used it a lot on my left shoulder since I got it. It was cool and caused great relief!! The packaging was clear and crips and simple to read.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE I GOT THIS ITEM FOR A REDUCED PRICE OR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UN BIAS REVIEW!</li>
            <li> I do like this product. It does have a minty smell. I seen that it helps with muscle relaxation,so I gave it a try. It really did work. when I rubbed it into my shoulder there was a warm then cooling feeling.Which felt wonderful. It was about 15 mins later I did feel relief.I did some research and the Capsicum  helps with swelling and helps fight cellulite.  Chamomile has anti-inflammatory properties. It absorbs in to the skin nicely. You are not left with any sticky feeling.I can&#x27;t wait to see how much it helps with cellulite.I used it on my  legs and they felt so good just from the warming feeling from the lotion.It is also a money back guarantee  I  DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery I used it right away when I received this, so far so good it relieved my back pain and it soothe my skin that I even fell asleep lol, people should give this a try. I will update more if there is any changes about my cellulite issues since I only used this for 2 days  lol.</li>
            <li> First I love that this jar comes sealed with a clearly readable label dated with both manufacture date and expiration (2 years out). The smell of mint is pleasant but pretty strong. No need to worry about the bright color of this as it glides on almost transparent and quickly absorbs into the skin without any greasy residue. After that the smell really tones down. For me it went on cold and had a slight warming effect 5 minutes later. I have been using this on my shoulder blades to help alleviate tension and relax myself. This does work as an aid great pairing after a hot shower and some relaxation time. I haven&#x27;t noticed any different with cellulite but I have to much of that for any product to help lol. I did receive this product at a promotional discount for the exchange of my honest unbias review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this! Received to review and sample and tried it the first night! Great for muscle aches!</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pleas I want to know&lt;br /&gt;How long is the appropriate massage for a better result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I can take a Bathed after a massage&lt;br /&gt;Or should not shower after i use hot shot massaging gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Good stuff. This gel has this wonderful creamy orange sherbet color and it feels great. It&#x27;s very smooth and not too creamy. The next thing I noticed about Hot Shot was the odor. It had a relatively strong, menthol, or mint smell, but it was not over whelming or unpleasant. I actually really liked the smell.  I had a very tense neck as I work from home on the computer and this is a re occuring problem. two nights in a row I had my husband rub on my neck and shoulders. I would say with in about a minute I could feel the cream actually loosen my muscles and i felt great. I was super happy with Slimming Cream. I was given the product at a reduced cost or free for my unbiased and honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surpised byt this product. I am usually against using creams or anything like this, but though this would be a great time to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the color. It has this wonderful creamy orange sherbet color and it feels great. It&#x27;s very smooth and not too creamy. The next thing I noticed about Hot Shot was the odor. It had a relatively strong, menthol, or mint smell, but it was not over whelming or unpleasant. I actually really liked the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, how it worked. Again I was pleasantly surprised. I had a very tense neck as I work from home on the computer and this is a reoccuring problem. two nights in a row I had my husband rub on my neck and shoulders. I would say with in about a minute I could feel the cream acutally loosen my muscles and i felt great. I was super happy with Slimming Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was given the product at a reduced cost or free for my unbiased and honest opinion of the product)</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this Botany&#x27;s Hot Shot Slimming Gel. I read that this gel helps with muscle relaxation. And I have pain in my arms. So first I massaged the gel on both my knees. I first noticed the gel instantly makes my skin warm. It started tingling.  From my past experiences I believed that to be an indicator that the product was working. After a few minutes my muscles begin to relax and feel better. I use this gel all the time</li>
            <li> I’m really skeptical about the slimming properties of this gel, I don’t have any results (granted only been using it for a few days). As a muscle relaxer, it’s great. I love the minty fresh smell, very relaxing. And the this gel is easy to apply and absorbs quickly, nice texture and finish.  I did get a “heating sensation” but nothing unpleasant and it was nice for relaxing muscles (perfect after workouts). I really got this for the relaxing properties and the fantastic ingredients, not the slimming effect. And for that, it does the job and was a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;*Honest review for discounted product*</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for aches and pains. I have chronic back pain and this helps a lot. I can compare this with Sweet Sweat and this cream does not make me sweat as much. However it heats up your body. Its cold at first then it acts like a heating pad and it can get quite warm. I use it with a neoprene wrap and I can sweat quite a bit when I exercise rigorously. I also use it at night when my back is really achy and stiff but to get the warming effect I have to wrap the area. However as for weight loss I think Sweet sweat works better because I sweat even without a wrap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed my before and after photo speaks for itself in just two days of trying this deep absorbing skin toning and detoxifying gel with intense Thermogenic action.  My stomach feels toner.  I purchased this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!  So wonderful for sore muscles and makes skin feel more firm and smooth!  I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it daily to see it&#x27;s results.  No bad smells.  I used before I put my clothes on and it wasn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li> the Hot Shot Slimming Gel does more then just tighten, it also is good for relaxing tight muscles. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the strong menthol smell. It made me tear up while applying , so it was very strong. I would recommend not putting it on in public,but waiting until after you work out, go home and shower and then apply it if you aren&#x27;t planning on going out anywhere. I did notice even after a day, tightening.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS ITEM FOR A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY UNBIASED REVIEW</li>
            <li> I have NOT purchased this product. I chose not to when I saw that  all the reviews were  the same.  It may be a great product. But it appears to be a sham.  Even the people that videotaped a review seemed to be looking at the product for the first time.  I hope to see real reviews for this product in the future because if it is a good product it would be a shame to be tainted by beefed up reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am 30 and overweight I have started working out and getting products to help me along my weight loss. This was one of them and I&#x27;m so happy to get this product and try it out. I really love the smell. Minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels good in my skin . I have been working out and using this cream to help my muscles and my belly feel good afterwards. I massage my belly and muscles with this cream daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helps control your weight, helps with stress, bloating and water retention. I am now drinking water and using this cream along. I will continue to use this cream and update my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this cream a try and see the results. Drink water, exercise and eat healthy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample and give you my honest opinion.</li>

            <li> First Botany&#x27;s Hot Shot Slimming Gel 4 oz. - Great for Muscle Relaxation and Massage ... Best Cellulite Transdermal Cream With Intense Thermogenic Action  FOR REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters the cream smell a little like menthol to me is not a real big deal you just smell like you have sports cream on. the cream does have a warming effect after you put the belt on. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet but it is still early and i would like to give this product a fair chance. but as of now I see no problems with it, plus it can be used for massaging , give it a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product mainly for relaxing my muscles and pain relief. I love the hot, soothing feeling of the jelly cream when applied. It soothes my aching muscles within seconds of application. I also love that it&#x27;s made up of 87% organic ingredients. Knowing what I put on my skin is very important. I can&#x27;t wait to test it out on cellulite.</li>
            <li> I love this gel so far, I wanted to test this product with the use of wraps to see if I could achieve a slimming effect. I would post the pictures but I&#x27;m a little uncomfortable flaunting my stomach. I applied this liberally over my mid section and wrapped myself with saran wrap. I wore it overnight and was happy with the results. My stomach looked noticablly slimmer! The results stayed but wrapping a second time didn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- You can feel it working! It tingles/burns but isn&#x27;t unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t stay on your hands much and feels watery even though it&#x27;s thick, this is a plus because it&#x27;s easy to spread on your skin&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a large jar so it will last a while&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s 87% organic which is nice&lt;br /&gt;- While the gel is bright orange, it applies clear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is really strong, my brother could barely stand it&lt;br /&gt;- Some may find the tingle unpleasant though I did not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised at the results so far and will update after I&#x27;ve used it over a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FULL DISCLOSURE: I received this sample for free for testing and reviewing! This review is 100% unbiased and honest.</li>
            <li> Thanks First Botany! This gel really helps my neck &amp; hands. Arthritis -I guess. With winter around the corner, my hands will really appreciate this. It is unlike the creams made for arthritis-it works! The makers of those arthritis rubs could take a hint from this. I like the minty scent &amp; it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes! I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. That did not affect my judgement. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still confused on how it works, but my backside is completely smooth after 2-3 applications.... So worth buying</li>
            <li> Really love this product feels great only down fall is used it once and 1/4 is already used up.</li>
            <li> I had recently use this and lost little a bit of weight and had been searching for products for my skin lately and im happy to find one. I was skeptical on this before whats about the results that I would get with this gel product,i get I was curious.So I went ahead and I get one to try. im was not disappointed.. It make cellulite disappear lightly, It definitely does work.work good .. I purchase this under promotional item on my Honest Review and own opinion</li>
            <li> great quality slimming gel. i never believed in slimming gel until my sister started using it and i noticed the results for myself, and she told me what it was! now i use it nightly and rub it in and go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;i received this product for review</li>
            <li> I have heard of the Hot Shot Slimming Gell from one of my coworkers and when i seen it up for review i had to try it. I love how it smells. It has a minty taste to it and is real smooth on the skin. I put the slimming gell on under my sweat band and its really starting to show. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, so while I cannot honestly attest to any cellulite reduction, I can surely attest to the way it calms and soothes my muscles.  I do a lot of walking and climbing stairs throughout my day and my muscles are typically tired and sore by the time I get home.  Of course, the first thing I want to do is sit down, but then my muscles get stiff if I sit too long.  Enter Hot Shot.  I use this on my legs and hips after I shower and before I go to bed and I&#x27;m able to lie down comfortably without the aches and pains I&#x27;ve been experiencing for months. It&#x27;s not greasy, has a pleasant scent, and does not stain my clothing.  I will continue to use this product for as long as it works for me!</li>
            <li> Product for Review: This HOT SHOT gel is great. My back has been killing me. This stuff numbed and made the area tingle. What makes this product even better is that it does not test on animals :) I would recommend this product for muscle relaxation.</li>
            <li> Great product. The gel gives you a nice relaxed feeling. I will need to review more for the anti-cellulite part because I don&#x27;t have much to see a big difference. The products seems to smooth the skin on that are though.</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday and have already used it twice. It has a nice minty smell, not harsh but pleasant. My skin is sensitive to products that heat or leave a cooling effect but this product cools nicely. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  IT FEELS SO GOOD GOING ON.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT ON MY STOMACH AND IT IS ACTUALLY STARTING TO LOOK TONER.  NOW FOR MY FLABBY ARMS!!</li>
            <li> Im going to assume this is working because this literally makes me feel like my thighs are on fire. It is extremely unpleasant but the smell is nice and this feeling only lasts about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The name HOT SHOT is completely true.. it gives you a shot of hot once you put it on the smell of mint filled my house once I opened the jar. I am using it on my tough areas thighs upper arms and belly. I love the product I can&#x27;t wait to start seeing results other than what I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> OK HAVENT SEEN ANYTHING YET</li>
            <li> I suffer from him flexxor issues was looking for a natural ingredient gel that would let me use it for both massage and pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product which let me get it at a great discount if I tested it and then reviewed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it looks like melted orange sherbert, which was a bit surprising.  And it smells like you would expect anything &amp;#34;Hot and Icy&amp;#34; to smell.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it feels like heaven. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy or filmy, it lets you massage but not feel like you are rubbing down an oil slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to tell if the results were placebo, the product, or a great massage, but I felt a lot better after using it.  I&#x27;ve tried it 3 times now and each time- same results.  The package is rather large so you&#x27;re not going to need to repurchase for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side: You&#x27;re going to want to probably not put this on before going somewhere that you don&#x27;t want to smell like you just had a muscle cream/lotion applied to you.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this makes my muscles feel better. It says it&#x27;s a slimming gel however, I did not notice any difference. When you put it on it feels really cold then it gets really HOT!! I did notice that I have to drink tons of water while using this if not I would get dehydrated. I tried using it at night and woke up  with really dry lips (not normal for me) like super dry chapped. It was horrible I tried it on two different occasions to see of that was it and yes it&#x27;s the gel. I would recommend to use it during the day when you can hydrate very well. I did receive this to review!</li>
            <li> Great for muscle relaxation.  Not so sure about the slimming part</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday and have already used it twice. It has a nice minty smell, not harsh but pleasant. My skin is sensitive to products that heat or leave a cooling effect but this product cools nicely. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I didn’t want to have very high expectations for this product.  It seemed like what it was promising was too good to be true.  But, I think it might actually work.  I’ve lost a lot of weight, but my arms are still really flabby with a lot of loose skin.  I applied the gel to my right arm only for several days.  Even my husband noticed that the one arm was visibly better than the other.  Granted, it’s not a miracle, and my arms have a long, long way to go, but there is definite improvement. In general, the gel is easy to apply.  For me, it has a cooling sensation that is not at all unpleasant.  I like to think of the cool tingle as a way to know it’s working.  It does have a strong scent that lasts several hours.  But, it’s definitely not an ‘old person cream’ smell.  And, I’ll be applying the gel to both arms and hoping they both get better.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> This works great as a massaging gel! It gives you an icy hot feeling to soothe aching muscles and joints but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong obnoxious odor! I received it for free as a trial and I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I Received This Product At A Discount In Exchange For An Honest Review. Arrived On Time. Great Product, Made FromGood Quality Materials, Not Cheaply Made. I Feel Relief Almost Instantly.</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday and used it for the first time after the gym.  Hot Shot felt great on my tired leg muscles and I love the smell.  The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming like other menthol products like bio-freeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive this product at a reduced price in order to try the product and provide a review.</li>
            <li> After having my kids, I had a bit of a belly left over. I worked on dropping weight, which wasn&#x27;t too hard. 45 lbs later, I realized that it was not the weight that was as much of an issue as the skin that was left after dropping all the weight. I have been working on toning, but needed a little extra help. I tried out the hot shot gel, and immediately noticed the menthol ish type smell and feel on my skin. The gel is easy to use, you don&#x27;t need a ton. I spread it all over my belly and waited for it to dry. There was no sticky residue left after, just a very tingly feeling. Almost like I had been working out, then cooling down. The skin already looks better. Over all it is helpful and I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look in a few months as I keep up with exercising and using my hot shot gel. I love that is&#x27;a 87% organic. I would love to see it 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
            <li> THIS SLIMMING GEL REALLY WORKS. I USE IT ON MY SORE TIRED MUSCLES AND ALSO ON MY CELLULITE AND IT FIRMS IT ALL UP. I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I really like the discount I got and it is working really well I&#x27;m excited to completely use it and hopefully get more</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar I noticed first off that it is an orange-ish color. It has a minty-ish smell, but not just minty.  I would say it would be difficult to pinpoint any one ingredient that overpowers the other.. First off, it smells nicer than your average soothing gel of dimension when you fist smell it, the mint and pepper is the first one you&#x27;ll probably recognize the menthol, black pepper, cinnamon,  eucalyptus and basil...The part that made me curious were  undernotes that were neither flowery or fruity, but a combination. None of which stand out enough for me to pinpoint, but they definitely add a dimension I haven&#x27;t seen in others. . There are a few types of chamomile, pink grapefruit, juniper berry, rosemary and several others. I like the smell of this over any other muscle crème I&#x27;ve used. I didn&#x27;t use it for the slimming properties. I have inflammatory and nerve disorders that cause me pain. The peppers and menthol properties help alleviate some of that pain for me. I always have the nerve, but I look to things like this to help with muscle pain I have. I do a lot of crocheting, so I&#x27;ve been putting this on over and over throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;br /&gt;My No Nonsense Thoughts: I could reiterate what is in the description above, but  you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it. What I will try to do is tell you what I see, smell, hear, what happens and what my opinion is as well as I can. In order to try to make easier for you to decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have the money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt; I have no connection to this seller or this company who makes this product and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I haven&#x27;t been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review. I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check. But I will do my best to describe this item for you</li>
            <li> Wow!! I try a lot of gels and lotions that promise to work on my cellulite and/or provide relief for muscle pain, but none come close to HOT SHOT!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this one has a very strong hot cinnamon smell so you may want to only use this one at home. I like the fragrance a lot as it reminds me of the fireballs I use to eat as a kid, but it can be overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as it working....YES! I first applied this to my tummy area, butt, and thighs as that is where all of my fat and cellulite sits. The gel rubbed in easily and was quickly absorbed. Within minutes the heat kicks in and it can get really hot! I recommend using this at home where you can wear as little clothes as possible until the heat wears off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things I have noticed over the past week of using this product twice daily (morning after shower &amp; evening before bed).&lt;br /&gt;1) My skin does appear to be a lot tighter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have to go to the bathroom within an hour of using this. I thought maybe it was a coincidence at first, but now I believe it has something to do with burning the fat cells. I could be wrong, but I have never been more regular. (Sorry if that&#x27;s tmi, just being honest.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH, I almost forgot, I have been using this on my under arm flab...you know that hard to fix area I&#x27;m talking about. I thought, &amp;#34;if this will burn fat cells, maybe it will help my flappers&amp;#34;, and it is!! They are not jiggling as much!! This morning I even used it as a massage gel for my guy because he suffers from a messed up shoulder. He really liked the heat it provided to his sore muscles and felt more relaxed then he has in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this jar for free to test and my experience has been wonderful.</li>
