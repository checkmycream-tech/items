            <li> Smaller than I thought, and bled somewhat around the edges. Didn&#x27;t hold up as well as others for around the same price, and finish was a little dull even though color was beautiful.</li>
            <li> As described, no box but bubble wrapped &amp; secured.  Appears to be new.  Love the color.  Good savings over retail price.</li>
            <li> Bigger bottle than I expected! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nail polish.. nice color</li>
            <li> Loved it! Beautiful, long lasting color.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it arrived and looked like it had been run over.  I was giving it as part of a birthday present for my sister so she understood and the nailpolish itself was fine.  Product was great but the presenation was terrible.</li>
            <li> Love this color, great price and fast delivery time. Thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing color and looks great</li>
            <li> have this color on my nails now. love it</li>
            <li> Nice plummy dark pink color. Lasts about 2 wks and stays shiny!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! It goes on kind of redish but after a day or so the color settles to an almost violet burgendy. Great for fall. It&#x27;s my new fav!</li>
            <li> Just as described! Works great so far!</li>
            <li> Is a nice color if you are looking for a dark red wine color.&lt;br /&gt;Came in an small botle, everything as promised.</li>
            <li> It chipped the very next day, and peeled off.</li>
            <li> Really pretty.  Was darker that I expected.  Almost a dark red color.</li>
