            <li>but Amazon customer service was awesome and refunded my money and let me keep the bag</li>
            <li>lenth and height are perfect</li>
            <li>Plus the pouch on the front fits my clips and bobby pins perfectly.</li>
            <li>It fits her straightener perfectly and she&#x27;s extremely happy.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect: stylish, durable, affordable!</li>
            <li>Great for travel also.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great looking and great performing product.</li>
            <li>bag is great to keep your straighten iron</li>
            <li>Love it, great product!!</li>
            <li>good product does the job</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The outer pocket is nice as well.  </li>
            <li>Most of the ones I have come across are either hideous or both hideous and over-priced.</li>
            <li>Not at all the cute and functional item I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Remington straightening iron fit perfectly well, plus a heat resistant silicone clear pad.</li>
            <li>The bag is cute and heat resistant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only practical, it&#x27;s beautiful as well.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered to my house the next day i ordered it, beautiful silver zip pouch.</li>
            <li>My daughter liked mine so much that she ordered one too.</li>
            <li>, i wanted it to carry my iron and curler but cannot fit both,</li>
            <li>So far very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It is actually pretty cute, it reminds me of a clutch because of the wristlet strap.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; Classy.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s so great about these is that you can store your flat iron/curling iron while it&#x27;s warm especially if you are traveling</li>
            <li>My flat iron fit perfectly, as well as my flat iron comb.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the recipient loves purple, too.  </li>
            <li>only the iron and mini iron but overall bag is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for travel with my straight iron, but too small for my curling iron.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the pocket to be larger/deeper, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this pouch is well made roomy and my hot curling iron goes right in the pouch at the gym.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>I loved it because, much to my surprise, it has a dark purple zipper.  </li>
            <li>Opens up all the way for protecting the table top from the heat of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It can be done, but if it were just a little bit bigger that would have been great.</li>
            <li>The front pocket, which presumably holds the cord, is awkward at best, and would leave a chunk of cord exposed.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the fact that it completely unzips and lies flat so it can be used for a heat mat when traveling.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit the cord for my flat iron</li>
            <li>I wanted somthing I could store my flat iron in for traveling and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>This pouch is much better than how it looks here, it&#x27;s really high quality &amp; big enough, my 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it is simple a little pricey but does have a handy side pocket in front to store a comb etc.....</li>
            <li>The inside is large enough to fit the flat iron and cord with out having to struggle to get the zipper closed.</li>
            <li>She now doesn&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute and protective that it now houses my flat iron year round.</li>
            <li>I have a full size flat iron and it does fit, but it is a little tight getting the cord in completely.  </li>
            <li>This is a large pouch and it is still not quite big enough for my curling iron.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit big if you are just using it for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Initially I just purchased this case to house my flat iron when traveling.</li>
            <li> when you unzip it it will lay completly flat, open on the counter, so you can use it has a place to put the flat iron (or any other hot item) down during use.</li>
            <li> Holds both my large flat iron and outside pocket holds my small flat iron.  </li>

            <li> Fits my flat iron, and i like the elastic front pouch for the wires.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Way to SHORT to accommodate the average size flat iron/curling iron.</li>
            <li> It was a lot bigger than what i expected, so i was extremely suprized!!</li>
            <li> It is also hard to zip shut after you lay it open flat.</li>
            <li> My flat iron will not fit in it because the cord is too bulky.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s narrow</li>
            <li> It feels like a makeup bag one could find at the dollar store, with a worse zipper.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s very thin,</li>

            <li> I have been searching for a travel case for my chi for months. Most of the ones I have come across are either hideous or both hideous and over-priced. This product is perfect: stylish, durable, affordable!</li>
            <li> This is not at all what I was expecting. It feels like a makeup bag one could find at the dollar store, with a worse zipper. The front pocket, which presumably holds the cord, is awkward at best, and would leave a chunk of cord exposed. Not at all the cute and functional item I was hoping for. This will be going back.</li>
            <li> The pouch looks like a high-end clutch purse. Made of quality material. My flat iron fit perfectly, as well as my flat iron comb.</li>
            <li> This product closes up like a bag overall it is simple a little pricey but does have a handy side pocket in front to store a comb etc.....it serves the purpose .</li>
            <li> Holds any flat iron and doubles as a mat. I put the cord in the front pouch and store it under the sink.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for travel with my straight iron, but too small for my curling iron. I wish they made a bigger size.</li>
            <li> This is a large pouch and it is still not quite big enough for my curling iron. Must be a me problem. Regardless, this pouch is well made roomy and my hot curling iron goes right in the pouch at the gym.</li>
            <li> This pouch is much better than how it looks here, it&#x27;s really high quality &amp; big enough, my 2&amp;#34; Remington straightening iron fit perfectly well, plus a heat resistant silicone clear pad. Nice &amp; Classy.</li>
            <li> The bag is cute and heat resistant but it doesn&#x27;t fit the cord for my flat iron so I end up having to zip it up but leaving the cord hanging out and wrapping it around the bag if I&#x27;m traveling with it.  I was going to return it but Amazon customer service was awesome and refunded my money and let me keep the bag so I ended up just using it.  It&#x27;s also a bit big if you are just using it for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This product seems to do the job it is for. I haven&#x27;t used it yet for traveling so that will be the test.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the fact that it completely unzips and lies flat so it can be used for a heat mat when traveling.  The outer pocket is nice as well.  I have a full size flat iron and it does fit, but it is a little tight getting the cord in completely.  It can be done, but if it were just a little bit bigger that would have been great.</li>

            <li> I wanted somthing I could store my flat iron in for traveling and this fit the bill. I like that when you unzip it it will lay completly flat, open on the counter, so you can use it has a place to put the flat iron (or any other hot item) down during use. I didn&#x27;t notice untill I received it, but it has a front pocket as well. The inside is large enough to fit the flat iron and cord with out having to struggle to get the zipper closed. So far very pleased with this product. I gave it 4, opposed to 5, stars simply for look and style.</li>
            <li> good product does the job</li>
            <li> She now doesn&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down. Just finish up, wrap the wire and place in the bag. It fits her straightener perfectly and she&#x27;s extremely happy.</li>
            <li> Neat pouch.  Holds both my large flat iron and outside pocket holds my small flat iron.  Great for travel also.  Opens up all the way for protecting the table top from the heat of the flat iron.  Great product.</li>

            <li> Complete waste of my money. Way to SHORT to accommodate the average size flat iron/curling iron. Wish I could find my receipt so I could return it.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift. I loved it because, much to my surprise, it has a dark purple zipper.  Luckily, the recipient loves purple, too.  May have been my oversight when ordering, but I didn&#x27;t see the colored zipper.  Otherwise, this is a great looking and great performing product.</li>
            <li> bag is great to keep your straighten iron yet it&#x27;s very thin, lenth and height are perfect but it&#x27;s narrow, i wanted it to carry my iron and curler but cannot fit both, only the iron and mini iron but overall bag is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Initially I just purchased this case to house my flat iron when traveling. It&#x27;s so cute and protective that it now houses my flat iron year round. Plus the pouch on the front fits my clips and bobby pins perfectly. Love it!</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner. My flat iron will not fit in it because the cord is too bulky. It is also hard to zip shut after you lay it open flat. I ended up buying another dual voltage flat iron to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> It was delivered to my house the next day i ordered it, beautiful silver zip pouch. It was a lot bigger than what i expected, so i was extremely suprized!! Fits my flat iron, and i like the elastic front pouch for the wires. It is actually pretty cute, it reminds me of a clutch because of the wristlet strap. Love it, great product!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and fits my straightener....I would have liked the pocket to be larger/deeper, but it works well enough.</li>
