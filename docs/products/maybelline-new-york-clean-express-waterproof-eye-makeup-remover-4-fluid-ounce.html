            <li>I have never had a product work on removing my makeup so good.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what will piss it off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>packaging is really nice looking</li>
            <li>How handy is that?</li>
            <li>so already I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>The best make up remover in the whole world.  </li>
            <li>Best on the market, drug store or high end!</li>
            <li>well, I bought two and will probably buy more Love mabelline products they are so good for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for remove eye make up easily.</li>
            <li>very easy to use</li>
            <li>Love this product and love that it is on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that this remover does exactly what it claims to!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li>Works well and cheap!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff (tho my daughter does not).</li>
            <li>I love this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I&#x27;ve done irreparable damage to my skin around my eyes with all the wiping from trying to get my makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve used, because when I take my makeup off and go in the shower, this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have me looking like a raccoon by the end of my shower.</li>
            <li>: be sure to shake the bottle well, before each use, or you WILL find it greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Monday morning I woke up with more makeup under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re seeing blurriness like most eye makeup removers do that have oil in them.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and just love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Already the packaging is setting it apart from most of the rest because the top of the bottle has a flow control cap.</li>
            <li>I love this eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY makeup removers.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li>I love this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>it works, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>My makeup is waterproof and this stuff really works great.</li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li>The more &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; I use (i.e. the more times I apply it)</li>
            <li>the more mascara comes off.</li>
            <li>Like many makeup removers, it needs to be shaken, but unlike most, it settles very quickly, so you have to shake it each and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- feels fresh and amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s just light makeup, I imagine you can get it with one application. :)</li>
            <li>Probably the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves a nice clean cool feeling&lt;</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with this makeup remover that I have thrown away 5 bottles of other brand makeup removers</li>
            <li>Helps take off all make up easily</li>
            <li>It takes everything off quite easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>Removes water proof make up easily.</li>
            <li>This is so far the most affordable and most effective eye make up remover I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Best remover I&#x27;ve ever tried, hands down.</li>
            <li>It removes mascara quickly and without any effort!</li>
            <li>No need for scrubbing, not disgustingly oily, easy to wipe off when re-applying makeup right after you&#x27;ve taken it off.</li>
            <li>It works great and is the only non-oily makeup remover we can find.</li>
            <li>I always wear two waterproof mascaras and waterproof eyeliner and this is so eye to put on a wash cloth and wipe my eye makeup off in one swipe, irritation free.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to work phenomenally but give it some credit for how much it goes for!</li>
            <li>Works great and lasts for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>The original formula was a gel consistancy.</li>
            <li>I use it with a baby wipe, and after I remove the makeup I use the wipe to clean off any residue.  </li>
            <li>one cotton ball soaked with this Maybelline NY, Clean Express Makeup Remover has removed all of my eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and brow pencil.</li>
            <li>I bought this the first time at the store on super sale and have not been able to find it since</li>
            <li>The purpose of it is to get make up removed right?!</li>
            <li>I love maybelline new york !!</li>
            <li>I am dissapointed not to be able to buy it any more, manufacture discontinued it :o</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This works quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Be sure to shake the bottle really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Arrived when promised, well packaged &amp; I find this item to be very gentle on eye area &amp; easily removes makeup.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m being nit-picky, the packaging isn&#x27;t stellar, but the product is so good that I honestly couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
            <li>far as effectiveness goes, it does seem to remove a majority of my mascara, it has no odor and the bottle is extremely easy to use with a great little pour spout that won&#x27;t leak or give you more than you</li>
            <li>It works pretty well and is quite cheap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave it oily or dry it out but a nice even finish.&lt;br /&gt;- removed eyeshadow very quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>really waterproof !!</li>
            <li>It works really well and takes off my waterproof makeup just fine.</li>
            <li>With  fresh pad I wipe the gel away.</li>
            <li>one day when I was out, loved the pink bottle.  </li>
            <li>Takes off all eye make up and leaves your eye fresh.</li>
            <li>This was a must have in Marie Claire last year, and as expected, Amazon has Health and Beauty for the best price.  </li>
            <li>Eye makeup comes right off.</li>
            <li>Super gentle and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle in the skin also.</li>
            <li>and this was very gentle for her.</li>
            <li>This is the first eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li>off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said:  Once make-up is taken off, one NEEDS to rinse one&#x27;s closed eyes with warm water.  </li>
            <li>- it will given a bit of time (and not that much!).</li>
            <li>I love this on my 3rd bottle now.  </li>
            <li>When I rub the liquid between my fingers on the cotton ball it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and as soon as I swipe the first swipe all of my eyeshadow is gone from one eye.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Lancome eye make-up remover but have been looking for a more affordable substitute and finally i have found it.</li>
            <li>Oil free (they never area) and some that sting terribly near the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t review this exact product, but the one I received, which was the lotion version, works well.</li>
            <li>With this, it&#x27;s almost gone the first wipe.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and does not leave oily residue when you remove make-up!</li>
            <li>Works great at removing my make up and seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands of eye makeup remover and none have ever compared to Maybelline NY, Clean Express Makeup Remover.</li>
            <li>The two separate phase of oil and water gives it good cleaning ability and less oily as some of the whole oil based remover.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you&#x27;re following up with a gentle face soap and a liberal amount of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A few more really good swipes and all the black eyeliner and mascara was gone from the first eye.</li>
            <li>It removes regular eye make fine</li>
            <li>Gentle and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and gentle, accidentally got in my eye</li>
            <li>Works very well for all my waterproof mascaras and eyeliners.</li>
            <li>It takes waterproof makeup off with ease but it is very oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s gentle on your eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>It really is just for stubborn mascara and eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this over the wipes because you use them up much quicker.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting and is gentle.</li>
            <li>But 5/5 stars for gently removing my waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li>Drugstore or high end!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Does the job without leaving too much oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I really like it works just like my neutrogena</li>
            <li>Gentle on my eyes and skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used various eye makeup removal products before, but this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It was not the same formula as I had originally tried.</li>
            <li>So much better than their other &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This product is very, very greasy and oily and always manages to get in my eyes and cover them with a thin film of... greasiness and oiliness which makes sight a bit of an issue for a good amount of time after use.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I was using a more expensive production by L&#x27;Oreal and this is better.</li>
            <li>There are two main problems with this makeup remover:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>It takes several applications to remove the most basic of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The other Maybelline eye makeup remover is far better.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>Not only did it cost less, but it works better!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove normal mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few drugstore makeup removers, this is my favorite and is cheaper than a lot of the others.</li>
            <li>Even if I use 2 or 3 cotton balls soaked with the stuff, I can always swipe my upper lash lines and find more gunk with a dry Qtip afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is the only waterproof mascara remover that I have used that actually works and works quickly!</li>
            <li>I dont think I would use this without washing my face though, because it has an oily texture and new makeup wouldnt stick to it.</li>
            <li>no black residue, no dryness!!</li>
            <li>The advice that another reviewer gave about putting it on a cotton pad, and then holding it to one&#x27;s CLOSED eye for 20 seconds was spot on; my Neutrogena waterproof mascara and Maybeline eye shadow came right off!  </li>
            <li>This takes off my heaviest, most waterproof falsie-style mascara on one cotton ball in a few wipes - and cheaper than the alternatives!</li>
            <li>It sometimes takes a second go, as I wear full makeup daily.</li>
            <li>I prefer my sight unobstructed and clear</li>
            <li>One layer of clear liquid floating on another, requiring you to shake well before use.</li>
            <li>and I use non-water proof that I coat with a clear waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>I use kohl and it doesn&#x27;t remove it completely.</li>
            <li>Removes all your eye makeup with out drying out your eye area or making it sensitive.</li>
            <li>guess the only con I can think of is that you really can&#x27;t use this as an all-purpose makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I would frequently use them when I got out of the shower and saw what my cleanser had not taken off.  </li>
            <li>But wow was</li>
            <li>I surprised this stuff works and at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation (I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product because I&#x27;d never had a good experience with a drug store brand remover on my waterproof makeup.  </li>
            <li>far as looks goes, this makeup remover liquid looks like every other double layer solution available on the market.</li>
            <li>You can easily avoid this problem by using this before you wash your face or get in the shower, but it is just a small change in my routine.  </li>
            <li>After using the same makeup remover for over five years, I thought I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is I wish they would just leave the squeeze top out.  </li>
            <li>I generally avoid waterproof mascara for this reason alone.  </li>
            <li>It removes tough makeup easily and quickly with no stinging, no strong smell.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this item despite the bad reviews it got here, because I saw it used very effectively in a YouTube video by a beauty</li>
            <li>I use a shadow primer but other makeup removers do not have this much difficulty removing the shadow.</li>
            <li>Breaks down the eyeliner and mascara very well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as baby oil.</li>
            <li> I have never had a product work on removing my makeup so good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Lancôme but does the job.</li>
            <li> they could somehow make it not blinding this would be a good product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sized bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Good formula.</li>
            <li> The price is good</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes, and it works good in my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> Good remover.  </li>
            <li> Works great as it said it would :)</li>

            <li> The best make up remover in the whole world.  </li>
            <li> Best on the market, drug store or high end!</li>
            <li> well, I bought two and will probably buy more Love mabelline products they are so good for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for remove eye make up easily.</li>
            <li> very easy to use</li>
            <li> Love this product and love that it is on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that this remover does exactly what it claims to!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Works well and cheap!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff (tho my daughter does not).</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I&#x27;ve done irreparable damage to my skin around my eyes with all the wiping from trying to get my makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve used, because when I take my makeup off and go in the shower, this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have me looking like a raccoon by the end of my shower.</li>
            <li> : be sure to shake the bottle well, before each use, or you WILL find it greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Monday morning I woke up with more makeup under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re seeing blurriness like most eye makeup removers do that have oil in them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and just love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Already the packaging is setting it apart from most of the rest because the top of the bottle has a flow control cap.</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY makeup removers.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> it works, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> My makeup is waterproof and this stuff really works great.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li> The more &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; I use (i.e. the more times I apply it)</li>
            <li> the more mascara comes off.</li>
            <li> Like many makeup removers, it needs to be shaken, but unlike most, it settles very quickly, so you have to shake it each and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- feels fresh and amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s just light makeup, I imagine you can get it with one application. :)</li>
            <li> Probably the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves a nice clean cool feeling&lt;</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with this makeup remover that I have thrown away 5 bottles of other brand makeup removers</li>
            <li> Helps take off all make up easily</li>
            <li> It takes everything off quite easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> Removes water proof make up easily.</li>
            <li> This is so far the most affordable and most effective eye make up remover I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> Best remover I&#x27;ve ever tried, hands down.</li>
            <li> It removes mascara quickly and without any effort!</li>
            <li> No need for scrubbing, not disgustingly oily, easy to wipe off when re-applying makeup right after you&#x27;ve taken it off.</li>
            <li> It works great and is the only non-oily makeup remover we can find.</li>
            <li> I always wear two waterproof mascaras and waterproof eyeliner and this is so eye to put on a wash cloth and wipe my eye makeup off in one swipe, irritation free.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to work phenomenally but give it some credit for how much it goes for!</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> The original formula was a gel consistancy.</li>
            <li> I use it with a baby wipe, and after I remove the makeup I use the wipe to clean off any residue.  </li>
            <li> one cotton ball soaked with this Maybelline NY, Clean Express Makeup Remover has removed all of my eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and brow pencil.</li>
            <li> I bought this the first time at the store on super sale and have not been able to find it since</li>
            <li> The purpose of it is to get make up removed right?!</li>
            <li> I love maybelline new york !!</li>
            <li> I am dissapointed not to be able to buy it any more, manufacture discontinued it :o</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This works quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Be sure to shake the bottle really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised, well packaged &amp; I find this item to be very gentle on eye area &amp; easily removes makeup.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m being nit-picky, the packaging isn&#x27;t stellar, but the product is so good that I honestly couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
            <li> far as effectiveness goes, it does seem to remove a majority of my mascara, it has no odor and the bottle is extremely easy to use with a great little pour spout that won&#x27;t leak or give you more than you</li>
            <li> It works pretty well and is quite cheap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave it oily or dry it out but a nice even finish.&lt;br /&gt;- removed eyeshadow very quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> really waterproof !!</li>
            <li> It works really well and takes off my waterproof makeup just fine.</li>
            <li> With  fresh pad I wipe the gel away.</li>
            <li> one day when I was out, loved the pink bottle.  </li>
            <li> Takes off all eye make up and leaves your eye fresh.</li>
            <li> This was a must have in Marie Claire last year, and as expected, Amazon has Health and Beauty for the best price.  </li>
            <li> Eye makeup comes right off.</li>
            <li> Super gentle and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle in the skin also.</li>
            <li> and this was very gentle for her.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said:  Once make-up is taken off, one NEEDS to rinse one&#x27;s closed eyes with warm water.  </li>
            <li> - it will given a bit of time (and not that much!).</li>
            <li> I love this on my 3rd bottle now.  </li>
            <li> When I rub the liquid between my fingers on the cotton ball it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and as soon as I swipe the first swipe all of my eyeshadow is gone from one eye.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Lancome eye make-up remover but have been looking for a more affordable substitute and finally i have found it.</li>
            <li> Oil free (they never area) and some that sting terribly near the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review this exact product, but the one I received, which was the lotion version, works well.</li>
            <li> With this, it&#x27;s almost gone the first wipe.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and does not leave oily residue when you remove make-up!</li>
            <li> Works great at removing my make up and seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands of eye makeup remover and none have ever compared to Maybelline NY, Clean Express Makeup Remover.</li>
            <li> The two separate phase of oil and water gives it good cleaning ability and less oily as some of the whole oil based remover.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you&#x27;re following up with a gentle face soap and a liberal amount of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A few more really good swipes and all the black eyeliner and mascara was gone from the first eye.</li>
            <li> It removes regular eye make fine</li>
            <li> Gentle and non greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and gentle, accidentally got in my eye</li>
            <li> Works very well for all my waterproof mascaras and eyeliners.</li>
            <li> It takes waterproof makeup off with ease but it is very oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle on your eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> It really is just for stubborn mascara and eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this over the wipes because you use them up much quicker.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting and is gentle.</li>
            <li> But 5/5 stars for gently removing my waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> Drugstore or high end!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Does the job without leaving too much oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I really like it works just like my neutrogena</li>
            <li> Gentle on my eyes and skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used various eye makeup removal products before, but this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It was not the same formula as I had originally tried.</li>
            <li> So much better than their other &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is very, very greasy and oily and always manages to get in my eyes and cover them with a thin film of... greasiness and oiliness which makes sight a bit of an issue for a good amount of time after use.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I was using a more expensive production by L&#x27;Oreal and this is better.</li>
            <li> There are two main problems with this makeup remover:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> It takes several applications to remove the most basic of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The other Maybelline eye makeup remover is far better.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Not only did it cost less, but it works better!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove normal mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few drugstore makeup removers, this is my favorite and is cheaper than a lot of the others.</li>
            <li> Even if I use 2 or 3 cotton balls soaked with the stuff, I can always swipe my upper lash lines and find more gunk with a dry Qtip afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is the only waterproof mascara remover that I have used that actually works and works quickly!</li>
            <li> I dont think I would use this without washing my face though, because it has an oily texture and new makeup wouldnt stick to it.</li>
            <li> no black residue, no dryness!!</li>
            <li> The advice that another reviewer gave about putting it on a cotton pad, and then holding it to one&#x27;s CLOSED eye for 20 seconds was spot on; my Neutrogena waterproof mascara and Maybeline eye shadow came right off!  </li>
            <li> This takes off my heaviest, most waterproof falsie-style mascara on one cotton ball in a few wipes - and cheaper than the alternatives!</li>
            <li> It sometimes takes a second go, as I wear full makeup daily.</li>
            <li> I prefer my sight unobstructed and clear</li>
            <li> One layer of clear liquid floating on another, requiring you to shake well before use.</li>
            <li> and I use non-water proof that I coat with a clear waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I use kohl and it doesn&#x27;t remove it completely.</li>
            <li> Removes all your eye makeup with out drying out your eye area or making it sensitive.</li>
            <li> guess the only con I can think of is that you really can&#x27;t use this as an all-purpose makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I would frequently use them when I got out of the shower and saw what my cleanser had not taken off.  </li>
            <li> But wow was</li>
            <li> I surprised this stuff works and at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation (I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because I&#x27;d never had a good experience with a drug store brand remover on my waterproof makeup.  </li>
            <li> far as looks goes, this makeup remover liquid looks like every other double layer solution available on the market.</li>
            <li> You can easily avoid this problem by using this before you wash your face or get in the shower, but it is just a small change in my routine.  </li>
            <li> After using the same makeup remover for over five years, I thought I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish they would just leave the squeeze top out.  </li>
            <li> I generally avoid waterproof mascara for this reason alone.  </li>
            <li> It removes tough makeup easily and quickly with no stinging, no strong smell.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this item despite the bad reviews it got here, because I saw it used very effectively in a YouTube video by a beauty</li>
            <li> I use a shadow primer but other makeup removers do not have this much difficulty removing the shadow.</li>
            <li> Breaks down the eyeliner and mascara very well.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating because even after I used it, little bits of mascara was falling into my eyes and causing them to water, which would cause more bits to fall into my eyes...</li>
            <li> Very greasy and is hard to remove with just water.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this pink little bottle.</li>
            <li> skin may feel dry after use.</li>
            <li> but I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This is much less expensive and easily dissolves my waterproof eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> Quick, easy and didn&#x27;t have a horrible smell to me.</li>
            <li> Very oily though  after using my eyes are so oily and it is very hard to get the oil off my eyes</li>
            <li> :) I don&#x27;t like ugly bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received a wet box and one of three bottles was empty, having an unsealed lid, causing leaking inside the box.</li>
            <li> I wet the cotton and just rest it on my eye, with no need to rub.</li>
            <li> It goes on wet but dries like it was never there.</li>
            <li> No real scrubbing involved, which is what was required from all of the other liquid remover brands to remove anything at all.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin around your eyes feeling tight and dry.. and make up still in tact.</li>
            <li> But something should be done about the bottle opening: sometimes it just drips out, other times it pours.</li>
            <li> I think I shall set up to have it delivered every other month.</li>
            <li> That NEVER happened with my other makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> the other liquid remover brands to remove anything at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried makeup remover from brands such as Estee Lauder, Sephora, Clinique, MAC, Neutrogena, E.L.F., Victoria&#x27;s Secret, and other generic store brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the eyes but tough on hard to remove waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> Like I said previously, I will never use another brand of makeup remover again.f</li>
            <li> Like I said previously, I will never use another brand of makeup remover again.</li>
            <li> As small as the bottle is, I applied half of what came out, and dripped the other half on the floor.</li>
            <li> it is a little bit oily</li>
            <li> a little oily feeling to me</li>
            <li> It takes my mascara off with just a little rubbing with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Little too oily for me</li>
            <li> , here&#x27;s the thing that people may not know about makeup removal:&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to apply this on a cotton round, cotton pad, cotton ball</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, just leave it on for a few seconds to a minute if not everything is coming off</li>
            <li> Clinique, Neutrogena, Victoria&#x27;s Secret (before they discontinued their eye makeup remover) and the generic brands from Target and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond all come in that layer liquid form and leave your face feeling greasy and smudgy.</li>
            <li> Even after soaking a sponge and holding it over my eye for a few seconds, just smeared some of the makeup and not pulling it</li>
            <li> I used to have to wipe over my eyes quite a few times before the makeup would be gone.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on a cotton ball and let it stay on the eye lid for about 10 seconds before wiping it off and it works wonders...</li>
            <li> a waste!</li>
            <li> Yes, I probably wear too much eye makeup :{  That being said,</li>
            <li> They all leave smudgy, black layers of mascara and eyeliner behind.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind no greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> It takes of all my eye makeup in one swipe even the waterproof hard to get stuff.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than what I have been using and works just as well on my black waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> However, for the price and the effectiveness, rinsing is a *very* small price to pay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on thick, smells weird, and does not remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Gets EVERYTHING off without irritating my eyes or my contacts.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased it from a store then I would have returned it,but this site wouldn&#x27;t let me,they don&#x27;t stand behind products....</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of eye makeup removers, and this is by far the WORST.</li>
            <li> BURNS my eyes when I apply it which is just wrong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts, doesn&#x27;t have a weird greasy consistency AT ALL, leaves no residue, does the job.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel weird.</li>
            <li> Buy this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless.</li>
            <li> I am so tired of all the oil-free products being so oily!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible experience with this product-</li>

            <li> Gentle and non greasy.  I use kohl and it doesn&#x27;t remove it completely.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of eye makeup removers, and this is by far the WORST. I wouldn&#x27;t wish this goopy gel on anyone! Goes on thick, smells weird, and does not remove makeup. It leaves the skin around your eyes feeling tight and dry.. and make up still in tact. Do not waste your money on this pink little bottle.</li>
            <li> Great Product, packing was secure and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> not the GEL as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and gentle, accidentally got in my eye and it didn&#x27;t burn or sting. But something should be done about the bottle opening: sometimes it just drips out, other times it pours. As small as the bottle is, I applied half of what came out, and dripped the other half on the floor.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite eye makeup remover. Gets EVERYTHING off without irritating my eyes or my contacts. I&#x27;ll be using this stuff forever.</li>
            <li> it is a little bit oily</li>
            <li> Works very well for all my waterproof mascaras and eyeliners. Removes everything. Affordable too! No milia, sensitivity reactions, or haziness/blurring of vision. Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible experience with this product- takes forever to remove all of my shadow/mascara and always seems to leave mascara residue behind no matter how much product I apply or how much I try and swipe it away with the cotton ball. I use a shadow primer but other makeup removers do not have this much difficulty removing the shadow. I&#x27;m even using a Maybelline mascara and the mascara is not even waterproof! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Helps take off all make up easily</li>
            <li> It takes waterproof makeup off with ease but it is very oily. I do not think I will buy this again</li>
            <li> Removes all your eye makeup with out drying out your eye area or making it sensitive. Quick, easy and didn&#x27;t have a horrible smell to me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff (tho my daughter does not). It takes everything off quite easily. It is a bit oily, but I haven&#x27;t ever found a good makeup remover that isn&#x27;t. A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> good product, good price, no complaints</li>
            <li> This is the only waterproof mascara remover that I have used that actually works and works quickly!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as baby oil. There is still some trace in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover.  I used to use the Mary Kay remover.  This is much less expensive and easily dissolves my waterproof eye makeup.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle on your eyes&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a nice clean cool feeling&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is really nice looking and I don&#x27;t mind leaving it on my counter or out in sight. This is a big issue for me because I have no cabinets in my bathroom. :) I don&#x27;t like ugly bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I guess the only con I can think of is that you really can&#x27;t use this as an all-purpose makeup remover. It really is just for stubborn mascara and eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a gel. How I use it: I squirt a dime-sized amount on a cotton pad and apply the gel to my eyes. I use the same pad for both eyes. With  fresh pad I wipe the gel away. It sometimes takes a second go, as I wear full makeup daily. If it&#x27;s just light makeup, I imagine you can get it with one application. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used. I am sure I&#x27;ve done irreparable damage to my skin around my eyes with all the wiping from trying to get my makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin may feel dry after use. Mine does. Just make sure you&#x27;re following up with a gentle face soap and a liberal amount of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I like it a lot. It works pretty well and is quite cheap. Will stick to it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific! Takes my waterproof mascaras off instantly, with no eye goopiness or burning. I&#x27;ll pit it against any high-end brand.</li>
            <li> Great price for an eye makeup remover that works!</li>
            <li> This is so far the most affordable and most effective eye make up remover I&#x27;ve found.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and removes waterproof mascara with ease.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Amazing! It takes of all my eye makeup in one swipe even the waterproof hard to get stuff. I have never had a product work on removing my makeup so good. It is very gentle in the skin also. I bought this the first time at the store on super sale and have not been able to find it since so thank gosh Amazon has it I bought several so I was stocked up for a while. It&#x27;s a must have!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my current eye makeup remover, Studio 35 Beauty eye makeup remover.  Not only did it cost less, but it works better!  The advice that another reviewer gave about putting it on a cotton pad, and then holding it to one&#x27;s CLOSED eye for 20 seconds was spot on; my Neutrogena waterproof mascara and Maybeline eye shadow came right off!  As for sensitivity, it did not hurt while in use, nor after I&#x27;d rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said:  Once make-up is taken off, one NEEDS to rinse one&#x27;s closed eyes with warm water.  (Thus I recommend using this next to the sink, so you can rinse as soon as the make-up is off.)  This is NOT a stand-alone makeup remover!  If you do not rinse, then yes, it will sting and possibly damage your eyes.  However, for the price and the effectiveness, rinsing is a *very* small price to pay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will *definitely* be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this item despite the bad reviews it got here, because I saw it used very effectively in a YouTube video by a beauty guru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works amazing! It&#x27;s probably the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve used, because when I take my makeup off and go in the shower, this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have me looking like a raccoon by the end of my shower. It takes it all off, no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s the thing that people may not know about makeup removal:&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to apply this on a cotton round, cotton pad, cotton ball, you name it,&lt;br /&gt;Then you put this on your eye for about 20 seconds, and then wipe. It breaks off the makeup. Trust me on this. So simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was bigger, but I guess there must be a bigger size.</li>
            <li> It definitely does its job. Don&#x27;t expect it to work phenomenally but give it some credit for how much it goes for! Definitely would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I saw the reviews but didn&#x27;t think it could compare to my expensive Mary Kay makeup remover that I&#x27;ve used for many years. I was glad to see I was mistaken! Buy this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!  PS: be sure to shake the bottle well, before each use, or you WILL find it greasy.</li>
            <li> This definitely removes even the waterproof makeup, but you will need to wash your face after using it.  Prior to this, I had been using makeup remover wipes, and they didn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue.  I would frequently use them when I got out of the shower and saw what my cleanser had not taken off.  I tried that with this, and while it removed everything, it left oil that I had to wash off.  You can easily avoid this problem by using this before you wash your face or get in the shower, but it is just a small change in my routine.  I wanted to try this over the wipes because you use them up much quicker.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. No scent. Doesn&#x27;t leave eyes oily or stinging.</li>
            <li> Works great as it said it would :)</li>
            <li> Great for the price works well, I bought two and will probably buy more Love mabelline products they are so good for the price</li>
            <li> This works quickly and cleanly. I am dissapointed not to be able to buy it any more, manufacture discontinued it :o(</li>
            <li> really waterproof !! no grease! oil with water, bigger than i imaged! I love maybelline new york !! it is a must have!</li>
            <li> Not as good as Lancôme but does the job. I have to rub it in my lashes with finger to get off mascara so I gave 3star</li>
            <li> It works. It doesn&#x27;t sting and is gentle. I would buy again and again. I think I shall set up to have it delivered every other month. How handy is that?</li>
            <li> After using the same makeup remover for over five years, I thought I&#x27;d try something new.  I chose this eye makeup remover because the waterproof mascara I use is from Maybelline and it made sense that this remover would actually work on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday morning I put on my mascara.  Saturday evening, I used this to remove it.  Sunday morning, I woke up with raccoon smudges under my eyes.  That NEVER happened with my other makeup remover.  I used the makeup remover again, washed my face.  That afternoon, I still had smudges.  So I used it again and took a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday morning I woke up with more makeup under my eyes.  Are you kidding me?  I shouldn&#x27;t have to use ten cotton balls of makeup remover to get rid of one coat of mascara.  This stuff is worthless.</li>
            <li> It removes regular eye make fine but I find it takes a lot to remove waterproof mascara.  I generally avoid waterproof mascara for this reason alone.  I would buy the product again though</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover. I regret buying one at make when you can get this for a fraction of the cost. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> a little oily feeling to me but I have oily skin.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I use this with tissues or cotton balls each night. Works just as well as Neutrogena IMHO. Like another reviewer said, just leave it on for a few seconds to a minute if not everything is coming off - it will given a bit of time (and not that much!). This takes off my heaviest, most waterproof falsie-style mascara on one cotton ball in a few wipes - and cheaper than the alternatives!</li>
            <li> I use this product in the shower before I wash my face to remove my waterproof mascara. I love it! It takes my mascara off with just a little rubbing with my fingers. I dont think I would use this without washing my face though, because it has an oily texture and new makeup wouldnt stick to it. But 5/5 stars for gently removing my waterproof makeup. No pain and no damaged eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara but this product can&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup. The other Maybelline eye makeup remover is far better.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover I ever used! Drugstore or high end! It&#x27;s gentle on the eyes but tough on hard to remove waterproof makeup. It has been discontinued in all of my local drug stores but I was so happy to find it available on amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover there is for waterproof makeup! I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes and you&#x27;re seeing blurriness like most eye makeup removers do that have oil in them. It removes mascara quickly and without any effort!</li>
            <li> This product showed up to me like it was opened already and the label peeling off.  I feel like someone sent me their already used portion.&lt;br /&gt;Ewww gross.</li>
            <li> Does great at removing my water proof mascara and eyeliner. Very oily though  after using my eyes are so oily and it is very hard to get the oil off my eyes</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and just love it. It works great and is the only non-oily makeup remover we can find.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I got it at Walmart one day when I was out, loved the pink bottle.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting much I prefer Estee Lauder and Lancôme.  But wow was I surprised this stuff works and at a fraction of the cost.  Be sure to shake the bottle really well.  I use a  cotton ball I sweep it on and then go back 15 seconds later and all that eye makeup even stubborn mascara is gone.  I love this on my 3rd bottle now.  Amazon has the best price.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Never found eye makeup remover that worked without scrubbing and hurting my eye. I always wear two waterproof mascaras and waterproof eyeliner and this is so eye to put on a wash cloth and wipe my eye makeup off in one swipe, irritation free. Remember to shake before using or it will be oily!</li>
            <li> I have used various eye makeup removal products before, but this is by far my favorite.  It truly removes all the eye makeup, including mascara.  I use it with a baby wipe, and after I remove the makeup I use the wipe to clean off any residue.  Leaves behind no greasy mess.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because I&#x27;d never had a good experience with a drug store brand remover on my waterproof makeup.  I&#x27;m happy to say that this remover does exactly what it claims to!  When I use it, every last bit of waterproof mascara comes off!! This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Works great and lasts for quite a long time. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few drugstore makeup removers, this is my favorite and is cheaper than a lot of the others.</li>
            <li> Little too oily for me</li>
            <li> This product is very, very greasy and oily and always manages to get in my eyes and cover them with a thin film of... greasiness and oiliness which makes sight a bit of an issue for a good amount of time after use.&lt;br /&gt;As I prefer my sight unobstructed and clear I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness goes, it does seem to remove a majority of my mascara, it has no odor and the bottle is extremely easy to use with a great little pour spout that won&#x27;t leak or give you more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could somehow make it not blinding this would be a good product.</li>
            <li> I find it oily but it&#x27;s good. The purpose of it is to get make up removed right?!</li>
            <li> I am so tired of all the oil-free products being so oily!!!! It gets the make up off, but I don&#x27;t like how it leaves my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands of eye makeup remover and none have ever compared to Maybelline NY, Clean Express Makeup Remover. I&#x27;ve tried makeup remover from brands such as Estee Lauder, Sephora, Clinique, MAC, Neutrogena, E.L.F., Victoria&#x27;s Secret, and other generic store brands. They all leave smudgy, black layers of mascara and eyeliner behind. Even if I use 2 or 3 cotton balls soaked with the stuff, I can always swipe my upper lash lines and find more gunk with a dry Qtip afterwards. Yes, I probably wear too much eye makeup :{  That being said, one cotton ball soaked with this Maybelline NY, Clean Express Makeup Remover has removed all of my eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and brow pencil. I didn&#x27;t even need to reach for a second cotton ball for the second eye. I was so impressed with this makeup remover that I have thrown away 5 bottles of other brand makeup removers and I plan never to get another type again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as looks goes, this makeup remover liquid looks like every other double layer solution available on the market. One layer of clear liquid floating on another, requiring you to shake well before use. Clinique, Neutrogena, Victoria&#x27;s Secret (before they discontinued their eye makeup remover) and the generic brands from Target and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond all come in that layer liquid form and leave your face feeling greasy and smudgy. Expecting the Maybelline solution to have the same effect as the others, I shake it up and take the cap off. Already the packaging is setting it apart from most of the rest because the top of the bottle has a flow control cap. The liquid doesn&#x27;t just gush out all at once so already I&#x27;m loving it. When I rub the liquid between my fingers on the cotton ball it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and as soon as I swipe the first swipe all of my eyeshadow is gone from one eye. A few more really good swipes and all the black eyeliner and mascara was gone from the first eye. No real scrubbing involved, which is what was required from all of the other liquid remover brands to remove anything at all. Like I said previously, I will never use another brand of makeup remover again.f the other liquid remover brands to remove anything at all. Like I said previously, I will never use another brand of makeup remover again.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Lancome eye make-up remover but have been looking for a more affordable substitute and finally i have found it. I love this eye makeup remover. It cleans off my water proof eye liner and mascara without any issues. I usually put it on a cotton ball and let it stay on the eye lid for about 10 seconds before wiping it off and it works wonders...no black residue, no dryness!! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Was totally inefficient,wouldn&#x27;t remove the mascara.I threw it away.I should have purchased it from a store then I would have returned it,but this site wouldn&#x27;t let me,they don&#x27;t stand behind products....a waste!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY makeup removers.  Oil free (they never area) and some that sting terribly near the eyes.  Not this one!  It removes tough makeup easily and quickly with no stinging, no strong smell.  It&#x27;s my go to remover.</li>
            <li> I actually received an item that I didn&#x27;t order, but it&#x27;s the same line and also removes makeup. I can&#x27;t review this exact product, but the one I received, which was the lotion version, works well. It&#x27;s a good sized bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> The two separate phase of oil and water gives it good cleaning ability and less oily as some of the whole oil based remover.</li>
            <li> Received a wet box and one of three bottles was empty, having an unsealed lid, causing leaking inside the box.</li>
            <li> It works perfect for taking off my eye makeup. Super gentle and not oily at all. Its totally a great deal.</li>
            <li> The best make up remover in the whole world.  Takes off all eye make up and leaves your eye fresh.</li>
            <li> Does not burn the eyes love this!</li>
            <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes at all. Comes off great with a cotton ball. Recommend!</li>
            <li> It was not the same formula as I had originally tried. The original formula was a gel consistancy. The one received is oily and watery consistancy.</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than what I have been using and works just as well on my black waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite eye makeup removers. I wet the cotton and just rest it on my eye, with no need to rub. Eye makeup comes right off.</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover.  Does the job without leaving too much oily residue.  It&#x27;s a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Works great just seems a Lil oily</li>
            <li> Works great on non-waterproof eye make up, including stubborn mascara.</li>
            <li> This is not for oily skin but I have dry skin so it&#x27;s great for me all my makeup came of even with glitter everything comes out I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. Removes the make up but the skin gets too oilly after using.</li>
            <li> Gets waterproof makeup off in a cinch. No need for scrubbing, not disgustingly oily, easy to wipe off when re-applying makeup right after you&#x27;ve taken it off. Good formula.</li>
            <li> Removes long-lasting lipstick and eye makeup although I think I would go back to Neutrogena the next time.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised, well packaged &amp; I find this item to be very gentle on eye area &amp; easily removes makeup.</li>
            <li> it works, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice now and it does a great job with no irritation on my skin. My makeup is waterproof and this stuff really works great. The price is good so I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Not that great. Let me give the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- feels fresh and amazing on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave it oily or dry it out but a nice even finish.&lt;br /&gt;- removed eyeshadow very quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation (I have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s amazing what will piss it off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t take off its own brand?! I was wearing maybelline eyeliner and it wouldn&#x27;t come off.&lt;br /&gt;- takes forever to come off and doesn&#x27;t remove makeup thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;- BURNS my eyes when I apply it which is just wrong. (It IS made for the eyes....supposedly!)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t remove mascara thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using Vaseline to take the rest off.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? Do not invest in this product. The cons outweigh the pros because it doesn&#x27;t DO what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Even after soaking a sponge and holding it over my eye for a few seconds, just smeared some of the makeup and not pulling it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase nuetrogena or equate eye makeup remover. I keep trying others and always go back to that one.  Lesson finally learned.</li>
            <li> Removes my stubborn waterproof mascara and bulletproof under eye concealer like a charm. Best remover I&#x27;ve ever tried, hands down. I think I&#x27;m on my sixth bottle, maybe seventh (lost count). Doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts, doesn&#x27;t have a weird greasy consistency AT ALL, leaves no residue, does the job. Perfect. If I&#x27;m being nit-picky, the packaging isn&#x27;t stellar, but the product is so good that I honestly couldn&#x27;t care less. Love it and will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover!!!!! Totally recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Effortlessly removes waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> The value for money can&#x27;t be beat... and no stinging eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like it works just like my neutrogena it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes, and it works good in my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> this is the only product I use now. Removes water proof make up easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great cheaper alternative to Lancôme Bifacils eye makeup remover! It works really well and takes off my waterproof makeup just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how great this works! Gentle on my eyes and skin.  I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no breakouts or redness from this.  It removes eye liner, mascara, eye shadow and brow liner with ease.  It works well with cotton pads.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This eye makeup remover works great even for waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I use waterproof mascara and I use non-water proof that I coat with a clear waterproof mascara. Take your time to let it soak a bit and off it comes. I was using a more expensive production by L&#x27;Oreal and this is better.</li>
            <li> There are two main problems with this makeup remover:&lt;br /&gt;1) It takes several applications to remove the most basic of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;2) Like many makeup removers, it needs to be shaken, but unlike most, it settles very quickly, so you have to shake it each and every time you go to put some on a cotton ball. This is especially problematic, since, as I said already, it takes several applications to remove basic makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for remove eye make up easily.</li>
            <li> Probably the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a makeup remover.  I used to have to wipe over my eyes quite a few times before the makeup would be gone.  With this, it&#x27;s almost gone the first wipe.  This stuff is amazing and will not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Very greasy and is hard to remove with just water. Makes your skin feel weird.</li>
            <li> This was a must have in Marie Claire last year, and as expected, Amazon has Health and Beauty for the best price.  Go Amazon!</li>
            <li> good. very easy to use</li>
            <li> Works well to remove all traces of eye makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and does not leave oily residue when you remove make-up!</li>
            <li> Removes makeup quickly and easily. My eye area doesn&#x27;t hurt after I use it.  It does not make my eyes watery. It goes on wet but dries like it was never there. Not oily at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover, but it just wasn&#x27;t doing anything to get my waterproof mascara off. It was frustrating because even after I used it, little bits of mascara was falling into my eyes and causing them to water, which would cause more bits to fall into my eyes...a torturous cycle. I&#x27;d had enough and decided to try this product. It works great! The more &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; I use (i.e. the more times I apply it) the more mascara comes off. Once I&#x27;m finished it looks like I don&#x27;t have any mascara on at all. Now, when I wake up in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t look like I have raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Works great at removing my make up and seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it works perfectly for her needs. She has sensitive skin and this was very gentle for her.</li>
            <li> Good remover.  So much better than their other &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; formula.  I threw that one out because it would get into my eyes.  This however is a liquid.  Breaks down the eyeliner and mascara very well. My only complaint is I wish they would just leave the squeeze top out.  I&#x27;d much prefer to tip it onto my cotton ball than to squeeze it out-that waste the product.  Hhmmmm....</li>
            <li> This stuff takes off everything! Best on the market, drug store or high end!</li>
