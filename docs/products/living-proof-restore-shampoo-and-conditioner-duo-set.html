            <li>The Best shampoo and conditioner on the market and a prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>best shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Great Transaction!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, love it!</li>
            <li>Ok..the product is good</li>
            <li>I have had good results with cheaper hair products.</li>
            <li>My cosmetologist always comments on how good my hair now looks.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo seems to over clean my hair, conditioner is great.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I ordered more of this product.</li>
            <li>With that said, the shampoo is ok...</li>
            <li>I read about this stuff in More Magazine and had to try it.  </li>
            <li>The product is awesome and smells terrific.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>And the fact that all LP shampoos are sulfate free, means that my color will stay fresh and bright.  </li>
            <li>but PHD is a much better fit.  </li>
            <li>And given how damaging most shampoos are, having one this gentle that still makes my hair look great is worth the money.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is awesome, but if you have oily had at all, your hair will be extremely oily</li>
            <li>I subsequently tried the Perfect Hair Day formula and it&#x27;s the right fit for me.  </li>
            <li>I will still use up the remaining Restore s/c on days when my hair seems more abused than usual, lol!</li>
            <li>They do make your hair looks smooth and shining, but try not to get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>All they had to do was secure the caps.</li>
            <li>Malibu line is far superior in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so I was able to get started right away.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>Took about three washes and I saw a significant difference in my hair&#x27;s texture, softness and sheen.  </li>
            <li>and they arrived quickly, within a day of one another</li>
            <li>I am a lifetime fan of this line and plan to be a loyal user.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it makes my hair soft especially with dye in my hair which it was very very dry great products :)</li>
            <li>then I end up with soft, lightly defined, beachy looking waves.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps my hair clean for nearly a week, which is unheard of for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The positive reviews on Restore led me to try it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re really just paying for the celebrity draw of the Aniston name.  </li>
            <li>This (along with PHD) makes a blow out much easier for me</li>
            <li>Really like these products.  </li>
            <li>It had been ruined due to radiation treatments for cancer, but now looks healthy and normal again.</li>
            <li>It hydrates just enough and eliminates frizz, leaving me with sleek, soft, shiny, frizz free strands that have body and bounce.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine, layer hair that looks frizzy if I don&#x27;t do a complete blow out.  </li>
            <li>So far, I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Customer service rectified immediately, A+ for communication  and action!  </li>
            <li>The plastic bag they were in was filled with a mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but I would probably not purchase it again due to the excessive price.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft, but when I was using the second bottle, I noticed my hair was really breaking off.  </li>
            <li>I also heat style frequently so dryness is always an issue.  </li>
            <li>I finally figured out that this formula had too much conditioning for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it was cheaper on Amazon rather than directly from the company.  </li>
            <li>Kevin Murphy Shampoo and Kerastase Bain leaves hair soft, with body and the fullness and shine lasts three days.</li>
            <li>but it only dried out my hair even more.  </li>
            <li>maybe using the entire product line at once has been the key to this success.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month, my hair is much improved, and my color hasn&#x27;t faded nearly as much as with the other salon brand that I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
            <li>Living Proof makes my hair so shiny and not dry.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurel sulfate (one of the few that doesn&#x27;t) and seems to be very gentle.  </li>
            <li>When you get out of the shower with literally squeaky clean hair, that is too much cleaning and is not good for your hair!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to deep condition with one of my other trusted brands every day for 3 days just to get it back to normal.....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had to deep condition with one of my other trusted brands every day for 3 days just to get it back to normal.....</li>
            <li> But apparently my hair is not as dry and damaged as I thought.  </li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair and dyed, double processed and it tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously intended for severely dry, damaged tresses, even for those with breakage.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this s/c for those with very dry, damaged hair in need of extra TLC.  </li>
            <li> Your hair retains water making it twice as long to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I had to use the &amp;#34;tears&amp;#34; eye drops for a week because it made my eyes felt dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium textured, wavy, color treated, dry and prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily greasy hair, maybe this may normalize you, but this should not be used if you already have dry ends.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner adds a little body to my hair so it blows out with some lift and bounce that lasts for several days.  </li>
            <li> I used this s/c for two weeks, as suggested by the company, and while it did eliminated the dryness and frizz completely, it left my hair heavy and lacking body.  </li>
            <li> But it was simply too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair limp shortly after blow drying and, by the day after using these products, hair is greasy and stringy looking.  </li>
            <li> I use a small dab in my palm so it will last for a while.  </li>
            <li> When the formula changed on the shampoo I had been using for years, I struggled to find a replacement that didn&#x27;t dry out my hair, strip the color or leave a heavy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> The bottles were a little scuffed up due to the way they were packaged.</li>
            <li> I also thought it was a little pricey</li>
            <li> It did take a little longer than suggested to ship.</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> Again, no difference in my hair feel/behavior over using my usual conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair frizzy, hard and dry!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried several times, using minimal product but results were always awful.  </li>
            <li> It was also increasingly difficult to heat style and it needed washing as often as ever.  </li>
            <li> Please do not spend your hard earned money on this crap!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Calufornia girl born and raised I recently moved to South Dakota So my hair took a beating with the climate change And living proof brought my hair back to life .</li>
            <li> Wow...I was using Lanza products. Not any more. I have highlighted hair and dyed, double processed and it tends to dry out. Living Proof makes my hair so shiny and not dry. I ordered more of this product.</li>
            <li> They do make your hair looks smooth and shining, but try not to get it in your eyes. I had to use the &amp;#34;tears&amp;#34; eye drops for a week because it made my eyes felt dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> Received 2 bottles of shampoo instead of the shampoo/conditioner duo as stated.  Customer service rectified immediately, A+ for communication  and action!  With that said, the shampoo is ok...no physical difference in my hair behavior/texture/feel after using it.  Also purchased restore mask treatment.  meh!  Again, no difference in my hair feel/behavior over using my usual conditioner.  You&#x27;re really just paying for the celebrity draw of the Aniston name.  Malibu line is far superior in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Ok..the product is good But the caps on both bottles were opened when they arrived so the shampoo &amp; conditioner were all over the place. The plastic bag they were in was filled with a mess. All they had to do was secure the caps. What a mess!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, love it!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend but it only dried out my hair even more.  It&#x27;s just shampoo.  No miracle here.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, layer hair that looks frizzy if I don&#x27;t do a complete blow out.  This (along with PHD) makes a blow out much easier for me and if I happen to skip the blow out then I end up with soft, lightly defined, beachy looking waves.  I&#x27;m a fan….</li>
            <li> My hair is medium textured, wavy, color treated, dry and prone to frizz.  I also heat style frequently so dryness is always an issue.  But apparently my hair is not as dry and damaged as I thought.  I used this s/c for two weeks, as suggested by the company, and while it did eliminated the dryness and frizz completely, it left my hair heavy and lacking body.  It was also increasingly difficult to heat style and it needed washing as often as ever.  I finally figured out that this formula had too much conditioning for my hair.  It&#x27;s obviously intended for severely dry, damaged tresses, even for those with breakage.  I subsequently tried the Perfect Hair Day formula and it&#x27;s the right fit for me.  It hydrates just enough and eliminates frizz, leaving me with sleek, soft, shiny, frizz free strands that have body and bounce.  It also keeps my hair clean for nearly a week, which is unheard of for me.  And the fact that all LP shampoos are sulfate free, means that my color will stay fresh and bright.  I will still use up the remaining Restore s/c on days when my hair seems more abused than usual, lol! but PHD is a much better fit.  I recommend this s/c for those with very dry, damaged hair in need of extra TLC.  But it was simply too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome, but if you have oily had at all, your hair will be extremely oily</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it makes my hair soft especially with dye in my hair which it was very very dry great products :)</li>
            <li> The Best shampoo and conditioner on the market and a prompt delivery. Will be purchased again.</li>
            <li> I bought this set and the Restore Mask... all of these are a joke.  It made my hair like straw after one use and talk about frizz!!  I&#x27;ve had to deep condition with one of my other trusted brands every day for 3 days just to get it back to normal.....If you have oily greasy hair, maybe this may normalize you, but this should not be used if you already have dry ends.  When you get out of the shower with literally squeaky clean hair, that is too much cleaning and is not good for your hair!!!</li>
            <li> best shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> You restoreth my hair&#x27;s soul.</li>
            <li> I used  2 bottles of this shampoo and conditioner.  It made my hair really soft, but when I was using the second bottle, I noticed my hair was really breaking off.  I stopped using it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but I would probably not purchase it again due to the excessive price. I have had good results with cheaper hair products.</li>
            <li> When the formula changed on the shampoo I had been using for years, I struggled to find a replacement that didn&#x27;t dry out my hair, strip the color or leave a heavy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive reviews on Restore led me to try it.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurel sulfate (one of the few that doesn&#x27;t) and seems to be very gentle.  The conditioner adds a little body to my hair so it blows out with some lift and bounce that lasts for several days.  And NO residue.  So far, I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once caveat.  It is pricey.  I use a small dab in my palm so it will last for a while.  And given how damaging most shampoos are, having one this gentle that still makes my hair look great is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read about this stuff in More Magazine and had to try it.  My cosmetologist always comments on how good my hair now looks.  It had been ruined due to radiation treatments for cancer, but now looks healthy and normal again.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first. I also thought it was a little pricey but it&#x27;s well worth it! My hair got severely damaged from over processing and this shampoo and condition have made my hair actually feel like hair again and not straw! I&#x27;ll will by it again.</li>
            <li> It did take a little longer than suggested to ship. The bottles were a little scuffed up due to the way they were packaged. The product is awesome and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Took about three washes and I saw a significant difference in my hair&#x27;s texture, softness and sheen.  I use this daily, and also bought the Restore Mask Treatment, which I use once a week.  It&#x27;s been a month, my hair is much improved, and my color hasn&#x27;t faded nearly as much as with the other salon brand that I&#x27;d been using.  I also began using the Restore Instant Repair at the same time so maybe using the entire product line at once has been the key to this success.  I bought all of these Living Proof Restore products here on Amazon and they arrived quickly, within a day of one another so I was able to get started right away.  Plus, it was cheaper on Amazon rather than directly from the company.  The packaging was done with care so nothing leaked out.  Overall, thumbs up all around.  I have just ordered another set and may try another type of Living Proof after I finish this set.  I am a lifetime fan of this line and plan to be a loyal user.  It&#x27;s helped my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Please do not spend your hard earned money on this crap!  Your hair retains water making it twice as long to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair is a frizz ball from h--.  Leaves your hair frizzy, hard and dry!!!&lt;br /&gt;SELLER WILL NOT LET YOU RETURN ONCE THE BOTTLES ARE OPENED!!!</li>
            <li> Shampoo seems to over clean my hair, conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell. Only used twice. Will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> You do not get what you have paid for. I feel cheated. The title said Restore Shampoo and Restore Conditioner. But I got a No Frizz Shampoo. I don&#x27;t get it. If you are selling one thing, don&#x27;t advertise another.</li>
            <li> Really like these products.  Great Transaction!</li>
            <li> Would not buy again.  Leaves hair limp shortly after blow drying and, by the day after using these products, hair is greasy and stringy looking.  Tried several times, using minimal product but results were always awful.  Kevin Murphy Shampoo and Kerastase Bain leaves hair soft, with body and the fullness and shine lasts three days.</li>
