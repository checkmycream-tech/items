    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this after a week or two, but as for now, I&#x27;m really happy to have found something that hasn&#x27;t yet caused an immediate allergy rash!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this deodorant, unless you use it on your nether regions (which I do now and it, for some reason, works great for me there).</li>
            <li>Good Amazon price with subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>The Tom&#x27;s deodorant is fairly good</li>
            <li>I chose the unscented kind since I prefer the deodorant smell not mix with my perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is perfect even for super hot days in Phoenix.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I absolutely loved this deodorant when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and has no odor unlike most deodorants.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying it again, though, since I can&#x27;t tolerate many scents.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>so I tried apply it more to have some result (3times)</li>
            <li>Perfect just what I was looking for, and very reasonable price for something being natural</li>
            <li>If you are a person who dies not like strong perfumes then this is the product for you</li>
            <li>The men in my life have sensitive skin, and have been using this product successfully for years.</li>
            <li>The banner on this package was a light PURPLE color.</li>
            <li>so of course shipping was prompt and headache free.</li>
            <li>I was happy to use Tom&#x27;s Deodorant knowing it was aluminum free,however, after using it a few times I will no longer use it because it made my arm pits break out in huge rashes.</li>
            <li>I showered one day and went without the deodorant making quick smell checks throughout the day and at night - nothing, no odor.  </li>
            <li>Works very consistently, even on my fat, sweaty self.  </li>
            <li>I love the non-abrasive smell of this natural deodorant and it can&#x27;t be beat at this price!  </li>
            <li>A quality, safe and natural product.</li>
            <li>I have only found one that works effectively</li>
            <li>Nice to have a non-aluminum &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brand that actually helps control odor!</li>
            <li>I love all natural products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over two years and it has not failed me.  </li>
            <li>However,  it does the job of eliminating underarm odor very well and lasted all day&lt;br /&gt;and night.</li>
            <li>After getting the impression that it wasn&#x27;t doing much, I tried an experiment:  </li>
            <li>The formulation my local Trader Joes carries does NOT contain the zinc ingredient, and its label reads &amp;#34;Natural 24 hour odor protection ORIGINAL CARE deodorant Unscented.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious if other reviewers have experienced the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have never found a deodorant I wasn&#x27;t allergic</li>
            <li>On my armpits, it not only made my skin peel, but turned the underlying skin a very unsightly orange mottled color after about a week.  </li>
            <li>There are two different formulations of this product currently available on the shelf at stores, and after reading such mixed reaction reviews of this deodorant on Amazon I thought perhaps I should buy this product at a brick and motar store to see if the listed ingredients on those packages differed (which what I was suspecting).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: I will continue to use it till I find a stronger natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m not a heavy sweatier....</li>
            <li>However, I do wear deodorant during the summer and intense physical activities just in case.  </li>
            <li>I try to use natural deodorants</li>
            <li>As a side note, I have a particularly sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>For several days I used the deodorant under my left armpit and not under my right.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has a strong spicy scent, which gives me a slight headache.</li>
            <li>I went to Target and found this deodorant with the zinc ingredient; at Target the package was labeled &amp;#34;Natural 24 hour odor protection LONG LASTING deodorant Unscented.&amp;#34; The banner on this product was a light BLUE color.</li>
            <li>Then, I went to Trader Joe&#x27;s and found the same exact product, (when I scanned it&#x27;s barcode into my Amazon search, it brought me to the same exact product page) except I noticed some slight differences on the item&#x27;s labeling compared to the stick I had picked up at Target.</li>
            <li>such a Lush or Soapwalla or Lavanilla.  </li>
            <li>Even though it says &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; there is a very faint and pleasant scent.</li>

            <li> Too bad, but it should not say unscented.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write a review because this product was spectacularly bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff works and has no odor unlike most deodorants. If you are a person who dies not like strong perfumes then this is the product for you</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the strangest deodorant I have used to date.  Why is this: 1) It has an unpleasant odor and is NOT unscented.  2) It seems to cause varying reactions to just about everyone&#x27;s skin I see posting consisting of blistering to just plain skin peeling similar to post-sunburn. 3) On my armpits, it not only made my skin peel, but turned the underlying skin a very unsightly orange mottled color after about a week.  Waste of money and into the garbage it went.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as the crystal deodorants don&#x27;t work and I needed an unscented one. It definitely has a strong spicy scent, which gives me a slight headache. However,  it does the job of eliminating underarm odor very well and lasted all day&lt;br /&gt;and night. I won&#x27;t be buying it again, though, since I can&#x27;t tolerate many scents.  Too bad, but it should not say unscented.</li>
            <li> I was happy to use Tom&#x27;s Deodorant knowing it was aluminum free,however, after using it a few times I will no longer use it because it made my arm pits break out in huge rashes. Unfortunately it has taken a long time for my rashes to heal.I would not recommend this product because of my experience.</li>
            <li> Liberal application prevents the stinkies without drawing the disdain of those who have to smell you.  A quality, safe and natural product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is perfect even for super hot days in Phoenix.  Zero scent and no aluminum.  Works very consistently, even on my fat, sweaty self.  I have been using this for over two years and it has not failed me.  Good Amazon price with subscribe and save.  $3.33 per stick versus $4 plus at any store in Phoenix.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get away from aluminum and it is a struggle to find something that actually works. I have only found one that works effectively and, unfortunately, this is not it. However, I think I know the reason. When I put this on alone,  was stinky by the end of the day BUT if you put this on with a little bit of scent (like a body spray over it), then  I can make it through the entire day (including a gym workout) with no problem. Basically, I recommend NOT getting the unscented.</li>
            <li> There are two different formulations of this product currently available on the shelf at stores, and after reading such mixed reaction reviews of this deodorant on Amazon I thought perhaps I should buy this product at a brick and motar store to see if the listed ingredients on those packages differed (which what I was suspecting). I have very sensitive skin and have never found a deodorant I wasn&#x27;t allergic to- my reactions usually end up in large red rashes that last for weeks after one application.   I went to Target and found this deodorant with the zinc ingredient; at Target the package was labeled &amp;#34;Natural 24 hour odor protection LONG LASTING deodorant Unscented.&amp;#34; The banner on this product was a light BLUE color. Then, I went to Trader Joe&#x27;s and found the same exact product, (when I scanned it&#x27;s barcode into my Amazon search, it brought me to the same exact product page) except I noticed some slight differences on the item&#x27;s labeling compared to the stick I had picked up at Target. The formulation my local Trader Joes carries does NOT contain the zinc ingredient, and its label reads &amp;#34;Natural 24 hour odor protection ORIGINAL CARE deodorant Unscented.&amp;#34;  The banner on this package was a light PURPLE color. The one and only ingredient difference between the two is the Zinc Ricinoleate. I will post pictures of the two different sticks to help people identify what they should be looking for!  Anyway, I did a small skin test on my wrists with both deodorant formulations and noticed as soon as I put the formula containing the zinc on myself, my arm started burning immediately. The one that didn&#x27;t contain the zinc did not seem to be irritated at all, so I will be trying that one with my armpits.  I&#x27;ll update this after a week or two, but as for now, I&#x27;m really happy to have found something that hasn&#x27;t yet caused an immediate allergy rash!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. Nice to have a non-aluminum &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brand that actually helps control odor! Even though it says &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; there is a very faint and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This deodorant seems to do nothing.  After getting the impression that it wasn&#x27;t doing much, I tried an experiment:  For several days I used the deodorant under my left armpit and not under my right.  At the end of each day, I sniffed both armpits.  I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  Time to try something different.</li>
            <li> This product does not keep you from sweating, but it does keep you from smelling AND you&#x27;ll never have yellow sweat stains ruin another shirt!  The aluminum in other brands that mixes with sweat to make that permanent yellow stain is what ruins shirts.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Tom&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love the non-abrasive smell of this natural deodorant and it can&#x27;t be beat at this price!  I&#x27;ve paid over $8 per bar in drug stores in the past.</li>
            <li> The men in my life have sensitive skin, and have been using this product successfully for years. No rashes and no body odor. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Pros: Made in the USA. Smells good. No aluminum. No triclosan (which makes my pits red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: In order to make this work, I have to take a daily shower and put it on two to three times throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I will continue to use it till I find a stronger natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> The Tom&#x27;s deodorant is fairly good I must say that I think that it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as some other brands I have used.  It does however get you through a work day w/o offensive odor.  Ordered it from amazon so of course shipping was prompt and headache free.</li>
            <li> I love all natural products. I try to eat organic when I can, grass fed beef, coconut oil, dead sea soap, all about that life. This deodorant though made me smell awful. Another user took the words out of my mouth when they said it makes them smell WORSE then if they wore no deodorant at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect just what I was looking for, and very reasonable price for something being natural</li>
            <li> do not recommend .. I got sweat despite  using it &amp; I&#x27;m not a heavy sweatier.... so I tried apply it more to have some result (3times) daily but I keep on having sweats .... it&#x27;s substance is hard with no effecting ingriedents in it.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write a review because this product was spectacularly bad and I wanted to warn off other buyers.  I&#x27;m a 30-something year old East Asian woman with minimal body odor.  I don&#x27;t usually wear deordorant as I normally do not have body odor.  However, I do wear deodorant during the summer and intense physical activities just in case.  I try to use natural deodorants such a Lush or Soapwalla or Lavanilla.  Recently, I was visiting family in Los Angeles and forgot to bring deodorant so I picked this up at the local drugstore.  I chose the unscented kind since I prefer the deodorant smell not mix with my perfume smell.  I noticed a slight cheese-like/vomit scent the first day but attributed it to other people.  When I got home, I continued to smell the vomit odor and slowly realized with horror that the smell came from my armpits.  I experimented with the deodorant.  I showered one day and went without the deodorant making quick smell checks throughout the day and at night - nothing, no odor.  I showered the next day and applied Tom&#x27;s Unscented and the smell was there after a minute.  It was horrific - I&#x27;ve never smelled anything so awful.  As a side note, I have a particularly sensitive nose.  This unholy smell may be due to my personal scent mixing with the deodorant but if the deodorant was truly unscented, this would not be the case.  I&#x27;m curious if other reviewers have experienced the same thing.  I would not recommend this product as it created body odor smells where there were none.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I absolutely loved this deodorant when I first bought it. I had one stick, used it about twice, and ordered a pack of 12. (I was deployed to the desert so I needed to stock up). After about a month and a half of using it, I noticed this awful smell and it would drive me nuts, mainly at the gym or when working. It took me about a week to realize that it was my armpits! It was my fourth deployment so my body was not new to desert life or anything. The only reason I believe it was the deodorant is I stopped using it, it went away, and I tried again. Same thing happened but after only about a week. I switched to Anthony Logistics for Men and haven&#x27;t had a problem since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this deodorant, unless you use it on your nether regions (which I do now and it, for some reason, works great for me there).</li>
