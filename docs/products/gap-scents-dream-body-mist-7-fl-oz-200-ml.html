            <li>great summer spray- non offensive- light and clean</li>
            <li>I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to go to the mall just to go to the gap</li>
            <li>cause all I ever get there is Dream body mist  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many complements from those who aren&#x27;t fond of colone</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it for her for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li>but this isn&#x27;t as potent as the perfume</li>
            <li>but the price is appropriate for what I got.  </li>
            <li>I love that after all these years I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent since they started making it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Shipping went smoothly and arrived in one piece!</li>
            <li>Bottle is big for the price and the scent itself is very good.</li>
            <li>The gap dream body spray is no longer available in gap stores, it&#x27;s my favorite scent</li>
            <li>doesnt smell original but is pretty good</li>
            <li>Such a good buy!</li>
            <li>Great scent ~ very floral, light, and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this before, I like the light sent, it doesn&#x27;t over whelm.</li>
            <li>I used to wear it during the day but the smell was so light and relaxing/soothing</li>
            <li>but I enjoy taking a shower before bed and spritzing on a bit of this perfume.</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a scent (in a good way), but doesn&#x27;t stay with you for too long.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>it seemed to go &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; quickly.</li>
            <li>Your significant other will most likely enjoy and comment once they get a wiff of this light scent.</li>
            <li>no doubt it&#x27;s the real deal!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>wasnt really satisfied because the bottle was not actually sealed.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on the scent that I bought an extra for work!</li>
            <li>I could never find this in a store or at a decent price!</li>
            <li>but I guess if you want it now you have to pay high dollar!</li>
            <li>Scent was just as I remembered from High School.</li>
            <li>Packaged professionally!  </li>
            <li>shipper sent me the wrong item at first but responded very quickly and resolved the problem in a very timely matter.</li>

            <li> Item as described....no doubt it&#x27;s the real deal!  Fast shipping!  Packaged professionally!  Thank you.  I will buy from you again!</li>
            <li> loved this sent will buy again.</li>
            <li> So happy to find it after all these years, my fiance loves when I wear this scent and so I needed more! It&#x27;s a larger bottle than the one I got in the store way back when... Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the Gap Scents Dream Body Mist as GAP has discontinued it.  My daughter-in-law loves it and I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it for her for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li> and for something lighter than the perfume i luv this one....i will keep on buying these as long as amazon sells it....gap store discontinued this item ....</li>
            <li> Love dream!  Great price but this isn&#x27;t as potent as the perfume but the price is appropriate for what I got.  Happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called Mist but it&#x27;s scent stays for long. Bottle is big for the price and the scent itself is very good. Plastic bottle allows to put in the bag without worrying.</li>
            <li> My sister bought me a small bottle of this perfume yeeeeeaaaaarrrsss ago, I&#x27;m talking 2001 or earlier, along with Heaven (another Gap body mist). I used to wear it during the day but the smell was so light and relaxing/soothing I started only using it as a bed time perfume. Yeah yeah, you may think it&#x27;s weird but I enjoy taking a shower before bed and spritzing on a bit of this perfume. Your significant other will most likely enjoy and comment once they get a wiff of this light scent. I love that after all these years I was able to find it on Amazon. This big bottle should last me a while!</li>
            <li> The gap dream body spray is no longer available in gap stores, it&#x27;s my favorite scent and I get compliments everytims I wear it.  I was so happy to find a vendor selling this product, so I stocked up!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite!!! I wish they would bring it back and it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find!!! I thought 22.00 was expensive because of shipping but I guess if you want it now you have to pay high dollar!</li>

            <li> I am so glad I found this!  It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li> this one we can no longer find at the store now we can find it and it is the same one as the one we got in the store</li>
            <li> i bought this item a while ago. shipper sent me the wrong item at first but responded very quickly and resolved the problem in a very timely matter. recomend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad to see this is retired. Great scent ~ very floral, light, and fresh. Hopefully they bring it back at some point.</li>
            <li> Double the regular price. A case of supply and demand.</li>
            <li> After 15 years, still my favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Smell is unappealing and it arrived like it was a used product or refilled..letters missing for the label as well.</li>
