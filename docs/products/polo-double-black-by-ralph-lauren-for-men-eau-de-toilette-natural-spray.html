            <li>We both love it and it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>A great \\&quot;date\\&quot; cologne, but try Armani Code or another type that has more of an &#x27;oomph&#x27; if thats what you are looking for...  </li>
            <li>or Hot Water(Gag Water)\\&quot; this is actually very nice.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a great smell, excellent for musicians under the lights and drummers such as myself, really holds up !</li>
            <li>totally satisfied with my purchase, do it yourself too, greetings from Quito, Ecuador</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all colognes....</li>
            <li>Good stuff, worth the $.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Even after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent, lasts longer than most, and has all the ladies saying \\&quot;yummm what is that smell.\\</li>
            <li>I was happy because it was much cheaper as well.</li>
            <li>well so it arrived safely.</li>
            <li>JUST  LOVE  </li>
            <li>I love this.......</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>I am holding both bottles in front of me and have used all the Polo&#x27;s over many years..</li>
            <li>It has a scent more like Armani or D&amp;G(I</li>
            <li>Nothing more of a turn off than the suffocation of the \\&quot;Perfume Wall\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite for many years.</li>
            <li>I have never paid this much for smelling so good.  </li>
            <li>I love the sweet undertones.</li>
            <li>The top notes are strong, but the drydown is the part that makes me smile about this fragrance.</li>
            <li>The Double Fragrance is great.</li>
            <li>/receiving was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>you are familiar with and have smelled and then resort to amazon for a cheaper price compared to Macy&#x27;s, JC Penney&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT!  </li>
            <li>Just a light touch or spray it and walk through it to enhance not to overpower your own natural scent.</li>
            <li>It arrived Sooner than expected which was very nice.  </li>
            <li>I think I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>Been into colognes for over twenty years, this is a 15 dollar cologne...smells pleasant but no real magic...</li>
            <li>I bought it as a birthday gift to my uncle and he likes it very much.</li>
            <li>it makes it very intimate.</li>
            <li>A dryer more formal scent,sort of a very light powdery with different overtones not really the summery ultra clean scent of the Polos.</li>
            <li>I think this one is more versatile and laid back for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first i thought, \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, people do smell it.</li>
            <li>Good for winter or evenings, but a little much for summer days...</li>
            <li>The polo black is so much better than this!</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as I would like nor does it last all day IMO.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pay full price to get the right item next time.</li>
            <li>Cologne is the real deal.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very robust and manly.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>You would not want to spray too much since it seems to carry quite well.</li>
            <li>But after an hour, IMO, it transforms to a lingering scent that only those who you want to be close to you (i.e. that special someone)can smell.</li>
            <li>Holds many of the notes from Polo Black, but adds the deeper notes of oriental in the mix.</li>
            <li>My husband always uses Polo, and Black is his favorite.</li>
            <li>I guess....), but it isn&#x27;t like those bright Lauren ones like Polo Blue or just plain Polo.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the subtle clean fragrance of this obviously masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>But right now this honestly is the cologne I reach for, and it works in just about any circumstance, casual day, evening or formal events.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it so far!</li>
            <li>So this as I mentioned has a definitively masculine touch with a very clean subtle spicy odor that drew me to it the first time I tried it on.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, quite a classy and professional scent with decent longevity and projection.</li>
            <li>Polo Double Black is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>The dry, smoothness, and almost dessert like ending is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the Polo products, and decided to try the double black for a change.</li>
            <li>Ok, but sort of boring!Polo Double Black does not smell like a Polo or too me any Polo product.</li>
            <li>Ive worn double black for over a year now and it has such a mild clean scent.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here and definitly not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>However, it is long lasting, just in very close quarters.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that after awhile I&#x27;ll start using some of my other men&#x27;s fragrances in my small collection.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how define it other than smelling on the darker side(hence</li>
            <li>I used the same cologne for a couple years (Cool Water Deep) but as soon as I smelled Double Black</li>
            <li>There have been a few colognes that have been to ambiguous for my taste, that cost as much or more than the Polo Double Black.</li>
            <li>This particular polo black is not a spray model, it&#x27;s the old fashioned dap and tap style.  </li>
            <li>I think I like Double Black a little more, since it doesn&#x27;t quite have the same bite that Armani Code has.  </li>

            <li> Compared to Polo &#x27;green&#x27; cologne, the fragrance of Polo Double Black QUICKLY disappears.</li>
            <li> Received the Double Black just as the old spray container ran out.</li>
            <li> I do wish that it lasted as long as Polo Blue though.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Polo Blue exclusively but recently switched over to Double Black.</li>
            <li> Ordered Double Black, received package sealed-box marked Double Black, once opened...</li>
            <li> Polo Double Black is a well done cologne of the oriental spice variety - very similar to Armani Code.  </li>
            <li> Not like any of the other Polo colognes - it is the only one I use now.  </li>
            <li> But I do like the scent of Double Black.</li>
            <li> double black</li>
            <li> But, RL needs to do something that will make it last as long as Polo Green.</li>
            <li> Double Black has a complex rich scent and Polo Black smells like \\&quot;a Polo\\&quot;, sort of a blue, mixed with a little Polo green and maybe a little Sport.</li>
            <li> The Double Black was packed carefully and received with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Doug</li>
            <li> It does not have any quality of other polo products.</li>
            <li> If you buy any perfume go with other companies.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mean any particular one, it just has that dark heavier scent but really not overpowering but complex.)</li>
            <li> I, too, like the negative reviews on Double Black, agree that it is not a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> Just Black.</li>
            <li> I typically spray my neck with three sprays in the morning and by lunch time it can no longer be smelled.</li>
            <li> If you are bored with the Polo Scents try Double Black, I think you will like its richness and different notes.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and mature.</li>
            <li> I feel I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is not an everyday, all day frag.</li>
            <li> Polo Green lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Was mailed 3/4 way across the country and was rec&#x27;d in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> But you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Was less expensive than what I could find around here, and was delivered even faster than they said it would be.</li>
            <li> Scent is weak ....</li>
            <li> Both have a similar wood base note, but this has a softer mango scent to me.  </li>
            <li> Wrong scent.</li>
            <li> Expensive mistake.</li>
            <li> Stupidity I guess.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Amazon!</li>
            <li> disappointed in this product!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cologne is the real deal. Ive worn double black for over a year now and it has such a mild clean scent. I do wish that it lasted as long as Polo Blue though. I&#x27;m curious as to why people would order a cologne online that they have never smelled before and than leave poor reviews because they weren&#x27;t satisfied with the scent..? Stupidity I guess. Order a cologne you are familiar with and have smelled and then resort to amazon for a cheaper price compared to Macy&#x27;s, JC Penney&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this item. It does not have any quality of other polo products. If you buy any perfume go with other companies. Do not waste your money. I feel I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this dealer to buy the product excellent, flawless delivery&#x27;m totally satisfied with my purchase, do it yourself too, greetings from Quito, Ecuador</li>
            <li> Scent is weak .... They don&#x27;t make colognes that last all day anymore. But I do like the scent of Double Black.</li>
            <li> Polo Double Black is a well done cologne of the oriental spice variety - very similar to Armani Code.  I think I like Double Black a little more, since it doesn&#x27;t quite have the same bite that Armani Code has.  Both have a similar wood base note, but this has a softer mango scent to me.  I think this one is more versatile and laid back for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, quite a classy and professional scent with decent longevity and projection.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all colognes....It is very subtle and mature. I don&#x27;t really know how define it other than smelling on the darker side(hence double black I guess....), but it isn&#x27;t like those bright Lauren ones like Polo Blue or just plain Polo. It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm but it def. noticeable; One many occasions I have had people ask what that smell was...wait, that came out wrong. But you know what I mean. I hear it has a hint of espresso to it, I would say that configures into the scent. Good stuff, worth the $.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Polo Blue exclusively but recently switched over to Double Black. I think I made the right choice. I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it so far! Amazon had an excellent price, beat all of its&#x27; competitors by a mile. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Amazon! What don&#x27;t they have???</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband.  Love the smell.  Great price too. I would have had to drive an hour away to purchase locally.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered 3 samples of this frag. At first i thought, \\&quot;Oh no! Another rendition of buglari black(Gag Reflex!) or Hot Water(Gag Water)\\&quot; this is actually very nice. Holds many of the notes from Polo Black, but adds the deeper notes of oriental in the mix. The top notes are strong, but the drydown is the part that makes me smile about this fragrance. The dry, smoothness, and almost dessert like ending is worth the buy. This is not an everyday, all day frag. Definitely for fall/ winter and for evenings only in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Because this smells so good. And it&#x27;s &amp;#34;double&amp;#34; which is twice as good as &amp;#34;single&amp;#34;. It is &amp;#34;double plus good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I used the same cologne for a couple years (Cool Water Deep) but as soon as I smelled Double Black I knew what my next puchase would be.</li>
            <li> Ordered Double Black, received package sealed-box marked Double Black, once opened... Just Black. Wrong scent. Cologne was a gift and package was thrown away, so I can&#x27;t return it. Expensive mistake. I&#x27;ll pay full price to get the right item next time.</li>
            <li> Polo Double Black is my new favorite.  I bought it for my husband&#x27;s Christmas and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I feel this is what Prince William smells like all the time. Even after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent, lasts longer than most, and has all the ladies saying \\&quot;yummm what is that smell.\\&quot; It&#x27;s me ladies, it&#x27;s me and my Polo DOUBLE Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to the max.</li>
            <li> very good smell. I bought it as a birthday gift to my uncle and he likes it very much. I was happy because it was much cheaper as well.</li>
            <li> My husband always uses Polo, and Black is his favorite. Will definately purchase again. I can count on Amazon to give us a good price.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I instantly loved this scent. Good for winter or evenings, but a little much for summer days...hence the name, I guess.</li>
            <li> Smells great! My Girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the Polo products, and decided to try the double black for a change. I really enjoy the subtle clean fragrance of this obviously masculine fragrance. There have been a few colognes that have been to ambiguous for my taste, that cost as much or more than the Polo Double Black. I do not like the over powering fragrances, or those that are too flowery. So this as I mentioned has a definitively masculine touch with a very clean subtle spicy odor that drew me to it the first time I tried it on.    I&#x27;m sure that after awhile I&#x27;ll start using some of my other men&#x27;s fragrances in my small collection. But right now this honestly is the cologne I reach for, and it works in just about any circumstance, casual day, evening or formal events.     Plus my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Your friends wives will buy this for their husbands.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. We both love it and it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Was less expensive than what I could find around here, and was delivered even faster than they said it would be. Great deal and packed well so it arrived safely.</li>
            <li> MY  SON  JUST  LOVE  THE  SMELL</li>
            <li> Kinda regretted buying this. The polo black is so much better than this!</li>
            <li> muy buen producto, excelente vendedor, entrega rapida y efectiva, me llego en excelente condiciones, agradecido por tan buen servicio prestado</li>
            <li> Not like any of the other Polo colognes - it is the only one I use now.  Compliments all the time....</li>
            <li> It arrived Sooner than expected which was very nice.  This particular polo black is not a spray model, it&#x27;s the old fashioned dap and tap style.  The fragrance is very robust and manly.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> fast shipping. perfect. thanks</li>
            <li> Compared to Polo &#x27;green&#x27; cologne, the fragrance of Polo Double Black QUICKLY disappears. Polo Green lasts all day. Ralph Lauren needs to fix this. The Double Fragrance is great. But, RL needs to do something that will make it last as long as Polo Green. Until then, I&#x27;m going back to Polo Green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> This was a requested gift, so can&#x27;t speak for the scent - however the customer service in sending/receiving was fantastic.  Was mailed 3/4 way across the country and was rec&#x27;d in just a few days.  VERY pleased w/the service!</li>
            <li> I put this on and my wife said.........D**N I love this.......She keeps returning to get a sniff......I have never paid this much for smelling so good.  WELL WORTH IT!  WoW1, I am still amazed!</li>
            <li> I, too, like the negative reviews on Double Black, agree that it is not a very strong scent. However, it is long lasting, just in very close quarters. When you first put it on, people do smell it. But after an hour, IMO, it transforms to a lingering scent that only those who you want to be close to you (i.e. that special someone)can smell. it makes it very intimate. A great \\&quot;date\\&quot; cologne, but try Armani Code or another type that has more of an &#x27;oomph&#x27; if thats what you are looking for...  [[ASIN:B000CNP4FQ Armani Code By Giorgio Armani For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Received the Double Black just as the old spray container ran out. The Double Black was packed carefully and received with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Doug</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....I get lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a great smell, excellent for musicians under the lights and drummers such as myself, really holds up !</li>
            <li> This cologne smells delicious. I love the sweet undertones. It is not as strong as I would like nor does it last all day IMO. I typically spray my neck with three sprays in the morning and by lunch time it can no longer be smelled. I would definitely recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here and definitly not worth the money. Been into colognes for over twenty years, this is a 15 dollar cologne...smells pleasant but no real magic...</li>
            <li> I am holding both bottles in front of me and have used all the Polo&#x27;s over many years.. Double Black has a complex rich scent and Polo Black smells like \\&quot;a Polo\\&quot;, sort of a blue, mixed with a little Polo green and maybe a little Sport. Ok, but sort of boring!Polo Double Black does not smell like a Polo or too me any Polo product. It has a scent more like Armani or D&amp;G(I don&#x27;t mean any particular one, it just has that dark heavier scent but really not overpowering but complex.) A dryer more formal scent,sort of a very light powdery with different overtones not really the summery ultra clean scent of the Polos. You would not want to spray too much since it seems to carry quite well. Just a light touch or spray it and walk through it to enhance not to overpower your own natural scent. Nothing more of a turn off than the suffocation of the \\&quot;Perfume Wall\\&quot;.....If you are bored with the Polo Scents try Double Black, I think you will like its richness and different notes.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for many years. Great order, great supplier.</li>
