            <li>I bought the Tonymoly Appletox for use as a massage cream based on the good reviews here.</li>

            <li>The Product is good.</li>

            <li>It absolutely met my expectations and the apple shape of the container ir really beautiful!</li>
            <li>The texture if this product is like a creamy moisturizer with a wonderful apple scent that does not become cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I splashed some water on my face and then gently massaged into my skin for about a minute.  </li>
            <li>I own the tomatox massaging cream also by Tonymoly</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>the consistency is very nice, glide on smooth and as I massaged on my skin, it does the job exfoliating well</li>
            <li>Adorable, but not as effective as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>it was really nice to get  it early before the estimate date it works wonderful!</li>
            <li>Love love loved</li>
            <li>I love love it!</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and pleasant and my skin feels so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I used it once and my face felt so nice after it :)</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable, the cream smells amazing, and the application is easy!</li>
            <li>and it feels very light on the skin.  </li>
            <li>And the apple smell is really nice, it is not too strong and it relaxed me.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job and again, how cute is the packaging?!?  </li>
            <li>Until I can find something as cheap as this or works a bit better!</li>
            <li>This peeling cream is just ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i added this to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Love the container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more as a backup when I run out</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I loved it, and really worth it</li>
            <li>I love apples</li>
            <li>South Korean facial products are the best on the market for skin types and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Many state</li>
            <li>What I do love of this product is the lotion that it leaves on your skin after using.  </li>
            <li>cute packaging</li>
            <li>then this is when the magic starts to happen....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the skin sloughing that many people are saying they get.</li>
            <li>I learned about TONYMOLY products online, and the cute packaging caught my attention.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love love love</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>(you&#x27;re not supposed to use it more than 2~3 times a week)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a month for me, but I can see that my skin is brighter and more even.</li>
            <li>I think you would see even better results over time.</li>
            <li>i was expecting more of a gel than a cream i suppose.</li>
            <li>Cute container.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because the packaging is adorable, but it smells great and works very well.</li>
            <li>and it will start peeling more and more.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because the apple is cute and the fragrance is suttle.</li>
            <li>I love TonyMoly charcoal pack</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes, the container is cute but that&#x27;s not why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still glad I have it</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable, C)</li>
            <li>cute container of course.</li>
            <li>but i think tomatox works a bit better</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something to use more than a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>Great special little product ~ Will work perfect for a teacher (An apple a day...)</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this buy and will be getting more when I need a new one ^.^</li>
            <li>Also I think the smell is strong but very very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>First the good:  </li>
            <li>For $10.00, this is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your skin look bright and healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so clean and smooth, and it smells soo nice too :3</li>
            <li>A nice gentle exfoliation product, smells nice.</li>
            <li>Great  for sensitive skin and feels extremely refreshing afterwards.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and made my skin feel very soft, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I honestly would have loved this Peeling Cream because I had bought it before and the way your dead skin comes off is amazing!</li>
            <li>and i love the free samples</li>
            <li>This is amazing, gentle, clarifying, and it arrived quickly from the great kind TOKTOK, a seller I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;m not super impressed.  </li>
            <li>Its super adorable packaging and its my favorite thing in my bathroom, period.</li>
            <li>Received very quickly, maybe four days.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are all in Korean, but you can easily find instructions online.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and no dramas associated.</li>
            <li>It works as described and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very mild exfoliator,</li>
            <li>I think that using the word &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is a bit strong though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it, because I&#x27;ve used more effective peels, Like Detclear/</li>
            <li>To be honest, at first I just ordered this product because I thought the packaging was</li>
            <li>While it did have a pleasant, mild apple scent, it did absolutely NOTHING for peeling nor exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I have done it both ways and my skin was fine.</li>
            <li>Firstly I too like many others purchased this cream since it was cute</li>
            <li>:) :) ;)</li>
            <li>I would also like to add that the seller shipped the item quickly!  </li>
            <li>However, the container is super cute</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, has an adorable package, and works wonders, even on my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is literally the exact size of a normal apple lol.</li>
            <li>Great product overall!</li>
            <li>TONYMOLY Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream 80g</li>
            <li>It does make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already kinda light skinned</li>
            <li>Smells amazing but breaks out my skin so much each time -- I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, free of blemishes, and some scars are fading.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing and really does peel--</li>
            <li>and u will see the magic right away.</li>
            <li>cream smells nice and is easy to massage on, and it rinses off nicely - leaving a moisturized feeling as opposed to a dry feeling.</li>
            <li>This is a nice gentle exfoliater with a clean scent.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so smooth and clean</li>
            <li>it smells good and makes your skin super soft</li>
            <li>I love this cream so much!</li>
            <li>What a fun product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got the original product because it didn&#x27;t come in any Tony Moly Casing.</li>
            <li>Then you rub it off your skin and rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>Love it, the packaging is too cute &amp; it arrived 4 days early.</li>
            <li>Super smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>it would be good to have detailed instructions in english on PAPER.  </li>
            <li>love the texture and its er gentle on my skin which is important to me.</li>
            <li>is very soft texture does not produce any kind of exfoliation</li>
            <li>When I first started rubbing the cream in, I didn&#x27;t really have any expectations in mind; the cream was both instantly moisturizing and smelled delicious.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, and is very very lightly exfoliating, but no matter how much I rubbed I couldn&#x27;t get it to peel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do much besides have a clean apple smell and cute packaging.</li>
            <li>but somehow your skin seems &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to explain, may be it&#x27;s best to try it.</li>
            <li>have experienced absolutely NO skin irritation,</li>
            <li>It got here on time and it was soo cute ^-^ but aside from both of those things it also works really</li>
            <li>The second time I gifted it to my mom in law since she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it really works.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to purchase something at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is my very first Korean cosmetic that I&#x27;ve ever gotten; so, I was a bit nervous and excited to get.</li>
            <li>It smells good and performs as a basic cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does have a nice fragrance and leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would recommend not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>it does smell amazing and it does leave your skin super soft</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it made my skin SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>I have fair, combination skin, which can be sensitive to certain products, however, my skin loves this.  </li>
            <li>What I have is a smooth, hydrated, soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li>I am using it as a quick cleanser in the morning in the shower.</li>
            <li>Luckily I read on here how to use it.</li>
            <li>And a bonus, it shipped quickly (3 days).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating effect, there are other products that are more effective.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with finding a good exfoliation method for a long time.</li>
            <li>This thing makes wonders, its not abrasive its soft, smells really good, you can actually see the dead skin in your fingers and leaves the skin feeling just great!!</li>
            <li>I will say, it must be doing something because when I use it, I always have 3 or 4 brand new pimples needing to be popped that have magically sprung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li>It has a nice very light apple scent when using and when you rub off and then rinse your face, your skin will have a slightly creamy feeling.  </li>
            <li>For exfoliating I think it does work but not super greatly</li>
            <li>did not see much difference!!</li>
            <li>Great exfoilant that did not leave my face irritated and tight.</li>
            <li>The price are very good comparison to more expensive brand from USA.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, just like a fresh green apple.</li>
            <li>and we all got the same amazing results.</li>
            <li>There was no irritation or redness (I am sensitive to most chemicals</li>
            <li>It exfoliates okay and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Firstly, this smells so great, kinda like sour granny smith, this smell makes me wanna eat it..</li>
            <li>My skin looked soft and supple, and it felt as smooth as pudding!</li>
            <li>My face was noticeably soft and I was pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>, it will be fun to use the container again.</li>
            <li>bring up the tag information that says no different letters not have any kind of protection</li>
            <li>then I expected also has a really good smell but</li>
            <li>i couldnt be more satisfied with this product and all of the other tony moly items ^-^</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I am using it right.</li>
            <li>You have to do a little work to make sure it really gets out the unevenness and flaking, but you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a crisp apple scent and really nice skin.</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin and want a very mild exfoliator, you&#x27;d probably like this one.</li>
            <li>First off, the container is so cute, I love seeing what looks like a crisp green apple on my bathroom counter every morning, puts a smile on my face.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin sooo soft and bright, totally recommended</li>
            <li>however, the product really leaves your skin super supple and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If any cream got that much skin off your face that quickly and without much rubbing at all - it would be the holy grail of skincare!</li>
            <li>, the packaging is not safe and easily opened , I wonder what kind of wue nonsense was sent me ??</li>
            <li>Its very gentle and smells just like apple.</li>
            <li>This works well enough, and it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li>The cream looks paper white, the texture silky, and its very very light.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that I&#x27;m a grown woman who still loves cool packing, like the clever apple shape, this is a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first week and a lot of improvement happened.</li>
            <li>After your skin will feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You start by rubbing about a teaspoon&#x27;s worth onto your face and neck and keep gently rubbing in circles until it starts to clump up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a chemical exfoliant though, so make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>After testing it out, I love it but maybe for different reasons than others.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This is not my face!!&amp;#34; First words out of my mouth after using this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>you only need a small amount to use and get awesome results .</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>They made your face clear and smooth for 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>I could instantly tell my face was in much better condition.</li>
            <li>But overall: I love this product and doesn&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li>Be patient and consistent.</li>
            <li>The apple has been open and I know this because the sticker was stuck to the top part of the apple.</li>
            <li>I love it overall.</li>
            <li>because I first thought I didn&#x27;t use it correctly.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like green apple at all.  </li>
            <li>Haha, I will definitely stick to this product I love it so much, I&#x27;m going to buy all of the Tonymoly fruit skincare products, I adore all of them!</li>
            <li>But again, it does ultimately (after about 20 minutes of leaving it on your face) start to exfoliate, and for only $10.00 for the amount you get, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>I loved the packaging, so I ordered it based off that (bad decision, I know, but it ended on a good note!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the green apple scent and how smooth it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>This stuff fixed it right away and didn&#x27;t hurt me at all!</li>
            <li>Keep massaging until all of it is pretty much gone from your face.</li>
            <li>and although it isn&#x27;t really for pedicures it works REALLY well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not too abrasive -at least for me-, and really nice to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the shipping !</li>
            <li>If you are extremely dry, maybe you might be able to use it to exfoliate but thankfully I&#x27;m not in that position</li>
            <li>So, I would have given this peel 5 stars, but I am generally not the type of person to get that excited about things and being the incredibly realistic person that I am, I am sure there are better products out there that are more expensive.</li>
            <li>The description sounded &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34;, however, the actual item is like cream with some fine granules.</li>
            <li>and this has had only positive results which for me is usually very rare.</li>
            <li>I really like the peeling effect and would recommend to anyone who wants to try out korean skin care.</li>
            <li>I know some said that it isn&#x27;t really peeling away skin</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I knew this really</li>
            <li>It does peel some skin away but not too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks....</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t really smell that &amp;#34;apple-y&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference i been using it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I dont see much peeling with this product.  </li>
            <li>it took me a while to figure out how to make it peel, haha, the smell</li>
            <li>This is a really neat product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>It really is the size of an apple.  </li>
            <li>so I appreciate that this seems to be gentle.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It really works the way it says it does.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s about twice as much as this cream.</li>
            <li>Emphasis on gently.  </li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t massage it into my skin for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And when this adorable apple jar is empty, I will immediately buy another.</li>
            <li>However, when I got it and used it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much going for it at all - nothing beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They both works really well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>but it was to much of a hassle to exchange it</li>
            <li>It really does peel off layers of skin.</li>
            <li>It also feels very</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to take just 15 minutes out of the week to pamper him or herself or is looking for a gentle peel with visible results.</li>
            <li>I bought the Appletow and Tomatox.&lt;br /&gt;Using both really helps skin to be brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its very oily.</li>
            <li>It also really does smell just like an apple.</li>
            <li>but frankly it doesn&#x27;t do much to my face.</li>
            <li>That shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, as you really don&#x27;t need to use that much product.</li>
            <li>very liquid m has no peeling effect is not as they say YouTube tutorials .</li>
            <li>but there are a lot of other products out there that work better.</li>
            <li>It is not an anti-aging cream - but it does help my other products absorb better -</li>
            <li>first time I used it, I cleansed my face, massaged this into my skin for about a minute, let it sit for two minutes, massaged a little more, then rinsed off.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very cute, it was a bit smaller than I had expected</li>
            <li>I would definitely not recommend this product for those who have a sensitive complexion and tend to break out easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something for my face to clear it and exfoliate and this appletox really does the job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more gentle compare to scrub exfoliants.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combo skin, and this stuff exfoliates my dry patches wonderfully without the roughness of big abrasive particles or the sting of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>the peeling is also not as expected.can find better for much less.</li>
            <li>They nerved disappoint - and the kids can be persuaded to use this cream, they love the packaging and it really does smell just like green apples</li>
            <li>made soft, fresh, clear, and whitens.</li>
            <li>I definitely going to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>There is a decent amount of product, however.</li>
            <li>an older woman, all my skin products and cosmetics have got to work overtime on improving my skin in some way.</li>
            <li>I usually this Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream twice a week alternating with the Red Tomatotox Magic Massage Cream.  </li>
            <li>It was supposed to arrive anywhere from Nov 5th -29th, but I just received it today, October 29, a whole month early!</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable; I had imagined that it would be somehow smaller, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that its very close to the actual size of an apple!</li>
            <li>gives you a really soft and clean face... definitely gonna buy it again!</li>
            <li>your skin is left feeling  clean and so soft.</li>
            <li>it really smells like apple and leaves my face really soft</li>
            <li>but I was glad to see that it wasn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li>It does smell like fresh cut green apples and the cream leave my skin smooth and soft than it ever has been in all my life.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to apply and you wont have to put any extra efforts like other masks,</li>
            <li>The price is right and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything other than a cheap cream.</li>
            <li>One  thing that sets it apart from other masks is that it easily rinsed off and didn&#x27;t create a huge mess.</li>
            <li>The History of Whoo/Noevir&lt;br /&gt;Instead of giving an immediate result of dead skin, this product seemed to only be effective when left on for 5-10 minutes with a massage following the waiting, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like the good typical peeling products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>you will see beads of old dry skin starting to roll up and fall off ur face but keep rubbing till you have covered all ur face removing all the old skin off ur face then when you don&#x27;t see any new &amp;#34; skin rolls&amp;#34; for lack of better words</li>
            <li>OK, I literally had to delete my previous comment because I could hardly type with how excited I was with this stuff!</li>
            <li>i barely noticed any clumps appearing, it did moisturize my skin but not that much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a harsh product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and smells like apples!</li>
            <li>At first this seems like a regular, a bit oily, lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better results from other facial creams.</li>
            <li>After about three minutes of vigorous scrubbing, the product had eventually started to be absorbed into my skin, and was beginning to dry.</li>
            <li>It has a strong green apple scent that may bother some folks.</li>
            <li>Everywhere that I used this dried smooth and soft while the untreated areas did their normal thing.</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable, but know that the product is only on the bottom half of the apple, so don&#x27;t be mislead by the size.</li>
            <li>, you know like a sunburn or something, However, on my skin at least, this was just a very light exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Was soo excited to get this and what a let down.</li>
            <li>I have used similar type of peeling gel products in the past which were in fact very effective (but ~2x more expensive).</li>
            <li>Unless I&#x27;m misreading, it clearly says 2014.03.24.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really feel a notice a difference on my actual skin though.</li>
            <li>I was going to know off a star, because I felt like it should be four/five stars, but there is really nothing objective to knock off a star for.</li>
            <li>My face has never been this soft, like since birth.</li>
            <li>Okay... late 40s</li>
            <li>but it made my skin soft and supple after using it.</li>
            <li>Not enough real results.</li>
            <li>I would use this once a  week maybe twice a week tops because peeling creams tend to kill the skins natural UV protection.</li>
            <li>I had a lot on my face and has been completely gone with just two weeks of using this product, two times a week.  </li>
            <li>like this so far.</li>
            <li>and once I washed my hands they were so soft.</li>
            <li>It does remove the dead skin, makes facial skin much more softer and radiant.</li>
            <li>I agree that most of the pilling you see when you rub it on your face is the cream itself balling up rather than tons of dead skin sloughing off, but I still think this is a solid exfoliator.</li>
            <li>There are quite a few bloggers who have tested this product on a glove on then on their bare hand and found that they see more pilling on bare skin, which leads me to believe it does what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I actually never saw a product perform so well and leave my skin really soft in the first use, and I have been using peeling creams for a while now, but never with the instant results of this one.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was interested in the Japanese exfoliating thingy called like Cure or Kure, but that one is like double, almost triple the price so I got this.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re most likely not, Korean products tend to put the manufactured date on their items, I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li>You basically put it on your clean, dry face and let it dry.  </li>
            <li>It was hard to tell that the product was actually peeling my skin, it looked more like the product residue.</li>
            <li>leave it on for a few minutes, use my Clarisonic to give a quick boost and rinse.  </li>
            <li>follow up routine is one of those facial masks by Hey!Pingko, The Face Shop, or one of the other brands to calm down my skin and get some soothing solution into my clean, open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your skin 1st off looks lighter having just had removing all the old dull skin reviling ur new healthy skin that was hidden under the old stuff.</li>
            <li>I noticed a major difference after using it on my face, underarms, hands and feet.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see much exfoliation going on, but as it dried I began to see those tiny clumps.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have used other peeling products (usually gels) that worked far better, but they were also four times the expense.  </li>
            <li>I applied the cream to both sides (and i only had to use whatever was clinging to the little plastic lid inside for full coverage) and followed the instructions.</li>
            <li>It gets all the dead skin off and is very gentle on my skin which can be sensitive at times.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t like tradition defoliators.</li>
            <li>I used it on my hand and indeed my hand is deeply exfoliated, it&#x27;s sort of sensitive now.</li>
            <li>This came sooo much faster than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>I shall buy this again in the near future.</li>
            <li>This is gross, but after bleaching, dying, then rebleaching my eyebrows all in one day a few days ago, the skin under my eyebrows and surrounding it was very dry/flaky, no matter how much I exfoliated.</li>
            <li>The scent is a fresh smell of green apples.</li>
            <li>But the top wasn&#x27;t firmly sealed so a bit leaked out and was a mess.  </li>
            <li>First off you put this on dry skin and rub in the cream and keep working it in after it is dry</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t really smell like green apples and it does leave my skin soft</li>
            <li>The Secret Key Lemon D-toc is better by leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li>I rubbed it in for a few minutes and then just let it set for a few more minutes before I started rubbing again.</li>
            <li>It is removing gunk from your skin, so you might break out a little at first.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, only half my face produced the sticky little beads ofdead skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any black pearls that certain reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>Basically you rub off the dry product, not dead skin.  </li>
            <li>After a few hours, the softness went away, and my skin looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I used this on my face and it was a little intense, but definitely worked.</li>
            <li>It really helped with peeling away that sensitive skin under my arms that I had a hard time exfoliating without hurting myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna give it a good or bad rating.</li>

            <li> This is a good skin exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like apples to me at all like everyone else is claiming, but it is good at what it says.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much so it is a good value.  </li>
            <li> did not come in a product box and did not have the leaf as shown in picuture just the amazon box and bubble wrap, but over all it is a good product.</li>

            <li> Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tonymoly Appletox for use as a massage cream based on the good reviews here.</li>
            <li> The Appletox seemed to have some good ingredients in it to help exfoliate while you massage, like fruit acids and papaya enzymes.</li>
            <li> The Product is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was reading good stuff about it and also because of the packaging.</li>
            <li> but it wasnt their fault so its all good.</li>
            <li> the cream is good</li>
            <li> loved how it smelled and made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> love the texture, also smells really good!</li>
            <li> The container is very cute, just like in the picture, and it has a good amount of product.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product, and I know I will be ordering more and more when it runs out (which I doubt will be for a while!)!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I love how it pulls the dirt from your face so its great for cleansing its a good size too</li>
            <li> The casing is cute and smells great</li>

            <li> and this was amazing on it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooooo amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an amazing combination.</li>
            <li> It absolutely met my expectations and the apple shape of the container ir really beautiful!</li>
            <li> The texture if this product is like a creamy moisturizer with a wonderful apple scent that does not become cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I splashed some water on my face and then gently massaged into my skin for about a minute.  </li>
            <li> I own the tomatox massaging cream also by Tonymoly</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> the consistency is very nice, glide on smooth and as I massaged on my skin, it does the job exfoliating well</li>
            <li> Adorable, but not as effective as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> it was really nice to get  it early before the estimate date it works wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love love loved</li>
            <li> I love love it!</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and pleasant and my skin feels so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I used it once and my face felt so nice after it :)</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable, the cream smells amazing, and the application is easy!</li>
            <li> and it feels very light on the skin.  </li>
            <li> And the apple smell is really nice, it is not too strong and it relaxed me.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job and again, how cute is the packaging?!?  </li>
            <li> Until I can find something as cheap as this or works a bit better!</li>
            <li> This peeling cream is just ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i added this to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Love the container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered more as a backup when I run out</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I loved it, and really worth it</li>
            <li> I love apples</li>
            <li> South Korean facial products are the best on the market for skin types and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Many state</li>
            <li> What I do love of this product is the lotion that it leaves on your skin after using.  </li>
            <li> cute packaging</li>
            <li> then this is when the magic starts to happen....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the skin sloughing that many people are saying they get.</li>
            <li> I learned about TONYMOLY products online, and the cute packaging caught my attention.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love love love</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;re not supposed to use it more than 2~3 times a week)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month for me, but I can see that my skin is brighter and more even.</li>
            <li> I think you would see even better results over time.</li>
            <li> i was expecting more of a gel than a cream i suppose.</li>
            <li> Cute container.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the packaging is adorable, but it smells great and works very well.</li>
            <li> and it will start peeling more and more.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because the apple is cute and the fragrance is suttle.</li>
            <li> I love TonyMoly charcoal pack</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, the container is cute but that&#x27;s not why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still glad I have it</li>
            <li> the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable, C)</li>
            <li> cute container of course.</li>
            <li> but i think tomatox works a bit better</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something to use more than a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> Great special little product ~ Will work perfect for a teacher (An apple a day...)</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this buy and will be getting more when I need a new one ^.^</li>
            <li> Also I think the smell is strong but very very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> First the good:  </li>
            <li> For $10.00, this is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It really makes your skin look bright and healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so clean and smooth, and it smells soo nice too :3</li>
            <li> A nice gentle exfoliation product, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great  for sensitive skin and feels extremely refreshing afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and made my skin feel very soft, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I honestly would have loved this Peeling Cream because I had bought it before and the way your dead skin comes off is amazing!</li>
            <li> and i love the free samples</li>
            <li> This is amazing, gentle, clarifying, and it arrived quickly from the great kind TOKTOK, a seller I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;m not super impressed.  </li>
            <li> Its super adorable packaging and its my favorite thing in my bathroom, period.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly, maybe four days.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are all in Korean, but you can easily find instructions online.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and no dramas associated.</li>
            <li> It works as described and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very mild exfoliator,</li>
            <li> I think that using the word &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is a bit strong though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it, because I&#x27;ve used more effective peels, Like Detclear/</li>
            <li> To be honest, at first I just ordered this product because I thought the packaging was</li>
            <li> While it did have a pleasant, mild apple scent, it did absolutely NOTHING for peeling nor exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I have done it both ways and my skin was fine.</li>
            <li> Firstly I too like many others purchased this cream since it was cute</li>
            <li> :) :) ;)</li>
            <li> I would also like to add that the seller shipped the item quickly!  </li>
            <li> However, the container is super cute</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, has an adorable package, and works wonders, even on my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is literally the exact size of a normal apple lol.</li>
            <li> Great product overall!</li>
            <li> TONYMOLY Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream 80g</li>
            <li> It does make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already kinda light skinned</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but breaks out my skin so much each time -- I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, free of blemishes, and some scars are fading.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and really does peel--</li>
            <li> and u will see the magic right away.</li>
            <li> cream smells nice and is easy to massage on, and it rinses off nicely - leaving a moisturized feeling as opposed to a dry feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gentle exfoliater with a clean scent.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so smooth and clean</li>
            <li> it smells good and makes your skin super soft</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much!</li>
            <li> What a fun product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got the original product because it didn&#x27;t come in any Tony Moly Casing.</li>
            <li> Then you rub it off your skin and rinse clean.  </li>
            <li> Love it, the packaging is too cute &amp; it arrived 4 days early.</li>
            <li> Super smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> it would be good to have detailed instructions in english on PAPER.  </li>
            <li> love the texture and its er gentle on my skin which is important to me.</li>
            <li> is very soft texture does not produce any kind of exfoliation</li>
            <li> When I first started rubbing the cream in, I didn&#x27;t really have any expectations in mind; the cream was both instantly moisturizing and smelled delicious.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, and is very very lightly exfoliating, but no matter how much I rubbed I couldn&#x27;t get it to peel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much besides have a clean apple smell and cute packaging.</li>
            <li> but somehow your skin seems &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to explain, may be it&#x27;s best to try it.</li>
            <li> have experienced absolutely NO skin irritation,</li>
            <li> It got here on time and it was soo cute ^-^ but aside from both of those things it also works really</li>
            <li> The second time I gifted it to my mom in law since she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really works.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to purchase something at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is my very first Korean cosmetic that I&#x27;ve ever gotten; so, I was a bit nervous and excited to get.</li>
            <li> It smells good and performs as a basic cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it does have a nice fragrance and leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I would recommend not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and leaves your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> it does smell amazing and it does leave your skin super soft</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it made my skin SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> I have fair, combination skin, which can be sensitive to certain products, however, my skin loves this.  </li>
            <li> What I have is a smooth, hydrated, soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li> I am using it as a quick cleanser in the morning in the shower.</li>
            <li> Luckily I read on here how to use it.</li>
            <li> And a bonus, it shipped quickly (3 days).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating effect, there are other products that are more effective.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with finding a good exfoliation method for a long time.</li>
            <li> This thing makes wonders, its not abrasive its soft, smells really good, you can actually see the dead skin in your fingers and leaves the skin feeling just great!!</li>
            <li> I will say, it must be doing something because when I use it, I always have 3 or 4 brand new pimples needing to be popped that have magically sprung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li> It has a nice very light apple scent when using and when you rub off and then rinse your face, your skin will have a slightly creamy feeling.  </li>
            <li> For exfoliating I think it does work but not super greatly</li>
            <li> did not see much difference!!</li>
            <li> Great exfoilant that did not leave my face irritated and tight.</li>
            <li> The price are very good comparison to more expensive brand from USA.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, just like a fresh green apple.</li>
            <li> and we all got the same amazing results.</li>
            <li> There was no irritation or redness (I am sensitive to most chemicals</li>
            <li> It exfoliates okay and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this smells so great, kinda like sour granny smith, this smell makes me wanna eat it..</li>
            <li> My skin looked soft and supple, and it felt as smooth as pudding!</li>
            <li> My face was noticeably soft and I was pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> , it will be fun to use the container again.</li>
            <li> bring up the tag information that says no different letters not have any kind of protection</li>
            <li> then I expected also has a really good smell but</li>
            <li> i couldnt be more satisfied with this product and all of the other tony moly items ^-^</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am using it right.</li>
            <li> You have to do a little work to make sure it really gets out the unevenness and flaking, but you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a crisp apple scent and really nice skin.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin and want a very mild exfoliator, you&#x27;d probably like this one.</li>
            <li> First off, the container is so cute, I love seeing what looks like a crisp green apple on my bathroom counter every morning, puts a smile on my face.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin sooo soft and bright, totally recommended</li>
            <li> however, the product really leaves your skin super supple and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If any cream got that much skin off your face that quickly and without much rubbing at all - it would be the holy grail of skincare!</li>
            <li> , the packaging is not safe and easily opened , I wonder what kind of wue nonsense was sent me ??</li>
            <li> Its very gentle and smells just like apple.</li>
            <li> This works well enough, and it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li> The cream looks paper white, the texture silky, and its very very light.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that I&#x27;m a grown woman who still loves cool packing, like the clever apple shape, this is a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first week and a lot of improvement happened.</li>
            <li> After your skin will feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> You start by rubbing about a teaspoon&#x27;s worth onto your face and neck and keep gently rubbing in circles until it starts to clump up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a chemical exfoliant though, so make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> After testing it out, I love it but maybe for different reasons than others.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is not my face!!&amp;#34; First words out of my mouth after using this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> you only need a small amount to use and get awesome results .</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> They made your face clear and smooth for 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> I could instantly tell my face was in much better condition.</li>
            <li> But overall: I love this product and doesn&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Be patient and consistent.</li>
            <li> The apple has been open and I know this because the sticker was stuck to the top part of the apple.</li>
            <li> I love it overall.</li>
            <li> because I first thought I didn&#x27;t use it correctly.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like green apple at all.  </li>
            <li> Haha, I will definitely stick to this product I love it so much, I&#x27;m going to buy all of the Tonymoly fruit skincare products, I adore all of them!</li>
            <li> But again, it does ultimately (after about 20 minutes of leaving it on your face) start to exfoliate, and for only $10.00 for the amount you get, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I loved the packaging, so I ordered it based off that (bad decision, I know, but it ended on a good note!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the green apple scent and how smooth it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li> This stuff fixed it right away and didn&#x27;t hurt me at all!</li>
            <li> Keep massaging until all of it is pretty much gone from your face.</li>
            <li> and although it isn&#x27;t really for pedicures it works REALLY well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too abrasive -at least for me-, and really nice to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the shipping !</li>
            <li> If you are extremely dry, maybe you might be able to use it to exfoliate but thankfully I&#x27;m not in that position</li>
            <li> So, I would have given this peel 5 stars, but I am generally not the type of person to get that excited about things and being the incredibly realistic person that I am, I am sure there are better products out there that are more expensive.</li>
            <li> The description sounded &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34;, however, the actual item is like cream with some fine granules.</li>
            <li> and this has had only positive results which for me is usually very rare.</li>
            <li> I really like the peeling effect and would recommend to anyone who wants to try out korean skin care.</li>
            <li> I know some said that it isn&#x27;t really peeling away skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I knew this really</li>
            <li> It does peel some skin away but not too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks....</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t really smell that &amp;#34;apple-y&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference i been using it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I dont see much peeling with this product.  </li>
            <li> it took me a while to figure out how to make it peel, haha, the smell</li>
            <li> This is a really neat product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> It really is the size of an apple.  </li>
            <li> so I appreciate that this seems to be gentle.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> It really works the way it says it does.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about twice as much as this cream.</li>
            <li> Emphasis on gently.  </li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t massage it into my skin for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And when this adorable apple jar is empty, I will immediately buy another.</li>
            <li> However, when I got it and used it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much going for it at all - nothing beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They both works really well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> but it was to much of a hassle to exchange it</li>
            <li> It really does peel off layers of skin.</li>
            <li> It also feels very</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to take just 15 minutes out of the week to pamper him or herself or is looking for a gentle peel with visible results.</li>
            <li> I bought the Appletow and Tomatox.&lt;br /&gt;Using both really helps skin to be brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its very oily.</li>
            <li> It also really does smell just like an apple.</li>
            <li> but frankly it doesn&#x27;t do much to my face.</li>
            <li> That shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, as you really don&#x27;t need to use that much product.</li>
            <li> very liquid m has no peeling effect is not as they say YouTube tutorials .</li>
            <li> but there are a lot of other products out there that work better.</li>
            <li> It is not an anti-aging cream - but it does help my other products absorb better -</li>
            <li> first time I used it, I cleansed my face, massaged this into my skin for about a minute, let it sit for two minutes, massaged a little more, then rinsed off.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very cute, it was a bit smaller than I had expected</li>
            <li> I would definitely not recommend this product for those who have a sensitive complexion and tend to break out easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something for my face to clear it and exfoliate and this appletox really does the job!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more gentle compare to scrub exfoliants.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive combo skin, and this stuff exfoliates my dry patches wonderfully without the roughness of big abrasive particles or the sting of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> the peeling is also not as expected.can find better for much less.</li>
            <li> They nerved disappoint - and the kids can be persuaded to use this cream, they love the packaging and it really does smell just like green apples</li>
            <li> made soft, fresh, clear, and whitens.</li>
            <li> I definitely going to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> There is a decent amount of product, however.</li>
            <li> an older woman, all my skin products and cosmetics have got to work overtime on improving my skin in some way.</li>
            <li> I usually this Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream twice a week alternating with the Red Tomatotox Magic Massage Cream.  </li>
            <li> It was supposed to arrive anywhere from Nov 5th -29th, but I just received it today, October 29, a whole month early!</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable; I had imagined that it would be somehow smaller, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that its very close to the actual size of an apple!</li>
            <li> gives you a really soft and clean face... definitely gonna buy it again!</li>
            <li> your skin is left feeling  clean and so soft.</li>
            <li> it really smells like apple and leaves my face really soft</li>
            <li> but I was glad to see that it wasn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li> It does smell like fresh cut green apples and the cream leave my skin smooth and soft than it ever has been in all my life.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to apply and you wont have to put any extra efforts like other masks,</li>
            <li> The price is right and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything other than a cheap cream.</li>
            <li> One  thing that sets it apart from other masks is that it easily rinsed off and didn&#x27;t create a huge mess.</li>
            <li> The History of Whoo/Noevir&lt;br /&gt;Instead of giving an immediate result of dead skin, this product seemed to only be effective when left on for 5-10 minutes with a massage following the waiting, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like the good typical peeling products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> you will see beads of old dry skin starting to roll up and fall off ur face but keep rubbing till you have covered all ur face removing all the old skin off ur face then when you don&#x27;t see any new &amp;#34; skin rolls&amp;#34; for lack of better words</li>
            <li> OK, I literally had to delete my previous comment because I could hardly type with how excited I was with this stuff!</li>
            <li> i barely noticed any clumps appearing, it did moisturize my skin but not that much</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a harsh product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and smells like apples!</li>
            <li> At first this seems like a regular, a bit oily, lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better results from other facial creams.</li>
            <li> After about three minutes of vigorous scrubbing, the product had eventually started to be absorbed into my skin, and was beginning to dry.</li>
            <li> It has a strong green apple scent that may bother some folks.</li>
            <li> Everywhere that I used this dried smooth and soft while the untreated areas did their normal thing.</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable, but know that the product is only on the bottom half of the apple, so don&#x27;t be mislead by the size.</li>
            <li> , you know like a sunburn or something, However, on my skin at least, this was just a very light exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Was soo excited to get this and what a let down.</li>
            <li> I have used similar type of peeling gel products in the past which were in fact very effective (but ~2x more expensive).</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m misreading, it clearly says 2014.03.24.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really feel a notice a difference on my actual skin though.</li>
            <li> I was going to know off a star, because I felt like it should be four/five stars, but there is really nothing objective to knock off a star for.</li>
            <li> My face has never been this soft, like since birth.</li>
            <li> Okay... late 40s</li>
            <li> but it made my skin soft and supple after using it.</li>
            <li> Not enough real results.</li>
            <li> I would use this once a  week maybe twice a week tops because peeling creams tend to kill the skins natural UV protection.</li>
            <li> I had a lot on my face and has been completely gone with just two weeks of using this product, two times a week.  </li>
            <li> like this so far.</li>
            <li> and once I washed my hands they were so soft.</li>
            <li> It does remove the dead skin, makes facial skin much more softer and radiant.</li>
            <li> I agree that most of the pilling you see when you rub it on your face is the cream itself balling up rather than tons of dead skin sloughing off, but I still think this is a solid exfoliator.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few bloggers who have tested this product on a glove on then on their bare hand and found that they see more pilling on bare skin, which leads me to believe it does what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I actually never saw a product perform so well and leave my skin really soft in the first use, and I have been using peeling creams for a while now, but never with the instant results of this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was interested in the Japanese exfoliating thingy called like Cure or Kure, but that one is like double, almost triple the price so I got this.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re most likely not, Korean products tend to put the manufactured date on their items, I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> You basically put it on your clean, dry face and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to tell that the product was actually peeling my skin, it looked more like the product residue.</li>
            <li> leave it on for a few minutes, use my Clarisonic to give a quick boost and rinse.  </li>
            <li> follow up routine is one of those facial masks by Hey!Pingko, The Face Shop, or one of the other brands to calm down my skin and get some soothing solution into my clean, open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your skin 1st off looks lighter having just had removing all the old dull skin reviling ur new healthy skin that was hidden under the old stuff.</li>
            <li> I noticed a major difference after using it on my face, underarms, hands and feet.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see much exfoliation going on, but as it dried I began to see those tiny clumps.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used other peeling products (usually gels) that worked far better, but they were also four times the expense.  </li>
            <li> I applied the cream to both sides (and i only had to use whatever was clinging to the little plastic lid inside for full coverage) and followed the instructions.</li>
            <li> It gets all the dead skin off and is very gentle on my skin which can be sensitive at times.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t like tradition defoliators.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hand and indeed my hand is deeply exfoliated, it&#x27;s sort of sensitive now.</li>
            <li> This came sooo much faster than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I shall buy this again in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is gross, but after bleaching, dying, then rebleaching my eyebrows all in one day a few days ago, the skin under my eyebrows and surrounding it was very dry/flaky, no matter how much I exfoliated.</li>
            <li> The scent is a fresh smell of green apples.</li>
            <li> But the top wasn&#x27;t firmly sealed so a bit leaked out and was a mess.  </li>
            <li> First off you put this on dry skin and rub in the cream and keep working it in after it is dry</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t really smell like green apples and it does leave my skin soft</li>
            <li> The Secret Key Lemon D-toc is better by leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li> I rubbed it in for a few minutes and then just let it set for a few more minutes before I started rubbing again.</li>
            <li> It is removing gunk from your skin, so you might break out a little at first.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, only half my face produced the sticky little beads ofdead skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any black pearls that certain reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Basically you rub off the dry product, not dead skin.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours, the softness went away, and my skin looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and it was a little intense, but definitely worked.</li>
            <li> It really helped with peeling away that sensitive skin under my arms that I had a hard time exfoliating without hurting myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna give it a good or bad rating.</li>
            <li> did have a few pimples over the next couple of days, but remember that is NORMAL with any sort of product like this.</li>
            <li> the dark spots on my nose have been dwindled down to nothing in my first</li>
            <li> It really does peel away the dead skin!</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t look like it will last for long</li>
            <li> It was the little bit extra I needed to add to my skin routine to completely clear it up.</li>
            <li> and I am left with patchy dry spots.</li>
            <li> Product inside sucks, I only bought this for the case to hold my real lotion.</li>
            <li> And the stuff coming off is not dead skin cells, it just becomes solid when it&#x27;s dried up.</li>
            <li> Not knowing how to read the Korean labeling, I made sure to watch a few review and instructional videos about this product before purchasing so that I would know approximately what to expect and how to use it.  </li>
            <li> In our household we used this as a moisturizing massage cream for the winter when it&#x27;s very dry outside.  </li>
            <li> This one feels more like cold cream in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s such a minimal amount of peeling agent in this cream, that it doesn&#x27;t roll off.  </li>
            <li> Lotion isn&#x27;t enough but this took care of the dry peeling velcro skin that plagues me every winter!!</li>
            <li> The scent is very soft green apple not much scent at all</li>
            <li> I was expecting a gel consistency like other products, and this is a white cream.</li>
            <li> The solid pieces do help mechanically rub your skin, just as microbeads or other mechanical styles of exfoliants work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, when I dry off after a shower skin still rolls off</li>
            <li> I put it on dry skin and it seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, pat it dry, and then massage the peeling cream on my face, focusing on my problem areas.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for non acne prone dry skin.</li>
            <li> But you have to keep rubbing faster and faster with a lot of pressure (not so much that it hurts, but enough that your hands get tired)</li>
            <li> you have to really rub hard and for a solid minute or two before the little peeling bits start showing up (maybe because i had already exfoliated?)</li>
            <li> and to clear up some things, some people are saying the expiration date is way past it</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t buy it again unless I loose the darling container I am going to put on my desk.</li>
            <li> exfoliate did not leave my face dry like others have!  </li>
            <li> ; until I could purchase my &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; facial care products (as this line is less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried putting it on a dry face, a wet face, a damp face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it with a wet face and with a dry face.</li>
            <li> I tried it on everywhere including the face, hands, feet and the body- damp, dry, wet skin...</li>
            <li> It make my skin very soft and I like the delicate peeling.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly exfoliated half of my face and only managed the other half with my daily face wash.</li>
            <li> In addition, the little leaf shown on the photo was not present on my package.  </li>
            <li> i peeled back the little label and everything was in Korean.</li>
            <li> On the second massage, little chunks were rolling off of my face-</li>
            <li> It also lasts a LONG time, since a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit when you want to exfoliate, so it will probably last a few months.</li>
            <li> I let it sit on a few extra minutes, massage again and then wash away all of the gross clumps of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I just apply it, after shower, it dries out, and wash with water, or a wet paper towel, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot longer from China.</li>
            <li> a lot of people point out that it&#x27;s likely the product peeling, but it is also picking up dead skin, I can visibly see that.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and sometimes have trouble with scrubs being too harsh</li>
            <li> My face gets super dry in the winter, and during the cold months I need something that will help me not feel like my skin will flake off like a potato chip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m oily and acne prone and this didn&#x27;t make me break out or cause any other issues.</li>
            <li> These clumps are all the gross dead skin and dirt from your face!  </li>
            <li> It does not &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; on me at all I don&#x27;t know why because I do use other peeling products that does peel when I exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I did not feel the little balls of dry skin sloughing off that others have had</li>
            <li> I got the little balls of the cream mixed with the dead skin</li>
            <li> kinda went a little overboard and used it 3 days in a row - almost like a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> but I think it will last me at least a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I use it every alternate day and am slowly noticing that the dryness of my skin is going away</li>
            <li> plus it doesnt burn my skin like other products!</li>
            <li> I also going to try other products from them!</li>
            <li> You just massage the cream and it balls up taking off the dead skin and other debris on the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few other products in the TONYMOLY line.  </li>
            <li> This is supposed to be all your dead skin cells and junk left on your skin making it dull.  </li>
            <li> Then  you rinse your face with LUKEWARM TO SLIGHTLY CHILLED water.  </li>
            <li> I have not used anything, like this before, its not sticky, or makes any mess, on your clothes or anything.</li>
            <li> Not good enough as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Not good enough as a massage cream.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s one thing i dont like because all that forceful rubbing is not good for your skin and only leads to wrinkles and sagging.</li>
            <li> After washing with luke-warm water, my skin does not feel tight at all, and seems to be somewhat smoother.</li>
            <li> The rest rinsed off without a fuss and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight at all.</li>
            <li> I take a pumice stone about once every week or two and scrub all the dead skin off my body; I hoped this product could maybe replace some of the time I spend on doing so because it typically takes me about an hour to reach all of my body and moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> However, when I received the product in September, I didn&#x27;t notice the little expiration date at the bottom.</li>
            <li> However if you are actually looking to peel, something you can&#x27;t do with a loofah and some soap I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, it is too weak.</li>
            <li> and you continue to massage it into your face until you notice little clumps forming.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face a little moist/greasy</li>
            <li> No redness, NO blotches or those little bumps I sometimes get when my skin is dried out by an astringent product.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself gums up as you keep massaging it and attracts the dead skin.</li>
            <li> you have to keep rubbing though it removes dead skin</li>
            <li> Smells just like a green apple.</li>
            <li> and they say no matter where you put the stuff, clumps form so therefore isn&#x27;t dead skin.</li>
            <li> but a few times.</li>
            <li> I never knew how much dead skin my face was harboring until I used this.</li>
            <li> It smells like a green apple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing lotion and dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Just not a huge fan of this mask.</li>
            <li> bad thing is amazon says this has free 2 day shipping with prime, biut seeing how the product came directly from korra, that was impossible.</li>
            <li> When I rub it into my skin, clumps do appear and stick to my fingers, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the cream clumping or picking up dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the peeling effect is just the cream or the dead skin cells</li>
            <li> - not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly sad about it not having the leaf and stem, because it just looks like a strange green ball now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the stem of the apple is suppose to be there are not</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally sure about that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret buying it, although I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll repurchase.  </li>
            <li> but it is just so hard to find</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not effective as a peeling cream at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not endorsing my particular regimen, but just wanted you to have some idea of how I base my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re MUCH less noticeable!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and while it does temporarily soften and moisturizer my skin, the scent is too fake candy-apple-like.</li>
            <li> You put it on your face while a bit damp (at least I do!)</li>
            <li> and so far I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it!</li>
            <li> something that I found with it is that when you apply it don&#x27;t go crazy with you just grab little at a time and do your face by section</li>
            <li> So, then I get confused if I&#x27;m supposed to leave it on as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> hate when I get that dry velcro type effect on my hands and fingers</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> (still haven&#x27;t figured out why) that I have always been insecure about.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read reviews AFTER I bought the product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn or sting like I was afraid it would.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m too afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> the bad:  everything is in Korean</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too  bad, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> that wasnt bad</li>
            <li> But no leaf...:(</li>
            <li> To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> so I was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was disappointed with the packaging</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that I returned the worthless product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed .</li>
            <li> but this is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice gentle exfoliater with a clean scent. I really like the peeling effect and would recommend to anyone who wants to try out korean skin care. I use this once a week to keep my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> This peeling cream is just ok. Adorable, but not as effective as I would have liked. The Secret Key Lemon D-toc is better by leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li> This peeling cream its great! gives you a really soft and clean face... definitely gonna buy it again! love the texture, also smells really good! love the packaging!</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;m glad i added this to my skin care routine. It&#x27;s a little more gentle compare to scrub exfoliants.  Smells great too &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This product is an amazing one . This is my first week and a lot of improvement happened.</li>
            <li> A nice gentle exfoliation product, smells nice.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes</li>
            <li> I know some said that it isn&#x27;t really peeling away skin but it IS! The lotion itself gums up as you keep massaging it and attracts the dead skin. You can tell because it turns greyish as it rolls off. I noticed a major difference after using it on my face, underarms, hands and feet. There was no irritation or redness (I am sensitive to most chemicals so this was a big PLUS). I have struggled with finding a good exfoliation method for a long time. No matter what I do, when I dry off after a shower skin still rolls off and I am left with patchy dry spots. Everywhere that I used this dried smooth and soft while the untreated areas did their normal thing. That&#x27;s how I knew this really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I hate when I get that dry velcro type effect on my hands and fingers (you know where the skin seems to snag on any material) and it drives me nuts! Lotion isn&#x27;t enough but this took care of the dry peeling velcro skin that plagues me every winter!! It really helped with peeling away that sensitive skin under my arms that I had a hard time exfoliating without hurting myself. I rubbed it in for a few minutes and then just let it set for a few more minutes before I started rubbing again. I put it on dry skin and it seemed to work. I didn&#x27;t get any directions with it but I was glad to see that it wasn&#x27;t harsh. It also smells lovely!</li>
            <li> It got here on time and it was soo cute ^-^ but aside from both of those things it also works really well&amp;#60;3 the dark spots on my nose have been dwindled down to nothing in my first use&amp;#60;3 i couldnt be more satisfied with this product and all of the other tony moly items ^-^</li>
            <li> I love it! It does peel as described.  Pleasant smell!</li>
            <li> It does peel some skin away but not too much. Maybe that is a good thing... Also I think the smell is strong but very very light. Don&#x27;t expect a lot of apple fragrance. The container is very cute, just like in the picture, and it has a good amount of product.</li>
            <li> This is a good skin exfoliator. I found that if works best for me in the morning before washing my face. You just massage the cream and it balls up taking off the dead skin and other debris on the face. Keep massaging until all of it is pretty much gone from your face. Rinse your face when done. You can also wash it if you feel like it. I have done it both ways and my skin was fine. After your skin will feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I honestly would have loved this Peeling Cream because I had bought it before and the way your dead skin comes off is amazing! However, when I received the product in September, I didn&#x27;t notice the little expiration date at the bottom. Unless I&#x27;m misreading, it clearly says 2014.03.24. So yeah, basically this is expired...Thanks....</li>
            <li> Love the container. This product did not help my skin at all...And doesn&#x27;t really smell that &amp;#34;apple-y&amp;#34; either. I bought it as a &amp;#34;hold me over&amp;#34; until I could purchase my &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; facial care products (as this line is less expensive).&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy it again unless I loose the darling container I am going to put on my desk.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like apples to me at all like everyone else is claiming, but it is good at what it says. It exfoliates okay and leaves your skin feeling soft. I&#x27;m trying to figure out whether or not it made me break out because a day later I broke out after using it. But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Smells great, just like a fresh green apple. If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating effect, there are other products that are more effective. I was expecting a gel consistency like other products, and this is a white cream. If you have really sensitive skin and want a very mild exfoliator, you&#x27;d probably like this one.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t really smell like green apples and it does leave my skin soft but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference i been using it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> This peeling cream is amazing!  It does remove the dead skin, makes facial skin much more softer and radiant.</li>
            <li> I dont see much peeling with this product.  did not see much difference!!</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a week to refresh and nourish my skin. First off, the container is so cute, I love seeing what looks like a crisp green apple on my bathroom counter every morning, puts a smile on my face. This product smells amazing, a combination of granny smith apple and pear. You don&#x27;t need much so it is a good value.  You start by rubbing about a teaspoon&#x27;s worth onto your face and neck and keep gently rubbing in circles until it starts to clump up.  This is supposed to be all your dead skin cells and junk left on your skin making it dull.  I think it really works, not only for removing dead skin, but brightening and healing it.  I was having trouble with some acne marks (i&#x27;m a bit of a picker) and I really notice them softening and lightening up. I&#x27;ve already ordered more as a backup when I run out, I never want to be without this awesome product!</li>
            <li> They nerved disappoint - and the kids can be persuaded to use this cream, they love the packaging and it really does smell just like green apples</li>
            <li> Eh.... Peels nothing.  It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and leaves your skin super soft. It&#x27;s definitely a chemical exfoliant though, so make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes. You have to do a little work to make sure it really gets out the unevenness and flaking, but you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a crisp apple scent and really nice skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like it give brightness to my skin after using it, I like it</li>
            <li> did not come in a product box and did not have the leaf as shown in picuture just the amazon box and bubble wrap, but over all it is a good product. it took me a while to figure out how to make it peel, haha, the smell it very nice it really smells like apple and leaves my face really soft</li>
            <li> This thing makes wonders, its not abrasive its soft, smells really good, you can actually see the dead skin in your fingers and leaves the skin feeling just great!! and i love the free samples</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much! It was the little bit extra I needed to add to my skin routine to completely clear it up. Its very gentle and smells just like apple. I use it about every three days and just scoop a bit on my finger tip. Its super adorable packaging and its my favorite thing in my bathroom, period. I would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t like tradition defoliators.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly, maybe four days.  But the top wasn&#x27;t firmly sealed so a bit leaked out and was a mess.  It smells heavenly, and is very very lightly exfoliating, but no matter how much I rubbed I couldn&#x27;t get it to peel.  Anyway, my skin feels very nice afterwards, and I follow up with Tony Moly redappletox cream, or Bhavipati peach waterfull cream to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I love it it works! nice packaging too so cute! and it really does smell like a green apple.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was interested in the Japanese exfoliating thingy called like Cure or Kure, but that one is like double, almost triple the price so I got this. For exfoliating I think it does work but not super greatly, sometimes I question if it&#x27;s actually my skin or just the product drying up, because all the &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; tend to stick on my hand, not ball up on my face. ah! and to clear up some things, some people are saying the expiration date is way past it and you&#x27;re wasting your money on an expired product BUT TRUST ME!! you&#x27;re most likely not, Korean products tend to put the manufactured date on their items, I&#x27;m not sure why but I like the concept c: anyway for the product I think it works to an extent because my face DID feel a lot softer the next day</li>
            <li> I loved it, and really worth it</li>
            <li> Smell - amazing. I love apples so this rocks my world.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness - not sure. When I rub it into my skin, clumps do appear and stick to my fingers, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the cream clumping or picking up dead skin cells. Didn&#x27;t really feel a notice a difference on my actual skin though. My skin feels moisturized though. Will probably just use it as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - So cute! But no leaf...:(</li>
            <li> made soft, fresh, clear, and whitens. I definitely going to buy more in the future. This website also is awesome !</li>
            <li> This is a really neat product. The packaging is adorable; I had imagined that it would be somehow smaller, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that its very close to the actual size of an apple! You only need to use a little bit when you want to exfoliate, so it will probably last a few months. When I first started rubbing the cream in, I didn&#x27;t really have any expectations in mind; the cream was both instantly moisturizing and smelled delicious. After about three minutes of vigorous scrubbing, the product had eventually started to be absorbed into my skin, and was beginning to dry. At first I didn&#x27;t see much exfoliation going on, but as it dried I began to see those tiny clumps. After washing with luke-warm water, my skin does not feel tight at all, and seems to be somewhat smoother. Great product overall!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it but my sisters like it</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. The second time I gifted it to my mom in law since she loved it so much. I have one for my face and one for pedicures and although it isn&#x27;t really for pedicures it works REALLY well! I love TONYMOLY products and have purchased a ton of their goodies and am always impressed and happy with the cute packaging. Definitely recommend this product. It gets all the dead skin off and is very gentle on my skin which can be sensitive at times.</li>
            <li> South Korean facial products are the best on the market for skin types and this is no exception.  I am German-American so I might have different skin types compared to others that have reviewed this product.  Firstly I too like many others purchased this cream since it was cute and I wanted it to sit in my bathroom for the fall season.  After testing it out, I love it but maybe for different reasons than others.  Many state it is great to exfoliate, I&#x27;m not understanding this part.  You basically put it on your clean, dry face and let it dry.  Then you rub it off your skin and rinse clean.  Basically you rub off the dry product, not dead skin.  If you are extremely dry, maybe you might be able to use it to exfoliate but thankfully I&#x27;m not in that position so I can&#x27;t say 100%.  What I do love of this product is the lotion that it leaves on your skin after using.  It has a nice very light apple scent when using and when you rub off and then rinse your face, your skin will have a slightly creamy feeling.  In our household we used this as a moisturizing massage cream for the winter when it&#x27;s very dry outside.  I don&#x27;t even need to use facial cream in the winter when I use this!  I would buy again and anything else from Tony Moly - love their quality South Korean products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. I was going to know off a star, because I felt like it should be four/five stars, but there is really nothing objective to knock off a star for. I used it on my hand and indeed my hand is deeply exfoliated, it&#x27;s sort of sensitive now.</li>
            <li> First the good:  it&#x27;s bigger than I expected.  It really is the size of an apple.  It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like green apple at all.  It leaves your face feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad:  everything is in Korean so you have no clue how you&#x27;re supposed to use this.  I&#x27;ve tried putting it on a dry face, a wet face, a damp face.  It doesn&#x27;t ever seem to actually &amp;#34;pill up&amp;#34; like shown in the pictures.  It&#x27;s just like rubbing lotion into your face.  I will say, it must be doing something because when I use it, I always have 3 or 4 brand new pimples needing to be popped that have magically sprung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, cute packaging but there are a lot of other products out there that work better.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is not my face!!&amp;#34; First words out of my mouth after using this product for the first time. My face has never been this soft, like since birth. Love it, the packaging is too cute &amp; it arrived 4 days early. Very happy &amp; will be buying it again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> What a fun product! I agree that most of the pilling you see when you rub it on your face is the cream itself balling up rather than tons of dead skin sloughing off, but I still think this is a solid exfoliator. There are quite a few bloggers who have tested this product on a glove on then on their bare hand and found that they see more pilling on bare skin, which leads me to believe it does what it says it is supposed to do. I have sensitive skin and sometimes have trouble with scrubs being too harsh so I appreciate that this seems to be gentle. I&#x27;m oily and acne prone and this didn&#x27;t make me break out or cause any other issues. My skin does look brighter and smoother after using this. It has a strong green apple scent that may bother some folks. The price is right and I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable, the cream smells amazing, and the application is easy! Great  for sensitive skin and feels extremely refreshing afterwards.</li>
            <li> It didnt peel my skin ( like the pic ) i barely noticed any clumps appearing, it did moisturize my skin but not that much</li>
            <li> It make my skin very soft and I like the delicate peeling.</li>
            <li> This has helped my facial skin a lot. I use it every alternate day and am slowly noticing that the dryness of my skin is going away and my skin is glowing</li>
            <li> Not knowing how to read the Korean labeling, I made sure to watch a few review and instructional videos about this product before purchasing so that I would know approximately what to expect and how to use it.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  While it did have a pleasant, mild apple scent, it did absolutely NOTHING for peeling nor exfoliating.  I tried using different quantities and for varying amounts of time, but still nothing.  In addition, the little leaf shown on the photo was not present on my package.  I was so disappointed that I returned the worthless product.</li>
            <li> TONYMOLY Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream 80g This face cream is great you only need a small amount to use and get awesome results . First off you put this on dry skin and rub in the cream and keep working it in after it is dry then this is when the magic starts to happen.... you will see beads of old dry skin starting to roll up and fall off ur face but keep rubbing till you have covered all ur face removing all the old skin off ur face then when you don&#x27;t see any new &amp;#34; skin rolls&amp;#34; for lack of better words haha ur done rinse your face and u will see the magic right away. Your skin 1st off looks lighter having just had removing all the old dull skin reviling ur new healthy skin that was hidden under the old stuff. your skin is left feeling  clean and so soft. I had a total of 5 people use this product and we all got the same amazing results. I am so happy with this buy and will be getting more when I need a new one ^.^</li>
            <li> It really works the way it says it does.</li>
            <li> Works really well! I use this once a week and really works well to get rid of all the dead skin cells. The only downside is the smell after you wipe it off. It isn&#x27;t too  bad, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that I&#x27;m a grown woman who still loves cool packing, like the clever apple shape, this is a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on for a few minutes, use my Clarisonic to give a quick boost and rinse.  I have fair, combination skin, which can be sensitive to certain products, however, my skin loves this.  It does a fantastic job and again, how cute is the packaging?!?  I&#x27;ve ordered a few other products in the TONYMOLY line.  My vanity will look like a fruit stand in no time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely not recommend this product for those who have a sensitive complexion and tend to break out easily. I have oily/combination skin and this cream left a waxy residue on my face after using it. It was hard to tell that the product was actually peeling my skin, it looked more like the product residue. Also, this product does not peel as well as the Cure Aqua Gel- my skin is literally smoother when using the Cure Aqua Gel- so I was greatly disappointed. I ended up breaking out after a three or four uses.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I wash my face, pat it dry, and then massage the peeling cream on my face, focusing on my problem areas. I let it sit on a few extra minutes, massage again and then wash away all of the gross clumps of dead skin. It really makes your skin look bright and healthy. Doesn&#x27;t burn or sting like I was afraid it would. Definitely a great edition to my skincare routine- I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week in combination with the Tomatox from Tonymoly. The packaging is adorable, but know that the product is only on the bottom half of the apple, so don&#x27;t be mislead by the size. There is a decent amount of product, however.</li>
            <li> I received this from honest skin the seller is really good it was really nice to get  it early before the estimate date it works wonderful! you have to keep rubbing though it removes dead skin it smells good and makes your skin super soft I love it!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s another Korean peeling gel I use but it is just so hard to find and it&#x27;s about twice as much as this cream. This works well enough, and it&#x27;s very cheap. Until I can find something as cheap as this or works a bit better!</li>
            <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am using it right. The directions are in Korean. I have tried it with a wet face and with a dry face. I don&#x27;t get the skin sloughing that many people are saying they get. Maybe my face is well exfoliated. I don&#x27;t know. But it does make my face seem cleaner. I only use it once a week - I am in my mid ---- OY! ---- Okay... late 40s - I don&#x27;t want to wash away all the oils from my skin. I was concerned a peeling cream would do that. But this makes my face feel fresher without over drying. It is not an anti-aging cream - but it does help my other products absorb better - I think. I just wish I could get that skin sloughing that others get.</li>
            <li> Just not a huge fan of this mask. I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and while it does temporarily soften and moisturizer my skin, the scent is too fake candy-apple-like.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really works. It arrived today and I was a bit sceptical about it, but I just used by applying the cream and rubbing it in my face for 1-2 minutes and at the end I got the little balls of the cream mixed with the dead skin and it was awesome! I actually never saw a product perform so well and leave my skin really soft in the first use, and I have been using peeling creams for a while now, but never with the instant results of this one. And the apple smell is really nice, it is not too strong and it relaxed me. It absolutely met my expectations and the apple shape of the container ir really beautiful!</li>
            <li> This came sooo much faster than I expected it to. The instructions are all in Korean, but you can easily find instructions online. I used it once and my face felt so nice after it :) Really satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> The texture if this product is like a creamy moisturizer with a wonderful apple scent that does not become cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I splashed some water on my face and then gently massaged into my skin for about a minute.  Emphasis on gently.  After that I just washed off the thinned out residue and my work was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kinda went a little overboard and used it 3 days in a row - almost like a facial cleanser. I did not feel the little balls of dry skin sloughing off that others have had but maybe its because I don&#x27;t massage it into my skin for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced absolutely NO skin irritation, No redness, NO blotches or those little bumps I sometimes get when my skin is dried out by an astringent product. What I have is a smooth, hydrated, soft and healthy looking face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My follow up routine is one of those facial masks by Hey!Pingko, The Face Shop, or one of the other brands to calm down my skin and get some soothing solution into my clean, open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not endorsing my particular regimen, but just wanted you to have some idea of how I base my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!  And when this adorable apple jar is empty, I will immediately buy another.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the peeling effect is just the cream or the dead skin cells but it made my skin soft and supple after using it.</li>
            <li> I learned about TONYMOLY products online, and the cute packaging caught my attention. I could not wait to try this out, and orderd it. Firstly, this smells so great, kinda like sour granny smith, this smell makes me wanna eat it..lol....The cream looks paper white, the texture silky, and its very very light. Easy to apply and no dramas associated. I have not used anything, like this before, its not sticky, or makes any mess, on your clothes or anything. Its very easy to apply and you wont have to put any extra efforts like other masks, its just like a cream! I just apply it, after shower, it dries out, and wash with water, or a wet paper towel, and that&#x27;s it. It does make my skin smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the Tonymoly Appletox for use as a massage cream based on the good reviews here. But I was disappointed in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an older woman, all my skin products and cosmetics have got to work overtime on improving my skin in some way. The Appletox seemed to have some good ingredients in it to help exfoliate while you massage, like fruit acids and papaya enzymes. However, when I got it and used it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much going for it at all - nothing beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People remarked on the skin sloughing off - that is not actually your skin. When the cream gets warmed by your fingers or the temperature, the formula  starts balling up into these solid pieces that may seem like skin, or that is marketed as your skin sloughing off. You can try it yourself - rub some on a piece of plastic - the same solids will form - it is definitely not your skin. If any cream got that much skin off your face that quickly and without much rubbing at all - it would be the holy grail of skincare! The solid pieces do help mechanically rub your skin, just as microbeads or other mechanical styles of exfoliants work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream smells nice and is easy to massage on, and it rinses off nicely - leaving a moisturized feeling as opposed to a dry feeling. I am using it as a quick cleanser in the morning in the shower. But I won&#x27;t buy it again. Not enough real results. Not good enough as an exfoliator. Not good enough as a massage cream. Just meh.</li>
            <li> Love love loved it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks amazing from it and my skin cleared up!! Get it! You know you want it!! :) :) :) ;)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel the peeling effect that others claim. It doesn&#x27;t really do much besides have a clean apple smell and cute packaging. Made me break out. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love love love itt~ It makes my face feel so clean and smooth, and it smells soo nice too :3</li>
            <li> Product inside sucks, I only bought this for the case to hold my real lotion.</li>
            <li> The Product is good. I think that using the word &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is a bit strong though. I was expecting to peel, you know like a sunburn or something, However, on my skin at least, this was just a very light exfoliate. You could probably get the same effect from using a exfoliating scrub. So if that is what you want A+ product. However if you are actually looking to peel, something you can&#x27;t do with a loofah and some soap I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, it is too weak.</li>
            <li> I usually this Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream twice a week alternating with the Red Tomatotox Magic Massage Cream.  They both works really well on my skin.  They made your face clear and smooth for 2-3 days.  The price are very good comparison to more expensive brand from USA.  I definitely recommend to friends and co-workers.  I shall buy this again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Smells just like a green apple. Lovely. cant wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed with the packaging but it was to much of a hassle to exchange it so i just said whatever and kept it anyhow. it does smell amazing and it does leave your skin super soft</li>
            <li> I own the tomatox massaging cream also by Tonymoly so I thought about giving the appletox a try! My face gets super dry in the winter, and during the cold months I need something that will help me not feel like my skin will flake off like a potato chip. I ordered via Amazon prime, and it didn&#x27;t come with the stem/leaf with instructions so I went to the website. I&#x27;m slightly sad about it not having the leaf and stem, because it just looks like a strange green ball now. (I added a stem just for personal taste so it looks like an apple now)&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on as soon as I got it in, and after I peeled it off I could instantly tell my face was in much better condition. My skin looked soft and supple, and it felt as smooth as pudding! Haha, I will definitely stick to this product I love it so much, I&#x27;m going to buy all of the Tonymoly fruit skincare products, I adore all of them!</li>
            <li> To be honest, at first I just ordered this product because I thought the packaging was cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it a couple of days ago and I&#x27;ve only used it twice (you&#x27;re not supposed to use it more than 2~3 times a week) and so far I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it! The scent is a fresh smell of green apples. It makes my face feel so smooth and clean and it really takes away all the dead skin. It&#x27;s supposed to have a brightening effect, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference compared to before and now. Yet. I&#x27;m already kinda light skinned so maybe that&#x27;s why (or maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve only used it twice). But overall: I love this product and doesn&#x27;t regret buying it. Maybe it&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth the money. The product doesn&#x27;t look like it will last for long but I think it will last me at least a couple of months. Depends on how often you&#x27;ll use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, would I buy this again? Yes!</li>
            <li> So, I would have given this peel 5 stars, but I am generally not the type of person to get that excited about things and being the incredibly realistic person that I am, I am sure there are better products out there that are more expensive. Anyway, I use this about once a week, after I shower and wash my face. Scoop about a quarter-size amount onto your hands and massage onto your cheeks, nose, mouth area, AND upper neck for about two-three minutes. I use about a dime size amount on my forehead and t-zone and massage for the same amount of time. Then, I wait about 10 minutes. After that, I rub the product off my face and upper neck. It really does peel off layers of skin. You can see the bits of darker skin that come off. Afterwards, my face looks brighter and pores look reduced. It also feels very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a harsh product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and smells like apples! I recommend this to anyone who wants to take just 15 minutes out of the week to pamper him or herself or is looking for a gentle peel with visible results. Be patient and consistent. It&#x27;s been about a month for me, but I can see that my skin is brighter and more even.</li>
            <li> Great exfoilant that did not leave my face irritated and tight. My face was noticeably soft and I was pleased with this purchase. One  thing that sets it apart from other masks is that it easily rinsed off and didn&#x27;t create a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I bought the Appletow and Tomatox.&lt;br /&gt;Using both really helps skin to be brighter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too abrasive -at least for me-, and really nice to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the shipping !</li>
            <li> The packaging is very cute, it was a bit smaller than I had expected but you don&#x27;t need very much. It really does peel away the dead skin! The scent is very soft green apple not much scent at all it is very nice. I would use this once a  week maybe twice a week tops because peeling creams tend to kill the skins natural UV protection. My skin definitely feels smoother and looks like it is glowing. I think you would see even better results over time. I would recommend not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> One thing product reviews don&#x27;t talk about is how this peeling cream reduces redness.  I had a lot on my face and has been completely gone with just two weeks of using this product, two times a week.  I would also like to add that the seller shipped the item quickly!  I expected a lot longer from China.</li>
            <li> Very good thank you for the lovely gift packaging and you are more than wonderful</li>
            <li> Leaves skin sooo soft and bright, totally recommended</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but breaks out my skin so much each time -- I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all. Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything other than a cheap cream. Did not peel, only irritated my skin since I was rubbing for a while to get it to peel. I was hoping to purchase something at a more reasonable price. I&#x27;ll go back the dermatological products that TRULY exfoliate and soften skin.</li>
            <li> like this so far. i was expecting more of a gel than a cream i suppose. you have to really rub hard and for a solid minute or two before the little peeling bits start showing up (maybe because i had already exfoliated?) that&#x27;s one thing i dont like because all that forceful rubbing is not good for your skin and only leads to wrinkles and sagging. however, the product really leaves your skin super supple and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another bad thing is amazon says this has free 2 day shipping with prime, biut seeing how the product came directly from korra, that was impossible. i did choose the 2 day shipping but it took about 3 weeks. that wasnt bad but it just wasn&#x27;t what amazon promised.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this product yet but when It arrive it was defected. I&#x27;m not sure if the stem of the apple is suppose to be there are not but it not there. The apple has been open and I know this because the sticker was stuck to the top part of the apple. Also there is no packaging at all just the apple itself. Now I&#x27;m too afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> the consistency is very nice, glide on smooth and as I massaged on my skin, it does the job exfoliating well and it feels very light on the skin.  Great product and I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Smells good, my skin felt refreshed and very smooth after an application. I followed by a face mask as instructed and got great results.&lt;br /&gt;this is a second product from TONYMOLY I have tried and I like them both.</li>
            <li> Dont have te label With the expiration date!</li>
            <li> I loved the packaging, so I ordered it based off that (bad decision, I know, but it ended on a good note!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best!  It smells just like granny smith apples.  You put it on your face while a bit damp (at least I do!) and you continue to massage it into your face until you notice little clumps forming.  These clumps are all the gross dead skin and dirt from your face!  Then  you rinse your face with LUKEWARM TO SLIGHTLY CHILLED water.  Then BAM!!!! Super smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;This exfoliate did not leave my face dry like others have!  It&#x27;s great! I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The description sounded &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34;, however, the actual item is like cream with some fine granules. So it is like a scrub.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t peel off at all.  There&#x27;s such a minimal amount of peeling agent in this cream, that it doesn&#x27;t roll off.  So, then I get confused if I&#x27;m supposed to leave it on as a moisturizer.  Which smells great...BUT.  Cute container.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, gentle, clarifying, and it arrived quickly from the great kind TOKTOK, a seller I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it looks and smells great, but i had to log on to Amazon to find out how to use it!  it would be good to have detailed instructions in english on PAPER.  i peeled back the little label and everything was in Korean.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the packaging is adorable, but it smells great and works very well. I will definitely order this again in the future.</li>
            <li> At first this seems like a regular, a bit oily, lotion. But you have to keep rubbing faster and faster with a lot of pressure (not so much that it hurts, but enough that your hands get tired) and it will start peeling more and more. This is not acidic at all. This is gross, but after bleaching, dying, then rebleaching my eyebrows all in one day a few days ago, the skin under my eyebrows and surrounding it was very dry/flaky, no matter how much I exfoliated. This stuff fixed it right away and didn&#x27;t hurt me at all! Also, I have very sensitive skin and this was amazing on it. I have some darker parts of my neck that I have been there since I was around 7 or so (still haven&#x27;t figured out why) that I have always been insecure about. They have never faded even after years of exfoliation. I was hoping when I ordered this that it would help fade them somehow (I know they&#x27;re not dirt, but I hoped anyway) and after once use they&#x27;re MUCH less noticeable!!! I am so in love with this product, and I know I will be ordering more and more when it runs out (which I doubt will be for a while!)!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my very first Korean cosmetic that I&#x27;ve ever gotten; so, I was a bit nervous and excited to get. I&#x27;ve been looking for something for my face to clear it and exfoliate and this appletox really does the job! It does smell like fresh cut green apples and the cream leave my skin smooth and soft than it ever has been in all my life. I can&#x27;t complain about the size since you don&#x27;t need a lot for this on your face. I will definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> Great special little product ~ Will work perfect for a teacher (An apple a day...)</li>
            <li> Love Tony Moly!  Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was reading good stuff about it and also because of the packaging. I love it overall. It took a while to get to me but it wasnt their fault so its all good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna give it a good or bad rating. It smells good and performs as a basic cleanser. It does not &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; on me at all I don&#x27;t know why because I do use other peeling products that does peel when I exfoliate. Overall just standard cleanser.</li>
            <li> when I got it, it was expire.</li>
            <li> I was using Daiso water pack gel peeling product, but decided to try this.  It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;m not super impressed.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to the water pack gel.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It really works and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. It also lasts a LONG time, since a little goes a long way.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooooo amazing. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I have very sensitive skin and this has had only positive results which for me is usually very rare. It has brighten my complexion for sure!</li>
            <li> Was soo excited to get this and what a let down. It made my face break out. Mine came thrown in the Amazon packing box with the baby diapers I ordered. No spoon no box!! It was just laying in there. It was sealed with a sticker. No directions nothing!! Luckily I read on here how to use it. Peeling cream noooo. Not even a grit to it. I put it on anyway and broke out. It doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do at all. It did give my skin a glow and made my forehead smoother. I recommend this for non acne prone dry skin. I gave it two stars because the apple is cute and the fragrance is suttle. But peeling mask please. I will not buy again!! I love TonyMoly charcoal pack but this is horrible. I will buy the lip glosses and the charcoal pack again. What a waste of money! Oh its not ur skin sloughing off its the product!</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once and my skin did seem &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; after the one use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like a miracle eraser but somehow your skin seems &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to explain, may be it&#x27;s best to try it.</li>
            <li> No peeling what so ever...waste of money. It feels like moisturizer with dirt or sal in it. Its very oily.</li>
            <li> Love the green apple scent and how smooth it makes my face feel.  Yes, the container is cute but that&#x27;s not why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works as described and it&#x27;s easy to use. The scent is very light and pleasant and my skin feels so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now, and really like it. I have sensitive combo skin, and this stuff exfoliates my dry patches wonderfully without the roughness of big abrasive particles or the sting of harsh chemicals. It also really does smell just like an apple.</li>
            <li> I take a pumice stone about once every week or two and scrub all the dead skin off my body; I hoped this product could maybe replace some of the time I spend on doing so because it typically takes me about an hour to reach all of my body and moisturize afterwards. Unfortunately, I read reviews AFTER I bought the product and they say no matter where you put the stuff, clumps form so therefore isn&#x27;t dead skin. I&#x27;m not totally sure about that but it left a filmy feeling on my body and I probably won&#x27;t use it but a few times. However, the container is super cute and I&#x27;m still glad I have it, it will be fun to use the container again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I was hoping for. the peeling is also not as expected.can find better for much less.</li>
            <li> great! love the texture and its er gentle on my skin which is important to me. i looooove the smell of it. would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I never knew how much dead skin my face was harboring until I used this. Some people think it is the product peeling but I tried it again on my skin after I did it 5 minutes before and nothing came off--so it is definitely not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s the size of an apple. It smells like a green apple. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People complain about not coming with a spatula and that it is not hygienic cause of that. I&#x27;ve been using throw away craft/Popsicle sticks for anything in a jay that doesn&#x27;t come with a spatula. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and made my skin feel very soft, but that&#x27;s it. After a few hours, the softness went away, and my skin looked exactly the same. I&#x27;ve had much better results from other facial creams.</li>
            <li> I bought this because A) Buzzfeed recommended it, B) It&#x27;s adorable, C) I like facial peels. This stuff smells amazing, has an adorable package, and works wonders, even on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I cleansed my face, massaged this into my skin for about a minute, let it sit for two minutes, massaged a little more, then rinsed off. On the second massage, little chunks were rolling off of my face- I&#x27;m guessing lotion and dead skin cells. Afterward my face felt ultra smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I did have a few pimples over the next couple of days, but remember that is NORMAL with any sort of product like this. It is removing gunk from your skin, so you might break out a little at first. But I&#x27;ve had no problems in the weeks since. My skin is smooth, free of blemishes, and some scars are fading. Love it!</li>
            <li> cute container of course. the cream is good but i think tomatox works a bit better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not effective as a peeling cream at all. I tried it on everywhere including the face, hands, feet and the body- damp, dry, wet skin...because I first thought I didn&#x27;t use it correctly. I have used similar type of peeling gel products in the past which were in fact very effective (but ~2x more expensive). This one feels more like cold cream in my opinion. I&#x27;d rather use salt, baking soda or sugar mixed with olive oil or jojoba oil for exfoliating. And the stuff coming off is not dead skin cells, it just becomes solid when it&#x27;s dried up. Even as a massage cream, it leaves a residue on the skin (it&#x27;s probably the mineral oil...).... I gave it a try... I will just use it as a decoration.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it, because I&#x27;ve used more effective peels, Like Detclear/The History of Whoo/Noevir&lt;br /&gt;Instead of giving an immediate result of dead skin, this product seemed to only be effective when left on for 5-10 minutes with a massage following the waiting, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like the good typical peeling products.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have a nice fragrance and leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very mild exfoliator, NO PEELNG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian and have pale/combination/sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t know if I got the original product because it didn&#x27;t come in any Tony Moly Casing. It also didn&#x27;t come with any spoon. I don&#x27;t see any black pearls that certain reviewers have mentioned. The casing is cute and smells great but frankly it doesn&#x27;t do much to my face. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> loved how it smelled and made my skin feel. no problems afterwards with my skin and no irrtation</li>
            <li> I will admit, the product is smaller than I thought it would be. It is literally the exact size of a normal apple lol. That shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, as you really don&#x27;t need to use that much product. It smells nice and it made my skin SUPER soft. And a bonus, it shipped quickly (3 days). All together, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> love it! it works so well! plus it doesnt burn my skin like other products!</li>
            <li> What a shame !! I am very disappointed . This product came without safety seal , the contestuea is very liquid m has no peeling effect is not as they say YouTube tutorials . I lost my time and money&lt;br /&gt;not bring up the tag information that says no different letters not have any kind of protection is very soft texture does not produce any kind of exfoliation , the packaging is not safe and easily opened , I wonder what kind of wue nonsense was sent me ??</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m 5-starring all of TonyMoly&#x27;s products but DANG I love them. This smells amazing and really does peel--a lot of people point out that it&#x27;s likely the product peeling, but it is also picking up dead skin, I can visibly see that. It leaves your face a little moist/greasy but if you follow up with the Tomatox mask it&#x27;s an amazing combination.</li>
            <li> excellent! recommended</li>
            <li> OK, I literally had to delete my previous comment because I could hardly type with how excited I was with this stuff! It was supposed to arrive anywhere from Nov 5th -29th, but I just received it today, October 29, a whole month early! So I conducted an experiment. I thoroughly exfoliated half of my face and only managed the other half with my daily face wash. I applied the cream to both sides (and i only had to use whatever was clinging to the little plastic lid inside for full coverage) and followed the instructions. Sure enough, only half my face produced the sticky little beads ofdead skin. The rest rinsed off without a fuss and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight at all. I totally recommend this seller AND this product.</li>
            <li> For $10.00, this is pretty good.  I have used other peeling products (usually gels) that worked far better, but they were also four times the expense.  I don&#x27;t regret buying it, although I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll repurchase.  But again, it does ultimately (after about 20 minutes of leaving it on your face) start to exfoliate, and for only $10.00 for the amount you get, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I love love it! It look so cute the package and feel so amazing on my face! I will buy this aging! I also going to try other products from them!</li>
            <li> it does what it says it does I used it once a week and I love how it pulls the dirt from your face so its great for cleansing its a good size too it was bigger then I expected also has a really good smell but something that I found with it is that when you apply it don&#x27;t go crazy with you just grab little at a time and do your face by section</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and it was a little intense, but definitely worked. It&#x27;s not something to use more than a couple times a week. Tonight I tried it on my hands and it worked great. I just rubbed my hands together until it all pilled up and once I washed my hands they were so soft. Great stuff.</li>
