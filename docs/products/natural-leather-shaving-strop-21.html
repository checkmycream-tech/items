    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>was very happy with my results.</li>
            <li>boyfriend says it works great!</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my brother, and he says it is a great product!</li>
            <li>Would be great if it wasn&#x27;t mailed all vented out of shape.</li>
            <li>The product was great.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>Again, good price</li>
            <li>Still good though.</li>
            <li>My guy loved it.</li>
            <li>this strop is just what I needed to keep those edges sharp...made well and is a good length...</li>
            <li>Otherwise the strop is good, leather is good, retaining clip is good.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer over here!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for sure!  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, you can also use cardboard, or cardboard covered with metal polish.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>This strop is actually really nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>The swivel attachment is a plus how ever I would have liked a longer one.</li>
            <li>but i was hoping for better.</li>
            <li>Go to your closet or to a thrift store and find a leather belt - any size (naturally, better quality recommended); it might cost you $5.</li>
            <li>so I was definitely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick on the day that was listed but leather strop could have been in alittle better shape.</li>
            <li>and i could feel a HUGE DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li>You have to break it in or doesn&#x27;t allow you to sharper well or smooth</li>
            <li>Good because its flat and easy to strop with.</li>
            <li>leather strop was clean, no knicks or scratches.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>overall was pleased with the way it worked!</li>
            <li>Great strop - hones my blades to a razor&#x27;s edge when combined with a little jeweler&#x27;s rouge.</li>
            <li>More than I expected and bettter than Strop&#x27;s I purchased for more money.</li>
            <li>Shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I was able to stretch it out and with some dressing, it started to lay flat.</li>
            <li>A real America - made razor strop.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>Obviously as a straight razor shaver one should probably just jump into investing in a really nice strop, but this seems to do the job until you can afford a better strop and at least this will allow you to get your x-pattern stropping down and at this price you dont have to worry about nicks as much.</li>
            <li>After reading the previous reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure if what I had just ordered&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Also the fabric strop had some small debris imbedded into it which im sure a straight razor blade would not like.</li>
            <li>Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This strop was brand new</li>
            <li>Overall it seems to work pretty darn well.</li>
            <li>I bought this saying in the description that it had a light leather strop and a black linen strop.</li>
            <li>Although it did have a light leather strop, it did NOT have a black linen strop.</li>
            <li>I just threw it away and still use my old one.....</li>
            <li>I hope that they can correct this in the near future.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller to see if it really was a black linen strop.</li>

            <li> Longer bladed razors and knives are harder to strop when they&#x27;re not a little thicker than this.</li>
            <li> I only give it four stars for personal preference of a little wider strop.</li>
            <li> Bonded Leather, simply not as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;While it won&#x27;t mess up your razor, it&#x27;s not going to sharpen it either</li>
            <li> It was just what i expected and&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rough part is on the inside</li>
            <li> A pathetic cheap imitation of a real strop.  </li>
            <li> i used waterstones, 220 grit, to 1200 grit, then 6000 grit, almost shaving with my katana and i stropped for less than a minute, and it already had a mirror edge, i ran my finger horizontally to the blade</li>
            <li> has a few high/low spots.</li>
            <li> Did not like the packing of the strop, I did not like it being rolled up, that caused a uneven surface.  </li>
            <li> this is not top dollar hide, but was doing the job of keeping the microscopic burrs down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> little on the small side</li>
            <li> Leather is very thick and stiff.</li>
            <li> Useless trash....</li>
            <li> the thought of it working the way it was suppose to was wrong.</li>
            <li> Bad because it was folded during shipping n</li>

            <li> Arrived quick on the day that was listed but leather strop could have been in alittle better shape. Also the fabric strop had some small debris imbedded into it which im sure a straight razor blade would not like. Again, good price but i was hoping for better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly fine. I only give it four stars for personal preference of a little wider strop. Longer bladed razors and knives are harder to strop when they&#x27;re not a little thicker than this. Still good though.</li>
            <li> After reading the previous reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure if what I had just ordered&lt;br /&gt;was actually going to be a said in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived, and I had opened it up, I was satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;The leather strop was clean, no knicks or scratches. However,&lt;br /&gt;the color of the leather was a bit darker than pictured. The second&lt;br /&gt;strop attached was indeed the cloth like material as described too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having no experience with strops, and just by going off of the reviews&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with my results. It was just what i expected and&lt;br /&gt;my boyfriend says it works great!</li>
            <li> Would be great if it wasn&#x27;t mailed all vented out of shape. You have to break it in or doesn&#x27;t allow you to sharper well or smooth</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a world class chef on youtube who contends that nobody needs to pay for one of these. Go to your closet or to a thrift store and find a leather belt - any size (naturally, better quality recommended); it might cost you $5. The underside will work just as well as any shaving strop. Just flatten it out on the counter and go to work. Do a search for &amp;#34;stropping your kitchen knives&amp;#34;. Amazingly, you can also use cardboard, or cardboard covered with metal polish.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;A little on the small side but it does what it is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and priced below it&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li> This strop was brand new so I was definitely satisfied with it. My guy loved it. Satisfied customer over here!</li>
            <li> Leather is very thick and stiff. Good because its flat and easy to strop with. Bad because it was folded during shipping n has a few high/low spots. Overall it seems to work pretty darn well.</li>
            <li> Garbage.  Useless trash....A pathetic cheap imitation of a real strop.  I just threw it away and still use my old one.....A real America - made razor strop.  They kinked the leather by rolling it up for shipping - ruined it.  There was no linen strop.  Caveat Emptor.</li>
            <li> Bonded Leather, simply not as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;While it won&#x27;t mess up your razor, it&#x27;s not going to sharpen it either</li>
            <li> No instructions at all. Which strop do you use? The rough part is on the inside so you have to hold it apart while stropping. Didn&#x27;t sharpen razor a bit.</li>
            <li> once received, I opened the box to find that this leather strop had been folded over three times. the thought of it working the way it was suppose to was wrong. I was able to stretch it out and with some dressing, it started to lay flat. this is not top dollar hide, but was doing the job of keeping the microscopic burrs down to a minimum. overall was pleased with the way it worked!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. i used waterstones, 220 grit, to 1200 grit, then 6000 grit, almost shaving with my katana and i stropped for less than a minute, and it already had a mirror edge, i ran my finger horizontally to the blade and i could feel a HUGE DIFFERENCE. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE WHEN RECEIVED.  I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.  I hope that they can correct this in the near future.</li>
            <li> Did not like the packing of the strop, I did not like it being rolled up, that caused a uneven surface.  Took a lot of time to flatten it out. Otherwise the strop is good, leather is good, retaining clip is good.</li>
            <li> This strop is actually really nice for the price.  I would recommend this for sure!  Now to see if they make razors......</li>
            <li> this strop is just what I needed to keep those edges sharp...made well and is a good length...fast delivery...pleased with this product...</li>
            <li> Obviously as a straight razor shaver one should probably just jump into investing in a really nice strop, but this seems to do the job until you can afford a better strop and at least this will allow you to get your x-pattern stropping down and at this price you dont have to worry about nicks as much.</li>
            <li> I bought this saying in the description that it had a light leather strop and a black linen strop. Although it did have a light leather strop, it did NOT have a black linen strop. I contacted the seller to see if it really was a black linen strop. Instead of replying back to me, the seller changed the description saying that its a &amp;#34;black faux leather.&amp;#34; What a shame.</li>
            <li> It is OK. The swivel attachment is a plus how ever I would have liked a longer one. I will not replace it.  It&#x27;s good enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my brother, and he says it is a great product! Shipped extremely fast! Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The product was great. Especially for the price. More than I expected and bettter than Strop&#x27;s I purchased for more money.</li>
            <li> Use it on my hunting knives, pocket knives. A great product.</li>
            <li> Great strop - hones my blades to a razor&#x27;s edge when combined with a little jeweler&#x27;s rouge.</li>
