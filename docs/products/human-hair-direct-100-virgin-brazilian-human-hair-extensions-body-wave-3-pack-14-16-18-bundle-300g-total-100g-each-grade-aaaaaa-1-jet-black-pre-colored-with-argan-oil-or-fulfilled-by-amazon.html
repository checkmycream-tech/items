            <li> Bought this exact weave a year ago, I remb I got 3 big bundles,omg reorder was suppose to order 2 but couldnt find 2 met black packs on prime so I order one and was very disappointed to see they reduced the packs significantly 14&amp;#34; 16&amp;#34; 18&amp;#34; each pack of inches barely had hair to hold in my hand. The texture of the hair is fabulous but if u have a big head like me u have to buy more than one pack. Disappointed in Hhd, boasted them so much about quality and weight of hair substancial to do ur hair and more. Well not any more.</li>
            <li> Love the hair once i cut it the ends was a little thin however i really like it no shedding at all</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy again hair is excellent and  of good quality was also enough for installation for a whole head. I absolutely love the hair thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she was impressed. GREAT quality, price and customer feedback! I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The hair is fake these other reviews a dam lie the hair has a hair store smell it cannot be dyed o tried v20 bleach it didnt take which means its fake i thought is was real until i went to a real professional he said they got me im upset this is coming from a mom that dont have money to waste i want&lt;br /&gt;Let the reviews trick me &amp;aacute;gain :-(</li>
            <li> Love my hair! And it takes a beaten and still looks nice! Lots of compliments! And it is a lot of hair in each bundle I had hair left over and my head is big! REAL TALK!</li>
            <li> I order this hair and it was suppose to jet black and it came in a 1b I jus waste my money...and the longer the length the thinner the hair gets</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase on amazon EVER !!! Never thought to buy hair online vs. the store but the prices were much more reasonable the quality was great &amp; there was much more hair than I thought it was gonna be..shipment came as schedule just in time for my last minute Miami trip I AM VERY SATISFIED !! Will be purchasing again soon :)</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORSE HAIR I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FOR MY DAUGHTER. I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS HAIR FOR DEAD PERSON! IT ONLY LASTED A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE IT TANGLED REALLY BAD. THIS HAIR IS FAKE BRAZILIAN HAIR. I SEE WHY IT WAS MARKED DOWN. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 2 FOR 10.00. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS HAIR UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO WASTE AND YOU ONLY NEED A ONE NIGHT ONLY HAIRDO!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying hair from Amazon / Human Hair Direct.  I purchased the hair on Thurs 03/12 and it arrived on Tues 03/18.  It was neatly packaged and all items in tact.  The hair looks and feels great and it did not have a smell.  Right now I&#x27;m liking it.  After I have it installed I will be able to tell if my like will become love.  So far I am happy with my purchase.  I will post an update after I have it installed...thx!</li>
            <li> The only thing is good about this company is that they send there hair when they say. But this company hair Is awful the hair has colored Strings all threw it the hair sheds bad plus they don&#x27;t contact you back on there product this is not really virgin hair at all don&#x27;t buy from them clearly a rip off</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this hair .it look good at first but like two weeks after it look n feel like plastic.its NOT 100% HUMAN HAIR . I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The hair is good, and I like it! However they didn&#x27;t send all three lenghts as they say. I received two 16&amp;#34; and one 14&amp;#34; there wasn&#x27;t NO 18&amp;#34; in package! The tracks are really hard to sew-into and my real hair is the same length as the hair purchased. May purchase more, but not sure because of the 3-bundles of Curly hair I purchased for my daughter who&#x27;s hair was POOR Quality IT MATTED IN TWO WEEKS! IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY! BUT THE BODY WAVEY WAS BETTER!</li>
            <li> The quality of this hair was so horrible. Definitely NOT 100% HUMAN washing it with extreme care it became so tangled and hard to manage. I only gave it 2 stars because it looked ok for the first day I got it installed. Waste of my money</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the shipping was quick; however I was disappointed that I mistakenly got the wrong color, I believe it was probably my fault and didn&#x27;t notice the color preference.</li>
            <li> I hated this hair because it was hard to manage...usually I can just finger comb it and go but NOT this bundle. I co-washed it before my install and it NEVER waved back up. It remained straight, it became very tangled and hard to comb. by the time I finished fighting w/ it I curled it. That was cute and it lasted but i don&#x27;t believe this is virgin hair. I had to do way too much to it just to make it look decent</li>
            <li> Pretty hair. But was disappointed. It had no deep wave. It was straight.</li>
            <li> Love the hair!!! Good price. Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every hair I can&#x27;t think of in the beauty supply stores, cheap hair, expensive hair you name it. So finally I said let me try online hair and u know what, I love it. My niece does hair so we are always experimenting with different types and this so far has been great, it got even better after I washed and blow dried it, so good that when I finally took it out two months later I gave it to my niece and she is now wearing it LOL.</li>
            <li> The hair has too many colorful foreign fibers. And after a week of hot tools the hair permanently smells burned. Tangles horribly. And loses its soft texture. It is not the worse hair I have ever had (due to its minimum shedding), but I will not be returning.</li>
            <li> Hair Was Terrible . It Smells Bad &amp; Has Terrible Shedding . It Frizzes Up And Is Not A Good Buy . Save Your Money . The Hair Is Not Worth It!!! B</li>
            <li> Omggg so I just orderd this hair less then 3 days ago and it came early super excited about that.. when I opened the package hair was packaged well and the hair feels so soft its beautiful.. so far I&#x27;m so happy and I was so nervous to buy on Amazon because... like I didn&#x27;t know if I could trust it but I would buy again I didn&#x27;t install it yet but I love it right now I totally recommend</li>
