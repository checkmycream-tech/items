            <li>I LOVE this thing!  </li>
            <li>i love this item works really good for my daughters hair</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, compact, great custom heat settings and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to be sure to thank you her for the kind note.</li>
            <li>This iron is very light, and has a easy nice grip...</li>
            <li>A better one will cost more money.</li>
            <li>(we ordered 3 more as gifts for her friends).  </li>
            <li>My best friend is the same way, so when she told me she had bought a wet/dry straightening iron</li>
            <li>I tried it with damp hair and made sure to use a leave in product for heat styling also.</li>
            <li>More people should have had a chance to try this product.   </li>
            <li>it was her favorite thing she got.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This better be returnable.</li>
            <li>Wife loves this and glad we got it...</li>
            <li>Sure did have a problem with tracking it though...</li>
            <li>Wonderful flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have to say it does a pretty good job if you use some sort of hair product of course.</li>
            <li>I will say the product came from a very nice seller who sent a personal card and nice note with my order.</li>
            <li>It is easy to heat up</li>
            <li>the product is not bad but could be better.</li>
            <li>Years ago, we have to spend more than $100 to purchase this kind of high quority hair straightner.  </li>
            <li>I said good-bye to my hair dryer and my curling iron (which I was using more as a straightener to calm the frizzies the hair dryer caused.)</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out when I got home that I heated it up and started in on my damp hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I love the way my hair feels straight out of the salon.  </li>
            <li>It heats up in about 30 seconds and it takes me a very short time to use and achieve good results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned other Conair products which were great</li>
            <li>It was fine at first...</li>
            <li>I bought it only about a month ago and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and very soft and I had no problems using this.  </li>
            <li>The only thing thats not so great is that when you straighten your hair you have to squeeze it so that it can straighten properly</li>
            <li>and  now it doesn&#x27;t get close to as hot as it did</li>
            <li>; She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>will update you folks once i tested it ;)</li>
            <li>so i had to find her a new one quickly, out of the 20+</li>
            <li>This item was pretty much as advertised and positively reviewed.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>My hair is usually pretty straight anyway</li>
            <li>It worked great though just as long as you want a 1 1/2 inch wide straightener.</li>
            <li>great to use with dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li>I look forward to getting my hair done professionally, so I can wear it down and have it actually look good!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really explain its features</li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t work like I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like my hair pin</li>
            <li>straight</li>
            <li>was reasonably priced</li>
            <li>but I do think it comes out better when it is wet</li>
            <li>but I like that REALLY sleek and shiny look</li>
            <li>the whole \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; aspect.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li>This product took 30 minutes and my hair isn&#x27;t straight</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>You might as well burn your money, because that will do as much to straighten your hair as this product does (i.e. nothing).</li>
            <li>This is so much better then my other conair straightener.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>my new travel parthner!</li>
            <li>Although I realize straightening your hair wet isn&#x27;t the best option it can&#x27;t be much worse than using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to work a little better than it does , for the price..</li>
            <li>(because my other straightener is only for dry hair), so I thought this would be great.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so straight, soft, and shinny.</li>
            <li>This straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to give you silky straight hair.</li>
            <li>That being said, once I dried out my hair with a blow dryer and used this product to straighten it, I was perfectly satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Not even Amazon&#x27;s normal &amp;#34;frustration-free&amp;#34; packaging.  </li>
            <li>She is able to get her hair VERY straight using either the dry or wet option.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shinny and it does not catch and pull my hair like some other irons have.  </li>
            <li>It works as good as some of the more expensive brands for much much less.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this flatiron after reading all the other reviews.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>other reviewer&#x27;s comments pretty much describe me too.  </li>
            <li>to be able to actually use this tool you have to squeeze the handle so tight.</li>
            <li>This item was received wrapped in a clear plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old</li>
            <li>Really want my money back.</li>
            <li>It takes far less time - plus I get far better results - if I blow dry and then straighten.</li>
            <li>but if it&#x27;s used everyday, it&#x27;s definitely not going to last you more than 6 months-</li>
            <li>When I first got this the wet setting did nothing</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to make my hair flat.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work any different than a normal straightener.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, it does only an okay job of straightening if my hair is damp or dry already, and it takes forever to dry your hair if it&#x27;s more than just a tad damp.</li>
            <li>Plus, it curves slightly, which means your hand naturally slips upwards, towards the HOT plates.</li>
            <li>It takes a very long time to get your hair decent and it doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li>I recommend the Remington Wet 2 Straight line, like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable in price to other straighteners, and I&#x27;m not dissatisfied with the product as a whole, I&#x27;ll keep using this one until it dies out on me, but don&#x27;t be fooled by</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d go to a smaller one a 1 inch, but I was quite surprised when the exact same one that I previously owned arrived.</li>
            <li>I just bought this straightener from Meijer yesterday after my old standard conair  straightener decided to suddenly stop working on me after 4-5 years of use.</li>
            <li>I have not yet tried this one with damp hair, but I cannot imagine it would be to different from using my old standard conair straightener on damp hair.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted this to work, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li>Really does not work well on wet or dry hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really, really wanted this to work, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Really does not work well on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair a little first</li>
            <li> I just need to push the plates really hard together and all it does is spray hot water all over my hands.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that it&#x27;s not completely ceramic, only ceramic coated.</li>
            <li> So I just started using it for a regular straightener on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually straighten your hair until the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I had to flat iron my hair once to dry it</li>
            <li> You have to be looking straight down into the little window to see</li>
            <li> It takes me longer to use this iron on my wet hair than blowdrying and using a regular straightener.</li>
            <li> The wet part is a gimmick--you can only use it at low temperatures wet</li>
            <li> there is not much difference between the heat settings 1-6, same heating ....</li>
            <li> Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex, 1 Inch]].</li>
            <li> If I shower in the morning, I have to blow dry my hair and then straighten it</li>
            <li> I have never tried a wet dry straightener and was intrigued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long this product says it&#x27;s suppose to last</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just concerned that I will fry my hair over time if I use it when wet.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try it wet, so I cannot comment on that.  </li>
            <li> It does not work on my towel-dried, wet hair.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this and other ones and since I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a Chi</li>
            <li> If the sections are small than this straightener pulls your hair and actually catches in your hair as you run it through.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why its so behind but thanks again</li>
            <li> The ends look coarse and not smooth even though I curled them under like I usually do.  </li>
            <li> I usually blow dry till damp then use it.  </li>

            <li> First of all when I used it on my wet hair, it started steaming really bad and the smell was horrible.</li>

            <li> I bought this so i can knock out two in one: straighten then curl my hair. I have to say it does a pretty good job if you use some sort of hair product of course. But it actually kept my hair curly until the next day. The only thing thats not so great is that when you straighten your hair you have to squeeze it so that it can straighten properly and when you squeeze it, it also pulls some hair. It sux but nothing i cant handle, for now.</li>
            <li> If I shower in the morning, I have to blow dry my hair and then straighten it (because my other straightener is only for dry hair), so I thought this would be great. Sadly, it does only an okay job of straightening if my hair is damp or dry already, and it takes forever to dry your hair if it&#x27;s more than just a tad damp. It takes far less time - plus I get far better results - if I blow dry and then straighten. I really, really wanted this to work, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I previously owned this straightener and it broke after a couple years so I thought I&#x27;d go to a smaller one a 1 inch, but I was quite surprised when the exact same one that I previously owned arrived. It is 1 1/2 inch, contrary to the items description. It worked great though just as long as you want a 1 1/2 inch wide straightener.</li>
            <li> i love this item works really good for my daughters hair</li>
            <li> I returned the iron because the curved handle was not comfortable for me. I&#x27;ve owned other Conair products which were great</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this. Just keep in mind that it&#x27;s not completely ceramic, only ceramic coated. A better one will cost more money.</li>
            <li> I now buy items from Amazon based upon the Customer Review Section and the status in the Bestselling List.  That&#x27;s how I picked this for my daughter and I have been a hero ever since (we ordered 3 more as gifts for her friends).  I can&#x27;t really explain its features but my daughter says \\&quot;OMG dad, this is sick!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this flatiron after reading all the other reviews. However, I found it to be really disappointing. It takes me longer to use this iron on my wet hair than blowdrying and using a regular straightener. My hair is often still wavy after ironing the same spot 4 or 5 times. It also catches and pulls on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am *terrible* when it comes to styling my own hair, which is why I usually wear it up.  I look forward to getting my hair done professionally, so I can wear it down and have it actually look good!  My best friend is the same way, so when she told me she had bought a wet/dry straightening iron and it had made her hair look incredible, I had to run and get one!  I bought this model and couldn&#x27;t believe the results!  It was like I had gone to the salon!  And unlike my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; straightening iron, this one didn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy.  I LOVE this thing!  Now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Years ago, we have to spend more than $100 to purchase this kind of high quority hair straightner.  This iron is very light, and has a easy nice grip...just amazing! Thank U~~~~</li>
            <li> This hair straightener has been something wonderful for my wife, she loved it at first use!!</li>
            <li> WORST STRAIGHTENER EVER!&lt;br /&gt;i bought this straigtener thinking i could take a shower than use it the next hour... NOPE . to be able to actually use this tool you have to squeeze the handle so tight. I do NOT suggest this tool to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, and slightly frizzy hair. I am always on the look out for quality straighteners at a low price. I owned the Conair CS26JCS wet/dry straightener for about 6 months until it stopped heating up. Up until that point, I loved the straightener. I&#x27;m not sure how long this product says it&#x27;s suppose to last but if it&#x27;s used everyday, it&#x27;s definitely not going to last you more than 6 months- not unless, you want to keep going over what you just straightened because it didn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t work like I hoped it would. Although I realize straightening your hair wet isn&#x27;t the best option it can&#x27;t be much worse than using a blow dryer. I tried it with damp hair and made sure to use a leave in product for heat styling also. It tends to pull on my hair pulling out some stray pieces which I didn&#x27;t like. I have a very expensive straightener from years ago that still works but I don&#x27;t really like my hair pin straight so I only tend to use it when I want waves or to straighten my hair from sleeping crazy. I will say the product came from a very nice seller who sent a personal card and nice note with my order. I feel bad it&#x27;s been a while since I received this and I wanted to be sure to thank you her for the kind note. Thank you Dottie!</li>
            <li> i stepped o the last one so i had to find her a new one quickly, out of the 20+ straighteners this girl has owned, you can tell she prefers this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Amazon stopped carrying this item.  I bought it only about a month ago and absolutely love it!  I said good-bye to my hair dryer and my curling iron (which I was using more as a straightener to calm the frizzies the hair dryer caused.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other reviewer&#x27;s comments pretty much describe me too.  More people should have had a chance to try this product.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was just now online to by \\&quot;a spare\\&quot; becx I was so happy with it.  Now I must go shopping elsewhere.  :-(</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old she loves it.She doesn&#x27;t even have to use a blow dryer anymore and it straightens faster than her straightener she already had.She loves it it is so esy to use it was reasonably priced it was her favorite thing she got.</li>
            <li> This item was pretty much as advertised and positively reviewed. I find it makes my unruly fizzy hair easier to manage here in Florida. I dry my hair a little first but I do think it comes out better when it is wet, I&#x27;m just concerned that I will fry my hair over time if I use it when wet. In my opinion, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> When I first got this the wet setting did nothing and it still doesn&#x27;t if I try it I just need to push the plates really hard together and all it does is spray hot water all over my hands. I got this about a year ago and I used it about 2 or 3 times a month and  now it doesn&#x27;t get close to as hot as it did</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  It is exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced.  I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst straightener I have ever used. First of all when I used it on my wet hair, it started steaming really bad and the smell was horrible. So I just started using it for a regular straightener on dry hair. Just the same. It pulls my hair out and it creases it. My hair smells burnt when I&#x27;m done and it takes me over 20 minutes. Never would recommend this a friend.</li>
            <li> The wet part is a gimmick--you can only use it at low temperatures wet and that isn&#x27;t enough to straighten. I had to flat iron my hair once to dry it (afterward my hair was Diana-Ross big) and then again to straighten it and take out SOME of the volume. It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to make my hair flat.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to work a little better than it does , for the price.. the product is not bad but could be better.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter with thick, wavy hair hair to get that &amp;#34;straight look&amp;#34; She absolutely loves it! She is able to get her hair VERY straight using either the dry or wet option. When this one wears out I will definitely replace it with ths same straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to give you silky straight hair. I recommend the Remington Wet 2 Straight line, like the [[ASIN:B009HKB152 Remington S7210 Wet 2 Straight Flat Iron with Soy Hydra Complex, 1 Inch]].</li>
            <li> needed in a pinch, daughters was on fritz, price no better than stores i found out, my bad..</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel. great to use with dry or wet hair. Beautiful colour&lt;br /&gt;Double voltage.&lt;br /&gt;Its my new travel parthner!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I love the way my hair feels straight out of the salon.  My hair is usually pretty straight anyway but I like that REALLY sleek and shiny look so I bought this.  I love it.  It heats up in about 30 seconds and it takes me a very short time to use and achieve good results.  It works as good as some of the more expensive brands for much much less.  My hair is fine and very soft and I had no problems using this.  I have yet to try it wet, so I cannot comment on that.  It flips, straightens and gives waves too.  There is no pulling either.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> It was fine at first... just used it a few times... but now it&#x27;s broken already!!! :( i didn&#x27;t drop it or anything it just won&#x27;t heat up anymore. :(</li>
            <li> I just bought this straightener from Meijer yesterday after my old standard conair  straightener decided to suddenly stop working on me after 4-5 years of use. I have never tried a wet dry straightener and was intrigued. It does not work on my towel-dried, wet hair. I have thick, wavy hair that can get downright curly at times. It made my hair damp and just as curly as when I started and was taking up a lot of time. That being said, once I dried out my hair with a blow dryer and used this product to straighten it, I was perfectly satisfied with the results. I have not yet tried this one with damp hair, but I cannot imagine it would be to different from using my old standard conair straightener on damp hair. It&#x27;s comparable in price to other straighteners, and I&#x27;m not dissatisfied with the product as a whole, I&#x27;ll keep using this one until it dies out on me, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the whole \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; aspect.    EDIT Do Not buy this product. It died on me after four months of use.</li>
            <li> I love it I don&#x27;t have any bad comments about it</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my stolen one.  I like it alot and it&#x27;s very easy to use. The one thing I would change about it would be the way you see the heat number setting. You have to be looking straight down into the little window to see</li>
            <li> got 2 of these, for me and my sister. I havent open mine but my sister loves it and she is using it everyday. It is easy to heat up so you have to be cautious. will update you folks once i tested it ;)</li>
            <li> This is the worst straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. It takes a very long time to get your hair decent and it doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job very well. My hair isn&#x27;t difficult to straighten, I have thin hair and it usually takes ten to fifteen minute to get it perfectly straight. This product took 30 minutes and my hair isn&#x27;t straight so I gave up. Really want my money back.</li>
            <li> Not as tight doesn&#x27;t work well for thick hair</li>
            <li> This is so much better then my other conair straightener. I love it, and it works great. Leaves my hair so straight, soft, and shinny.</li>
            <li> there is not much difference between the heat settings 1-6, same heating ....</li>
            <li> This was bought as a Christmas gift and it came in a plastic bag labeled &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; yet it was in NO packaging, dirty, and had an index card attached to it with some numbers. What a joke. This better be returnable.</li>
            <li> Not working as expected... :( I initially had a conair (i don&#x27;t remember the model number) that i gave it to my sister coz she loved it. I bought that over amazon too as a trial. So i wanted to try again and bought this. It doesn&#x27;t actually straighten your hair until the hair is dry. Although it kinda serves the purpose...its not the machine I had.</li>
            <li> This tool works great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful flat iron.  Heats quickly, compact, great custom heat settings and I love that I can use it on wet hair.  I usually blow dry till damp then use it.  My hair is smooth and shinny and it does not catch and pull my hair like some other irons have.  I&#x27;ve even used it to \\&quot;iron\\&quot; my daughters dress while on vacation :P</li>
            <li> Wife loves this and glad we got it... Sure did have a problem with tracking it though... I got it and the tracking says its still in transit? Not sure why its so behind but thanks again</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I have to for this product. Simply put, it does not work - at all. There is a small gap between the plates, so unless you squeeze it as hard as you can, it will not press down on your hair to straighten it. Plus, it curves slightly, which means your hand naturally slips upwards, towards the HOT plates. I cannot believe something so terrible made it through testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually a fan of the brand, I&#x27;ve always bought Conair hair dryers and they last forever. I figured, what could go wrong with a straightener made by them? The answer is \\&quot;everything\\&quot;. I&#x27;m only writing this so perhaps one person out there will be spared from wasting money on such a horrible, ineffective product. You might as well burn your money, because that will do as much to straighten your hair as this product does (i.e. nothing).</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this straightener I researched it.  I read the reviews for this and other ones and since I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a Chi I thought this seemed like a good deal.  Boy was I wrong.  I was so excited to try it out when I got home that I heated it up and started in on my damp hair.  My hair looks matted where I straightened it.  My curly hair is still wavy in places that I went over 5 or 6 times.  The ends look coarse and not smooth even though I curled them under like I usually do.  I tried everything, turning up the heat, taking bigger sections, taking smaller sections.  Nothing will work!  If the sections are small than this straightener pulls your hair and actually catches in your hair as you run it through.  I am so disappointed that it&#x27;s going back tomorrow!  Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li> This item was received wrapped in a clear plastic bag.  Not even Amazon&#x27;s normal &amp;#34;frustration-free&amp;#34; packaging.  No packaging.  And no instruction manual.  To say this is disappointing is an understatement.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Won&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any different than a normal straightener.  Really does not work well on wet or dry hair.</li>
    </ol>
