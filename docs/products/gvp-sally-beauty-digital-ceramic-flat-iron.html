            <li>Great straightener for the price!  </li>
            <li>The temp is adjustable, which is great, but best of all is automatic shut off function, which puts my mind at ease.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I bought this model.</li>
            <li>keep it cause the straightness it brings to your hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposedly dual-voltage (haven&#x27;t used it overseas yet), which will come in handy for travelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They recommended this product, i liked the price and the fact that I could control the temp setting.  </li>
            <li>ok this straightner is amazing but just not for my hair.</li>
            <li>are some things I love about this straightener:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I would even say they love it.</li>
            <li>My bangs never looked better.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and I still LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Ok  </li>
            <li>Love that you can control the temperature.</li>
            <li>My favorite one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, convenient plug</li>
            <li>I asked a lady who worked there which flat iron was the best</li>
            <li>This flat iron is Amazing!!!</li>
            <li>My best friend who is a beautician recommended this flat iron and I&#x27;m recommending them to you.&lt;br /&gt;CHI</li>
            <li>This flat iron is light, easy to hold, swivels and best of all-- works!</li>
            <li>The first day I used it I got so many complments!</li>
            <li>Easy to burn your fingers</li>
            <li>Gets hot fast and does a great job straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>Tip got VERY HOT!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s smooth and bumped just how I like it.</li>
            <li>It also came with a 2 year warranty and a free travel size iron.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I made the right decision</li>
            <li>I had originally bought the CHI, came home with it and tried it.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, smooth and does what you need! :)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t pull on my hair and did make my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel nice and soft</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the features, adjustable auto shut off/temperature control...if you want the same or better results of a CHI</li>
            <li>Because I am nervous about damaging my hair, I want to be able to monitor just how high the heat is.</li>
            <li>No one has worse hair than me and this iron works wonderfully, plus you can curl or flip the ends to add body to your hair if you feel like it.</li>
            <li>so I finally bought my own.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about get my money&#x27;s worth on a generic version but to my surprise,I love it!</li>
            <li>The iron turns on to the last temperature used (opposed to it always turning on to a standard pre-set) which is great.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for someone and they like it very much.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t snag, the plates fit together snug without much pressure, and the outside doesn&#x27;t get super hot that you would need a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They told me this model is the generic version and has all the features of Chi at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Anyways it works amazingly because it left my hair very straight (am african).</li>
            <li>Holding one in each hand, the new digital is much lighter (which is great for styling), but I tend to be rough on them (drop, toss in boxes, bags, etc.)</li>
            <li>I was nervous to try a flat iron because my hair is highlighted and easily breaks.</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes my banes really straight.   </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>They were shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>When i used it on my hair, it left my hair smelling burnt like some cheap straightners do.</li>
            <li>They do other womens hair and now many of them even pay her so that she can use thiss product.</li>
            <li>I usually blow it using round and vent brushes and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>and I have to hold the handle up near the blue light</li>
            <li>I was using it on 350 degrees with the treseme heat protectant on freshly washed/ deep conditioned hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim design makes it easy to manipulate and the digital temperature display is my safety net.</li>
            <li>It has dual ceramic heaters and easily slides down my hair.</li>
            <li>Granted in 7 years they may have come up with a new lighter material, but it makes me nervous that it may not be as durable.</li>
            <li>I went to a new hair salon  for my bangs to be cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been 5 years of owning this same flat iron and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>However, the heat setting was too hot for me...and it only had one setting.</li>
            <li>This flat iron makes my hair really straight!  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe flat irons are selling for more than 3 times the price I paid for the GVP Digital Ceramic Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you what a good feeling it is to be able to have your hair the way you want it without being a victim to humidity or bad hair days.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and looks shiny after each use.</li>
            <li>The packaging explains the ceramic plates \\&quot;generate Far Infaread Heat to straighten hair from the inside out\\&quot;, It has a temperature range from 160 to 450 degrees F.</li>
            <li>I admit, I did not expect much from this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>So I had to get a flat iron because I was never more pleased with the way my bangs looked or behaved.</li>
            <li>I will be going back to buying a new Jibere de Paris straightner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the closest thing I have have had had a professional flat iron.</li>
            <li>have pretty easy hair - shoulder length, thin (but a lot of it), slight wave.</li>
            <li>only negative is that the iron has much thinner plastic (body) than my old one.</li>

            <li> only negative is that the iron has much thinner plastic (body) than my old one.</li>
            <li> I had the same pink GVP ceramic (non-digital) flat iron for nearly 7 years.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this flat iron if you&#x27;re looking to save some</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store.  </li>
            <li> She told me that they sell several of these flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I choose the GVP Digital Ceramic Flat Iron, because it goes to 450 Degrees</li>
            <li> I later learned she used a 1 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li> They suggested the GVP Digital  Ceramic Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I never used a flat iron before.</li>
            <li> so it almost feels like a miracle, i&#x27;m wondering why I haven&#x27;t been purchased this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I do not use a flat iron, but I got it for my wife</li>
            <li> flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I would say if you try this flat iron</li>
            <li> my sister/roomate has this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was a long time fan of CHI and thought that was the only flat iron that could get my curly thick hair straight enough.  </li>
            <li> After my last move, it got a decent crack that I was afraid would snag my hair or spark because it was right along the plate.</li>
            <li> Bought this product 4 years ago, it broke after that long</li>
            <li> The handle is too long</li>
            <li> I had the pink GVP iron before, non digital.  </li>
            <li> I have also used CHI and other big salon brands</li>
            <li> The hairdresser cut my dry bangs and then swiped them with a wand-like appliance.</li>
            <li> They did warn me to use on dry hair.</li>
            <li> so I went down to my local Sally Beauty and asked if they had anything comparable.  </li>
            <li> My previous Jibere straightner never left that burnt smell on my hair.</li>
            <li> I air dry at night and either straightener my hair or curl a few pieces with the flat iron to accentuate my waves.</li>
            <li> and I  thought my GVP worked the same, if not better at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair, and this straightener majorly cuts down my straightening</li>
            <li> My hair is really hard to straighten, especially my banes.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday, if not every other day.</li>
            <li> Cut doing my hair in half.</li>
            <li> All for less than half the price of my previous CHI irons.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year</li>
            <li> I have really bad luck with flat irons lasting me a long time, so I purchased the warranty.  </li>
            <li> But a little heavy and cumbersome..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how my hair would be if I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> The summer humidity did not have it&#x27;s way and make my bangs spring up in its usual curl.</li>
            <li> Not sure??</li>
            <li> I have very thin, short hair</li>
            <li> First of all, i absolutely hate straighteners that have that lingering burning smell to them.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to do.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick</li>
            <li> After going through 2 CHI flat irons in a little over a year I was disgusted by their lack of warranty to back up their costly irons</li>
            <li> I mean it was</li>
            <li> I also have really bad luck with flat irons straighening my hair.  </li>
            <li> and she got tired of me</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one does.</li>

            <li> Gets hot fast and does a great job straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> This iron smooths out my hair without flattening it.  No one has worse hair than me and this iron works wonderfully, plus you can curl or flip the ends to add body to your hair if you feel like it.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought the CHI, came home with it and tried it. It didn&#x27;t pull on my hair and did make my hair feel nice and soft. However, the heat setting was too hot for me...and it only had one setting. I have very thin, short hair so it felt like it was frying my hair. I can&#x27;t imagine how my hair would be if I used it everyday. So I returned it and decided to try the generic version from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply that a friend told me about. When I got to Sally&#x27;s, I saw that they had an adjustable, digital version. I was really nervous about get my money&#x27;s worth on a generic version but to my surprise,I love it! It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair and the adjustable setting was perfect for me! It made my hair feel nice and soft and I didn&#x27;t have to spend an arm and a leg on it. I would definitely recommend this flat iron if you&#x27;re looking to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been 5 years of owning this same flat iron and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use this everyday, if not every other day. I have had ZERO problems with this! I am still very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Sally Beauty supply. A representative told me it&#x27;s one of their best-selling straighteners, so I decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some things I love about this straightener:&lt;br /&gt;1. Sometimes when I&#x27;m in a hurry to get out the door, I forget to turn off my straightener. The fact that this has an auto-shutoff feature puts me at ease so I won&#x27;t accidentally burn my house down!&lt;br /&gt;2. There are a bazillion temperature settings for every hair type and it remembers your temperature setting from the last time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s supposedly dual-voltage (haven&#x27;t used it overseas yet), which will come in handy for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have thick, wavy hair, and this straightener majorly cuts down my straightening time!&lt;br /&gt;5. The price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: For one reason or another it stopped turning on during the winter (maybe because I dropped it). Shipped it back to Sally and they sent me a gift card in the mail!</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store.  I asked a lady who worked there which flat iron was the best and she said the GVP.  She told me that they sell several of these flat irons.  I choose the GVP Digital Ceramic Flat Iron, because it goes to 450 Degrees and it&#x27;s digital!!  I was nervous about purchasing a generic product, but the lady said that if I did not like it, just to bring it back in 30 days for a refund or replacement.  Also, Sally&#x27;s offered a 2 year warranty for only $9.00.  I have really bad luck with flat irons lasting me a long time, so I purchased the warranty.  I also have really bad luck with flat irons straighening my hair.  I have wavy, curly, frizzy hair.  I admit, I did not expect much from this flat iron.  This flat iron makes my hair really straight!  It looks like I just got back from the salon.  My hair is really hard to straighten, especially my banes.  This makes my banes really straight.   I would buy this product again.  I STRONGLY recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and they like it very much. I would even say they love it. They do other womens hair and now many of them even pay her so that she can use thiss product. I would say this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I had the same pink GVP ceramic (non-digital) flat iron for nearly 7 years. After my last move, it got a decent crack that I was afraid would snag my hair or spark because it was right along the plate. I upgraded to the digital with the auto-shut off for safety. The iron turns on to the last temperature used (opposed to it always turning on to a standard pre-set) which is great. It looks like you can adjust the auto-shut off with the mode key, but it doesn&#x27;t program it in; once you turn it off, it re-sets to 60 at the next power on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty easy hair - shoulder length, thin (but a lot of it), slight wave. I air dry at night and either straightener my hair or curl a few pieces with the flat iron to accentuate my waves. I think it both straightens and curls very well at the same level as my old GVP, which I have used on friends with thick curly hair. I have also used CHI and other big salon brands and I  thought my GVP worked the same, if not better at a fraction of the cost. This doesn&#x27;t snag, the plates fit together snug without much pressure, and the outside doesn&#x27;t get super hot that you would need a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is that the iron has much thinner plastic (body) than my old one. Granted in 7 years they may have come up with a new lighter material, but it makes me nervous that it may not be as durable. Holding one in each hand, the new digital is much lighter (which is great for styling), but I tend to be rough on them (drop, toss in boxes, bags, etc.) so we will see.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is light, easy to hold, swivels and best of all-- works! My hair feels soft and looks shiny after each use. The temp is adjustable, which is great, but best of all is automatic shut off function, which puts my mind at ease. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must for my wife.  She straighens her hair every day and it does everything it says it does.  Great price and great item (according to wife). Cheers!</li>
            <li> I never used a flat iron before. I was nervous to try a flat iron because my hair is highlighted and easily breaks. My hair is thinning and frizzy. I usually blow it using round and vent brushes and hope for the best. I went to a new hair salon  for my bangs to be cut. The hairdresser cut my dry bangs and then swiped them with a wand-like appliance. I later learned she used a 1 inch flat iron. My bangs never looked better. They were shiny and straight. The summer humidity did not have it&#x27;s way and make my bangs spring up in its usual curl. Instead, my bangs stayed perfect until I washed my hair. So I had to get a flat iron because I was never more pleased with the way my bangs looked or behaved. I heard good things about Chi and went to Sally Beauty Supply for their help. They suggested the GVP Digital  Ceramic Flat Iron.  They told me this model is the generic version and has all the features of Chi at a much more reasonable price. They did warn me to use on dry hair. What sold me on this model is the temperature is digitally displayed. Because I am nervous about damaging my hair, I want to be able to monitor just how high the heat is. The digital readout allows for just that. I cannot tell you what a good feeling it is to be able to have your hair the way you want it without being a victim to humidity or bad hair days.  I bought this at a great price.  I cannot believe flat irons are selling for more than 3 times the price I paid for the GVP Digital Ceramic Flat Iron. I&#x27;m very glad I bought this model. It heats up quickly. It has a 60 minute shut off timer. It has dual ceramic heaters and easily slides down my hair. The packaging explains the ceramic plates \\&quot;generate Far Infaread Heat to straighten hair from the inside out\\&quot;, It has a temperature range from 160 to 450 degrees F. It has a 9 foot cord. It&#x27;s slim design makes it easy to manipulate and the digital temperature display is my safety net.</li>
            <li> I had heard of this on one of of the morning shows and thought why not. I have always wanted a CHI, but just can&#x27;t afford it. I got this as a gift and I absolutely LOVE it. It&#x27;s the closest thing I have have had had a professional flat iron. The first day I used it I got so many complments! Great product!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is Amazing!!! Cut doing my hair in half. No need to go over the same strip of hair 2 or 3 times burning and trying to straighten. My hair is thick so it almost feels like a miracle, i&#x27;m wondering why I haven&#x27;t been purchased this flat iron. One try and it&#x27;s smooth and bumped just how I like it. Love the features, adjustable auto shut off/temperature control...if you want the same or better results of a CHI this is it at a fraction of the cost. My best friend who is a beautician recommended this flat iron and I&#x27;m recommending them to you.&lt;br /&gt;CHI who?</li>
            <li> This is the best straightening product I have ever used.  I was a long time fan of CHI and thought that was the only flat iron that could get my curly thick hair straight enough.  After going through 2 CHI flat irons in a little over a year I was disgusted by their lack of warranty to back up their costly irons so I went down to my local Sally Beauty and asked if they had anything comparable.  They recommended this product, i liked the price and the fact that I could control the temp setting.  I have been using this product for a little over a year and I still LOVE it.  It also came with a 2 year warranty and a free travel size iron.  All for less than half the price of my previous CHI irons.  This is a must have product, I will never buy another brand again.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this flat iron. It is awesome and what a great price!!</li>
            <li> Easy to burn your fingers</li>
            <li> I do not use a flat iron, but I got it for my wife and she just loves it.  Actually the second one I bought for her.</li>
            <li> ok this straightner is amazing but just not for my hair. First of all, i absolutely hate straighteners that have that lingering burning smell to them. Unfortunately this one does. When i used it on my hair, it left my hair smelling burnt like some cheap straightners do. My previous Jibere straightner never left that burnt smell on my hair. I was using it on 350 degrees with the treseme heat protectant on freshly washed/ deep conditioned hair like i always do when i flat iron my hair. Anyways it works amazingly because it left my hair very straight (am african). As am writing this, i have shipped it back to sally&#x27;s. Anyways its not that it cant do the job, i just cant stand the smell it leaves on my hair. I will be going back to buying a new Jibere de Paris straightner so i dont have to deal with any of that smell. I would say if you try this flat iron and you dont have the smell problem, keep it cause the straightness it brings to your hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Model for a while and is really for heavy duty use. The smarter choice ever!</li>
            <li> Not for me! I mean it was Ok  But a little heavy and cumbersome.. Tip got VERY HOT! I didn&#x27;t like that at all!  So I returned it feeling possibly mine was defective? Not sure??</li>
            <li> Bought this product 4 years ago, it broke after that long and I bought this one just now and its just as awesome! Leaves hair soft, smooth and does what you need! :)</li>
            <li> my sister/roomate has this flat iron. It works great and she got tired of me borrowing hers so I finally bought my own. Love that you can control the temperature. Also does a great job curling my hair.</li>
            <li> The handle is too long and I have to hold the handle up near the blue light and it is hard to do.  Wish I could return it.  Can I?</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for the granddaughter. She like it so I like it. This is a great price.</li>
            <li> Great straightener for the price!  My favorite one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, convenient plug so you can plug in with a blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I had the pink GVP iron before, non digital.  It lasted 6 years and I was devastated when it broke.  I was going to buy a chi but decided on another gvp and I&#x27;m glad I made the right decision</li>
            <li> I gave as a christmas gift.  Person loved it.  It was recommended by my wife who was a beauty specialist.</li>
