            <li>It&#x27;s relaxing and a great method for de-stressing or just getting out of your own mind for a moment.</li>

            <li>Really good quality product for the price.  </li>
            <li>These looked and sounded good on reviews</li>
            <li>My daughter loved these brushes.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I made a good investment with buying these brushes.</li>
            <li>For all of us who like to do our own make up, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>and I loved the price.</li>
            <li>The wife loved this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Never had good quality brushes, because I couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good buy..</li>
            <li>and it did smell chemical but a good wash took care of that, and it looks well made.  </li>
            <li>the one good thing I can say is the bag is good for traveling --</li>
            <li>Good brushes for the Mrs.</li>
            <li>These brushes look  good quality.  </li>
            <li>I bought them as they seemed fair quality for the price, I was a bit scared about the complaints of the smell.</li>
            <li>Works really good with my make up.</li>
            <li>I know some people said theirs was good</li>
            <li>I really liked these they look great,</li>
            <li>These were a really good deal.</li>

            <li>so once they come out they are gone for good.</li>
            <li>The bristles on these brushes appear to be glued in fairly well, again for 25 dollars you shouldn&#x27;t complain you are not getting M.A.C. brushes nor are you getting Dior.</li>
            <li>the cost is cheap and the quality is great!!!</li>
            <li>I guess for the price they are good.</li>

            <li>Good for teenager but not woman who needs reliable application.</li>
            <li>This was a good purchase I believe.</li>
            <li>Brushes are good for the price.</li>

            <li>I travel a lot and the fact that this set comes with its&#x27; own pouch that rolls up and fits in my suit case without taking up a lot of room really made it an excellent purchase.</li>

            <li>I purchased these brushes for my wife and she was thrilled with them.</li>
            <li>I LIKED THE STYLE BAG THAT CAME WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>BUT IT HAD SOME KIND OF SMELL THAT WONT GO AWAY.</li>
            <li>I loved the packaging as well, came in a cute box with it&#x27;s own brush holder.</li>
            <li>The pouch is a nice touch adds elegance.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush set for beginners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie and these brushes are a nice introduction into the make up world.</li>
            <li>she seems to like the brushes and had no problems with them, she liked that they held up with out the brushes falling out.</li>
            <li>These brushes are nice for what they are.</li>
            <li>These are nice, quality brushes.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend loved it :3</li>
            <li>Brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are nice.</li>
            <li>Really liked the variety they have in this set.  </li>
            <li>and when I had to do my own bridal make-up.</li>
            <li>its a nice starter kit but</li>
            <li>The brushes come in this nice roll out case.</li>
            <li>and they hold up nicely.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s loving them and the leather carrying case.</li>
            <li>Kind of funky but not unbearable.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it two stars vs. 1 star is because the eyeshadow applicators and eyebrow brush are quite handy.  </li>
            <li>Nice case too.</li>
            <li>Around the time of purchasing these I also purchased SHANYs pro-signature kit for $40 and those are significantly better brushes in every way superior to these.</li>
            <li>Nice value for the money.</li>
            <li>Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy good quality brushes.. even target has better brushes than these.</li>
            <li>Heard nothing but good things from this product, &amp; from make up artists :)</li>
            <li>This is going to be perfect for my daughter who wants to practice makeup.</li>
            <li>I kind of pretended like I wasn&#x27;t home</li>
            <li>Honestly I was unsure about buying this product</li>

            <li>Thank you and have a nice day.</li>
            <li>And the ONE thing that I absolutely loved the MOST was the fact that it came with a booklet describing each brush and its uses.</li>
            <li>Everything was in place and the brushes were nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice you can keep your brushes all organized together.</li>
            <li>and its nice to have a pouch to put them all in too</li>
            <li>Each brush also came with a plastic cover for the brush bit at the end, they were really nice plastic covers</li>
            <li>so i keep on them when I&#x27;m not using the brushes to help them keep their form and stay nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think they existed until I found these brushes.</li>
            <li>The roll up case that came with the brushes is nice and helps to keep them together.</li>
            <li>It you looking for affordable yet effective, elf brushes are the way to go.</li>
            <li>This is a handy brush set for all your needs.</li>
            <li>The bag was in nice condition.  </li>
            <li>its nice and</li>
            <li>The pouch was nice but would have been nicer without the straps</li>
            <li>The brushes felt nice but not for me.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really help me achieve a flawless makeup look.</li>
            <li>The box it all came in was really nice too.</li>
            <li>and I am sure they will be loved.</li>
            <li>Nice set.</li>
            <li>they all come in a handy organizer case, too.</li>

            <li>The case they come in is nice and the brushes are sturdy.</li>
            <li>They are a nice set of brushes.  </li>

            <li>Brush material is very good, in the face to use no uncomfortable feeling, often use, can be uniformly coated on cosmetics, very good, outside of the bag is also very good.</li>
            <li>I am so excited and happy</li>
            <li>i am very happy with the brush set and the carrying case is small and just perfect!</li>

            <li>They work perfectly, and there SOO soft.</li>
            <li>As far as price, I dont even have to say anything about that, its perfect for what I got.</li>
            <li>A nice variety of brushes but the quality is just okay.  </li>
            <li>The brushes came really fast and are wonderful quality and they fit in a nice case.</li>
            <li>Then paint circles on your hand as you rinse wish warm water so make sure each hair gets the shampoo off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was nicely packaged but the pouch smelled of paint, I&#x27;m sure that will go away.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing quality love the traveling case it comes with</li>
            <li>amazing i love the softness of these brushes.</li>

            <li>The price was good and they are smooth.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft... but not the best.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and also the the leather pouch is the best.</li>
            <li>This set is nice and I love the traveling case it comes in</li>
            <li>I would have liked to seen more blending brushes in the set.</li>
            <li>For the money they are worth buying once a year because they hold up great for a while.</li>
            <li>Nice set of brushes with case, washed it too. :)</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and come in a lovely case.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and perfect!!!</li>
            <li>the packaging and handling are so nice too, its really safe and</li>
            <li>They are soft and a perfect quality for it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The most amazing brushes i ever used.</li>
            <li>They look nice, but the brush sheds, there are two brushes that are ok..</li>
            <li>I am just so pleased with what I got, and for how inexpensive these brushes are, it&#x27;s an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great beginners set of brushes for a teenager to have fun with.</li>
            <li>I love the case that the brushes come in and the brushes themselves are nice.</li>
            <li>The brushes were all soft and packaged perfect.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re so good, yet so cheap.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for cheap but good brushes get them from ELF.  </li>
            <li>Both are great and well worth looking into.</li>
            <li>They are better then drug store brushes, but not as nice as my Mac brushes.</li>
            <li>They are soft &amp; the pouch they came in is perfect to use on the go!</li>
            <li>Brushes are nice - comparable to MAC brushes and come it a cute and convenient carrying case.</li>
            <li>I think I liked the pouch more than the brushes themselves</li>
            <li>just going to add my support for what is a really nice product, &amp; I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
            <li>The best I ever had so far.</li>
            <li>I feel like the powder brushes are a bit too soft sometimes for getting all of the product around my face but for what they are, this is an awesome deal.</li>
            <li>I chose this cosmetic brus set that is comfortable and have good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are some brushes, like 3, 11 and 12, that I have never used because I don&#x27;t use liquid eye liner, already had a brow brush I liked better, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case is nice for keeping the brushes neat and the color is cute.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the variety, the handy pouch, and I love the colour.</li>
            <li>Great brush for a good price, live the texture soft and works perfectly blended the make n eye shadow LUV it</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really bother me though since the rest of the brushes were awesome and the brow brush can be easily replaced.</li>
            <li>I was more than excited!!</li>
            <li>For people learning to do their makeup or are overwhelmed with the number of brushes, the set comes with an instruction sheet and all the brushes are numbered, so it&#x27;s an easy reference guide!</li>
            <li>and they store away easily!  </li>
            <li>The pouch makes them easy to store and keeps any dust or unwanted particles away!</li>
            <li>Easily compact too!</li>
            <li>And many of the best ones are nearly forty!  </li>
            <li>These brushes are strong and I would recommend this for everyone!</li>
            <li>So, I guess its worth buying if you love applying makeup!!</li>
            <li>the brushes dont shed, they are soft and i love it!!!</li>
            <li>These are soft brushes that blend very nicely!</li>
            <li>I am really picky about my beauty supplies, and let me just say these gorgeous brushes way exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Would recommend for the great price, and the quality -- have not had a brush be damaged yet, just make sure you wash them first!</li>
            <li>These are completely gorgeous brushes and by FAR the most beautiful $13 brushes you will ever see.</li>
            <li>Very good price, however, these brushes aren&#x27;t high quality if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>The product is very good, with high quality and surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>Of course I would have liked to have a case that zipped instead of tied, but for a person who is just starting to play around with makeup, this is great!    </li>
            <li>I did my homework on many makeup brushes and these by far are awesome.</li>
            <li>Probably not the most professional set, but for my purposes it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>However they don&#x27;t leave my hair as sleek and frizz free as I like, but again for the price they are an extremely good value:)</li>
            <li>However.. I was impressed with the time I received my purchase and the nice red pouch that the brushes came in...</li>
            <li>They are super easy to clean and feel good when you are using them!!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, good quality materials and a great variety.  </li>
            <li>My wife said that she was really happy to get these amazing real animal bristles in a set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I love mine, but it would&#x27;ve been nice to be able to pick out what color of handles and roll up bag you want.  </li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t mind not getting such great quality with a great price then do buy.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and the brushes are giving a clean finish...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m loving these brushes more and more all the time.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great deal, and also is great if you&#x27;re just starting out in the makeup world.</li>
            <li>The set comes in a great case to keep them all organized and I am really happy with this purchase - would order a second set as a gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are my favorite and it makes eyeshadow applications very easy.</li>
            <li>The package is cute, however it smelled very strongly when I opened it....</li>
            <li>Great product, packaged well and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>i love it too much very useful and good quality material .</li>
            <li>This was my first step to buying a brush set, but I heard great reviews and decided to try it out...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with them, and would recommend these to family and friends.</li>
            <li>everything went smoothly and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for and they look truly great.</li>
            <li>The set arrived in a timely manner and the brushes looked exactly as shown which was great.</li>
            <li>it is so cute red is the best the brush set apply nice</li>
            <li>They look great and are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I bought these as my first set and thought they were great</li>
            <li>I also would have preferred a \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; face brush or two that would be more suitable for liquid foundation and contouring.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase and received exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars because it does exactly what I wanted at a great value.</li>
            <li>&quot; Overall, it was a fair price for a fair brush set, but it would improve galaxies if the Shany people included a good blending brush in their sets.</li>
            <li>is very practical and good presentation, good quality and is appropriate to the publication and price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these for people on a budget who need good brushes that come with a sweet roll-up case for them.</li>
            <li>so cool loved it .</li>
            <li>the most important thing here is that brushes are beautiful and useful, thanks and good luck in your shopping!....</li>
            <li>But it still works perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>These are high quality cheap brushes that work wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I do know that brushes are VERY important for the process of applying make-up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very comfortable on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>they felt like feathers, the brushes did not shatter on my face, and it was very light weight.</li>
            <li>I thought they were very cheap in quality.</li>
            <li>The two tone brushes pictured are not two-toned and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>it doesnt clump the makeup it applys very smoothly</li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>This Shany professional cosmetic set is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Amazing brushes, make-up application is so easy with these tools.</li>
            <li>They were everything I needed for my makeup kit, with my sisters always stealing them I always stock up and this was just a easy cheep kit that was amazing.</li>
            <li>However, the blush brush was pretty much amazing, as it did a really good  job concentrating the blush on the apples of the cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed these and they&#x27;re great as a first set of brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i strongly recommend buying these amazing brushes</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know why this product is getting so many great reviews, they&#x27;re really misleading!</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and organized and it&#x27;s easy to keep them that way with the pouch they came in.</li>
            <li>The set is pretty and I have not used all of the brushes yet, but from what I have used, I have found to be very nice.  </li>
            <li>Very nice brush set if you are in a bind or if purchasing makeup brushes for first time.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for some new brushes and these seemed like the perfect fit.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and everything was wrapped perfect so my products would not come</li>
            <li>Maybe I was just lucky to get a good set, but I am quite satisfied with what I got.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow brush is very cheap but it does an okay job.</li>
            <li>A large selection at a great price.</li>
            <li>, i wasn&#x27;t really happy with the blush and powder brush the hairs come out really easy, if your looking for professional brushes i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush set is better to pay more and get a good product and not regret it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and very good quality.</li>
            <li>much better price than others I looked to buy and quality seems very good so far.  </li>
            <li>Nice brushes for a very good deal, ordered them last year</li>
            <li>This item was delivered exactly as promised at a very reasonable price and made for a wonderful holiday gift idea!</li>
            <li>The brushes are amazing, I&#x27;ve used them some times already and are great and soft.</li>
            <li>This actually isn&#x27;t a huge problem for me though, because now it&#x27;s travel sized!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Not only are you getting some really good brushes but you get them at a great price.</li>
            <li>Everyone has a routine they follow and favorite eyeshadows, lipsticks, and mascaras they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the holder.</li>
            <li>:)</li>

            <li>I can tell that there aren&#x27;t as many hairs in each brush</li>
            <li>For the price, these are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Based off the reviews, I thought that this purchase would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>These brushes are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not MAC, but they&#x27;re the next best thing.</li>

            <li>Love my brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my fault for expecting slightly better quality than the synthetic bristles that make up some of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>The case is what I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>and I was in love with the case it comes in.</li>
            <li>(Y) :}</li>
            <li>Much better and have never shed on me.</li>
            <li>Love the quality of the brush holder and Brushes..</li>
            <li>I will defiantly be buying more from this wondeful company.</li>
            <li>Nevermind the fact that the bag is cheap-looking and has an overwhelming chemical smell, because I could air that out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, I got them cleaned and figured they&#x27;d be okay.  </li>
            <li>This set is okay</li>
            <li>but I have bought better brushes at the drug store.</li>
            <li>The brushes are ok...</li>
            <li>I love how they just glide on my skin when applying my beauty products.</li>
            <li>These are good brushes that are easy to wash to clean, without losing most of their bristles as soon as you use or wash them.</li>
            <li>love the pouch it comes in too.</li>
            <li>came faster than i thought also:)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>Obviously these are not the fanciest or best made brushes out there, but that&#x27;s why they are so affordable.</li>
            <li>I truly love them.  </li>
            <li>These make up brushes are ok</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I been researching many brushes so I can start my makeup collection.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t hesitate and purchase the set if you have been looking for brushes :)</li>

            <li>overall it was about $20 very good price!</li>
            <li>Yay! :)</li>
            <li>rather use a more stuck together brush.</li>
            <li>Love the color scheme and the carrying case.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m really excited about is that it comes with a cute case which helps me keep the brushes in one place!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes are not as good as others but they are worth the $13</li>
            <li>I was wanting a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li>thats ok too.</li>
            <li>im in love with them.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use all of them yet, but I love shadow brush.  </li>
            <li>I loved the price and it was worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll feel famous applying powder or getting clumps out of mascara.</li>
            <li>There are many brushes for all sorts of makeup uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off using my elf powder blush.</li>
            <li>luck with these if you are buying them. :)</li>
            <li>but there are better brush sets out</li>
            <li>-The eye brushes held up well through many washings and applications&lt;</li>
            <li>There is a power brush, blush brush, fan brush, lip brush, and many eye brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the colour and the variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>Glad I got  them,</li>
            <li>Glad I got them.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy though!</li>
            <li>Love they way they work with makeup and would buy again.  </li>
            <li>I will order more of there product in the furture</li>
            <li>so I guess it a okay product</li>
            <li>BUT you NEED to make sure you wash these before you use them.</li>
            <li>they are so cute thinking of re ordering</li>
            <li>i want to try more of Shany products.</li>
            <li>Again, you cannot get a better set for the money.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the handles and the storage case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in LOVE with them</li>
            <li>The product works but the material that it was made could be better.</li>
            <li>For the price its ok</li>
            <li>I love tem</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li>i think i prefer elf brushes over these though, but those cost a bit more.</li>
            <li>What better deal can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Give these brushes a try to see for yourself! :)</li>
            <li>The brushes are ok.</li>
            <li>I am sure she will like it.</li>
            <li>I bought better brushes at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>and i love them and still use them.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Probably buy another set as a gift for someone that I think would love them also</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I will be buying better quality set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Can never have too many.  </li>
            <li>They came in a cute leather pouch.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>The studio brushes are excellent quality at a low price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the case.</li>

            <li>But I have bought drug-store brushes that I feel are better quality than these are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give them 5 stars because they have lived through many applications and disinfecting and haven&#x27;t fallen apart.</li>

            <li>I was pleased after purchasing this set.</li>
            <li>More than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>china requires products to be tested on animals how can i be sure of this ?</li>
            <li>I love the packaging, the variety of brushes and the brush quality.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend buying these, they&#x27;re cheap in price &amp; they&#x27;re even cheaper in quality!</li>
            <li>but im sure i will..</li>
            <li>im glad i got it</li>
            <li>These brushes are better than others I&#x27;ve paid a LOT more for.</li>
            <li>I love the blush brush</li>
            <li>I love the pouch it comes in aswell and the box</li>
            <li>I love shany cosmetics...</li>
            <li>I received this brush set as a gift from my son for Christmas, and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>The pouch it comes in is wicked cute too</li>
            <li>yes they are better but comparing them to anything you buy at Sephora</li>
            <li>is much much better.  </li>
            <li>Better quality.</li>
            <li>Love all of shany products</li>
            <li>favorite and most-used of this set are 4, 5, 9 an 10.</li>
            <li>Most of the brush tips are medium to chestnut brown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Average: 3 1/4 stars</li>
            <li>I would prefer a firmer brush just for more precision when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>:) Would recommend.</li>
            <li>Shany has a great reputation and this is real value for the money.</li>
            <li>for the money it was an ok purchase.</li>
            <li>I purchased two sets, this set had so much more.  </li>
            <li>l love it</li>
            <li>I was expecting better quality and to say what to use each brush for on the brush.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It saves a lot of space to store them like that and the bag is stylish .</li>
            <li>I love the variety and the price</li>
            <li>Great brushes, would recommend them to anyone, fast delivery, a brush for everything, real hair brushes so they&#x27;re washable, great pouch to keep them all in one place</li>
            <li>Love the brushes.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more as gifts.</li>
            <li>I have had products arrive in disposable packing of better quality.  </li>
            <li>I love my Shany Neutral Eye Palette</li>
            <li>but if you want non-shedders you should probably spend more money on a nicer set.</li>
            <li>but I would prefer to buy something with more quality.</li>
            <li>Now I want more.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying 5 better quality brushes rather than wasting your money on this set.</li>
            <li>I would buy more items from the brand.</li>
            <li>The storage pack it comes in is cute and the brushes are labeled so you know what to use them for.</li>
            <li>I love the case they came in and even a guide as to what brush is used for what part of the face.</li>
            <li>She was very excited and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are VERY soft, so beautiful feeling on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>shipping was fast, and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li>While the packaging was amazing, and it looked cool, it smelled like a dying rat snuffed with some molten chemicals as soon as I unwrapped the case.</li>
            <li>With first applications they were good,  </li>
            <li>The eye brushes from this kit are however pretty good for eye make up applications...</li>
            <li>They are pretty good for being inexpensive.</li>
            <li>For $12.99, it&#x27;s still a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>This brush set is exactly what I wanted, it has a good variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brushes were good for a first timer but others may not think so.</li>
            <li>but anyways they were a pretty good price</li>
            <li>Its pretty good, even tho there is some shedding of the brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are pretty good quality.</li>

            <li>I loved this set at first...</li>
            <li>Once I used them for the first time, I loved them.  </li>
            <li>They appeared to work well at first, but I started to wonder if the eye palette just wasn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li>They were not expensive and she works in the cosmetology industry and said they were good quality</li>
            <li>the brushes for eye makeup are pretty good quality considering the price</li>

            <li>These are the best brushes I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are pretty good, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>

            <li>i first loved this, however now the bristles are coming out.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of brushes and the price, the bag is beautiful nice leather, the brushes aren&#x27;t super soft may be is because am used to the painting brushes, am new in the world of make up, but one thing i say they are a very nice quality.</li>
            <li>case they came in is wonderfully sturdy and keeps everything wrapped up in a nice neat little package.</li>

            <li>they are handy in their own carring case and make appling make up so much easier.</li>
            <li>The price seemed to be good and the product offered a good selection for multiple application purposes.</li>
            <li>The red case is great and it&#x27;s nice to have something to carry and store my brushes.  </li>
            <li>It even came with a great red pouch that was nice.</li>

            <li>The bristles are effective in applying makeup evenly and clean easily with soap and water or brush cleanser.  </li>

            <li>Love them,but the brushes arnt really soft as I&#x27;d like but there very nice quality an.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t soak your brushes when you clean them!</li>
            <li>It was a good by as my daughter enjoys watching video tutorials on hair, nails, and makeup applications but did not have the brushes they recommend for certain looks.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very nice, and very soft.</li>
            <li>the brushes are very nice and very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>they are a pretty color and the brushes are great for people who love creating their own eyeshadows and want soft brushes!</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are very good quality (especially for the price).</li>
            <li>The Brushes are really soft and have great coverage, I love that I have a good variety of eye shadow brushes, that was the main reason for this purchase.</li>
            <li>Then you can see what I think are more accurate photos of each brush..</li>
            <li>As far as the quality of the brishes themselves, all mine have held up well and feel great.</li>
            <li>A beautiful stylish red bag to hold brushes.  </li>
            <li>But the quality of brushes is pretty good for the price-doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how these brushes are such a great price at such a great quality!</li>
            <li>they are definitely worth the regular price, but it&#x27;s always awesome to get a better deal.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something for a young girl they are great.  </li>
            <li>These Brushes are really soft and great to use.</li>
            <li>I know they are cheap, but they are cheap for a reason!</li>
            <li>I love using them, they are smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>The Shany professional is a great set to have.</li>
            <li>Better to find something that is worth more because it is better quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great so far.</li>
            <li>I was able to fit it inside of my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>otherwise, best 12.99 i ever spent</li>
            <li>I ordered this set of brushes just to qualify for free shipping:)</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC :)  </li>
            <li>and i love it for light hand application.</li>
            <li>I kid you not, these brushes are the most fantastic set out there.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and feels great on your skin</li>
            <li>The pouch is also cute and pretty handy.</li>
            <li>Sure, you can say that using &#x27;spare parts&#x27; makes you cruelty free, but let&#x27;s be serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is lacking as well.</li>
            <li>These are not rock star fabulously made, but they are okay.  </li>
            <li>and she said they work great and feel soft against skin</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and of great quality.</li>
            <li>The brushes work wonderfully, the hair brush hair started to fall out when I cleaned them, so be careful.</li>
            <li>I think the 3 most important brushes in this set are the blush brush, the powder brush and the fan brush.</li>
            <li>the strands of hair are nice and it is worth the money</li>
            <li>I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>These brushes look real fancy, I thought I was getting a good deal for the price..</li>
            <li>They seem to be of good quality and are much cheaper than buying the &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li>Really qood product at good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good set if you&#x27;re really into eyes.</li>
            <li>very affordable and loved it</li>
            <li>Good quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Loved them so much, we bought them again.  </li>
            <li>So I would say it is worth the investment if you don&#x27;t have any make up brushes of your own and a budget.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Amazon.com for my SHANY product and a nice and easy delivery!</li>
            <li>Worth buying nice strong bristles.</li>
            <li>I like the brushes they are nice and long very nice colors</li>
            <li>very soft, and bright colors, purchased them for my mom and am going to buy some for myself now, for sure.</li>

            <li>Pouch is very nice and professional.</li>
            <li>But the hair is soft, and it doesn&#x27;t fall out on your face, which is very nice.</li>
            <li>Compared to some of the other brushes that I have bought these are the best.</li>
            <li>All the other brushes are excellent</li>
            <li>This is my first set of makeup brushes, so I&#x27;m not as educated in brushes as others might be, but I love this set!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li>This is my first set of makeup brushes and I LOVE them!</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s a full collection for her makeup set!</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>but I do use these brushes daily and they are good quality for the price!</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are a great buy!</li>
            <li>but all the other brushes are WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li>It works excellent with their other beauty products.</li>
            <li>First off I love these brushes!</li>
            <li>I am going to check out the other products SHANY sells because I am so impressed with these brushes and how affordable the company has made them.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes and the eyeshadow brushes are very ideal for small areas that you want touch up and the eyebrow brush/comb combo are very ideal, although I wished they would have thrown in a mascara brush.</li>
            <li>easy to handle ...</li>
            <li>I loved these brushes, they&#x27;re great and firm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my Estee Lauder brush cleaner to clean the brushes, because they too had the overwhelming smell of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>But I find that when I&#x27;m putting my makeup on a lot of the hair in the brushes will be pulled out easily...</li>
            <li>Easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li>So many brushes too,its a great buy for only $15.</li>
            <li>And application is easy.</li>
            <li>The set came very quickly.</li>
            <li>They blend my stuff well,&amp; they are easy to use .</li>
            <li>Easy to store.</li>
            <li>easy to clean :)</li>
            <li>Great starting kit for people getting more into make up</li>
            <li>They fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>pouch is also helpful, I can easily carry it in my bag, it is compact and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect for the everyday makeup guru :)</li>
            <li>they also arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>They apply the color I need and are easy to clean and are stored neatly in the cute pouch.</li>
            <li>The product has a great value, the price is much lower than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This set is great for personal use and you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes they are soft and the price is great!</li>
            <li>but they actually a bright red was kind of upset at firt</li>
            <li>Overall, they&#x27;re great :)</li>
            <li>Brushes broke to easily</li>
            <li>it is quite convenient to have makeup brushes that are easy to carry around..</li>
            <li>Easy to ship arrived on time no problems w order</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with my purchase and feel that the brushes were appropriately described in the product description.  </li>
            <li>They were delivered very quickly...</li>
            <li>Because of the case it is easy to transport.</li>
            <li>Also, on the blush and foundation brushes the bristles fall out quite easily.</li>
            <li>Makes them easy to use and easy to find&gt;</li>
            <li>but im trying to warn yall before you buy it there are better brush sets and cheaper thanks &amp; have a nice day</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell when you take it out of the bag.</li>
            <li>, it was too strong.</li>
            <li>Four of the brushes will have a strong plastic \\&quot;topper\\&quot; keep the plastic that comes with the lip brush, fan brush and two blush brushes to help these keep their shape ladies.    </li>
            <li>sure to wash with gentle, diluted shampoo and warm water before using!&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT when I opened the box, the plastic/petroleum/PVC smell was so strong it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>and they are still going strong</li>
            <li>I received all individual items as described, each in their own plastic packaging and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Comes with a strong smell, but if you wash them when you get them, it goes away immediately.</li>
            <li>The bag that they came in had a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about this particular set of brushes.</li>
            <li>The pouch had a strong smell of plastic.</li>
            <li>One issue though - the case smelt strongly of paint.</li>
            <li>but so far so good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I wish the case did not smell so strong...</li>
            <li>It does have a strong plastic scent that goes away after time.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell and had to air out for a couple of days before I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>Strong smell.</li>
            <li>They are good quality brushes and do well with my sensitive skin:)</li>
            <li>For the price, these are a good value and decent brushes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect, professional brush kit that&#x27;s priced at a reasonable price, you better place an order right now!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that the quality would be good because of the price, but I was very surprised!</li>
            <li>Great for professional and first time users!!</li>
            <li>The cost is just good deal, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality, not my favorite brushes for actual makeup, but they&#x27;re surprisingly good for stage makeup.</li>
            <li>They are good to have as backup, but I will be buying a high quality set instead.</li>
            <li>I am very very excited to try them and happy overall with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very very excited to try them and happy overall with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The red pouch the brushes come in is not the best quality, but what can you expect for the price right?</li>
            <li>The brushes are very good quality, and I couldn&#x27;t find any flaws with the brushes themselves, but the case they come in is kind of annoying to roll it up and wrap the straps all the way around, and if I were to change it, I would make it have a velcro or a button or a clasp of some sort instead of the straps, but otherwise, great!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft brushes and the pouch is gorgeous, when I opened it everyone asked where I had gotten it, and when I used them this morning they blended extremely well and were great for putting on fondation, eyeliner, eye makeup, even lip products!</li>
            <li>so you dont have to do much and they are so soft when they touch your face great produt again and the price amazing</li>
            <li>First of all, THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I liked this product when I first got it because 1.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes but did not come with the exact set pictured.</li>
            <li>Just enough brushes to create a beautiful look for any day of the week.</li>
            <li>Mine came in a beautiful red.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a pretty color and they come in a nice pouch.  </li>
            <li>and the brush carrier thing is pretty handy though</li>
            <li>And it is a beautiful red color.</li>
            <li>The set is pretty nice, it has a lot of variety.</li>
            <li>These are pretty nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>&amp; they come whit instructions which is pretty nice</li>
            <li>The red leather-like pouch is beautiful.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve held up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>So yeah, I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a good set of brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li>i needed new make-up brushes and didnt have new money so this was a excellent buy!</li>
            <li>Great product..Came quick and brand new.</li>
            <li>I got new ones for pretty good deal and they were nice and efficient.</li>
            <li>For the price, these brushes are fine.  </li>
            <li>Definitely perfect first brush set for your preteen or teen.</li>
            <li>The brushes also stank but after i washed them they were fine.</li>
            <li>you will have an angled brush that is best used for lining the top of the lids, a small lip brush, a brow comb/brush and an applicator.</li>
            <li>The brushes however are so fine that they don&#x27;t pick up powder or shadow and you end up wasting makeup and don&#x27;t get coverage on your skin.   </li>
            <li>That said, I was less than impressed with the eyelash/eyebrow brush, foundation brush, and blush brush.  </li>
            <li>but they have been fine since then.</li>
            <li>and it should be fine.</li>
            <li>so I think these brushes will work fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Camel hair removes the dust without scratching fine metals and plastics.</li>
            <li>if you like that hot red color and great quality brushes!</li>
            <li>They work just fine</li>
            <li>They are my first set of actual makeup brushes and I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>fine-</li>
            <li>Super soft, professional looking, great variety, amazing value!</li>
            <li>At this price, the quality is just fine.</li>
            <li>The hairs are fine</li>
            <li>and they work fine.  </li>
            <li>I guess they are fine.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow ones are still working just fine, though.</li>
            <li>Also has a great variety for pretty much anything you might need a brush for.</li>
            <li>It looked fine to me and had the eyeshadow applicators I was looking for</li>
            <li>The brushes work fine.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fine and I received this ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow I really wasn&#x27;t expecting such great quality since they were so cheap, but these brushes are great!!!</li>

            <li>they pick up makeup really well and the pouch they come in is absolutely adorable!</li>
            <li>I love this &amp; would recommend it very much!</li>
            <li>and I love how it will keep all my new brushes and the ones I already own all in one place.</li>
            <li>When I saw this deal on Amazon it had pretty good reviews and the price was right</li>
            <li>I bought this set as a quick buy without much thought since the price was really good.  </li>

            <li>okay these items are very soft and nice</li>
            <li>I love love love my new brushes i got today</li>
            <li>They are great I clean them with baby wash and their are soft and clean</li>
            <li>My only thing I would have liked to have seen was something that told what all the uses of the brushes were since their are so many!</li>
            <li>If you need a cheap set, these will do just fine.</li>
            <li>I wash my brushes once a week with warm water and Sephora brush shampoo and one of the large eye shadow brushes</li>
            <li>This is a nice set of brushes and certainly affordable.  </li>
            <li>I got the brushes and felt like they aren&#x27;t the best quality ,Of course if you compare them to mac brushes your not going to like them they don&#x27;t shed and they had a little smell but</li>
            <li>I love that these are high quality, yet affordable brushes!!!</li>
            <li>the spooly brush really isn&#x27;t that great for the brows, the brush is too large for anyones brows</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with them they are very soft and pick up the eyeshadow easily.</li>
            <li>BEAUTIFUL RED AND LOVE HOW SOFT THE BRUSHES ARE AND VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>From the beautiful leather pouch to the complete selection of high quality brushes, I was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this because they&#x27;re so inexpensive but the brushes are still much nicer then you would possible think they could be and the variety in them is also very very good.</li>
            <li>They are also really super for making some unique looks!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to check these out!</li>
            <li>They are really smooth and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>brushes have not shed at all, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t a huge problem</li>
            <li>and these were cheap cheap CHEAP.</li>
            <li>My expectations were huge and were reached.</li>
            <li>This one was HUGE for me.</li>
            <li>and they are easy to clean and they make the make-up go on so smooth</li>
            <li>AND it doesn&#x27;t absorb product which is a huge bonus because then you&#x27;re not wasting your money.  </li>
            <li>Huge mistake.</li>
            <li>There is a huge range of sizes.</li>
            <li>The difference it makes with my makeup is huge.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really nice and they work very well.</li>
            <li>Cheap product,  doesn&#x27;t blend in make up</li>
            <li>So, I would recommend this, you know, if it was available........</li>
            <li>Overall a great deal for $13.</li>
            <li>They make makeup application a breeze and allow the makeup to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I never planned on using these as my primary brushes.</li>
            <li>Therefore, based on the cheap quality of the case, I was worried about the quality of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well made, durable, and easy to clean.     </li>
            <li>The price was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Also important to note.  </li>
            <li>The bag is also extremely cheap looking</li>
            <li>i thought it was going to be some cheap dollar store type</li>
            <li>this set is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall, i am happy with my purchase and  would definetly recommend.  </li>
            <li>but I now use these everyday, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>This is a great set of make up brushes, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It holds the brushes securely.</li>
            <li>They are just cheap dollar store quality brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean and the makeup your using doesn&#x27;t cling or clump in the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Amazon prime 2day free shipping.</li>
            <li>and why should it, its made of cheap vinyl but anyway for 25 dollars you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I got a red pouch, which is great since it matches the color of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>2nd year in a row I&#x27;ve ordered this great set</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t anything amazing, but they are very sturdy for the price.  </li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>Oh my... This brush set is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The larger brushes are a great substitute in these situations.</li>
            <li>I probably will never need to buy another and some will be available for others to inherit when I&#x27;m gone.</li>
            <li>For Approx $15, they are fantastic and I adore my brushes.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it came in a red plastic roll/up case which is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t back out of buying these!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and very helpful.</li>
            <li>Shany has been an awesome product for me thus far, i intend to purchase more from their company in the future.</li>
            <li>Article is acceptable, filled my expectations.</li>
            <li>I just recently bought these brushes and they are great.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made to me</li>
            <li>and i just didn&#x27;t enjoy them at all.</li>
            <li>Cheap but convenient.</li>
            <li>Folds up perfectly to fit neatly in a purse.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that they don&#x27;t have a lot of blending brushes but everything else is great.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This set is primarily a brush set focused on the eyes.</li>
            <li>and they look fantastic.</li>
            <li>The brushes felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and work well with mineral make up</li>
            <li>but they do not look cheap, fall apart or shed.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone, hope you enjoy them.</li>
            <li>They are really soft and so far they have worked wonderfully, I use them for personal purposes and I&#x27;m happy about the results.</li>
            <li>but the rest of brushes looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>Bought this for myself, however I thought that it was a bit flimsy and cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I sure got my money&#x27;s worth with these.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made and bristles fall out off all brushes and irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>i bought them for my daughter and they are great for a starting up make up tips and learning how to use all the variety of brushes</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding inexpensive brushes that didn&#x27;t shed their bristles and this is definitely a great set!</li>
            <li>Yes, they are cheap</li>
            <li>Also, if this is important: It doesn&#x27;t come with a foundation/concealer brush either.</li>
            <li>I am just getting into the real routine of how to do make up and these brushes were amazing with my start.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the picture made these brushes look very luscious.  </li>
            <li>and when I pack it is is to fit in any suit case</li>
            <li>This is primarily an eye brush kit.</li>
            <li>All these brush kits are available shipped and sold by amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say again how important it is to wash them because the difference is like night and day</li>
            <li>Apply makeup evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>This will be great for those who travel regularly</li>
            <li>I really liked they picked up make up very well.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love:)  Hope this helps and potential buyers!!</li>
            <li>I thought that with the number of reviews and stars that I would enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li>Great for personal use or for gifts.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brushes was more than I expected and my niece indicates that she is able to apply her makeup more effectively.</li>

            <li>they pick up product well, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>cheap out on stuff for your face/skin, save up for MAC or something on that level.</li>
            <li>Overall this set of brushes is a great bargin/value.</li>
            <li>The storage pouch makes it easy for storage and keeps your brushes clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>but hey they were cheap.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I purchased a set for my sister too for Christmas.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for my everyday use.</li>
            <li>my makeup goes on smooth and I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li>so I decided to find some cheap brushes to start off with.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I got this, but the brushes are definitely nice.</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes doesn&#x27;t hold my foundation too well but a great starter kit for beginners</li>
            <li>Really cheap quality,</li>
            <li>Everything I need for home makeup application in one great set, and for the amazingly low price, cannot be beat!</li>
            <li>Might as well just take the free ones that come with drugstore eyeshadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag to carry brushes was a nice surprise, it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>But overall, great beginner set.</li>
            <li>doesnt look cheap at all for the price.</li>
            <li>If you assume you are buying a cruelty free product because they tout that they are a member of PETA on their description, you are incorrect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to splurge for better brushes.</li>
            <li>but none show signs of breaking and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive set of makeup brushes that I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice set at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li>IT&#x27;S CHEAP.</li>
            <li>The packaging looks tacky and cheap.</li>
            <li>Some cheap brushes that stick to your face.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic brush set...</li>
            <li>They do not feel cheap and do not shed</li>
            <li>The cover is a cheap plastic</li>
            <li>They are Cheaply made brushes and smelled of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>makes it easier to see what&#x27;s on them since I use a lot of light or saturated colors.</li>

            <li>They are worth much more than the price charged.  </li>
            <li>I love shopping on Amazon, too, so it was worth it</li>
            <li>I have to be honest when I say that I don&#x27;t use them all, however the ones I do use are well made, and very functional.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Its my primary set.</li>
            <li>Makeup application goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes over a year ago and they are still in fantastic condition.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, these are good brushes.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to have every available makeup brush in a tool kit ready.</li>
            <li>When I received it as I was pleasantly surprised as they seem good quality and the smell reported comes from the package.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good, but it may cause an allergic reaction if you don&#x27;t wash them first.</li>
            <li>The pouch is soft and in 100% good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>But overall there good:)</li>
            <li>so far so good, I&#x27;ll say.</li>
            <li>The bag is so convenient and the brushes have worked good so far for me.  </li>
            <li>The real goat hair gives it a perfect texture and softness and just enough stiffness to maintain control.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are good quality many different shapes for applying make up.</li>
            <li>It has everything you could want in a brush set, the case is better than most I have had the brush hair dosent shead and are very durable.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>this remains to be seen, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>My GF loved it she was surprised it came with so many things to choose from its worth every penny</li>
            <li>This is a good, all around set of brushes complete with case.</li>
            <li>I use more of the eyeshadow brushes then anything else and have got to say they are good, although I wish the bigger eyeshadow brushes had been fluffier to help with blending.</li>
            <li>I love that you can get 13 good brushes and a pouch for only 12.99.</li>
            <li>so glad I found all the brushes and more that she wanted and needed to get the look she wants at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>and I so far so good..</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter is very involved in theatre - ordered these for her stage make-up and was very happy with the quality!</li>
            <li>Be good for a &amp;#34;starter set&amp;#34; for someone young and just fooling around..</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price, soft brush tips.</li>
            <li>Great looks; however, the brushes I use the most are a bit stiff, even after more than a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially love the blush brush, large powder brush, slanted eyeliner blush for applying gel eyeliner, and the three flat brushes which I use for eyeshadow, but which are probably for shadown, concealer, and foundation.  </li>
            <li>Although the price seemed too good to be true, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it beat spending $28.00 for a new Lauder eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautifully packaged in a cute case (mine was black).</li>
            <li>They came in a red cosmetic case that is cheap but very handy for all of the brushes.</li>
            <li>, otherwise I&#x27;d be more pissed than I am right now.</li>
            <li>For that many brushes the price is just right.</li>
            <li>My new brushes are super soft, there is a wonderful variety.</li>
            <li>super easy to clean and easy to take with me when I travel in the case they come in.</li>
            <li>There was a strong (not necessarily bad) smell when I opened it.</li>
            <li>Very nice set lots of shapes and sizes plenty to choose from for different uses.</li>
            <li>very useful...</li>
            <li>They are very nice and only $1-$5 a piece.</li>
            <li>All of them have been very useful.</li>
            <li>are very useful to me.</li>
            <li>honestly i have no idea what i&#x27;m doing when it comes to makeup, so it was a good start for someone like me to have all different kinds of brushes for pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes you will need for your daily routine, and easy to keep organized as it comes with a lovely pouch!</li>
            <li>These come in an adorable red pouch and they do what they are supposed to do exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>But after trying them out for a few weeks i fell in love!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing brushes , very soft and easy to work with .</li>
            <li>They came nicely packaged in a beautiful red is soft case and protectors around the hair of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too advanced with applying makeup &amp; this kit is user friendly.</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with it, would definitely purchase again from SHANY :)</li>
            <li>They are great for a first time purchase, but they will not likely sustain themselves over time like my set of brushes from Sephora which are a tad more...</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no shedding which is a must in a good brush!</li>
            <li>Ok I am not sure why so many people think these are great brushes.  </li>
            <li>they are great exactly like the picture, the Bristles are soft and do not fall out</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the best brushes ever, but they are much higher quality than I would have expected to get for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>They are full and soft, and the carrying case is good quality too.  </li>
            <li>With the carrying pouch allowing you to roll up the brushes, it makes it super easy to keep them organized.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Its pretty much just good for tickling your face.</li>
            <li>Love my new brushes!!!</li>
            <li>They really hold the Shany colors well and make applying them very easy.  </li>
            <li>These feel very high quality, have soft bristles, are easy to clean, and are great sizes.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone who spend hundreds on high end brands for brushes as these brushes are truly amazing.</li>
            <li>they are so soft when they touch your face great produt again and the price amazing really thanks so much.</li>
            <li>So far the brushes are great, soft and a great variety, not to mention brushes for this price, completely unbeatable.</li>
            <li>:) With that price, even if you end up not having a favorite new set of brushes, you will gain some you didn&#x27;t have or have a travel set at a bargain price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am honestly very satisfied, these brushes are amazing and the price is even better, this is a definite must have for any beginner or even someone who is more advanced, you can never have enough brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know very little about cosmetics and brushes, but she is very happy with this set, thus I would recommend this set to anyone.</li>
            <li>SUPER EASY TO CLEAN TOO.</li>
            <li>These are well worth the money and do the job more than just adequately.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely red case that folds up for easy storage and the brush quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I just got the brushes today, and I&#x27;m so excited about them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll probably fade over time, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Shany is also animal friendly so that also boosted my decision to buy these brushes.</li>
            <li>Between this brush set and the eyeshadow palette, I&#x27;m so pleased and will definitely purchase more Shany products from Amazon!</li>
            <li>The variations of brushes and the foldable cloth container they come in make it perfect for travel in a small carry on.</li>
            <li>i love these brushes so much!</li>
            <li>When they arrived I was so excited to try them.</li>
            <li>Ok girls if you are looking for a great cosmetic brush set this is it I was so excited to receive this product, and let me say these people don&#x27;t mess around</li>
            <li>I am so excited to order these brushes.</li>
            <li>item arrived on time in all original packaging.</li>
            <li>I especially enjoyed the carrying pouch that they come in and the small booklet guide to tell you what each brush is used for.</li>
            <li>it to be more puffier but over all I love everything and the red bag I love</li>
            <li>So far she is very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when they arrived.</li>
            <li>Such a nice color!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t too excited about this.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Leads me to belive these brushes are bought wholesale from china (Usually not the best quality) and sold by different vendors with defferent names.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything is in order &amp; totally worth it!</li>
            <li>i was excited to get my brushes</li>
            <li>My wife was pleased with these at first.</li>
            <li>but this is the first brush set that I have bought that has me completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure wether or not to buy these, but for the price I was willing to gamble</li>
            <li>I was really excited for the set for the price.</li>
            <li>These are the first brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I can tell they aren&#x27;t top of the line.  </li>
            <li>Love this set so much I bought two as gifts!</li>
            <li>this was so worth it!</li>
            <li>From first inspection I love the set.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind using small brushes or are prepared with glue or tape, this is great!</li>
            <li>they were definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>But it is worth the price!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice variety of brushes and the bristles are not hard and brittle.</li>
            <li>the brushes are nice and soft, and the travel case came in very handy for my recent business trip.</li>
            <li>They come in a great case that I can easily pack with my other cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>The brushes have a very unique smell when they first come out of the plastic wrapping.</li>
            <li>I was new to wearing makeup and these were AMAZING starter brushes.</li>
            <li>I’m not a make up artist, I just wanted a nice set of brushes to experiment with some new makeup techniques.</li>
            <li>They came as new in the box with an explanation of what each brush is and what it&#x27;s for, which was handy.</li>
            <li>but I would have liked to have been able to choose my color although I got red</li>
            <li>and the fact you dont HAVE to clean the brushes all the time...</li>
            <li>I despaired of actually being able to replicate the application on my own at home...</li>
            <li>I do not put them in water to clean...</li>
            <li>I needed a nice set with some smaller thinner brushes for more precision and this delivered.  </li>
            <li>Not the best quality as far as the big brushes go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought brushes from Walmart that I&#x27;ve kept clean and treated well</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and they rarely shed hairs.</li>
            <li>They are made with quality and I like the nice red pouch it came in:)</li>
            <li>It was alright for the price, u do have to spend more on ur makeup brushes, this was  better for a young girl.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t super experienced with make-up some of the brushes feel redundant, but so far they work great and do not shed.</li>
            <li>came in cute red foldout-style pouch which made for a nice gift.</li>
            <li>I loved the variety of brushes for such a cheap brush</li>
            <li>I only wish there was a foundation brush, but I was able to find one I liked at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>it came in a nice red case and all the brushes work fabulously!</li>
            <li>Overall I think that this is a fabulous set all together for a fair price.</li>
            <li>The case is way better even than expected, and is good quality.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making these professional brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li>They stay clean and dust-free.</li>
            <li>) they are soft on your face and last great!</li>
            <li>While these are cheap, you will pay what you would have for a good set of brushes replacing these constantly.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are beautiful at first but they will not last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price for a beginner or someone who really doesn&#x27;t know much about application.</li>
            <li>I have purchesed brushes from high end retailers such as bare minerals and department store cosmetics counters and these brushes were every bit as good and came beautifully packaged in a roll-up case for easy travel.  </li>
            <li>they are very soft and trendy, I do recommend this item.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and you get a nice variety.</li>
            <li>I love this set of brushes, it is very useful, very practical (can take it everywhere)</li>
            <li>I did like the brushes they are soft and pretty nice quality, it does not have a lot of face brushes mostly eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>and they are by far my favorite brushes!</li>
            <li>I am brand new to the brush experience, however these seem to be pretty good.  </li>
            <li>today got here super fast!!!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love these especially for the price and the seemingly good quality but only the brush tips themselves are nice.  </li>
            <li>the bristles fall out very easily, not the best quality product.</li>
            <li>I really thought this was great, since the larger brushes can so easily become</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy , I&#x27;m recommend 100% to buy your cosmetics here its easy simple and fast</li>
            <li>Im sure I bought the right item at right price.</li>
            <li>However, I am in no way saying you need to go spend $15.00 on \\&quot;special brush</li>
            <li>the case is nothing too special, it&#x27;s just a pouch, but it does it&#x27;s job of holding the brushes</li>
            <li>the bristles aren&#x27;t sculpted right for me and there is no blending brush!</li>
            <li>Returned these right away!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using the brushes either personally or professionally, highly recommend getting a good make up remover- these brushes cover so well that you&#x27;ll really want to clean up or your foundation will wind up on your pillows/clothes at night.</li>
            <li>So far, I love the package it comes with, it is super cute and true to its description.</li>
            <li>So awesome that the hairs don&#x27;t fall out of these when you use them which is what I have experienced with all the other makeup brushes I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to clean before using, they stand up to being cleaned very well.</li>
            <li>Great brush kit, there&#x27;s a brush for every need in a cute little package!</li>
            <li>I was super excited when they came</li>
            <li>The brushes actually look better in person than in the pictures above, which was very surprising.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, and I am very impressed with how fluffy, soft the brush is.</li>
            <li>Minimal hair loss from the brushes and they work great</li>
            <li>Great gift for a girl of almost any age, wide variety of material.</li>
            <li>The bright red is cheerful and fun</li>
            <li>The handles are a nice length and the whole brush seems to be pretty sturdy</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the bag, only my sister can comment on product, so far I feel, it worth cost.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty good and soft.</li>
            <li>Now the burshes are nice and soft.......</li>
            <li>Overall I thought it was a good price for what I was getting</li>
            <li>I really have fell in love with the brushes.</li>
            <li>definitely pleased with the price and quality of these&lt;br /&gt;brushes and can do so much with them</li>
            <li>thanks :)</li>
            <li>I use them on a daily basis, and they&#x27;re a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>on the whole i feel satisfied.</li>
            <li>I really like the pricing on this item, so cheap!</li>
            <li>The blush brush is nice and soft and bushy.</li>
            <li>They were soft, applied smoothly on my skin, and loved the very organized case it came with.  </li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are nice quality and they are soo soft.</li>
            <li>The Essential line is the cheapest at $1, but some of the brushes are not that good.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft &amp; nice to the face.</li>
            <li>: I really wish i had gotten a more feminem color</li>
            <li>Very well made we both love them.</li>
            <li>Loved the overall brushes.</li>
            <li>This is such a good price for this set.</li>
            <li>i really dont write a review until im sure what im going to post!&lt;br /&gt;i bought them like</li>
            <li>The Bristles don&#x27;t fall off onto your face and it makes a nice soft touch to your makeup.</li>
            <li>: Obviously I am going to start out with the good things about this product!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t read anything else in this review, which you really should because I KNOW my make up products, make SURE you read this.</li>
            <li>Kind of flismy sort of natural looking.</li>
            <li>the brushes are good and are glued properly ...doesn&#x27;t fall off from the handle....</li>
            <li>You get such a good deal for the price of this set.</li>
            <li>the brushes seem good enough for every day use.</li>
            <li>They are not as full or dense as in the pictures.</li>
            <li>I ready love it</li>
            <li>Granted, they are inexpensive, but if you wanted something that lasts just buy individual brushes of good quality.</li>
            <li>They seem well made for the price, and are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I really liked it, I being using it since I got it and also using it with my daughter (9 years old) when she has dance performances or teather plays.  </li>
            <li>She loved them and actually keeps them all togeather in the Pouch.</li>
            <li>The only brush that I would have loved to have would be an angled blush brush....</li>
            <li>and I needed brushes that were cheap and useful.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these brushes and out of the box I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVED the case that the brushes came in, it stores them compactly for ease of use, especially when traveling.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised on how nice these are</li>
            <li>Overall, some good brushes for their price.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really nice and soft and seem like they will hold up well.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase overall.</li>
            <li>But overall for the price it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>i ordered it because not only was it a lot of brushes for a good price but came in a to go wrap carrier thing.</li>
            <li>Red brush roll is really nice and easy clean up.</li>
            <li>My teenage girl loved it.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes so much.</li>
            <li>In matter of fact, the E.L.F. Studio line brushes are better, and they&#x27;re at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>But love the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They are not as full as I wish they were</li>
            <li>But its true what they say</li>
            <li>brushes  dont look as good as in the picture, but would definitely would  buy again.</li>
            <li>I gave 2 stars because it is a nice, soft brush set</li>
            <li>And it is so true that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I really love it thanks, and i will tell all my friends to buy it, thank you again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft brushes and nice size selection.</li>
            <li>They look nice and feel soft.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, the brushes feel soft but they haven&#x27;t been tried out yet.</li>
            <li>I am not big on makeup but wanted some quality brushes at a good price and this is what I got.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the most high-end but for the price, I really like them.</li>
            <li>A guide for which brush is which would also be handy as I had never seen the &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; brush before and later found out that it works great for getting the extra powder off of your face without it leaving spots of color on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of the brushes picked up much pigment from my eyeshadows, my dollar store brushes performed better than these.</li>
            <li>The red is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This is a true case of you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is really nice soft leather</li>
            <li>but the actual brush parts are really good.</li>
            <li>i just love this product it really saved my life</li>
            <li>Bought for teen daughter and she loved and asked for again.</li>
            <li>I bought this brushes for my wife as a present after i had read so much good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>and I got a full set for the price of one brush at the stores.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good set to buy just for basic applications.</li>
            <li>Good for practice only then upgrade.</li>
            <li>This product got one star because the only brush in my set that was any good was the angled brush n</li>
            <li>I love the case and how it is real quality</li>
            <li>One of my favorite hobbies is to collect make up and make up brushes and with SHANEY COSMETICS, I can collect real quality brushes cheaper than  MAC and SEPHORA.</li>
            <li>i LOVED it only thing i wished it had was a foundation brush, i was looking foward to it !!!</li>
            <li>but, these brushes are great because they don&#x27;t shed their bristles, just enough choices in the bundle which comes in a nice leather wrap that rolls up and ties up nicely especially for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good set, especially for the purchase price.  </li>
            <li>well, they&#x27;re soft but they are kind of laking in volume?</li>
            <li>Also it comes in a nice case that folds over like a professional case.</li>
            <li>good quality, they come with a red bag for brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are only good for beginners.</li>
            <li>If only the brush was a bit thicker, but it&#x27;s good the way it is.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes hold so much shadow and applies so smoothly with almost no powder particles falling on your face!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something inexpensive and good enough to get the job done</li>
            <li>Overall a good value.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I would highly recommend this brush set to anyone who needs one! :)</li>
            <li>I liked the brushes but they don&#x27;t look professional.</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice case looks professional .</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad, though.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad buy for the money.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>There was no bad smell from my brushes and I ran my finger through the bristles and did not see any powder or dust.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad for 13 brushes $ price.</li>
            <li>Not a bad brush set for people setting their stride in cosmetics.</li>
            <li>not that hold some.the brush is tick and nice and the case is strong enough</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to use as well as wasy to clean!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a wide selection of brushes to choose from, so they do they job very nicely.</li>

            <li>this is and okay product because it has some brushes that are great quality mostly the eye-shadow ones, but the big ones are a bit rough and always shedding hair</li>
            <li>I washed the brushes before using them with luke warm water mixed with baby oil and they have worked just fine.</li>
            <li>She said the bristols are nice and fine for different make up styles.</li>
            <li>Other than that this product was great.</li>
            <li>other than that they are great.</li>
            <li>the brushes isnt great as compared to what i read on other comments posted..</li>
            <li>From the other reviews it seemed they were great quality brushes but any brush I have gotten with a product</li>
            <li>These flat irons are good for the price.</li>
            <li>I Love my new Shany brushes!</li>
            <li>It smelled a bit when it first arrived, but after washing the brushes and letting the case air out, it was fine.</li>
            <li>from the first wash the hairs of the brush for powder and blush brush are out, the others are fine</li>
            <li>They clean easily and dry nicely.  </li>
            <li>And fortunately each brush comes in handy when I need a particular brush to do a particular job.</li>
            <li>will most definitely be perusing amazon and the Shany cosmentics webpage for more steals and deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this set is awesome especially for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped quickly</li>
            <li>ES UN PRODUCTO MUY UTIL PARA MAQUILLAJE, MUY PROFESIONAL, SUPER CHEVERE, LLEGO SIN NINGUN INCONVENIENTE, EMPACADO CORRECTAMENTE, SUGUIERO LA COMPRA DE ESTE PRODUCTO</li>
            <li>While red is not my favorite color, I do love the case these brushes came in.  </li>
            <li>First let me start by saying I love how fast I got these brushes!</li>
            <li>Super affordable and are not rink dink brushes that suck.</li>
            <li>I really use the smaller ones though, they are great for eyeshadow</li>
            <li>but that wore off quickly.</li>
            <li>After looking at the prices for brushes &amp; brush sets in any of the beauty stores this was a super value.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my own personal use and for $13 you can&#x27;t go wrong, they are great to use, soft, versatile and great quality for the price!</li>
            <li>super speedy delivery, pack comes with a brush guide</li>
            <li>This kit is a great buy for someone who is just starting out or if your a real pro.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li>The pouch is convenient and allows her to pack them up quickly and head out.  </li>
            <li>The chemical smell of the case went away quickly.</li>
            <li>The brushes are sturdy and most importantly the hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>but they arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I recommend washing these with mild soap before using them.</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes for my teenage daughter, who is in the process of learning to apply makeup using brushes and the different tools to help her with a flawless finished look.</li>
            <li>Luckily the brushes don&#x27;t stink so</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a quick buy that will get the job done these should work.</li>
            <li>I got mine fairly quickly (2 days) because of my prime membership.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived quickly and were neatly packaged for delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were shipped quickly and well</li>
            <li>They come in a really convenient travel case which i lied, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I got these rather quickly and when I opened up the pouch, a chemical smell hit me.</li>
            <li>The hair falls off quickly.</li>
            <li>The brushes seem to fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li>Better than decent quality bristles.</li>
            <li>Overall, great value and high quality for the price!</li>
            <li>I have a few luxury brand makeup brushes but wanted something inexpensive - but still good - for experimenting with more daring, bold colors.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make these better is if the handles on the brushes were shorter to make them even more compact, and so when I&#x27;m leaning into the mirroe to see what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li>Since red is my favorite color even better.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>the cost was unbeatable and the service was quick and efficient.</li>
            <li>High Quality brushes with cute carrying pouch and even instructions on which brushes are what.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t own such a large shadow brush like that before, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case the brushes come in is cheap but handy and a little cute.</li>
            <li>there are many brushes but there is a little slip that tells you what each brush is for, i was really happy they did that because i dont know much about</li>
            <li>I must say - I love, love, LOVE the brushes, though I wish they were a little thicker.</li>
            <li>The set has nice long handles, so they&#x27;re easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>I bought some fantastic Ecotools and Real Techniques brushes that are soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>I followed the advice of other reviewers and washed them before using them and so far I am very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I have used the blush brushes and really loved them but some of the other brushes looked a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this brush set and would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li>And the red leather case it came in is very stylish.</li>
            <li>overall i am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>, the bristles of the brushes have not fallen out, they pick up a healthy amount of makeup and there&#x27;s not much left on the brush after application, and they&#x27;re fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The look of the case is very pretty.</li>
            <li>but cheap is exactly what you&#x27;re getting here.  </li>
            <li>Thank u all very much!</li>
            <li>my friends and family cannot believe I got such good quality brushes for such an amazing price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pouch smells like hot plastic when you first receive the product, so just leave the brushes in the fridge for a day if the smell honestly bothers you that much.</li>
            <li>great quality brushes and the red is soon pretty ;)</li>
            <li>Pouch is pretty cheap looking and some of the hairs came out of the brushes during use.  </li>
            <li>Also shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>I did kind of expect the brushes to be bigger, just because of how they looked in the pictures but all in all I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I soaked mine in a body mist and rinsed before I used them- very potent scent when you open them.</li>
            <li>I think some of the eyeshadow brushes are basically duplicates of each other just to make it seem like you get lots of brushes, but the bag is nice, stylish and durable.</li>
            <li>Not only does this look awesome on my makeup table, my brushes stay clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as good as do scribed and the delivary was made long before the estimated date which is grate</li>
            <li>The case is beautiful, sleek, heavy duty, and there was NO stitching coming undone.</li>
            <li>I do wash them with brush cleanser which is good for long time use.  </li>
            <li>Good but no professional quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really digging Shany right now!!</li>
            <li>Im just very impatient, But the brushes are beautiful and I&#x27;m going to have alot of fun playing around with them!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I loved the color, they cleaned pretty easily and did not become rough after being cleaned</li>
            <li>Cute packaging,&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good quality (gets the job done, very little brush</li>
            <li>Now, I need to look for a new kabuki brush. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for some new brushes and these really fit the bill!</li>
            <li>I love adding new tools to my collection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve about had it with these and bought a new set of more plush and softer brushes that don&#x27;t lose bristles and</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite, go-to brushes.</li>
            <li>Hey, full disclosure right?</li>
            <li>They might not be professional brushes, but the quality is still pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Work great for your typical makeup use.</li>
            <li>They are great to apply make-up and cost keeps less than make-up brushes in stores.</li>
            <li>The handles are easy to hold and the ferral is really sturdy where the hairs are.</li>
            <li>I do not like short brushes, so I was particularly impressed with the long handles.  </li>
            <li>If you read the product description very closely, it says to be SURE to wash these brushes before your first use.</li>
            <li>Overall, I had a pretty good experiece with the purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for several months, and they&#x27;re holding up pretty good.  </li>
            <li>They collect and hold the makeup really well, and blending is really easy.</li>
            <li>Sweet Brushes, Nice Red Case.</li>
            <li>Brushes are made very well and easy to use and comes with a pouch too.  </li>
            <li>These are very nice, the only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars is because they smell very chemical like, I couldn&#x27;t use them right away.</li>
            <li>The brush tips are very soft, the handles are sturdy, and the carrying case is adorable.</li>
            <li>I found the brushes to be high quality, and the red pouch gave the set more of a trendy vibe.</li>
            <li>Really!!</li>
            <li>and i got the brushes first!</li>
            <li>When I first got these brushes, I was in Heaven!  </li>
            <li>but I was hoping to get it in red color my favorite!</li>
            <li>These are really pretty brushes!</li>
            <li>smell at first so wash them!</li>
            <li>WASH BEFORE FIRST USE!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>but what do you expect to get a whole set for a fraction of the price of one!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li>and she said her Cilents love how soft they were!</li>
            <li>The VERY 1st time I used them they fell apart!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Bought them over a year ago, and til&#x27; this day I continue to use these brushes, I&#x27;ve added to my collection of course, they&#x27;re not MAC brushes, but they hold up pretty well and do their job for their price!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for makeup brushes !!</li>
            <li>They are great for everyday use and the extra tools come in handy for special occasions as well.</li>
            <li>I love how every brush comes individually wrapped and how easy they are to organize.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are super soft and I love the handles, lightweight.</li>
            <li>Super soft, LOVE these brushes.</li>
            <li>Amazing set of makeup brushes.. they are very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>This product is nice, it&#x27;s very soft and gentle when you apply it on your face.  </li>
            <li>It is not extremely high quality, but it is good quality.</li>
            <li>Maybe not professional quality but great for a mom like me who doesn&#x27;t want to spent too much but still get good quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no makeup artist, I use youtube to come up with most of my makeup tips, but I love that this kit comes with every single type of brush I&#x27;ve seen artists use.  </li>
            <li>it has pretty much every brush you could need from Eyeliner brushes to different eye shadow brushes I love them!!</li>
            <li>then those little bugs, the brushes work great.</li>
            <li>The carrying pouch has frayed a little but the brushes are in great shape.</li>
            <li>besides these two little cons, the set is great.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes are just fine, but I must say that the larger brushes shed on my face when using them for blush or bronzer.</li>
            <li>This set comes with a large set of soft brushes and a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li>These are nice brushes but for the price I paid I was hoping for little better quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are wonderful, but at times a little soft in the bristles for my tastes.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting too much given how cheap these brushes are, but I fear they&#x27;d go bald within a couple applications.</li>
            <li>It would be great to have for traveling with these brushes, I&#x27;m not a fan of using the roll-up ones as a everyday item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>although the pouch is cheap quality it is very functional.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>While relatively cheap, the pouch does the trick of organizing the brushes and storing them so they don&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for the brushes, and for your fantastic service.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and accurate and one time.</li>
            <li>They are real Badger and Goat hair brushes, which was important to me as I don&#x27;t care for synthetic bristles.</li>
            <li>The red color of the brush handles and case is much more bright of a red than in the picture.</li>
            <li>You can actually change what kind of brushes they are by using them a different way, and they still work amazingly.</li>
            <li>I dont like these brushs because they are cheap and they shed too much.</li>
            <li>They are the best I had in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these brushes, they are incredibly soft and work so well with all eyeshadows&lt;</li>
            <li>I go to, they love how it gives that soft touch.</li>
            <li>Worth your money.</li>
            <li>In this case I guess you get what you pay for, but I have to say I feel that these brushes weren&#x27;t even worth what I paid for them.</li>
            <li>it just seems more professional.</li>
            <li>The case was a nice shade of red, along with the brush handles.</li>
            <li>You get a nice red bag that carries all of the brushes, I have already put mine to use.</li>
            <li>worth the price..</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are, and the fact that they&#x27;re natural bristles makes them easy to clean.</li>
            <li>These are definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li>wish I would have just spent more money on a better set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Such good quality and very well</li>
            <li>These brushes are all nice, but overall quite an over-kill for me.</li>
            <li>They got the job done, I personally feel like elf brushes are better considering how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>So soft and so cheap!</li>
            <li>The brush handles are in a nice ruby red color</li>
            <li>Nice starter set and enough variety for any need you might have.</li>
            <li>Love the brushes they are soft and catch on to product well.</li>
            <li>Love the color and that they are soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves come in a nice variety and some of the fluffier, larger ones have a vinyl brush cover to help keep their shape when being stored.</li>
            <li>Not the quality I expected but good price for the set.</li>
            <li>I love how incredibly soft the brushes are.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice red pouch and it has all the brushes she would probably need.</li>
            <li>I guess if you want to rate the brush set based on value, then yes, 4 stars for a 13 pc brush set that cost $13 is worth it.</li>
            <li>These have a distinct made-in-China look (and smell--</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also true that one of the foundation brushes lost a hair on its first use.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup anymore, but when I do, I like to do it well and</li>
            <li>The faces brushes are ok but tend to leave bristles on your face and are not as soft as I would like.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft and</li>
            <li>For this price even if you were to get one or two brushes you would use often it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Love all the brushes each one has a purpose and they are all extremely soft and work well on the face.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really good in the sense that they don&#x27;t shed,  however they are extremely rough.</li>
            <li>Extra carrying pouch was a nice added touch.  </li>
            <li>The pouch they come in is really handy in storing the brushes and you can even carry it your purse if necessary for touch ups.</li>
            <li>These brushes aren&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li>These brushes seem pretty cool.</li>
            <li>but it offers such a great variety for beginners.</li>
            <li>I love how well organized it is, and the covers that come with the fluffy brushes to keep the bristles nice</li>
            <li>I took the advice from one of the comments I read and washed the brushes with baby shampoo in warm water (I recommend the same)  </li>
            <li>I Love how soft the hair bristles are.</li>
            <li>To sum it up, they work, they aren&#x27;t rough, but you can tell when you use it that the quality (of the hairs) isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>but so far, but they seem alright. :)</li>
            <li>I love these brushes they are soft  </li>
            <li>Also comes in a nice red faux leather pouch.</li>
            <li>but overall they are nice brushes</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Coastal scents also have a natural and synthetic 22 piece brush mix that is much better than these.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old brushes, firm edges are great for applying makeup with definition.</li>
            <li>Come in nice red pouch.</li>
            <li>It is ok for beginners, but if you are a professional I would not</li>
            <li>This was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>probably worth</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and there&#x27;s not too many of them</li>
            <li>I do wish I got to choose the color of the set, mine is red but would have liked a choice.</li>
            <li>it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>these brushes are so soft and easy to clean i love they color and the pink on the brushes don&#x27;t chip :)</li>
            <li>love how soft and they blend well.</li>
            <li>So soft and silky I love how these brushes feel on my face.</li>
            <li>nice for makeup.everything for the basic and median makeup can be found.</li>
            <li>The set looks nice and is portable with the pouch, but those are the only positives.  </li>
            <li>inferior bristles hardly worth salvaging two of them.</li>
            <li>I do not need the big blush brushes but still nice to have.  </li>
            <li>you can never have to many makeup brushes and they&#x27;re so soft</li>
            <li>The brushes come in a nice pouch with individual slots for each brush that folds up.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a nice red leather case.</li>
            <li>I have waited several months to post this review, hoping that my first impressions of the set being nice would eventually come true, but the set just keeps degrading, and I have to advise against getting this set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I wash them every couple of weeks and the brushes have rarely lost any hair.</li>
            <li>The pouch is red, and professional looking, and the brushes are great for $12.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it is everything it was advertised it as being, and it really is worth buying...</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes heads came off, which can be fixed with glue after about a month.</li>
            <li>worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The colors are fun and when you lie them out, it brightens up your room.</li>
            <li>My 17 yr old daughter has been after me to buy more brushes, but when I looked at the price per brush</li>
            <li>These are incredibly nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and i also love how soft it feels on my face and&lt;br /&gt;how</li>
            <li>They are nicely made and come in a nice tie-up bag and appear more expensive than the asking price.</li>
            <li>will deff recommend this product its worth the price</li>
            <li>As a beginner I think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Also - there are a couple of brushes which look almost the same, so it would have been nice to see a list of each brush and what they are used for.</li>
            <li>But overall, they a nice brushes.</li>
            <li>So they are worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice but the larger face brushes leave bristles after use.</li>
            <li>I only use them to apply my own makeup</li>
            <li>Def worth the money</li>
            <li>They come in so handy for multiple things.</li>
            <li>they are easy to clean and are stredy so far</li>
            <li>Will buy more once I need to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li>she was thrilled to get them as they were on her wish list and didn&#x27;t realize that there was anything personal in the sack of gifts.</li>
            <li>for i still think they are OK just not as soft as i would like.</li>
            <li>look professional- love the colors.</li>
            <li>It comes in a really nice red, pleather case that rolls and ties.</li>
            <li>It is worth buying.</li>
            <li>Gave this as a Christmas to my teen daughter, who loved it and wants to give as gifts to her friends...</li>
            <li>...not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good quality brushes with nice diversity in soft to firm.</li>
            <li>Comes in nice red bag.</li>
            <li>I love my Shany Professional 13 piece cosmetic brush set.</li>
            <li>I have waited several months to post this review, hoping that my first impressions of the set being nice would eventually come true, but the set just keeps degrading, and I have to advise against getting this set of brushes.</li>
            <li>She was surprised when she received them, but love them.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and have all sizes you might need for different makeup applications.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the red color, make them look cheap, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>A couple of them are a little too stiff for my taste (kind of scratchy on the skin) but the majority of them are perfect.</li>
            <li>They barely smelled (not sure why so many people had SUPER smelly brushes), and the pouch was beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is bulky enough (even without the brushes in it) that I can&#x27;t imagine ever using it to travel with because I have no need to carry that many brushes with me, but some may find it very useful for travel/</li>
            <li>they work amazingly with the loose pigments i bought and to keep the brushes clean</li>
            <li>and they are super soft and pretty i am in love</li>
            <li>At first, they were soft and smooth, but the plastic case smells strongly of plastic.</li>
            <li>These are a nice set of brushes if you are first starting out on your make-up journey, but they wear quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a very positive experience with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>For right now, I&#x27;d say the packaging was great but the leather case that it came in had a patch missing from the front.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are perfect, they are not fluffy but not too stiff-</li>
            <li>so when applying makeup it is applied appropriately with no mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend a little more money on something I know for a fact that is a good, high quality product.</li>
            <li>I was glad I bought a set for myself as I was originally looking to buy a set for a gift only.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is the perfect makeup brush set, at an outrageously low price.</li>
            <li>but many other manufacturers and vendors are charging much much more.</li>
            <li>pouch wore out quickly and fell apart after a month of (gentle!)</li>
            <li>Came quickly and exactly like it stated it would come.</li>
            <li>The Brushes got here within two days which was super fast!</li>
            <li>Also recieved them pretty quick &amp;</li>
            <li>I was suprised by how soft and comfortable the bristles are, the case they come in is not of extreme high quality but still very good, and extremly useful for storage with how it rolls</li>
            <li>so i suggested you keep them clean as much as possible! :)</li>
            <li>super soft, easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are decent and a good option for back up brushes</li>
            <li>Anyways I really advise you guys to invest in a brand that your familiar with and can go to a store and see, touch, and test BEFORE you buy.</li>
            <li>Other than that good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone who wants quality makeup brushes for cheap!</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>Just the right stiffness and softness.  </li>
            <li>it is right at your fingertips.</li>
            <li>The case has embossing on the lower right corner of the opening flap.</li>
            <li>just right as Goldie Locks would say</li>
            <li>and I got it right on time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brushes look just right, though.  </li>
            <li>I swear my throat is irritated right now.  </li>
            <li>and I always have the right brushes when I travel.</li>
            <li>you are looking for eye brushes than this may be the right set for you.</li>
            <li>I got these about a month ago, and started using the brushes right</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m about to purchase another set right now...</li>
            <li>Another thing, is right when I received them I immediately felt the powder and blush brush and some bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li>makeup falls right off.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t labeled right and some of the brushes weren&#x27;t there like they are on the pictures that were shown.</li>
            <li>the price it right.</li>
            <li>Also they pick up just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>it slid right off the wand part [which i doubt it should do].</li>
            <li>This kit had all the right stuff.</li>
            <li>all right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in Aruba right now</li>
            <li>This is the right price for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>You would want to wash them right?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right number of brushes for my purposes.</li>
            <li>The blush brush is very easy to use when applying light blush on and the tiny brush 2nd to last on the right in the given picture is just so handy!</li>
            <li>great set and value, I recently bought urban decays naked contouring palette and this set help me make magic!</li>
            <li>First off, the photo makes the brushes look large and very useful.</li>
            <li>I use the brushes on my new Urban Decay Naked pallets and they are great!</li>
            <li>These were great the first few months, but after a while the brushes separated from the handles.</li>
            <li>I was really unsure about these brushes at first because they were really cheap</li>
            <li>They will be a dream for those of us who travel for work since you can fold them up into such a compact package while still being able to carry a full set of 13 brushes.  </li>
            <li>the red case is so cute and the brushes are full and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I think they are perfectly suited for your average makeup wearing individual...</li>
            <li>Since i only use make up for cosplay it ok for me but it not that great like I don&#x27;t even know what half of the brush is used for</li>
            <li>They have not shed much, was and dry really well and are all around great brushes.</li>
            <li>The pouch came in a beautiful red color and the brushes were individually wraped.</li>
            <li>I have yet to see the ferrule of one of these brushes come apart from the handle, which is something I saw happen with my older cheap brush set.</li>
            <li>, they clean well and are a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad set, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it, but it just would be a lot easier if the brushes were number correctly.</li>
            <li>I use the large full circular brushes for lightweight application and blending of face powder...</li>
            <li>The hair is very coarse and breaks off very easily.</li>
            <li>The brush heads (metal from red part) come off very easily.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I like about this brush set is the handles, they&#x27;re very easy to hold and move around.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get new brushes</li>
            <li>nothing major, ok for the price.</li>
            <li>and when I found this set at a very reasonable price, I decided it was worth trying out.  </li>
            <li>high light foundation, shadows etc.</li>
            <li>My hopes were high, since the makeup collection I have from Shany is so fantastic, I hoped the brushes would be as well.</li>
            <li>From the reviews I was expecting them to be either really bad, or totally awesome, but I find them to be pretty average and for the price I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I wash my brushes daily and they still look as good as new.</li>
            <li>Brush\\&quot; isn&#x27;t plush or very large in diameter at all.</li>
            <li>work great and shed very little</li>
            <li>i guess its Ok, i was expecting better quality based on previous reviews but</li>
            <li>I primarily use the brushes for applying eye shadows and I am please because the various brushes make it easy to apply the eye shadows and blend colors.</li>
            <li>I believe there are too many sticks, but you should focus more on quality instead of providing more item, for daily use we usually use around 5 brushes will be fine</li>
            <li>The handles are wooden, covered in a cheap paint that chips easily.</li>
            <li>Love them and would definitely recommend them to anyone considering purchasing a new set of brushes!!!!</li>
            <li>thanks i received my cosmetic brush set and was satisfied i like the way the brushes feel very soft and haven&#x27;t tried them yet</li>
            <li>Good quality, very professional packaging and will definitely order their products again.</li>
            <li>They come in a pretty elegant pouch that matches the brushes and trhe brushes are really pretty and soft</li>
            <li>I bought this small set as a gift for a teenager, I thought it would make a great starter set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it comes like this because you can easily take it with you in your purse if you need to, or if you dont have a big bathroom (like myself) its hard to find a spot for everything and the roll up bag makes it easy.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the brushes shed all over my face, even though I have barely cleaned them.</li>
            <li>These brushes were nice initially, however I bought them earlier this year, more than six months ago but not up to a year.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the brushes shed all over my face, even though I have barely cleaned them.</li>
            <li>Long handles are nice.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about these, but after the first use the bristles on the brush were all ready falling out.</li>
            <li>If you are a person who is very experienced with putting make-up on and you have experimented with different types of brushes, you&#x27;ll be able to discern which brushes are great and worth the money and which ones are not only a waste of money but a waste of make-up.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very useful, and it is easy to use by following the guide.</li>
            <li>If u are looking to build up your make-up brush set quickly, this is a smart way to do it.</li>
            <li>The larger prowder brushes are soft and feel very good on your skin, and the smaller brushes are just dense enough to be more precise.</li>
            <li>And more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft and really hold shadow well, picking it right up and not dropping a bit as I move it to my eye.</li>
            <li>When you first open it there will be a very strong scent, please wash before use.</li>
            <li>these brushes are ok, i was expecting something a little bit more but for 26 bucks thats what you get</li>
            <li>In a sexy red hot color!</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money and get a better set.</li>
            <li>I would say pay a little more $ and buy something better</li>
            <li>I want to return this item and pay a little more for a better quality.</li>
            <li>; brush set for a little bit more, but still had &amp;#34;PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34; brushes with more brushes in the set.</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t dense enough to give you a flawless full coverage and you waste too much product by just trying to apply an even amount on your face.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the color red, the brushes are natural and there are so many.</li>
            <li>Very long handles, would be best to apply to other people.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great, very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sigma brushes if you want amazing high quality brushes and have a little more money to spend....</li>
            <li>THese brushes came super fast and they really are Mac quality brushes, I have actually repurchased as gifts bcuz they are so amazing.</li>
            <li>Case is soft and flexible, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>I just want to wash them off in warm water and pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li>It is a fun set of many different kinds of brushes.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are great quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I only use the smaller eye ones but they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li>They are soft, well shaped, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>the brushes were in no way soft, and they feel apart really easily.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of professional brushes myself, but found these brushes well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and the red case is a bonus</li>
            <li>Got to my house super fast.</li>
            <li>I already had great brushes, but these are RED, and the bristles are all well made and haven&#x27;t fallen apart yet - a year later.  </li>
            <li>I do independent films and these brushes come in handy so much with make-up.</li>
            <li>Great set of brushes for such a low price!</li>
            <li>they ship super fast and for they&#x27;re price</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>She is very happy with this brush set, and only costs a few dollars.</li>
            <li>Good buy for a young girl just starting out with makeup.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the package I was pleased to see how professional the brushes looked, though when i can closer to the brushes i began to notice it had an absolutely repulsive smell to it.</li>
            <li>The product did arrive FAST in 3 days in a nice red bagget</li>
            <li>the brushes are so soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are cheaply made and the bristles do not feel good on the delicate skin on your eye.</li>
            <li>But the brushes are good quality (so far) and I would purchase this set again overall.</li>
            <li>The ordered came very quickly and the brush bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>Great brushed especially for the price</li>
            <li>think this would be a fine starter kit (and a nice present) for a young lady just starting out wearing makeup or newly out on her own.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice about this is the price, all these tools that make any amateur seem like their own makeup professional.</li>
            <li>The brush case is so nice, to keep the brushes from floating loosely in the makeup drawer.</li>
            <li>While the variety of brushes and value was pretty good the brush quality is less than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Today I used them for the first time after I bought them, they are really soft, each brush is easy to access.</li>
            <li>I have good things, as well as bad things to say about this purchase, but overall, I am pleased and happy with what I purchased at the price of which I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the box though, there was the gross smell of cheap cheap pleather thats been sitting in a closed warm container.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try out this very reasonably priced set.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like em very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>This product had very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It was shipped out very fast</li>
            <li>i recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable priced at $12.99 on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i ordered them and not only did they take forever to get to my house, but they were very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>pouch these brushes come in is red and the material used (some sort of plastic) feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>Besides that, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the lip gloss brush and the eyeliner brush was pretty much a fail because it didn&#x27;t put eyeliner on my eyelid at all, it just seemed to smear right off.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look cheap and flimsy like many other brushes at this price range.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and easy to use, I absolutely love the color and overall they just rule!</li>
            <li>I used the sponge-tip applicators that came with eye shadow to apply it and owned a VERY cheap, small set of blush/eye/lip brushes that I used for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer a brush that is a little firmer and these also seem to shed a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular kit has 13 brushes in total, and gives a nice variety-</li>
            <li>They are super super soft brushes.</li>
            <li>Super soft and super durable.</li>
            <li>All in all, I definitely recommend spending a little more money for a set that will have good quality.</li>
            <li>It did have a very strong leathery smell which it takes a few washes to get rid off, but for the price and considering for who and what I bought them for very worth it.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what it said and advertised.</li>
            <li>My brushes arrived on the exact date I was told it would come.  </li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>Items are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes and use them daily!</li>
            <li>It has all the basic brushes, plus a couple of more &amp;#34;sophisticated&amp;#34; ones.</li>
            <li>They only shed a tiny bit the first time I washed them, but have help up remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>this is my first ever brush set</li>
            <li>so I had someone buy it for me and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>one can get better quality at lesser price.</li>
            <li>There are still many brushes I have never used, and they tend to get warped in the red sleeve they come wrapped up in.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be using these brushes till they ruin. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many left of those.</li>
            <li>Comes in plastic protectors and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>This was my first brush set</li>
            <li>First of all, shipping was a joke.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes, especially if you are a beginner with makeup.</li>
            <li>Especially they are in her favorite colors.</li>
            <li>Very soft; which is very important to me as i have pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>I most likely will buy another set for my sister.</li>
            <li>and they most definitely are.</li>
            <li>Very Feminine!</li>
            <li>I love the red pouch they come in too</li>
            <li>love the red leather wrap case they come in too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they were shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li>but of course with a higher price tag.</li>
            <li>It came in a very cute red case and the brushes are as soft as I was hoping they would be.</li>
            <li>The brushes had a funny smell when I first opened the box not to mention the brushes were already losing hair.</li>
            <li>The brushes that are sown in the first picture are not ALL the ones you will receive.     </li>
            <li>I needed another eyebrow/eyelash brush and wanted a fan-type brush, and realized for the price, I was getting a better deal buying this entire set- especially with the $5 coupon (making the set about $8).</li>
            <li>I also got the red case! :)</li>
            <li>First off, please wash the brushes immediately.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you love to play with different eye shadows</li>
            <li>When I first saw the price I thought there was a catch</li>
            <li>The brushes are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>th biggesst brush , powder brush, a bunch of th bristles just came off when i washed it for the first time.</li>
            <li>the product came exactly as described and came to my home promptly.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>(they aren&#x27;t going to be the softest you&#x27;ve ever bought, you need to be logical when its $15 )</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to bend it back</li>
            <li>bristles were pretty sparse</li>
            <li>but if you read they say you need to wash them BEFORE you use them for the first time.</li>
            <li>first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I worked as a make up artist for Estee Lauder for several years &amp; love their brushes, however, they can be pricey to replace.  </li>
            <li>They work very well!</li>
            <li>But really, for that price?!</li>
            <li>Have I ever been so embarrassed as when she opened the set (for the first time, I hadn&#x27;t opened it yet) and bristles were sitting on the brushes.  </li>
            <li>the case kinda smelled funny when i received it in the mail</li>
            <li>The color is pretty.</li>
            <li>The case does smell at first butonce out of the box it starts to not smell.</li>
            <li>There is an insert included that lets you know what each brush is for, which I found to be helpful not knowing the first thing about makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>This product is both pretty and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>My pouch came in a pretty red color and I love that it has a flap that covers up all of your brush heads before you roll it up.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed playing with all the different brushes and finding out which ones do this or that.</li>
            <li>I love using all the brushes especially the face/powder and blush brush!!</li>
            <li>The first time I used them a couple of stay hairs fell out</li>
            <li>I love that I got a red Pouch to match the brushes.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using more of there products in the future.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed with these brushes, firstly the \\&quot;big\\&quot; ones are small and really only work for blush or highlighting/shading.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think it can be healthy inhaling the fumes.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed is the bag or carrier (however you want to name)</li>
            <li>, it looks exactly like the online picture</li>
            <li>the first time I try all the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>will definitely order more makeup brushes again via amazon.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use them to get ready for the graduation!</li>
            <li>Recieved this product fast and intact!</li>
            <li>I was able to hot glue it back</li>
            <li>they shed a lot after the first wash.</li>
            <li>but overall they are okay.</li>
            <li>I just love eye shadows and different looks with the eye.</li>
            <li>overall, i&#x27;m satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>but they do what it says on the tin ;-)</li>
            <li>I love the ability to choose different colors</li>
            <li>This brush set is my first brush set all the brushes</li>
            <li>I would definitely look at better brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love all the individual pockets to keep the brushes organized.</li>
            <li>No weird powder either.</li>
            <li>Quality of brushes was exactly as described .  </li>
            <li>Overall no chemical smell when my friend and I opened and we are pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted in a starter kit</li>
            <li>After looking at tons of different brush sets and reading so many reviews, I decided to go with this one.  </li>
            <li>After that, I had no issues and they have been working very well for about 3 months!</li>
            <li>and I would definitely give them another try (on a better quality brush set of course)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>You really get your moneys worth with this brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it comes with so many brushes all for different purposes</li>
            <li>the hairs don&#x27;t shed and they seem to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing a cosmetic brush set.</li>
            <li>I have been using them from the first day I got them.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying them.</li>
            <li>Just remember when buying this item that the total number of brushes in the picture featured, is more than what you get.</li>
            <li>Overall I still love the Shany brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy better quality brushes next time.</li>
            <li>Love the red color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll love that there is such a variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, because I don&#x27;t use make up on a daily basics, but I figure to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are two different face brushes, I use one for bronzer and one for powder.</li>
            <li>I think for the most part they will last.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>The case itself smells a bit when you first get it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It also comes in a lovely red case so the brushes are neatly organized.</li>
            <li>and they seem to be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Other than that i am really enjoying the product!</li>
            <li>On the up side, I still love the red pouch!</li>
            <li>Came in the mail pretty fast and came with a case to take on the go!</li>
            <li>And you obviously can&#x27;t get much better on the price.</li>
            <li>pretty color and pretty case!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Just want I was expecting, arrived in expected time, nicely packaged and</li>
            <li>These brushes smell funny.</li>
            <li>There was an odor when I first opened the box</li>
            <li>The eyehadow brushes blend and pack on very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>They all have a specific purpose, and thats what I love.</li>
            <li>Theyre exactly what I was looking for..</li>
            <li>this are my first brushes ever</li>
            <li>but I will definitely be buying more products by Shany.</li>
            <li>pleased with this purchase overall, would buy again!</li>
            <li>She is gonna get her Naked Platte 2 on top of this also.</li>
            <li>The red is so cute</li>
            <li>I thought it was value for money at first but upon receiving the brushes</li>
            <li>my make up has never looked better, I&#x27;ll not use the traditional make up applicators ever again it&#x27;s brushes from here on..</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these brushes and the eyeshadows. :)</li>
            <li>I use the powder brush regularly and it works so much better than the Sephora one I had before.</li>
            <li>I love these, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as needed and wanted.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived on-time and packaged in a pretty pouch.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of your products in the future.</li>
            <li>so I guess you could say these are my first &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I have found better at the same time.</li>
            <li>and you get so many different brushes.</li>
            <li>if its the same with others but the color on my eyes would spread better i believe with a softer brush.</li>
            <li>Only wish they told you what each brush was for!! :)</li>
            <li>You get so much bang for your buck here!</li>
            <li>partially why im thrilled to have these brushes.</li>
            <li>First of all they smelled funky.</li>
            <li>I love the red case the brushes are in.</li>
            <li>I received them fast and on time!</li>
            <li>but I really like the quality of these brushes, will order from Shany again!</li>
            <li>the smaller brushes work better.</li>
            <li>but i dont really have anything to complain about!</li>
            <li>This is my first set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>I am confident that they will last me a while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got some more solid makeups that these brushes have issues with.</li>
            <li>is pretty as well.</li>
            <li>There are the basic variety, which will work for a beginner and a more seasoned makeup artist.</li>
            <li>but I did wash them before I used them first.</li>
            <li>2 smaller more detailing eyeshadow brushes, an eyebrow comb, lip color brush, and a smudger type brush.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set as my first set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I became interested in buying this package of cosmetic brushes after my sister showed me the set she bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>All these brushes work very well for me!</li>
            <li>on the medium sized blush brush, the top disconnected from the red part of the brush.</li>
            <li>They are durable and pretty.  </li>
            <li>The first time for myself and then again for a friend for christmas.</li>
            <li>The ones pictured look higher quality and fuller.</li>
            <li>It is my first brush set</li>
            <li>My first ever brush set.</li>
            <li>i like my brushes they dont smell like others do at first</li>
            <li>I love the color red</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to use them first before I&#x27;ll know the quality of the brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the red pouch it comes with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this for red lipstick, it was OK, but it sheds like CRAZY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, but definitely not \\&quot;fluffy,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Again, only OK.</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and haven&#x27;t fallen apart, but they do seem a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty, but not functional.</li>
            <li>Brushes are exactly what advertise.</li>
            <li>The brushes look nice, but when you first use them they are rough and prick at your face.</li>
            <li>love the color i got mine in color RED .</li>
            <li>For the price they do their job, however a couple of them started to shed after first time use.</li>
            <li>I definitely will be ordering from here soon. :)</li>
            <li>Everything was there, it even came with a cute red case to store my brushes away in when I&#x27;m not using them</li>
            <li>I wanted to give them a try for that same reason, ur better off saving money to buy quality brushes</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>, I was exactly the one I was hoping to get.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash them with some baby shampoo to get the extra dye out before the first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pro is absolutely the price!</li>
            <li>OK I HAVE ONLY USED ONE BRUSH</li>
            <li>SO FAR IT REMINDED OF A CHEAP PAINT BRUSH BUT HVNT USED THE OTHERS</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been really using because I barely wear makeup any more..</li>
            <li>So I recently started doing make up, and needed a lot more brushes than I thought.</li>
            <li>It came so fast!</li>
            <li>The packaging is so pretty as well.</li>
            <li>Love the red!</li>
            <li>First off, it was neatly and well-packaged.</li>
            <li>But the brushes were exactly the ones from the picture.</li>
            <li>They seem pretty durable and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be trying more of their products.</li>
            <li>I paid more but they last.</li>
            <li>Both my daughters love all the brushes and use them daily.</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL THE BRUSHES SMELL.</li>
            <li>Application of products goes on smoothly and professionally.  </li>
            <li>Well, you get exactly what you paid for.</li>
            <li>i more that likely won&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>and it did smell like glue when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future for gifts.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !&lt;</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more from this company.</li>
            <li>Brushes came exactly as described here.</li>
            <li>I saw the same items in the store which was 10x more</li>
            <li>Actually they all are I&#x27;ve seen $1 brushes that are better than them.  </li>
            <li>At first look though, it looks like it will serve it&#x27;s purpose we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li>Overall they are not bad, I really enjoy having access to brushes while doing my make-up and others&#x27; make-up as well.</li>
            <li>they were exactly what i thought they were gonna be but softer</li>
            <li>This is my first cosmetic brush set</li>
            <li>Definitely purchasing another set with more brushes.</li>
            <li>I use the big brush mostly, maybe it can be repackaged with 6-Pieces.</li>
            <li>Also the bristles have stayed pretty well intact after being used.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I actually returned this Shany set because there are so many brushes</li>
            <li>They do have a funny smell when first opened, but I always wash my brushes before I use them anyway.</li>
            <li>so I still don&#x27;t exactly know which brush is used for what</li>
            <li>The first thing I would like to say is that it came in the time it said it would with no damage at all.</li>
            <li>They quality is stunning and it came very quickly in a red leather case!</li>
            <li>And i love the red color of the handels and the case.</li>
            <li>I will leave off a star because some bristles have come out after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I love the red pouch it comes in.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described and affordable.</li>
            <li>I chose this set of brushes because it has a lot of sizes and love the red color.</li>
            <li>i loved them i just got them used a few already.</li>
            <li>Good, firm concealer brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And even after me having these for a few months they still work just as good as when i got them.</li>
            <li>If you want good, everyday make-up brushes that won&#x27;t break the bank, then I recommend this set.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and the application is very smooth and well-covered compared to many other brushes.</li>
            <li>looks super high quality.</li>
            <li>Great at first but didn&#x27;t last very long for me.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up much eye shadow,but they are very soft and for a cheap order, I am overall pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I mean, if the price looks too good to be true, then it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are so soft and pretty!!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery time, cute pink carrying case.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging and it comes with a little apron I love the way the brushes feel I will definently order again thanks so much</li>
            <li>Overall they are good quality for a beginner make-up guru or someone that wants a little more variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>complaints are the strong plastic smell from the case and since I am new to this it would be nice if the brushes had names on them as there are a few that I am unsure of their purpose..</li>
            <li>I recieved these yesterday, although beautiful the scent is not pleasant.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving these brushes, I did not notice a harsh chemical smell, and thought that they would be fine; however, there are many things I dislike about these brushes.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is adorable as well and has held up to a few months of use fine.</li>
            <li>I only use it for traveling because I also own the 32 Super Professional Set from Shany (which I also highly recommend).</li>
            <li>The brushes do shed a bit, especially the fan brush, but overall they&#x27;re a pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>But other than that, they are really nice.</li>
            <li>These brushes would be better of for painting on flat paper.     </li>
            <li>I have read other reviews about the smell of the brushes but honestly my brushes didn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more flat, and does shed a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good set for a young teen new to make up.</li>
            <li>I got the Red one which is the color i wanted it is a bright Cherry Red</li>
            <li>I think the price and the way the brush has such soft bristles  feels on my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not well constructed and it doesn&#x27;t look nearly as neat or clean as the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li>I love the way the brushed are tapered and they&#x27;re super soft as well.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a good value price-wise, but several of the brushes are too similar &amp; I had hoped for a contouring eye-shadow brush which was not included.</li>
            <li>they are no where near my professional mac brushes but they are better than the ones ive bought at target.</li>
            <li>Many different ones to use and works very well..</li>
            <li>But when I opened it, I was absolutely ecstatic that mine was red :]</li>
            <li>I may just switch these for my personal brushes I like them so much. :)</li>
            <li>They are good if you&#x27;re not a huge makeup fan, it holds the make up very well.</li>
            <li>They were packaged very well and came with a cute red pouch and each brush was wrapped in a plastic protector.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed at all and are very soft to the touch..and the tiny detailer brushes are useful when doing eyeliner on top or bottom using eyeshadow and also to blend it out.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re super soft, and very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also I was using baby shampoo which I use on all my brushes as it is very gentle and nurturing to the hair, especially natural.</li>
            <li>Ok, first off I was very hesitant to purchase these brushes simply because I don&#x27;t know that much about types of brushes and how to use them.</li>
            <li>For one, they are super soft!</li>
            <li>I can say that these are wonderful and the little hairs don&#x27;t end up all over your face like with other brands.</li>
            <li>All in all, these are a pretty decent set of brushes!</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft, and I cant wait to start experimenting with makeup with these!</li>
            <li>I mean, I only have 2 eyes, lol~!</li>
            <li>Buy one brush at a store for the same cost of these 12, you can really do anything with these and make sure to have a large variety of colors too.</li>
            <li>but I think I should have rinsed them off and let them dry first to get out most of the loose/unglued hairs.</li>
            <li>Because of previous reviews saying there was some kind of powder or dust already on them from shipping or something I did go ahead and wash them and the case when I first got them,</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re super soft and apply my eyeshadow really well!</li>
            <li>That is about all that is positive that can be said about them.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and have nice long handles.</li>
            <li>The full brush deposits the product on top of my pores and distributes it evenly for a natural finish  Also flexible flat brushes with slight pointed tip for precision application and blending are amazing to work with.   </li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are very nice, but the bigger brushes.... not as soft!</li>
            <li>And I must have ordered them right at the right time because I only paid $12.00 for the set and now they are up to $27.00, so I feel quite lucky.</li>
            <li>i loved the funky light green case it came in , I open it</li>
            <li>Her dog chewed them up pretty soon after getting them though, so she doesn&#x27;t have much idea about longevity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much smells like plastic</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve been eyeing this product for a long time.</li>
            <li>The other reason is they are so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Pretty much get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>and it really makes her look hot.</li>
            <li>and delivery was fast and came exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its not a horrible set if you are looking for a cheap set to give someone who is younger and just starting out with make up.</li>
            <li>Another minor complain is the red color of the pouch is hideous, but that&#x27;s just a minor detail, otherwise everything has been perfect.</li>
            <li>Clearly it is not MAC or Sigma, but it is OK;  Try it</li>
            <li>These are my first real brushes and I have had them for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li>the flat top really makes a difference in the appearance of your makeup</li>
            <li>Real Techniques is affordable and much much much higher quality than these brushes.</li>
            <li>This product was ok though the bristles where too long for some of the designs.</li>
            <li>I find the RealTechniques brushes to be of higher quality (but still reasonably priced) and, unlike these SHANY brushes which are made of animal hair, RT brushes are cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the RealTechniques brushes to be of higher quality (but still reasonably priced) and, unlike these SHANY brushes which are made of animal hair, RT brushes are cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the long handles.</li>
            <li>These brushes are not soo good, one of them is ridiculously small, that it doesn&#x27;t even look like a brush.</li>
            <li>THe brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li>Above all there are much much better brushes in this price range, real techniques makes an eye and face kit each about the price of these that absolutely tower over the quality of these.</li>
            <li>yes, the odor is there, but its not unpleasant or strong, it is like a new leather/chemical smell and it is only on the case not the brushes.</li>
            <li>Not exactly as seen in the photos, are more simple and the quality is not as high, but for the price are great, no brushes to blend and you have are simple</li>
            <li>like said in the other reviews and did not have a foul smell, just a kind of new scent (only a tad bit overwhelming)</li>
            <li>The brushes came quickly, they work more or less, and everything was as it said.</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first makeup brush set in an attempt to use makeup more regularly and acquire some new skills.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these, but suggest you get something to help preserve and clean the brushes to help them to stay looking and feeling like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few brushes daily for over a year and a half and they are still holding up as great as the day I bought them and are super easy to put away!</li>
            <li>the smaller ones fell apart easily.</li>
            <li>brushes are cheap, smell funny and overall</li>
            <li>And the red is easy to see in your makeup case.</li>
            <li>First of let me just say, I am not a make up snob, however, after ordering this cheap brush set, I can definitely ask myself, \\&quot;what was I thinking?\\</li>
            <li>They are super soft and have a ton of variety.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you re-shape your brushes once you have them washed and that you let them COMPLETELY dry before you try and use them.</li>
            <li>They are super soft.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still working/looking/feeling brand new.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re super soft and the makeup goes on evenly with them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one issue I have with the bigger brushes is that the bristles fall off easily.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and my mom says they do not shed.</li>
            <li>Super soft and works efficiently.</li>
            <li>The brushes are not labelled with their name (i.e., \\&quot;Blush brush\\&quot;) but are labelled with a number, so as long as you keep the enclosed pamphlet, you&#x27;ll be able to keep straight which brush is for what use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved doing my makeup but never took a real interest in using eye shadow until this past year.</li>
            <li>My Shany brushes came in a red pouch, it did smelled like plastic, but not as strong as some are saying.</li>
            <li>but it does have a strong smell when you open it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional make up artist, but I do know a good beauty product when I see one, and I definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>This brush is way to bushy and large to be used as a fondation brush</li>
            <li>Opening the case you will notice it is held shut by two large silver magnetic snaps.</li>
            <li>Two blush brushes, One large, one medium.</li>
            <li>; however I certainly would never buy them again or recommend them.</li>
            <li>and I certainly won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li>Large powder/blush brush-</li>
            <li>come in a large pouch that rolls up and ties around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells of pure chemicals and falls apart immediately.</li>
            <li>Large variety.  </li>
            <li>I use the large all-over shadow brush to blend powder shadow onto the rest of my eye after applying a cream shadow to just the lids, below the crease.</li>
            <li>Large shadow brush</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and dry and the pouch is easy to clean as well (I usually just take an antibacterial wipe for that).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty gross, and they aren&#x27;t very useful.</li>
            <li>Just add few more buks and buy one MAC brush!</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes a few weeks ago and i love them!</li>
            <li>What i don&#x27;t like about them is that there is just many flat brushes as opposed to blending brushes and cute other brushes.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love how they have the pouch with it!  </li>
            <li>Wow so many different brushes they work really well!</li>
            <li>The pouch looks awesome and the color is very stylish - bloody red.</li>
            <li>I am not a make up artist, just a regular person that needed new brushes, and I love them.</li>
            <li>And I discovered so many new uses for some of the different brush styles.  </li>
            <li>so i just got rid of the big ones bought better new ones and kept the eye-shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and I feel like they don&#x27;t pick up the product or apply it very well.</li>
            <li>I thought the price of this collection of SHANY Professional brushes was super reasonable for all you get.</li>
            <li>Actually it is perfect, compared to other much more expensive similar products, a wide range of brushes made good materials.</li>
            <li>I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these brushes - I could have paid a lot more for pretty much the same thing.  </li>
            <li>Hello I very much liked the brushes they were soft and very pretty; I love pink and black.</li>
            <li>With so many shapes and comfortable handles, these brushes will last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using them daily for about 2 months and each brush has held up just fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that small mishap, it&#x27;s a wonderful makeup brush set!</li>
            <li>Like any other Cosmetic brushes BE SURE TO WASH BEFORE YOUR FIRST TIME USE.</li>
            <li>The face brushes were fine for about 6 months, but after that, they started leaving gross hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li>They work fine for the price, but again, I&#x27;d probably buy just one or two brushes and not the set in the future.</li>
            <li>Also, the brushes look pretty decent online but do not be deceived.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are pretty decent, but after having them for one day, one of the brushes fell off of the handle.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t in the market for new brushes but for playing with eyeshadow colors I needed more than what I had and it was just cheaper to get a whole set like this instead of individual brushes.  </li>
            <li>To be quite honest I&#x27;ve always been a bit of a Tomboy in nature, you know, legos, Brio trains, and mud for me as a little girl.</li>
            <li>The little brush carrier is comes with is nice too.</li>
            <li>With that being said they work nice for how little I use them.</li>
            <li>Came in a nice little box, with a guide on how to use each brush.</li>
            <li>These contain natural fibers which make application so much smoother!!</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend you try this one first.</li>
            <li>She appears to be happy with them, and there were enough for her to give some to her little sister.</li>
            <li>This is a great little starter for a person that needs brushes for personal use.  </li>
            <li>Also I love the red, it gives it a little touch of sexy</li>
            <li>Now these are no where near Sigma soft, but fabulous eye brushes.  </li>
            <li>Think about what makeup you wear everyday/are comfortable wearing everyday, and buy brushes that fit your needs.</li>
            <li>cheap cheap not durable at all waste of money</li>
            <li>The brushes are of great quality (not cheap) and there are plenty different types.  </li>
            <li>If you want good brushes for cheap dont even hesitate, like me u wont be sorry.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap price you can&#x27;t expect much, however this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>to be honest I thought it was going to be a bad product, but its good, I don&#x27;t give 5 stars because it came with a smell I didn&#x27;t like, maybe chemical, so I had to soak them for a bit in soap, .but</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because their products are inexpensive but the product is great and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It would also be a nice kit for someone of any age who did not have the money (or want to spend the money) on the more expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than what I expected.</li>
            <li>They are made out of real hair (badger and goat)  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much, but for the number of brushes and the price, I figured I would try them.</li>
            <li>They make putting on make up so much easier, and it stays where I put it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the brushes.</li>
            <li>I expected more quality.</li>
            <li>dog very well though.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s probably not something you should be sniffing all that much.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes, but getting them to me was the problem, it took alot longer than i expected</li>
            <li>After having had this for over a year now, I have to say it is a bit too much for my needs.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift and my sister really likes it</li>
            <li>are very sturdy</li>
            <li>Given these brushes are not MAC or Sephora quality, they are really a bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Yes, shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li>However....they aren&#x27;t made from real animal hair...</li>
            <li>If you really into make up, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>I was nervous as to how the quality of these brushes would be but they are holding up very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>This has lasted much longer than some of the MAC brushes I have</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take much time for the package to get to me and nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li>She says they work very well</li>
            <li>The item does cone very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>And the organizer pouch is very durable.</li>
            <li>These brushes don&#x27;t pick up much product making application take much longer than it should.</li>
            <li>I used it this morning while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>yucks, thus threw that away immediately after opening as it is really \\&quot;melted\\&quot; till out of shape.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>But who wants to spend a ton of money on one brush or a set of three?  </li>
            <li>- they work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>But I really like them.</li>
            <li>This product was ok, but not fully what expected.</li>
            <li>These brushes are absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From all the reviews, I expected to receive top notch brushes.</li>
            <li>really thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner with the whole</li>
            <li>If you wash these brushes before you use them, they won&#x27;t shed as much.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up the product very well either.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are very well made and have covers.</li>
            <li>my whole bathroom stunk.</li>
            <li>the eyeshadow brushes are very thing.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had much chance to use them yet.</li>
            <li>the bristles are soft and totally worth your money I have had them since April 2014</li>
            <li>I really like the varied selection of the brushes.</li>
            <li>bristles themselves are a lot better than i expected.</li>
            <li>so I tend to avoid even purchasing whole sets.</li>
            <li>But I was very dissatisfied...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>very soft&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>The makeup brush kit was much prettier in person.</li>
            <li>All my friends and sisters want one, too, and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this set.</li>
            <li>was very please n satifide with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the set I got was defective, but I absolutely would not buy Shany brushes again because of this experience.  </li>
            <li>FAst</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes aren&#x27;t very versatile either and there isn&#x27;t much of a variety.</li>
            <li>These brushes shed so much.  </li>
            <li>I was worried what color I would get haha.</li>
            <li>I raved about these brushes so much after I got them that one of my sisters bought them.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brushes always fall out and they are very scratchy.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>and fast the package was well put to together</li>
            <li>It is alright for a starter set or a set for someone who doesn&#x27;t care about the quality as much.</li>
            <li>So if you are buying this because you really want a carrying case, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satified with the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people complain so much about the smell</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The reason it is four stars is because I don&#x27;t really like the case.  </li>
            <li>for the price you can&#x27;t ask too much.</li>
            <li>Really like the assortment and quality of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>They shed so much, I couldn&#x27;t even use one of them.  </li>
            <li>but i really like the pouch they came in.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care since the brushes are what I was ordering.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need to buy really expensive/pro brushes when these do what you the pro brushes do.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a cheap last minute go to</li>
            <li>The bag however does have a real leather smell.</li>
            <li>and I use them very day</li>
            <li>I did not care much for the travel case it came with.</li>
            <li>They are made of real animal fur</li>
            <li>The product is very sheek in presentation.</li>
            <li>I dont remember how much I purchased them for but</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>love the packaging minus the smell.</li>
            <li>The one thing that you ABSOLUTELY must do is WASH the brushes with hand soap.</li>
            <li>For the money, you really can&#x27;t beat this set.</li>
            <li>Brushes work very well</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to put much product on the brushes to get it to apply.</li>
            <li>but I still use the ones that are together and they still work really well</li>
            <li>I handle it very lighltly</li>
            <li>I was expecting a much softer brush.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I used each of them, they are all very usefull.</li>
            <li>they are the softest brushes i have ever used very afforable</li>
            <li>i recommend this absolutely...</li>
            <li>the pouch is also very convinient ...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to buy this product!</li>
            <li>They are very durable.</li>
            <li>I used to have elf brushes but those brushes got really ruff with my makeup and was always falling apart and they always have an odor to them even after I wash them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The quality is very shabby and the bristles feel like animal hair.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the softest but that docent bother me too much.</li>
            <li>While they aren&#x27;t Mac quality, they are very comparable with Bamboo and Ulta brands..</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that for the price I really like them</li>
            <li>I checked each brush to see if I could gently pull out the hairs, I could not.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very content with the product and the service.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like their product</li>
            <li>REAL SOON ...</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush set.</li>
            <li>powder brush sheds too much though.</li>
            <li>it looks very profesional, and the set of brushes its well</li>
            <li>but I didnt like the bristles of them too much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>They shipped fast and arrived before the date is said to arrive so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but well, can&#x27;t expect that much.</li>
            <li>In addition, it smell as plastic... or as chemical... if you are looking for something to cheap, this could be enough.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect that much for this amount of money</li>
            <li>the only thing i dont like about the brushes is that the fan brush is really cheap.</li>
            <li>and before I really knew anything about makeup/brushes.</li>
            <li>Even then, they were absolute s</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind though</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>If you need a bunch of brushes for a reasonable price, then you should defenitly consider buying these brushes.</li>
            <li>Got it fast</li>
            <li>The price is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast too.</li>
            <li>I got them for Christmas from my husband because he knew I really like my brushes</li>
            <li>but he doesn&#x27;t know much about them</li>
            <li>I prefer Sigma or Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li>This brush is an absolute MUST for liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with this set.</li>
            <li>They are a lot for the money &amp; reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really mind picking them off my face...</li>
            <li>So, for the price I was not expecting much.</li>
            <li>ITS VERY CONVENIENT FOR TRAVEL.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t really shed for me, even after I cleaned them.</li>
            <li>something you really don&#x27;t want on your face, applying makeup.</li>
            <li>The plus is that it doesn&#x27;t really shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These Shany brushes are much nicer.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why I gave 2 stars because of fast shipment.</li>
            <li>At the price I was not expecting much</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>I expected better quality.</li>
            <li>but they really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use them because they just aren&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li>The bristols aren&#x27;t shedding and it hold makeup really well.</li>
            <li>There is an itemized description for each brush which is really helpful.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s very convenient for keeping the brushes in.</li>
            <li>I got this product soooo fast</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need all of them by any means, and probably wouldn&#x27;t order the whole set again.  </li>
            <li>but most likely will only last a year maybe two at most</li>
            <li>I expected so much more from these brushes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much out of these because of the price.</li>
            <li>I find myself constantly trying to re-do my makeup, because these brushes just do not have a smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like these brushes holding up really well</li>
            <li>, they keep up really neat</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to hold much shadow.</li>
            <li>Great set of different brushed and such.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to keep my $$$ brushes for my HG products, which are all gentle, neutral colors.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It does not play much role to me, because I do not use these brushes for my makeup a lot anyway.</li>
            <li>so i was very impress by the price.</li>
            <li>these brushes work very well to apply makeup</li>
            <li>i dont wear much makeup.</li>
            <li>But, I really like this set, for the money</li>
            <li>and they really hold the powder eyeshadows and make up</li>
            <li>it is more than I expected</li>
            <li>this product is working very well</li>
            <li>, I know not everyone wants to spend 30$ on a face brush,</li>
            <li>Shipment was lightning fast.</li>
            <li>but it makes it look like just as much coverage to hide all the imperfections.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They do the job very well.</li>
            <li>pouch is sweet, but not professional, so depending on your use for these brushes will determine if it&#x27;s useful or not.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really nice for cleaning them because they are supposed to be dried upside</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve since gone back to my old set while I look for a better one.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that the case was big but not too big.</li>
            <li>cannot work with that kind of brush on the contour of a round eyelid or cheek.</li>
            <li>The smell goes away on its own after a few days anyway.</li>
            <li>These are better than the ELF professional brushes (white ones).</li>
            <li>There were quite a few brushes, soft, and good quality.  </li>
            <li>The shedding is getting worse, instead of better, and I have stopped using most.</li>
            <li>I guess I was just expecting too much from low drugstore products and the smaller brushes are amazing for defining and really getting detailed but the bigger brushes arent as well as they are just stuffed with animal fur.</li>
            <li>probably purchase more from this company in the near future.</li>
            <li>Overall - nice product to have on hand and works well with my eye shadow pallete I recently purchased - also from Shany.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d say is to take a look at the different kind of brushes included in the set before you buy.</li>
            <li>I love that it offers 3 different sizes of eye shadow brushes plus a sponge brush, which I use just for blending, but can also be used for applying.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money that I paid for these brushes I was expecting far more quality than what I actually received.</li>
            <li>The shedding is getting worse, instead of better, and I have stopped using most.</li>
            <li>Too frayed and thick for eyeliner, maybe good for brow powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are professional quality and will definetely please any makeup user!!!</li>
            <li>A few of the brushes fell apart right away and many of them have a lot of fall out.  </li>
            <li>It goes great with my black and grey purse.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure I use less foundation too, but don&#x27;t quote me on this.</li>
            <li>You will find far softer brushes in your drugstore.. which because of this experience, I did check out Walgreen&#x27;s selection and was very pleased for less $$.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the Brush Set the brush fell off and I had to super glue back on.  </li>
            <li>OK I realize these are extremely cheap brushes and that you usually get what you pay for, but, wow!  </li>
            <li>because I mean it&#x27;s a good product to start off with.</li>
            <li>( washed the case though because it had a funny smell, like a new case smell</li>
            <li>Other than that, its a good enough product.</li>
            <li>The Brushes pick up the makeup good and they arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>Like, I thought the brushes were going to have soft bristles, but it was the other kind.</li>
            <li>These brushes are decent quality, you get a large variety in this set and</li>
            <li>i have this set now for over a year and still works pretty good, ill definitely buy more from this seller</li>
            <li>So far, my expierence with make up brushes in all has been that its difficult to find brushes that look nice and dont burn a hole in pockets, If you get what I mean but this set come with a roll and in a very attractive color seems like something anyone interested in makeup would want to try.</li>
            <li>It is rare to find natural hair brushes at this low of a price, this is NOT to say synthetic brushes are cheaper, synthetic brushes can be outstanding and far better than natural and in this case these are really low quality natural hairs.    </li>
            <li>You may find that you don&#x27;t need to invest in another full set, and only want certain brush upgrades.</li>
            <li>case is very soft and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Very soft but strong enough to put eye shadow on.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this brush kit is okay.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a basic brush kit at this price...</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t gotten much use out of it because I don&#x27;t wear my full \\&quot;face\\&quot; very often and as such don&#x27;t need to use the brushes</li>
            <li>When I got them in I was so excited to open up the box, but what I found dampened my mood.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewer that the elf brands are way better for this price</li>
            <li>my novel helps at least one person! :P</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li>It comes in a pretty cute little makeup pouch</li>
            <li>I have seen other sets costing incredibly more.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, for as many brushes as I received for the price, I guess I&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li>[ive even been able to add a couple other brushes i purchased to it].</li>
            <li>Other then that, I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I stopped using 6 and 8 due to the hair dropping (see more on this below).</li>
            <li>She gave a few gentle pulls on the bristles to see if the loose hairs were from the brushes and each gentle pull resulted in more and more bristles falling out of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>So I half-heatedly put this SHANY set on my wish list, not getting my hopes up too too high, though the reviews were certainly encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>If the brushes are new, it&#x27;s harder to tell when they&#x27;re clean because no makeup will be coming out, so just use your best judgement; if they are old but just need to be cleaned, swirl them in the shampoo until the makeup stops making the soap brown (blue green ext.).</li>
            <li>and I was so surprise about how much they cost.. usually to get a set like this cost about 40.00 and up and as a college student I don&#x27;t have that kind of money.</li>
            <li>I was kind of nervous, on purchasing at first, it sucks that it didn&#x27;t include a foundation brush though.</li>
            <li>Such a bargain just for the great small brushes that I use all the time.</li>
            <li>I clean them individually...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I got a different set than others, as I bought them based on the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>quality, probably better then Sephora, Sheer Cover &amp; Bare Minerals ones, which I used to use.</li>
            <li>I received the red brushes and they are very lovely with minimal shedding (if any).</li>
            <li>The price point is rather reasonable and the quality is decent.  </li>
            <li>the brushed washed and dried nicely and didn&#x27;t shed any bristles!:</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am pretty annoyed at everyone who gave this product a good rating.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes and the last a long time.</li>
            <li>I hope to have a long relationship with my new makeup brushes and be able to try new tricks that I weren&#x27;t before with my elf brushes.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for with these brushes, you can&#x27;t really expect them to be high end.</li>
            <li>I really had high expectations for these Shany brushes.</li>
            <li>, Santa came through, slipping the bright red case into my stocking, and SHANY has absolutely blown me away with these unexpectedly high-quality brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I currently work as a special effects makeup artist and was looking for a set of brushes to add to my collection.</li>
            <li>or i am doing something extra special.  </li>
            <li>Some of the brushes were made a little cheap, but i got a few good ones out of it.</li>
            <li>Each brush came individually wrapped and the hairs are so soft and pick up make-up easily.</li>
            <li>The red pouch makes it much easier to spot and grab quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like the bold red color of the handles and pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work really good with wet or dry eyeshadows</li>
            <li>They are a cheery red color with contrasting black bristles.  </li>
            <li>I am very new with make up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very new into the \\&quot;makeup brush\\</li>
            <li>they r cheap and alot of different brushes but they arent very soft</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really have any kind of bad smell, each brush was wrapped in it&#x27;s own protective baggy.</li>
            <li>Not only is the set a great bargain, but it can be used for everyday makeup, traveling, and for professional use.</li>
            <li>The handles are long and sleek and so smooth and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>In cleaning them before first use there was some absolutely minimal shedding, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li>I feel pretty professional when I unroll it to get a brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, solid brush set, especially for someone just starting out in makeup and needing a range of brushes for their collection.</li>
            <li>Professionally, probably not; however, as a starter kit or spare kit absolutely!</li>
            <li>They are soft and exactly what was ordered.thank you</li>
            <li>The one thing that i noticed at first was how soft they are.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t notice a lot of shedding and for the price(somewhat matching its quality), they&#x27;re better than buying professional ones if you don&#x27;t have to much extra $ to spend.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty soft and if you&#x27;re a advocate for PETA this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product i am looking forward to future purchases!totally worth the money i use them everyday!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are so soft, and yet still pretty dense.</li>
            <li>No shedding so far and yes, its very recommended that you wash before use!</li>
            <li>They are also soft and have no weird smells.</li>
            <li>If you angle them better, they won&#x27;t feel as scratchy, but it&#x27;s not worth the effort when you are just trying to apply makeup and be done with it.</li>
            <li>Some of the smaller brushes are probably meant for people who are true professionals with putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>Best set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I&#x27;ve purchased some very expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>This is the first complete brush collection that I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>Each brush has a different purpose and they all work true to the descriptions in the pamphlet.  </li>
            <li>Be warned though, the red is a fairly obnoxious shade of red that definitely is not for everyone.</li>
            <li>Ok, on to the brushes:  The brushes are not high quality at all, nor that soft.  </li>
            <li>These Brushes were ok, noting to jump up and down about.</li>
            <li>My fan brush did get a little crushed by the pouch because of they way it was wraped up but still great.</li>
            <li>Lots of brushes in a nice little soft vinyl roll-up kit that ties.  </li>
            <li>Good care would make them last a little longer.</li>
            <li>As someone who is fairly new to make up, I luv to experiment without having to splurge on tools every time!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to get my new eyeshadow palette in the mail!</li>
            <li>I am new to the make up world and have never used mac brushes or any other better brand,</li>
            <li>Still work, look &amp; feel as if they were brand new, and I&#x27;ve had them for a year!</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding good makeup brushes that are soft that don&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my sister, she really needed new brushes.</li>
            <li>The product smells how something new would smell, it smells straight out of factory.</li>
            <li>Quality is good; for everyday, light use, I think they will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I feel bad saying it, since I absolutely love the palette, but the brushes aren&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li>I feel bad saying it, since I absolutely love the palette, but the brushes aren&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more for brushes that don&#x27;t leave hairs all over my face or come with black chemicals still in them.</li>
            <li>The bristles are rough and come apart easily.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wash them before using them because there is an odd smell/powder residue on the brushes.</li>
            <li>After washing them and letting them dry I lightly tugged on the hair</li>
            <li>I was able to easily krazy glue the handle back into place but still not a good first impression.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash the brushes after every use espically if you are using black shadow.</li>
            <li>Feels rough on the skin and hairs come out to easily.</li>
            <li>As I got older I was introduced to the wonders of the bra and shorn legs...</li>
            <li>I currently have invested in a better quality of make up brushes and have given these to my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>Because it was decent looking and affordable.</li>
            <li>Decent brushes for the price</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother because I wouldn&#x27;t of used that particular brush</li>
            <li>I ordered this set mainly to replace my eye shadow applicators that kept getting destroyed.  </li>
            <li>I suppose that it was a decent deal for the price, but I&#x27;m not so enthralled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- so much better, softer, fuller - I only recommend this set if you want/need the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the red and the bristles are an auburn red</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes like the foundation, concealer and eye brushes are a lot firmer and they definitely get more product</li>
            <li>in my opinion there are a few that I really don&#x27;t see the point in, I feel like it would have been better to trade a few in... but for a starter kit it has really helped me and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li>This brush set has so many different brushes that can be used for all different makeup applications.  </li>
            <li>Decent set of beginner brushers.</li>
            <li>The only plus I have is that they came in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a decent brush set for the price.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the eye brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a few brushes, but they seem fairly durable.</li>
            <li>now they are a decent purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of those classic cases of, \\&quot;You can&#x27;t judge a book by its cover.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The larger powder brushes are okay, but the bristles on the eyeshadow brushes are too coarse.</li>
            <li>Picks up quite a decent amount of makeup.</li>
            <li>i like the smaller brushes more then the larger ones.</li>
            <li>I got this 13 piece set in 2012 when i was just starting off learning how to apply make-up, and for that reason only i think this is ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I only use 4 out of 12, but I&#x27;m glad I have extra just in case</li>
            <li>I needed decent brushes with a decent price.</li>
            <li>I mainly use brushes to apply blush and mineral powder eyeliner.</li>
            <li>But this isn&#x27;t the main problem.    </li>
            <li>The main problem is shedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking to purchase something better and will definitely hold on to these for back up.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t happen with the eye brushes, thank goodness since they are the ones I mainly use.</li>
            <li>Also, I have discovered that the shaft is quite short and comes apart; however, I have been able to stick the brush back onto its handle, but it&#x27;s an ongoing issue.</li>
            <li>The case is clever too, because it conveniently organizes quite a number of brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never owned decent brushes before.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are decent quality.</li>
            <li>but it is still decent quality for the amount I paid.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes hoping they would be decent.</li>
            <li>Needs a decent powder brush for 5 stars.</li>
            <li>only reason i gave it a 2 star because they are a cute red color</li>
            <li>the hair of the brush is not that soft, cheap qualified, and it is big</li>
            <li>I did not return them because the shadow and eyeliner brushes were decent and I don&#x27;t like the hassle.</li>
            <li>E.L.F essential brushes have the same feel to them, but are of much better quality.</li>
            <li>They are a decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last more than a year before the bristle starting fall apart.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes is serving as a backup to my main set.  </li>
            <li>OK, but really only for people with smaller eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>White are cheaper but only cost $1 each, I love them.  </li>
            <li>but they are really nice does the work they also came later then expected</li>
            <li>but they look of decent quality.</li>
            <li>I love the way the brushes came individually wrapped and with plastic covers for each of the larger brush heads.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brushes is decent...</li>
            <li>If one of your main reasons for buying this set is the fact that it comes with a pouch, MOVE ON.</li>
            <li>Decent set of beginners brushes or brushes for traveling.</li>
            <li>So if you want a decent set of starter brushes I would go for these.</li>
            <li>This is a decent quality item.</li>
            <li>the smaller brushed are better than the two blush/powder brushes.</li>
            <li>I am used to very high quality bushes and these by far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li>high quality, can&#x27;t live without it anymore !</li>
            <li>They are very soft, and I use one of the very small-tipped brushes for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>Brushes aren&#x27;t very soft after about 5th use, but they were very inexpensive</li>
            <li>They are very soft and Gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and put the makeup on very well.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft, and they pick up any product really well.</li>
            <li>Since I had been using the same make-up brushes for many years (some up to 20 years) and cleaning them on a regular basis, most of them were getting a little shabby.  </li>
            <li>and I got mine in a red color which was very pretty.</li>
            <li>and the fiber is still very soft!</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li>YOU WILL DO BETTER THAN THIS MESS.</li>
            <li>very soft brushes!</li>
            <li>I pulled on the brushes to make sure they were on tightly</li>
            <li>Yes these brushes are high quality.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting high quality Mac brushes.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend these brushes to all women.  </li>
            <li>but they were always priced way to high for me to afford.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy high end brushes since I don&#x27;t want to hop on the MAC or Sigma brushes bandwagon.</li>

            <li>These brushes are of really high quality and didn&#x27;t lose hairs when you use them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need brushes when I bought it, but they&#x27;re so high quality</li>
            <li>i highly recommend</li>

            <li>highly recommend them and the bristles don&#x27;t fall off</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love new brushes every year to a few month depending on how much I ware make up for</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick but was to be expected of Prime (we pay $80 a year for it, so it better be!)The product itself came in a pink pouch (nothing to be done about that)</li>
            <li>These are soft, the large shadow brush doesn&#x27;t apply that well.  </li>
            <li>So the brushes are great but not easily suitable for mineral powders because the brushes are not firm enough.</li>
            <li>Comes with a cute little carrying case too.</li>
            <li>Also, the brushes come in a cute little leather type bag which takes up no room at all.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for a little over a year, and i have used them (most of them) every day.</li>
            <li>I would get the little hairs in my eyes, in top of my foundation, and so on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they come in a cute little case to hold all of them trust me you will not be dissapointed</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li>It also comes in a cute little pouch.</li>
            <li>But other than those few things, I would say they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and the little holder they come with.</li>
            <li>Theyre so soft!!</li>
            <li>Good for starting out not high quality but for younger girls just learning about</li>
            <li>This can certainly happen with brushes but this was more than usual.  </li>
            <li>but no they really are fine quality for such a low cost.</li>
            <li>Like in other reviews there was a strong plastic smell, you have to let it breath</li>
            <li>it is hard to find nice makeup brushes that won&#x27;t hurt your pocketbook and don&#x27;t fall apart the minute you buy them.</li>
            <li>The comb kind of brush is really hard.</li>
            <li>but I have no children or other strong responsibilities</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft, well made, and i love the color (mine were red and black).</li>
            <li>They do smell very strongly of some chemical when they first arrive, but I just set the pouch out, open, for a few days and the scent went away.  </li>
            <li>I advise that you spend a little extra on some amazing quality brushes, or if you are really on a budget, I suggest trying out the ELF Studio Brushes.</li>
            <li>But after I left it open for a few minutes, the smell went away and I could use the super cute brushes!</li>
            <li>I mainly bought these to have a new foundation brush.</li>
            <li>This product is like a real professional brush kit.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and they&#x27;re put together very well.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and pick up the powders very well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>they are very sturdy and the brushes themselves are soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>The box they came in looked very sleek and professional.</li>
            <li>great alterenative to expensive bruses</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that the mineral powder brush is really quite soft and doesnt feel like sandpaper to your face like kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>The brushes were soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>The brushes are amazing, case is soft and not cheap!</li>
            <li>Like if i just pull softly on the brushes some of the hairs fall out, so I&#x27;ve been scared to use them too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ware it near as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>rough like a cheap set.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, apply the makeup evenly blend everything very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the soft brushes.</li>
            <li>and they are very durable and soft.</li>
            <li>soft, and apply makeup very evenly.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, and no matter how much I wash them they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and work very well.</li>
            <li>You get all of your basics plus a few extra for such a great price.</li>
            <li>i couldnt find anything wrong, its a great buy.</li>
            <li>There soft but catches and applies product really well.</li>
            <li>Not thick.</li>
            <li>They are soft and appear to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>She threw all her old ones out and said 3 times now how much see loves them.  </li>
            <li>the brushes are too soft and cant help much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so many quality professional brushes before at such a low price!</li>
            <li>However, the wood part does scratch, but I guess thats normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup artist but for someone that uses it on a somewhat regular basis this is worth it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are of acceptable quality, and they are soft to the skin, and the handles are long and have a comfortable hold.</li>
            <li>but i think thats normal considering its vinyl.  </li>
            <li>They take up the same amount of space as a flip flop pretty much.</li>
            <li>I actually ended up RETURNING them, and I rarely return make up</li>
            <li>Also all brushes are all good sizes, not too big or too small.</li>
            <li>But I feel like it&#x27;s worth to buy the set for the smaller eye brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes were really small only 3 were of good use):</li>
            <li>I bought these to use with my real techniques brushes and they work pretty well overall.</li>
            <li>Its not the most fantastic brushes I&#x27;ve ever used, however it does the job adequately enough especially for such a low price.</li>
            <li>It comes with pretty much all the necessary brushes.</li>
            <li>I use them everyday and they&#x27;re still fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I have now built up my collection with mostly Sigma and Coastal Scents brushes, a few MAC.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first real set I&#x27;ve ever had, so I&#x27;m obviously no expert, but I can tell when something works.</li>
            <li>These brushes are ok if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing with nicer ones.</li>
            <li>ONCE I USE A FEW MORE</li>
            <li>only a few brushes are good do not waste your money</li>
            <li>Price is good but poor quality.</li>
            <li>After my 14 month old thoroughly destroyed one of my favorite eyeshadow brushes, I broke down &amp; decided to try my luck with a cheaper brush; boy did I make a mistake.  </li>
            <li>But the other tools I used in the kit worked fine</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to a new cosmetic brush set, so I ordered Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush 13 piece set with a Pouch.</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for, the full brushes were not very good but the eye shadow and smaller brushes were okay for the price.</li>
            <li>I thought they smelled yucky, they were more coarse feeling than I thought they&#x27;d be, and I dislike needing to wash and dry them after every use.</li>
            <li>I mean really nice brushes coast $20-30 a piece at department stores.</li>
            <li>roll them right back up</li>
            <li>I did wash them right away put them back in their plastic covers.</li>
            <li>BUT WITH THE POUCH I CAN SLIP THEM RIGHT BACK IN!</li>
            <li>Also when washing my brushes the smaller sized powder/blush brush handle came right off.</li>
            <li>But I saw it had more positive then negative ones.</li>
            <li>The only positive is that it doesn&#x27;t shed as much as the powder brush did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush set comes with a very pretty red leather soft roll up case.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the durability, because I got mine recently, but definitely worth the money so far!</li>
            <li>Its time for me to get a new set, and i am coming right back to SHANY...</li>
            <li>: The main brushes (powder, blush, bronzer, etc.) started falling apart after the first month of daily use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy my other Shany Cosmetic products and thought I&#x27;d give this set a try</li>
            <li>The brochure has advertisements for other Shany products, and ways to get free samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I washed these brushes a second time before using (which I don&#x27;t normally do) and they still shed (not as much thankfully) making me very weary to use on myself.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a red brush set in my collection, the holding up pretty well, but as far as applying makeup, the eyeshadow brushes work very well</li>
            <li>I thought that little extra bit was really nice.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a little booklet that lets you know which brush is which, that is a nice touch especially if you are a beginner.</li>
            <li>So I figured it was time to get some new ones.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s just a \\&quot;new factory\\</li>
            <li>they smelled like new brushes.</li>
            <li>I would definately suggest this item to anyone if they were looking for a new brush set.</li>
            <li>The smell of the pouch is not a problem, its new therefore the smell...</li>
            <li>I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products.</li>
            <li>and I now need new brushes.  </li>
            <li>I never thought to make a review about this product, but I was searching for new brushes and I stumbled upon these</li>
            <li>Note, I just said I was looking for new brushes..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new set.</li>
            <li>so i will be a buying a new set to replace this one</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I&#x27;m going to go buy new replacements of the brand I had before.</li>
            <li>price, variety, and pouch are convenient but I will be getting new brushes.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with your brushes smelling like they are new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waited almost two years to buy new brushes because I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend money on something I don&#x27;t use often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like they go out an clip the fur off a live animal to make these, they are made from fur scraped off of hides before they are tanned for leather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying another set to keep on hand because I like to use new brushes every 6 to 12 months</li>
            <li>I am still new to using make-up brushes and bought this set to try them out.</li>
            <li>And BE SURE to lay them flat on a paper towl to dry.</li>
            <li>but they are another cheap option for make up brushes if you are looking for something a little better quality but still affordable for a tight budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clearly that&#x27;s to be expected because they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li>My big mistake here was not using a brush guard, you MUST use a mesh BRUSH GUARD when on the two larger brushes in this set (made by coastal scents available here on amazon, buy the muti pack).</li>
            <li>These are not professional brushes, so you don&#x27;t really get the range or variety you would for higher end brushes.</li>
            <li>The fabulous willowy tall blonde model receiving this from her wishlist intends to use this set to their maximum potential.</li>
            <li>The only con is the cheap looking fire engine red pleatherette pouch they came in.</li>
            <li>Let me just say I love these brushes they soft and firm..</li>
            <li>These brushes a very soft and durable, (mine still look brand new)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how so many people gave it all these stars but its not worth it!!</li>
            <li>Even tough they are very cheap!</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft to the skin yet durable.</li>
            <li>They are very very soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.</li>

            <li>it is very professional looking.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel very soft and one or two strands of hair fall every time I use them.</li>
            <li>Very soft on the face ...</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>They look very professional.</li>

            <li>Seem to work alright; they are very soft.</li>
            <li>It looks very professional.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft on your face, but sturdy.</li>
            <li>I was having some difficulties picking up color on the brushes but they are very soft on skin</li>
            <li>And was very surprised with the quality of it.</li>
            <li>The hair brushes are very soft, it contains instructions on what the brushes are for.</li>
            <li>they are very soft, and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and seem to be made well.  </li>
            <li>Well packaged and the brushes were all covered in plastic and very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, which is a pro.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes are very soft, ive had them for almost a month</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes.</li>
            <li>These are very professional, well made brushes.</li>
            <li>I wish they were a little more natural and soft.</li>
            <li>They last a long time and dont break easily.</li>
            <li>This is my first makeup brush kit, and I have found it easy to use and not in any way negative.  </li>
            <li>did I mention they have a strange strong smell as if they were actually dipped in paint.</li>
            <li>I washed them first, and no bristles came out during the next uses.</li>
            <li>The hairs were so soft!</li>
            <li>Plus the pouch is not bulky or heavy! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>were the same exact brush i thoguth that one of them would have been a powder brush as showen in the pic.....</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are still holding up though ;-)</li>
            <li>Also the red pleather sleeve smelled like chemicals for the first 3 months.</li>
            <li>These brushes far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>The only problem is, when I first got it I opened the bag</li>
            <li>I compared a similar set today, at a much higher price, and wondered how my Amazon purchase would compare.  </li>
            <li>but WOW!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are so soft!</li>
            <li>Love it use them everyday!</li>
            <li>/&gt;she loves the color, the material and how soft they are!</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>i thought they were the same at first also.</li>
            <li>so I never got to use it, the brushes are definitely not as lush/dense as the pictures make them out to be, the pouch fell apart within my first month of using the set, and the tops of the brushes have become to fall off</li>
            <li>Save your money and either get a smaller, higher quality set, or buy a bunch of cheaper and mid-range products from CVS or Target.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first and not last, oh well, lesson learned.</li>
            <li>the only downside to these is that the hairs are not cut precisely and there are no rigid flat brushes you can use to do an eyeliner.</li>
            <li>They are also not the exact same brushes you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>The only con I see with this product is when you first use them, some of the hairs fall out</li>
            <li>I noticed that other reviews mentioned the potent smell of the brushes when you open the box.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and I had extra brushes thank goodness because the first time I used them the hairs just ended up all over the models face.</li>
            <li>But it feels so soft and durable!</li>
            <li>I love them and use them everyday!</li>
            <li>They are soft, yet the bristles stay in and don&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li>I got my set in red, it comes exactly how it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>The brushes are SO soft and uber-gentle on your eyelid, and they blend like a PRO!</li>
            <li>None of the hairs are falling out and they are sooo soft!</li>
            <li>Not as soft as I was wishing for, but I now have a brush for everything I need!</li>
            <li>Next time i&#x27;ll choose to buy something most expensive and hopefully of better quality.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to everyone and anyone professional or not!</li>
            <li>Like the title says, these brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>I love the pouch (in red) because I also use it to store some other brushes that I use.</li>
            <li>I use the angled brush, a shadow brush, the foundation brush, and small powder brush every day, and often use the others on the weekends when I put more time into my makeup.</li>
            <li>come at an extremely run for your value price, the case they come in is adorable and when I apply my blushes and bronzer, I truly see a big  difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were my first makeup brushes that I bought a WHILE back.</li>
            <li>when I received the brushes they came in a pretty red pouch .</li>
            <li>These were purchased for my 15 year old daughter and she has never complained about them so that makes them a winner.  </li>
            <li>She loves the options that this set gives and she uses it with other Shany products of the same top notch quality.</li>
            <li>The reason for four stars instead of five is that some of the bristles shed which is why I wanted a different set in the first place.  </li>
            <li>the lack of texture in the bristles is more obvious in the two big ones than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>the kit has nice variaty but the brush wasn&#x27;t soft enough and the brush hair were all uneven and they tend to fall all over.</li>
            <li>The pouch was a huge let down in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I washed them for her with just normal shampoo (frutics) and they dried just fine.</li>
            <li>They are okay for personal use, but if you are interested in buying them for professional use then I would suggest buying a different and more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>These are very cheep, but at a high standard.</li>
            <li>Very soft, very professional and so far none of the hair is coming out of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Essencell® Cosmetic Brushes-12pc Makeup Brush Set -High Quality Natural and Synthetic Hair Makeup Brushes -Soft and Dense-</li>
            <li>They work fine, but they dont last very long.</li>
            <li>They do need washed with shampoo before using because of the harsh smell, but that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li>I took a quick glance and saw lots and lots of reviews with a decent average.</li>
            <li>These brushes are not good good at all, especially with liquid makeup foundation.</li>
            <li>At least they came in a pouch, so it&#x27;s really not much of a complaint :)</li>
            <li>I have washed the brushes a few times and the hair bristles are strong and durable.  </li>
            <li>The brushes feel cheap and are not full as make up brushes should be.</li>
            <li>Very pretty pink.</li>
            <li>I mean they&#x27;re not professional, but for the price I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>It is new as expected and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Instead, my order came as expected, with the pouch color I wanted (even though there isn&#x27;t an opportunity available to choose the pouch color), faster than the expected delivery date, with a high quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I actually like these brushes better than my previous brushes...</li>
            <li>make sure to condition them before prior use because they do have an odd smell.</li>
            <li>They do smell weird and bristles has fallen off; but over all I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li>My first brush set: no major brand name or exorbitant price</li>
            <li>I love to layer different colors of eyeshadows on my eyes, and realize the mess that applying them on with my fingers can create.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a very vibrant red.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes have lost their shape, even though I take extremely good care of my products, and at least one face brush has come loose in the handle and knocks about when I use</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes have lost their shape, even though I take extremely good care of my products, and at least one face brush has come loose in the handle and knocks about when I use</li>
            <li>It comes with a large blush brush and a smaller blush brush which I am assuming they think can also be used for foundation.  </li>
            <li>mine are not stiff at all.  </li>
            <li>There is such a large variety of brushes to use.  </li>
            <li>I like the large options of different types of brushes and the color</li>
            <li>but if you do your daily makeup for school or work then this certainly will get the job done.</li>
            <li>The case seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li>The brushes I received reminded me of ones I got from the toy store when I was a little girl with some cheap makeup.</li>
            <li>My daughter used them and stated that she liked them but didn&#x27;t notice much difference in them and other brushes she has used in the past.</li>
            <li>so many brushes for such a little price.</li>
            <li>The brush set smelled a little funny at first</li>
            <li>The brushes may be numbered, and indeed out of order, but I like it as the original order they are in the case is the order of brushes I typically use when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>the little red pouch is cute too.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel a little extra sexy when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that I would be lucky like the other reviewers and not have brushes that shed, but these started shedding as soon as I washed them.  </li>
            <li>These brushes shed SO much during the first wash, both the large and small brushes and there was hair all over my counter and my hands.</li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of getting all these brushes with a little leather wrap up thing, but the quality is definitely on the low end.</li>
            <li>Professional brushes that if you keep them clean will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and the bristles are really soft, the bigger brushes come with a plastic cover</li>
            <li>Sheds pretty bad, but overall works pretty good</li>
            <li>If you are a proffessional it may be worth it to invest in a more expensive brand-</li>
            <li>These brushes are cheap when I got them it came in a cheap fake leather roll thing.</li>
            <li>But when I got them (fast shipping too by the way), there was no odor,no white powder, &amp; they ARE soft..</li>
            <li>It meets all needs when making up and has a clear instruction about how to use each brush.</li>
            <li>really like all the brushes, Not the biggest fan of Number 6 or 8 only because the hair did fall</li>
            <li>Th red case filled with brushes came wrapped in plastic and each individual brush came plastic wrapped and had brush covers for the bigger brushes.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, but she readily says she really only uses 4 or 5 tools in the kit, but she doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m young.</li>
            <li>I ordered a Shany Shimmer Eyeshadow Palette, 50/50 Shimmer Matte, 13 Ounce plus the Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch</li>
            <li>, they just send me 2  Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch</li>
            <li>I love the MAC brushes, but can&#x27;t stand the thought of forking out at least eighteen dollars for ONE brush.  </li>
            <li>I honestly do not know what they are all for, but I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out.</li>
            <li>They looks so professional</li>
            <li>i cant really complain since they were only 25 dollars but still for that price i would have thought that all of the brushes wold have been useable.</li>
            <li>Bought these brushes for my 15 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>They shed heavily and are cheaply made.</li>

            <li>I like the brushes because they are soft and the bristles do not come out during use.</li>
            <li>To my knowledge all these brushes are natural hair (appear to be pony, not including the eyebrow comb).</li>
            <li>Do not I repeat DO NOT use dish soap or vinegar or any chemical like that, they will strip the natural hair and make these brushes weaker and scratchier than they already are.    </li>

            <li>This set by far exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also consider purchasing this product for a young person beginning to learn how to use makeup.  </li>
            <li>I thought the brushes are soft and apply make up well, and I&#x27;ve been using them for over a month without problems.</li>
            <li>To be complete it should have a bent eyeliner brush.</li>

            <li>They smell and they&#x27;re like a old rug.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 16 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>It fit the discription.an no parts were missing.</li>
            <li>The description says the brushes have a soft and silky feel and they by no means do.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft, but ont fall out.</li>
            <li>The brushes are prickly against skin, if you like soft brushes, DO NOT BUY THESE.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a Professional set of quality brushes.</li>
            <li>B001JKTTVQ Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch</li>
            <li>that I am  practicing artist with 22 yrs experience, I wouldnt use these professionally.</li>
            <li>soft brushes..</li>
            <li>For the price and what you actually get, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>the pouch is a soft material.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are really professional grade like sigma</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes but so far with the ones I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t damage my already sensitive</li>
            <li>It is so soft and</li>
            <li>Maybe let your 9 year old daughter play with them but</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money on this product ever again.</li>
            <li>For example, the all over powder brush from E.L.F is soft, not as soft as the brush from their studio line, and doesn&#x27;t scratch the face.</li>
            <li>As I stated earlier since I&#x27;m knew to makeup this makes things much easier for me.</li>
            <li>feels soft against my skin</li>
            <li>It works well with my professional skills.</li>
            <li>I just got my Shany Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch.</li>
            <li>The brushes are professional.</li>
            <li>Sometimes as an MUA, when you are on set, you really need a variety of brushes as you may not have time for cleaning properly.  </li>
            <li>They are extremely cheaply made and smell like harsh chemicals-</li>
            <li>Angled brush- NOT FIRM</li>
            <li>no fallout bristles,great for beginners and professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete set where I don&#x27;t have to go out and purchase additional brushes.</li>
            <li>These are not quality professional brushes.  </li>
            <li>far im</li>
            <li>THESE ARE NATURAL HAIR BRUSHES made from goat and badger fur.</li>
            <li>probably far out of my league with these.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The package came early, undamaged.</li>
            <li>She show me the difrrence between her drugstore brushes and this ones and the bristles on hers were really soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and velvety.</li>
            <li>She will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Love the red color, I was afraid they were going to be too pinkish, but the are a nice cherry red.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>I received these for a christmas gift, and I like them so much I will be buying them for my mom and daughter at the next oportunity.</li>
            <li>they are soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as I thiught they would be, thats why I gave three stars.</li>
            <li>I like how soft these brushes are.</li>
            <li>Its a cheap brush set don&#x27;t waste your money unless you are on some budget as I was.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or anything, I really didn&#x27;t need like, 8 different types of eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>searched for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I like to keep some basic toiletries in the guest bath, making trips so much easier.</li>
            <li>I bought this to accompany a make-up kit SHANY products for a young girl.</li>
            <li>The only brushes I really like are the blush and powder brush.</li>
            <li>but there not fluffy</li>
            <li>They are soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li>But the hair is not so soft.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit surprised at the exclusion of a contour brush and a lip liner brush.</li>
            <li>They are quite soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, if I had known about RealTechniques brushes BEFORE ordering this SHANY Professional set, I probably would not have purchased this set.</li>
            <li>3 1/4 starsechniques brushes BEFORE ordering this SHANY Professional set</li>
            <li>you want truly professional quality brushes, you&#x27;ll need to pay for them.  </li>
            <li>I can buy one brush at Sephora for the same quality and price for this whole set.</li>
            <li>B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch,</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter spotted my set and demanded I order her one too.</li>
            <li>They are soft and not corse like some brushes sold at stores.</li>
            <li>I Gave three  stars because the brushes were not what I expected but they were definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>but I own a $70.00 Kabuki brush and even that occasionally malts bristles and loses its softness after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>whatever I spent was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>I think this set is definitely worth the money, but be careful with them if you don&#x27;t want them to break.</li>
            <li>The only brush that I use everyday and love is the brow/lash comb.</li>
            <li>The only brush that I use everyday and love is the brow/lash comb.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, brush sets mainly only come with eye shadow brushes and a few faces brushes.</li>
            <li>It came kind of messed up since it&#x27;s so thin.  </li>
            <li>They get HOT really fast extremely so!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on MAC or Sigma, these brushes are just as good for a lot less money!</li>
            <li>I agree with previous reviews stating that the brushes are soft, but to me, they are nothing special.</li>
            <li>I finally decided it was time to invest in a solid set of brushes and these were right in my price range.</li>
            <li>I think the only brush I dont like is the eyeliner brush, its cheap &amp; just isnt sturdy enough to apply liner, but I really like the other ones.</li>
            <li>They are way better than the bits and pieces I had cobbled together and mean that I can take advantage of the pricey makeup</li>
            <li>Great variety of brushes, however the case is cheap-looking plastic, and the entire set has a funky smell that is very unappealing.  </li>
            <li>Also, so far the brushes have held up very nicely, possibly due in part to my rare use of them.</li>
            <li>It came so nicely packaged (in this black professional black)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 months now, and i can&#x27;t help but compare them to other brushes that I used before (and spent alot more money on).</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something I really want to use with my face or make-up due to the intense chemical smell.</li>
            <li>You get quite a few brushes in the set and for the money I would say they are worth it!</li>
            <li>The hairs constantly fall out, they are rough not soft at all, the top of the brush falls off the handle.  </li>
            <li>Some of my brushes were loose from the stick, I super glued them back together, that why you see four stars.</li>
            <li>All the small brushed works beautifully but the big ones are a mess.</li>
            <li>This will be my second Shany Professional Brush set, My daughter needed some, so I gave her my old ones and purchases some new ones.</li>
            <li>and one more thing is that the brushes come out red and the hair part is not half blonde and half brown their just brown.</li>
            <li>You seriously can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didnt like is that the powder brush (i assume its a powder brush) is too small and is a better as a blush brush.</li>
            <li>but.. I bought this set mainly for the bigger brushes and...</li>
            <li>Only problem I had with this product is the smell when you first open the box.</li>
            <li>The only problem I foresee having is having to hot glue the handles back on.</li>
            <li>A couple are okay, but overall I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li>Also these exact  same brushes are sold by a different name by Makeup By Ren Ren.  </li>
            <li>I got these mainly because they were red..</li>
            <li>First, the picture shown on the main search page prior to selecting it, does not match the actual merchandise as there is NO big powder brush.  </li>
            <li>The case is a vibrant red that catches the eye.  </li>
            <li>Urban Decay and MAC are my top brands usually.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed that there isn&#x27;t a bigger powder brush, but I am very happy with the eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical when I saw this set of brushes at the price they were sold at - for a natural/synthetic hair brush product I expect to be paying a bit more.</li>
            <li>Definitely a very strong weird smell when you first open them, but that also goes away once you wash them completely.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend doing that before putting your brushes back in.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>There is very little glue used to hold the handle on and to hold the hairs inplace which is a huge problem.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes seem to be OK but all the larger ones leave little brown hairs all over may face and eyes, and it takes forever to get them off.</li>
            <li>I expected a little more of a professional set.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and the basic ones needed in an everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and the basic ones needed in an everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I use them several times a week for personal use and so far, they&#x27;ve held up fine with very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes because of the numerous positive reviews and the low price.</li>
            <li>For me I don&#x27;t really care about the pouch color as long as what&#x27;s inside works.</li>
            <li>So soft I can barely get any product on it..</li>
            <li>so my only complaint really is they&#x27;re kinda cheaply made</li>
            <li>The brushes ok the brush bag not good.</li>
            <li>I realized from the start that there were a number of brushes that I knew I would never use (i.e. small brushes used for precise application of eye makeup).</li>
            <li>No shedding, no missing part,  the red color is still the same, it picks up make up very well</li>
            <li>not sure if this is cruility free as it did not say anything on package</li>
            <li>Only use a few of the brushes regularly but I love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fun to pick brush hairs out of your freshly done makeup.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are ok but the big fluffy ones leave hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li>They are a hot pink reddish color with a matching case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much of an expert on make up and this is my first brush set</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money doing so and the shany brushes are just as good as expensive makeup brushes but these are very affordable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2/20/13: Since the two brushes I use most (for powder and blush) are still so stiff (not soft and &#x27;fluffy&#x27; as the picture would lead you to believe), I ended up buying new brushes from Amway, since I had bought from them in the past and liked their quality and how they applied the powder products.</li>
            <li>They are not super expensive brushes but they are pretty good for what you pay.</li>
            <li>They are fluffy, nice material, don&#x27;t prickle the skin, and it comes with a little pouch.</li>
            <li>I have a few very high end brushes that I paid WAY too much for</li>
            <li>I will probably buy new set in future to replace this set.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, I uses them daily without any disappointment</li>
            <li>I just wish the handles were black, red isn&#x27;t really a favorite color of mine, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll survive based on the necessities of needing an expensive set.</li>
            <li>I really like them overall especially for the price.</li>
            <li>She has been using them constantly and has said that they are soft, professional and they are not falling apart after she washes them.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Shany Professional 13-piece Cosmetic Brush Set and it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs or wants a brush set, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Their very soft overall</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive considering there are single brushes selling for over $300.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, save your money and buy some real techniques or eco tools if you&#x27;re a beginner and want brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I was lured in by relatively good reviews and cheap price but seriously did NOT like these brushes because they were so unpleasant to use on my face.</li>
            <li>I would especially recommend this to beginners because they are easy to use and there is almost no seeding, and what does shed is very little</li>
            <li>Comparable with other higher priced make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I recommend buy EcoTools brushes (there is a set of small brushes and bigger brushes) for a couple more dollars and double the usage time.</li>
            <li>Major bang for your buck with this set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes shed like no other.</li>
            <li>I usually gently tug at the hairs before I use the brush to get rid of any loose ends.</li>
            <li>I got them very quickly using Amazon Prime (I am not sure if it was even 2 days!)</li>
            <li>after using it for a week, the black part of the brush can right off.</li>
            <li>They are firm and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like many other brushes I have owned....</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to replace my older makeup brushes, and it was long overdue.</li>
            <li>The eyelash brush was crappy, maybe just a fluke, but I threw that out and added a few of my own brushes because a few of the brush handles are small enough to fit two into one slot.</li>
            <li>They are barely satisfactory compared to the brushes I purchased from other companies; however, at a much higher cost.  </li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are soft yet stiff, and they don&#x27;t require you to mash into your make up to get the right amount to apply.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this brush set, and it not only doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this brush set, and it not only doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>1st, they came in my fave color (red) and 2nd, they are so soft!!</li>
            <li>I saw some great reviews and some bad reviews, but I figured for the price I&#x27;ll try them.  </li>
            <li>The pouch came in a separate box with two informational leaflets - one with a description of every brush and one with general information about Shany Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>set of brushes has found itself completely integrated into my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I bought the 12 brush set called the \\&quot;Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set\\&quot; and it came with a red pouch for 12 dollars in 2 days.</li>
            <li>I touched them before washing, and they were all soft except the 2 big ones.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely thought that this brush was going to get the job done (absolutely not).</li>
            <li>The foundation brushes are not firm enough for application, and when pressure is put on them, all of the bristles fall out!</li>
            <li>The hairs are really soft and don&#x27;t fall out compared to others of the same price.</li>
            <li>Some malt bristles occasionally and they are fairly soft</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes are wayy too soft..</li>
            <li>Then, the hair on both brushes are very coarse and itchy-not soft at all.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much anyway based on the price (about $20 with shipping)</li>
            <li>Mine is in my fave color - red, and in buttery soft leather.</li>
            <li>The red brush roll holder is so soft and the leather smell like leather...</li>
            <li>the 13th piece is the soft case that it comes in.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush completely fell apart the second time I washed it!  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see it coming off in the near future.  </li>
            <li>get a complete set of brushes needed to wear you facial makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for barely two weeks and they&#x27;re already shedding.</li>
            <li>You are given three brushes designed for your overall face.&lt;br /&gt;- SOFT BRISTLES.</li>
            <li>the bristles weren&#x27;t soft enough.</li>
            <li>so I washed them and aired them out for a couple of days and that helped to entirely get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a kit very similar to this in terms of the brush layout and natural hairs here</li>
            <li>They are soft, BUT way too soft to where the brush bends too much when trying to apply leading to wasted prouct.</li>
            <li>I cleaned them when I took them out of the packaging with Bare Minerals brush cleaner, and they&#x27;re still intact.  </li>
            <li>so I literarily wrapped it up and threw it in the back of my closet</li>
            <li>I am surprised that they are only this price.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than expected.</li>
            <li>These brushes really pick up color and are way softer than expected.</li>
            <li>The bristles constantly fall out and are way too soft.</li>
            <li>They are rough and do not apply make up very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommended this item.</li>
            <li>&quot; smudge brush- Not firm enough to be a pencil brush.</li>
            <li>(And I know this may be gross to some of you professional make-up artists, but I have never even cleaned them!)&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
            <li>My fan brush barely had any hairs on it and it does not do its job.</li>
            <li>No regrets on brushes.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not a rough make up</li>
            <li>But the big brushes are not as soft as I thought they were.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I lost some of my old brushes in our move recently.  </li>
            <li>I am a beginner with makeup, but I have found that all the necessary essentials as far as brushes are concerned are included.</li>
            <li>What I do not quite like is that angled and &#x27;pencil&#x27; brushes are really not firm enough.</li>
            <li>And on one of the eye brushes the metal part that&#x27;s attached to the handle came completely off, and I had to glue it back on.</li>
            <li>I only used two so far, the blush brush and they eye shadow brush...one of them, anyway.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Shany professional 13 piece cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li>The big ones shed a tiny bit when washing, which is normal.  </li>
            <li>The brushes smelled like the packaging the first few days, but that went away one they aired out.</li>
            <li>one more thin gr8 shipping</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews that stated the poor quality of the brushes, but I think that for the price, they&#x27;re not terrible.</li>
            <li>Most of them have broken by now.</li>
            <li>They &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; as if they&#x27;re an expensive brush set, and the case is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You honestly cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li>It did have kind of a weird smell when I opened it however.</li>
            <li>Its ok for gifting to children but not worth for women who use make up everyday</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what people are talking about the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pro makeup artist for 12 years, so I&#x27;m not easy to please, but these brushes were very, veryyyy high quality, and the set has quite an array of brushes that can be used professionally and personally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why people left any kind of review other than 5 stars!  </li>
            <li>Super soft hair with hardly any shedding.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t apply makeup except for when the sun goes down cuz it&#x27;s hot here</li>
            <li>i am interested to see what other products this company has!</li>
            <li>I would recommend washing them prior to use in a gentle shampoo, rinse and lay out on a towel to dry.</li>
            <li>I found myself to only finding about half useful.</li>
            <li>My only negative criticism is the strong, plastic smell, but I assume it can be removed once washed.</li>
            <li>Like previous commentors said the bag smells pretty stong</li>
            <li>, the quality appears to be less than stellar.</li>
            <li>love the larger brushes for when im bronzing Seriously still using these brushes 3 years later</li>
            <li>The brushes start to fall apart pretty soon, having this kit for less than a year</li>
            <li>, the quality appears to be less than stellar.</li>
            <li>Although these brushes were cheap and delivered promptly, there have been a few loose hairs here and there, but that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>They are not HIGH quality, but we didn&#x27;t pay for high quality.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are made well, no loose hairs.</li>
            <li>No loose bristles.</li>
            <li>The large powder brush loses a few hairs but other than that, these are amazing.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and as expected!</li>
            <li>I do wish there was a foundation brush so that I could use this whole set on other people and not have to use my hands to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>The brushes are long, and look so professional!</li>
            <li>Then third of all when I washed my brushes they didn&#x27;t shape back to normal and the texture of them was not the same.</li>
            <li>brushes I did receive are cheap, bristles fall out constantly, they are hard and hurt my skin.</li>
            <li>Simga brushes are expensive, so the only one I really wanted was the F80 Flat Top Kabuki Brush.  </li>
            <li>It was great for my face especially since I have bad acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not being dramatic, I love this set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I have honestly never seen such cheap quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>Before owning the Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch, I never really had a complete set like this.</li>
            <li>The red leather purse/bag is retro yet classy, and was obviously made with style in mind.</li>
            <li>This is money well spent especially for someone like me who is very fussy about where I spend &amp; what I buy.</li>
            <li>The larger brushes were ok but not great when I applied powered makeup.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the powder brush it was too thin on the top</li>
            <li>I bought the Shany Brushes, I tried out a few different companies for a blush brush, and none of them were worth it.</li>
            <li>The case is pretty cute, and the brushes are very soft, but during washing them and just after 1 use it&#x27;s shedding :(.</li>
            <li>just the right feel...not too soft or hard</li>
            <li>The case smells a little funny just out of the package.</li>
            <li>The only time i use them is when I have no other choice.</li>
            <li>It dissapointed me just a little when I first saw it, but I wasn&#x27;t surprise about the quality.</li>
            <li>and so far i&#x27;ve had to hot glue the tops back on a few of them, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>My only problem was that they weren&#x27;t glued to the sticks well enough so some of the brushed came off but a little super glue and problem, solved.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with was some the brushes hair is uneven and my fan brush got a little bent.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slight smell when you first open them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big makeup brush fan, but I needed them and wasn&#x27;t going to spend an exuberant amount on just one brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a larger flat foundation brush to apply powder mineral concealer, and am still using my old brush for that.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much of a variety of brushes and they are a bit rough and flat.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, while I have not noticed the eye brushes dropping hairs much, I have seen a LOT of dropped hairs from the larger (blush and powder) brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes have long length, to allow for professional makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I like the roll-up pouch holder - apparently the color of the pouch may vary, but mine matched the brush handles in red.  </li>
            <li>No strange smells.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>, i was afraid they could damage my skin, but the cosmetics brushes are made from a combination of natural animal hair and synthetic hair, so they are soft and silky on top.</li>
            <li>just be aware of the heavy bristle fall out.</li>
            <li>For instance -- there is no good eye blending brush, all the eye brushes are very stiff, good for lining or loading on color, but no blending eye brush.  </li>
            <li>The eye shadow brushes are a little flat, and I&#x27;m one to like more fluffy brushes for blending, but I have some of those too</li>
            <li>The handles are a pretty Chinese lacquer-type red and the ferrules are glossy black.</li>
            <li>My brushes shed a little but that was only the first wash.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little worried because there seems to be mixed reviews, but for the price I figured I would try it.</li>
            <li>The shedding is minimal, only shed the first time I used and washed them, which is pretty common.</li>
            <li>They are very soft at first but become kinda rough after a few uses..</li>
            <li>, the bristles themselves come out a little easily and the cut of them is a little jagged for the types of brushes.  </li>
            <li>Quality is too be expected for the pricing, if you are new at applying makeup &amp;#34;GO FOR IT&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have used them regularly for over three months and not a single hair has fallen from the brushes.</li>
            <li>Given the other reviews here speaking about high quality, I&#x27;m hoping that this was just an aberration...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about them, besides the bristles do fall out, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good product and need a quick set that will last you a few sessions, then buy this and use it!</li>
            <li>By what I can tell, they are just firm enough to maintain my powders along with my liquids but just soft enough for my face to feel comfortable to use everyday.</li>
            <li>do the same as the first but instead of using Baby shampoo I use a mixture of dish soap and virgin olive oil, the dish soap is harsh on the brushes so use the oil to condition them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them and cleaned them many times in the past few months</li>
            <li>i dont know which brush is what because there not in same order as really small packet thing that i could hardly read... would be nice to know what bruah is what</li>
            <li>They are very soft but I feel like they are a little to soft.</li>
            <li>All of these brushes are nice, and do exactly what they are supposed to, the only problem I have encountered is that the powder brush in my set keeps losing hairs while I am applying make up, not a big problem can be a tad bit annoying though.</li>
            <li>We got this Shany Cosmetic Brush Set as a Christmas Gift for out Daughter and just before wrapping it we found that the three large brushes were missing.</li>
            <li>A little too many brushes and the pouch is rather large and difficult to use.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft,but I am a little dissapointed in the eye brushes.</li>
            <li>At least 2 of the heads detached within the first 2 weeks or month!</li>
            <li>At the very least, I figured it would be a good secondary travel set.  </li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are wonderful, but the bigger ones are annoying because the little hairs are always falling out.</li>
            <li>I used 4 of these brushes every single day and after about a year they started to break and became too hard to clean.</li>
            <li>but I guess that&#x27;s if you get a good set or a bad one.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t risk getting bad or good ones.</li>
            <li>Good pricing and the makeup bag isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s relaxing and a great method for de-stressing or just getting out of your own mind for a moment.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> i think its a good beginners set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> out.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that i think they are good.</li>
            <li> Really good quality product for the price.  </li>
            <li> These looked and sounded good on reviews</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these brushes.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I made a good investment with buying these brushes.</li>
            <li> For all of us who like to do our own make up, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> and I loved the price.</li>
            <li> The wife loved this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Never had good quality brushes, because I couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good buy..</li>
            <li> and it did smell chemical but a good wash took care of that, and it looks well made.  </li>
            <li> the one good thing I can say is the bag is good for traveling --</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the Mrs.</li>
            <li> These brushes look  good quality.  </li>
            <li> I bought them as they seemed fair quality for the price, I was a bit scared about the complaints of the smell.</li>
            <li> Works really good with my make up.</li>
            <li> I know some people said theirs was good</li>
            <li> I really liked these they look great,</li>
            <li> These were a really good deal.</li>
            <li> they are still good brushes</li>
            <li> so once they come out they are gone for good.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brushes appear to be glued in fairly well, again for 25 dollars you shouldn&#x27;t complain you are not getting M.A.C. brushes nor are you getting Dior.</li>
            <li> the cost is cheap and the quality is great!!!</li>
            <li> I guess for the price they are good.</li>

            <li> Do not be fooled by the good reviews that this product has.</li>
            <li> ( you get what you pay for)  bought these to take with me on a cruise because I did not want to bring my good stuff.</li>
            <li> I loved the product</li>
            <li> Good for teenager but not woman who needs reliable application.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase I believe.</li>
            <li> Brushes are good for the price.</li>

            <li> After reading the reviews of all these people who said these are good quality brushes....</li>

            <li> I travel a lot and the fact that this set comes with its&#x27; own pouch that rolls up and fits in my suit case without taking up a lot of room really made it an excellent purchase.</li>

            <li> I LIKED THE STYLE BAG THAT CAME WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> BUT IT HAD SOME KIND OF SMELL THAT WONT GO AWAY.</li>
            <li> I loved the packaging as well, came in a cute box with it&#x27;s own brush holder.</li>
            <li> The pouch is a nice touch adds elegance.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush set for beginners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie and these brushes are a nice introduction into the make up world.</li>

            <li> Really liked the variety they have in this set.  </li>
            <li> and when I had to do my own bridal make-up.</li>
            <li> its a nice starter kit but</li>
            <li> The brushes come in this nice roll out case.</li>
            <li> and they hold up nicely.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s loving them and the leather carrying case.</li>
            <li> Kind of funky but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it two stars vs. 1 star is because the eyeshadow applicators and eyebrow brush are quite handy.  </li>
            <li> Nice case too.</li>
            <li> Around the time of purchasing these I also purchased SHANYs pro-signature kit for $40 and those are significantly better brushes in every way superior to these.</li>
            <li> Nice value for the money.</li>
            <li> Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy good quality brushes.. even target has better brushes than these.</li>

            <li> And the ONE thing that I absolutely loved the MOST was the fact that it came with a booklet describing each brush and its uses.</li>
            <li> Everything was in place and the brushes were nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice you can keep your brushes all organized together.</li>
            <li> and its nice to have a pouch to put them all in too</li>
            <li> Each brush also came with a plastic cover for the brush bit at the end, they were really nice plastic covers</li>
            <li> so i keep on them when I&#x27;m not using the brushes to help them keep their form and stay nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think they existed until I found these brushes.</li>
            <li> The roll up case that came with the brushes is nice and helps to keep them together.</li>
            <li> It you looking for affordable yet effective, elf brushes are the way to go.</li>
            <li> This is a handy brush set for all your needs.</li>
            <li> The bag was in nice condition.  </li>
            <li> its nice and</li>
            <li> The pouch was nice but would have been nicer without the straps</li>
            <li> The brushes felt nice but not for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really help me achieve a flawless makeup look.</li>
            <li> The box it all came in was really nice too.</li>

            <li> The brushes came quickly, so I was happy there.  </li>
            <li> I need more than the reviews to make sure I get a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They work perfectly, and there SOO soft.</li>
            <li> As far as price, I dont even have to say anything about that, its perfect for what I got.</li>
            <li> A nice variety of brushes but the quality is just okay.  </li>
            <li> The brushes came really fast and are wonderful quality and they fit in a nice case.</li>
            <li> Then paint circles on your hand as you rinse wish warm water so make sure each hair gets the shampoo off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was nicely packaged but the pouch smelled of paint, I&#x27;m sure that will go away.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing quality love the traveling case it comes with</li>
            <li> amazing i love the softness of these brushes.</li>

            <li> The price was good and they are smooth.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft... but not the best.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and also the the leather pouch is the best.</li>
            <li> This set is nice and I love the traveling case it comes in</li>
            <li> I would have liked to seen more blending brushes in the set.</li>
            <li> For the money they are worth buying once a year because they hold up great for a while.</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes with case, washed it too. :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and come in a lovely case.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and perfect!!!</li>
            <li> the packaging and handling are so nice too, its really safe and</li>
            <li> They are soft and a perfect quality for it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The most amazing brushes i ever used.</li>
            <li> They look nice, but the brush sheds, there are two brushes that are ok..</li>
            <li> I am just so pleased with what I got, and for how inexpensive these brushes are, it&#x27;s an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great beginners set of brushes for a teenager to have fun with.</li>
            <li> I love the case that the brushes come in and the brushes themselves are nice.</li>
            <li> The brushes were all soft and packaged perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re so good, yet so cheap.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for cheap but good brushes get them from ELF.  </li>
            <li> Both are great and well worth looking into.</li>
            <li> They are better then drug store brushes, but not as nice as my Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> They are soft &amp; the pouch they came in is perfect to use on the go!</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice - comparable to MAC brushes and come it a cute and convenient carrying case.</li>
            <li> I think I liked the pouch more than the brushes themselves</li>
            <li> just going to add my support for what is a really nice product, &amp; I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
            <li> The best I ever had so far.</li>
            <li> I feel like the powder brushes are a bit too soft sometimes for getting all of the product around my face but for what they are, this is an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> I chose this cosmetic brus set that is comfortable and have good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are some brushes, like 3, 11 and 12, that I have never used because I don&#x27;t use liquid eye liner, already had a brow brush I liked better, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is nice for keeping the brushes neat and the color is cute.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the variety, the handy pouch, and I love the colour.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a good price, live the texture soft and works perfectly blended the make n eye shadow LUV it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really bother me though since the rest of the brushes were awesome and the brow brush can be easily replaced.</li>
            <li> I was more than excited!!</li>
            <li> For people learning to do their makeup or are overwhelmed with the number of brushes, the set comes with an instruction sheet and all the brushes are numbered, so it&#x27;s an easy reference guide!</li>
            <li> and they store away easily!  </li>
            <li> The pouch makes them easy to store and keeps any dust or unwanted particles away!</li>
            <li> Easily compact too!</li>
            <li> And many of the best ones are nearly forty!  </li>
            <li> These brushes are strong and I would recommend this for everyone!</li>
            <li> So, I guess its worth buying if you love applying makeup!!</li>
            <li> the brushes dont shed, they are soft and i love it!!!</li>
            <li> These are soft brushes that blend very nicely!</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my beauty supplies, and let me just say these gorgeous brushes way exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Would recommend for the great price, and the quality -- have not had a brush be damaged yet, just make sure you wash them first!</li>
            <li> These are completely gorgeous brushes and by FAR the most beautiful $13 brushes you will ever see.</li>
            <li> Very good price, however, these brushes aren&#x27;t high quality if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, with high quality and surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> Of course I would have liked to have a case that zipped instead of tied, but for a person who is just starting to play around with makeup, this is great!    </li>
            <li> I did my homework on many makeup brushes and these by far are awesome.</li>
            <li> Probably not the most professional set, but for my purposes it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> However they don&#x27;t leave my hair as sleek and frizz free as I like, but again for the price they are an extremely good value:)</li>
            <li> However.. I was impressed with the time I received my purchase and the nice red pouch that the brushes came in...</li>
            <li> They are super easy to clean and feel good when you are using them!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, good quality materials and a great variety.  </li>
            <li> My wife said that she was really happy to get these amazing real animal bristles in a set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I love mine, but it would&#x27;ve been nice to be able to pick out what color of handles and roll up bag you want.  </li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t mind not getting such great quality with a great price then do buy.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and the brushes are giving a clean finish...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m loving these brushes more and more all the time.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great deal, and also is great if you&#x27;re just starting out in the makeup world.</li>
            <li> The set comes in a great case to keep them all organized and I am really happy with this purchase - would order a second set as a gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are my favorite and it makes eyeshadow applications very easy.</li>
            <li> The package is cute, however it smelled very strongly when I opened it....</li>
            <li> Great product, packaged well and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> i love it too much very useful and good quality material .</li>
            <li> This was my first step to buying a brush set, but I heard great reviews and decided to try it out...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with them, and would recommend these to family and friends.</li>
            <li> everything went smoothly and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and they look truly great.</li>
            <li> The set arrived in a timely manner and the brushes looked exactly as shown which was great.</li>
            <li> it is so cute red is the best the brush set apply nice</li>
            <li> They look great and are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I bought these as my first set and thought they were great</li>
            <li> I also would have preferred a \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; face brush or two that would be more suitable for liquid foundation and contouring.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase and received exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars because it does exactly what I wanted at a great value.</li>
            <li> &quot; Overall, it was a fair price for a fair brush set, but it would improve galaxies if the Shany people included a good blending brush in their sets.</li>
            <li> is very practical and good presentation, good quality and is appropriate to the publication and price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these for people on a budget who need good brushes that come with a sweet roll-up case for them.</li>
            <li> so cool loved it .</li>
            <li> the most important thing here is that brushes are beautiful and useful, thanks and good luck in your shopping!....</li>
            <li> But it still works perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> These are high quality cheap brushes that work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I do know that brushes are VERY important for the process of applying make-up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very comfortable on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> they felt like feathers, the brushes did not shatter on my face, and it was very light weight.</li>
            <li> I thought they were very cheap in quality.</li>
            <li> The two tone brushes pictured are not two-toned and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> it doesnt clump the makeup it applys very smoothly</li>
            <li> Very cheap.</li>
            <li> This Shany professional cosmetic set is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes, make-up application is so easy with these tools.</li>
            <li> They were everything I needed for my makeup kit, with my sisters always stealing them I always stock up and this was just a easy cheep kit that was amazing.</li>
            <li> However, the blush brush was pretty much amazing, as it did a really good  job concentrating the blush on the apples of the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed these and they&#x27;re great as a first set of brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i strongly recommend buying these amazing brushes</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why this product is getting so many great reviews, they&#x27;re really misleading!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and organized and it&#x27;s easy to keep them that way with the pouch they came in.</li>
            <li> The set is pretty and I have not used all of the brushes yet, but from what I have used, I have found to be very nice.  </li>
            <li> Very nice brush set if you are in a bind or if purchasing makeup brushes for first time.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for some new brushes and these seemed like the perfect fit.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and everything was wrapped perfect so my products would not come</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just lucky to get a good set, but I am quite satisfied with what I got.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush is very cheap but it does an okay job.</li>
            <li> A large selection at a great price.</li>
            <li> , i wasn&#x27;t really happy with the blush and powder brush the hairs come out really easy, if your looking for professional brushes i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush set is better to pay more and get a good product and not regret it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and very good quality.</li>
            <li> much better price than others I looked to buy and quality seems very good so far.  </li>
            <li> Nice brushes for a very good deal, ordered them last year</li>
            <li> This item was delivered exactly as promised at a very reasonable price and made for a wonderful holiday gift idea!</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing, I&#x27;ve used them some times already and are great and soft.</li>
            <li> This actually isn&#x27;t a huge problem for me though, because now it&#x27;s travel sized!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Not only are you getting some really good brushes but you get them at a great price.</li>
            <li> Everyone has a routine they follow and favorite eyeshadows, lipsticks, and mascaras they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love them overral.</li>
            <li> and she says that she is in love with them!&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love my Shany brush set.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fault for expecting slightly better quality than the synthetic bristles that make up some of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> The case is what I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> and I was in love with the case it comes in.</li>
            <li> (Y) :}</li>
            <li> Much better and have never shed on me.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of the brush holder and Brushes..</li>
            <li> I will defiantly be buying more from this wondeful company.</li>
            <li> Nevermind the fact that the bag is cheap-looking and has an overwhelming chemical smell, because I could air that out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, I got them cleaned and figured they&#x27;d be okay.  </li>
            <li> This set is okay</li>
            <li> but I have bought better brushes at the drug store.</li>
            <li> The brushes are ok...</li>
            <li> I love how they just glide on my skin when applying my beauty products.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes that are easy to wash to clean, without losing most of their bristles as soon as you use or wash them.</li>
            <li> love the pouch it comes in too.</li>
            <li> came faster than i thought also:)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> Obviously these are not the fanciest or best made brushes out there, but that&#x27;s why they are so affordable.</li>
            <li> I truly love them.  </li>
            <li> These make up brushes are ok</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I been researching many brushes so I can start my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t hesitate and purchase the set if you have been looking for brushes :)</li>
            <li> and the carrying case it comes in is so cute.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks so much better since I started using these</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife after reading the reviews and sure it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> overall it was about $20 very good price!</li>
            <li> Yay! :)</li>
            <li> rather use a more stuck together brush.</li>
            <li> Love the color scheme and the carrying case.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m really excited about is that it comes with a cute case which helps me keep the brushes in one place!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are not as good as others but they are worth the $13</li>
            <li> I was wanting a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li> thats ok too.</li>
            <li> im in love with them.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use all of them yet, but I love shadow brush.  </li>
            <li> I loved the price and it was worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll feel famous applying powder or getting clumps out of mascara.</li>
            <li> There are many brushes for all sorts of makeup uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off using my elf powder blush.</li>
            <li> luck with these if you are buying them. :)</li>
            <li> but there are better brush sets out</li>
            <li> -The eye brushes held up well through many washings and applications&lt;</li>
            <li> There is a power brush, blush brush, fan brush, lip brush, and many eye brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the colour and the variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> Glad I got  them,</li>
            <li> Glad I got them.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy though!</li>
            <li> Love they way they work with makeup and would buy again.  </li>
            <li> I will order more of there product in the furture</li>
            <li> so I guess it a okay product</li>
            <li> BUT you NEED to make sure you wash these before you use them.</li>
            <li> they are so cute thinking of re ordering</li>
            <li> i want to try more of Shany products.</li>
            <li> Again, you cannot get a better set for the money.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the handles and the storage case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in LOVE with them</li>
            <li> The product works but the material that it was made could be better.</li>
            <li> For the price its ok</li>

            <li> will be trying 2 get more products from the Shany company!&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>

            <li> These brushes were okay for the price..</li>

            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> i soon plan to buy more SHANy products.</li>
            <li> I love the roll up case they come in.</li>
            <li> but the chemical smell from the packaging is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Overall, we&#x27;re very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Shany brushes.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But I have bought drug-store brushes that I feel are better quality than these are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give them 5 stars because they have lived through many applications and disinfecting and haven&#x27;t fallen apart.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a big deal lol!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE these brushes.</li>

            <li> I did love the eyebrow, and concealer brush, but the rest were just OK.</li>

            <li> Much better to spend a lot and buy from sephora.</li>
            <li> Love this set brought over a year ago and now writing a review.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and decided to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love my brushes I&#x27;ve had them for a while</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are ok.</li>
            <li> You get many brushes.</li>
            <li> I suppose love the eye shadow brushes though</li>
            <li> Cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Top notch quaility.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream]].</li>
            <li> y me llego a tiempo :)</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I wish there were more variety in a 12-pack, because I don&#x27;t want to buy like, a 72-piece to have the selection of brushes I need.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great product</li>
            <li> I was pleased after purchasing this set.</li>
            <li> More than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> china requires products to be tested on animals how can i be sure of this ?</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, the variety of brushes and the brush quality.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying these, they&#x27;re cheap in price &amp; they&#x27;re even cheaper in quality!</li>
            <li> but im sure i will..</li>
            <li> im glad i got it</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than others I&#x27;ve paid a LOT more for.</li>
            <li> I love the blush brush</li>
            <li> I love the pouch it comes in aswell and the box</li>
            <li> I love shany cosmetics...</li>
            <li> I received this brush set as a gift from my son for Christmas, and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> The pouch it comes in is wicked cute too</li>
            <li> yes they are better but comparing them to anything you buy at Sephora</li>
            <li> is much much better.  </li>
            <li> Better quality.</li>
            <li> Love all of shany products</li>
            <li> favorite and most-used of this set are 4, 5, 9 an 10.</li>
            <li> Most of the brush tips are medium to chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Average: 3 1/4 stars</li>
            <li> I would prefer a firmer brush just for more precision when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> :) Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Shany has a great reputation and this is real value for the money.</li>
            <li> for the money it was an ok purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets, this set had so much more.  </li>
            <li> l love it</li>
            <li> I was expecting better quality and to say what to use each brush for on the brush.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It saves a lot of space to store them like that and the bag is stylish .</li>
            <li> I love the variety and the price</li>
            <li> Great brushes, would recommend them to anyone, fast delivery, a brush for everything, real hair brushes so they&#x27;re washable, great pouch to keep them all in one place</li>
            <li> Love the brushes.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have had products arrive in disposable packing of better quality.  </li>
            <li> I love my Shany Neutral Eye Palette</li>
            <li> but if you want non-shedders you should probably spend more money on a nicer set.</li>
            <li> but I would prefer to buy something with more quality.</li>
            <li> Now I want more.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying 5 better quality brushes rather than wasting your money on this set.</li>
            <li> I would buy more items from the brand.</li>
            <li> The storage pack it comes in is cute and the brushes are labeled so you know what to use them for.</li>
            <li> I love the case they came in and even a guide as to what brush is used for what part of the face.</li>
            <li> She was very excited and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are VERY soft, so beautiful feeling on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when i got the brushes i was very excited to see how they worked but after having them for about a month now i have realized that they are deff.</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t phenomenal quality, but they&#x27;re pretty nice for the amazing price.</li>

            <li> For the price you cannot beat it and it is a great starter set, I have moved up to more high end brushes</li>
            <li> For around $12 and some decent reviews I thought they were a great bargain.</li>
            <li> The brushes themseleves are attractive to look at and do a decent job at applying my makeup.  </li>

            <li> Shany deliverd big time with this set of brushes ,specially designed for the make up artist ,the soft feel is amazing , the bag is sleek and great for girls ,and the quality is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen for the price !</li>
            <li> shipping was fast, and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> While the packaging was amazing, and it looked cool, it smelled like a dying rat snuffed with some molten chemicals as soon as I unwrapped the case.</li>
            <li> With first applications they were good,  </li>
            <li> The eye brushes from this kit are however pretty good for eye make up applications...</li>
            <li> They are pretty good for being inexpensive.</li>
            <li> For $12.99, it&#x27;s still a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> This brush set is exactly what I wanted, it has a good variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes were good for a first timer but others may not think so.</li>
            <li> but anyways they were a pretty good price</li>
            <li> Its pretty good, even tho there is some shedding of the brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty good quality.</li>

            <li> I loved this set at first...</li>
            <li> Once I used them for the first time, I loved them.  </li>
            <li> They appeared to work well at first, but I started to wonder if the eye palette just wasn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li> They were not expensive and she works in the cosmetology industry and said they were good quality</li>
            <li> the brushes for eye makeup are pretty good quality considering the price</li>

            <li> i first loved this, however now the bristles are coming out.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of brushes and the price, the bag is beautiful nice leather, the brushes aren&#x27;t super soft may be is because am used to the painting brushes, am new in the world of make up, but one thing i say they are a very nice quality.</li>
            <li> case they came in is wonderfully sturdy and keeps everything wrapped up in a nice neat little package.</li>

            <li> they are handy in their own carring case and make appling make up so much easier.</li>
            <li> The price seemed to be good and the product offered a good selection for multiple application purposes.</li>
            <li> The red case is great and it&#x27;s nice to have something to carry and store my brushes.  </li>
            <li> It even came with a great red pouch that was nice.</li>

            <li> The bristles are effective in applying makeup evenly and clean easily with soap and water or brush cleanser.  </li>

            <li> Love them,but the brushes arnt really soft as I&#x27;d like but there very nice quality an.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t soak your brushes when you clean them!</li>
            <li> It was a good by as my daughter enjoys watching video tutorials on hair, nails, and makeup applications but did not have the brushes they recommend for certain looks.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice, and very soft.</li>
            <li> the brushes are very nice and very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> they are a pretty color and the brushes are great for people who love creating their own eyeshadows and want soft brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are very good quality (especially for the price).</li>
            <li> The Brushes are really soft and have great coverage, I love that I have a good variety of eye shadow brushes, that was the main reason for this purchase.</li>
            <li> Then you can see what I think are more accurate photos of each brush..</li>
            <li> As far as the quality of the brishes themselves, all mine have held up well and feel great.</li>
            <li> A beautiful stylish red bag to hold brushes.  </li>
            <li> But the quality of brushes is pretty good for the price-doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how these brushes are such a great price at such a great quality!</li>
            <li> they are definitely worth the regular price, but it&#x27;s always awesome to get a better deal.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something for a young girl they are great.  </li>
            <li> These Brushes are really soft and great to use.</li>
            <li> I know they are cheap, but they are cheap for a reason!</li>
            <li> I love using them, they are smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> The Shany professional is a great set to have.</li>
            <li> Better to find something that is worth more because it is better quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great so far.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit it inside of my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> otherwise, best 12.99 i ever spent</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of brushes just to qualify for free shipping:)</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC :)  </li>
            <li> and i love it for light hand application.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, these brushes are the most fantastic set out there.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and feels great on your skin</li>
            <li> The pouch is also cute and pretty handy.</li>
            <li> Sure, you can say that using &#x27;spare parts&#x27; makes you cruelty free, but let&#x27;s be serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is lacking as well.</li>
            <li> These are not rock star fabulously made, but they are okay.  </li>
            <li> and she said they work great and feel soft against skin</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and of great quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes work wonderfully, the hair brush hair started to fall out when I cleaned them, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I think the 3 most important brushes in this set are the blush brush, the powder brush and the fan brush.</li>
            <li> the strands of hair are nice and it is worth the money</li>
            <li> I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> These brushes look real fancy, I thought I was getting a good deal for the price..</li>
            <li> They seem to be of good quality and are much cheaper than buying the &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> Really qood product at good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good set if you&#x27;re really into eyes.</li>
            <li> very affordable and loved it</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Loved them so much, we bought them again.  </li>
            <li> So I would say it is worth the investment if you don&#x27;t have any make up brushes of your own and a budget.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Amazon.com for my SHANY product and a nice and easy delivery!</li>
            <li> Worth buying nice strong bristles.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes they are nice and long very nice colors</li>
            <li> very soft, and bright colors, purchased them for my mom and am going to buy some for myself now, for sure.</li>
            <li> These are nice and came in the right amount of time and in condition promised.  </li>
            <li> the brushes are very nice and the quality is good, the wide variety of brushes and instructions were very useful</li>
            <li> it ships fast and comes in a cute case ! :)</li>
            <li> I received my Brush Set about 5 days ago and so far, I love them!!</li>
            <li> Pouch is very nice and professional.</li>
            <li> But the hair is soft, and it doesn&#x27;t fall out on your face, which is very nice.</li>
            <li> Compared to some of the other brushes that I have bought these are the best.</li>
            <li> All the other brushes are excellent</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, so I&#x27;m not as educated in brushes as others might be, but I love this set!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes and I LOVE them!</li>
            <li> also it&#x27;s a full collection for her makeup set!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased them, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> but I do use these brushes daily and they are good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are a great buy!</li>
            <li> but all the other brushes are WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> It works excellent with their other beauty products.</li>
            <li> First off I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> I am going to check out the other products SHANY sells because I am so impressed with these brushes and how affordable the company has made them.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes and the eyeshadow brushes are very ideal for small areas that you want touch up and the eyebrow brush/comb combo are very ideal, although I wished they would have thrown in a mascara brush.</li>
            <li> easy to handle ...</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes, they&#x27;re great and firm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my Estee Lauder brush cleaner to clean the brushes, because they too had the overwhelming smell of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> But I find that when I&#x27;m putting my makeup on a lot of the hair in the brushes will be pulled out easily...</li>
            <li> Easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li> So many brushes too,its a great buy for only $15.</li>
            <li> And application is easy.</li>
            <li> The set came very quickly.</li>
            <li> They blend my stuff well,&amp; they are easy to use .</li>
            <li> Easy to store.</li>
            <li> easy to clean :)</li>
            <li> Great starting kit for people getting more into make up</li>
            <li> They fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> pouch is also helpful, I can easily carry it in my bag, it is compact and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perfect for the everyday makeup guru :)</li>
            <li> they also arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> They apply the color I need and are easy to clean and are stored neatly in the cute pouch.</li>

            <li> This set is great for personal use and you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes they are soft and the price is great!</li>
            <li> but they actually a bright red was kind of upset at firt</li>
            <li> Overall, they&#x27;re great :)</li>
            <li> Brushes broke to easily</li>
            <li> it is quite convenient to have makeup brushes that are easy to carry around..</li>

            <li> Overall, I am happy with my purchase and feel that the brushes were appropriately described in the product description.  </li>
            <li> They were delivered very quickly...</li>
            <li> Because of the case it is easy to transport.</li>
            <li> Also, on the blush and foundation brushes the bristles fall out quite easily.</li>
            <li> Makes them easy to use and easy to find&gt;</li>
            <li> but im trying to warn yall before you buy it there are better brush sets and cheaper thanks &amp; have a nice day</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell when you take it out of the bag.</li>
            <li> , it was too strong.</li>
            <li> Four of the brushes will have a strong plastic \\&quot;topper\\&quot; keep the plastic that comes with the lip brush, fan brush and two blush brushes to help these keep their shape ladies.    </li>
            <li> sure to wash with gentle, diluted shampoo and warm water before using!&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT when I opened the box, the plastic/petroleum/PVC smell was so strong it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> and they are still going strong</li>
            <li> I received all individual items as described, each in their own plastic packaging and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Comes with a strong smell, but if you wash them when you get them, it goes away immediately.</li>
            <li> The bag that they came in had a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this particular set of brushes.</li>
            <li> The pouch had a strong smell of plastic.</li>
            <li> One issue though - the case smelt strongly of paint.</li>
            <li> but so far so good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I wish the case did not smell so strong...</li>
            <li> It does have a strong plastic scent that goes away after time.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell and had to air out for a couple of days before I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Strong smell.</li>
            <li> They are good quality brushes and do well with my sensitive skin:)</li>
            <li> For the price, these are a good value and decent brushes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect, professional brush kit that&#x27;s priced at a reasonable price, you better place an order right now!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that the quality would be good because of the price, but I was very surprised!</li>
            <li> Great for professional and first time users!!</li>
            <li> The cost is just good deal, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality, not my favorite brushes for actual makeup, but they&#x27;re surprisingly good for stage makeup.</li>
            <li> They are good to have as backup, but I will be buying a high quality set instead.</li>
            <li> I am very very excited to try them and happy overall with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very very excited to try them and happy overall with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The red pouch the brushes come in is not the best quality, but what can you expect for the price right?</li>
            <li> The brushes are very good quality, and I couldn&#x27;t find any flaws with the brushes themselves, but the case they come in is kind of annoying to roll it up and wrap the straps all the way around, and if I were to change it, I would make it have a velcro or a button or a clasp of some sort instead of the straps, but otherwise, great!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft brushes and the pouch is gorgeous, when I opened it everyone asked where I had gotten it, and when I used them this morning they blended extremely well and were great for putting on fondation, eyeliner, eye makeup, even lip products!</li>
            <li> so you dont have to do much and they are so soft when they touch your face great produt again and the price amazing</li>
            <li> First of all, THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I liked this product when I first got it because 1.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes but did not come with the exact set pictured.</li>
            <li> Just enough brushes to create a beautiful look for any day of the week.</li>
            <li> Mine came in a beautiful red.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a pretty color and they come in a nice pouch.  </li>
            <li> and the brush carrier thing is pretty handy though</li>
            <li> And it is a beautiful red color.</li>
            <li> The set is pretty nice, it has a lot of variety.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> &amp; they come whit instructions which is pretty nice</li>
            <li> The red leather-like pouch is beautiful.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve held up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> So yeah, I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a good set of brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li> i needed new make-up brushes and didnt have new money so this was a excellent buy!</li>
            <li> Great product..Came quick and brand new.</li>
            <li> I got new ones for pretty good deal and they were nice and efficient.</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are fine.  </li>
            <li> Definitely perfect first brush set for your preteen or teen.</li>
            <li> The brushes also stank but after i washed them they were fine.</li>
            <li> you will have an angled brush that is best used for lining the top of the lids, a small lip brush, a brow comb/brush and an applicator.</li>
            <li> The brushes however are so fine that they don&#x27;t pick up powder or shadow and you end up wasting makeup and don&#x27;t get coverage on your skin.   </li>
            <li> That said, I was less than impressed with the eyelash/eyebrow brush, foundation brush, and blush brush.  </li>
            <li> but they have been fine since then.</li>
            <li> and it should be fine.</li>
            <li> so I think these brushes will work fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Camel hair removes the dust without scratching fine metals and plastics.</li>
            <li> if you like that hot red color and great quality brushes!</li>
            <li> They work just fine</li>
            <li> They are my first set of actual makeup brushes and I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> fine-</li>
            <li> Super soft, professional looking, great variety, amazing value!</li>
            <li> At this price, the quality is just fine.</li>
            <li> The hairs are fine</li>
            <li> and they work fine.  </li>
            <li> I guess they are fine.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow ones are still working just fine, though.</li>
            <li> Also has a great variety for pretty much anything you might need a brush for.</li>
            <li> It looked fine to me and had the eyeshadow applicators I was looking for</li>
            <li> The brushes work fine.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fine and I received this ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow I really wasn&#x27;t expecting such great quality since they were so cheap, but these brushes are great!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brushed bet affordable and they are so nice !</li>
            <li> so cheap and easy</li>
            <li> They are face, and apply the makeup evenly and smoothly quickly!</li>
            <li> Such good quality and cute too for such a good price!</li>
            <li> Love them very pretty</li>
            <li> The product comes in a beautiful red leather carrying case with individual slots for each brush, great for traveling.</li>
            <li> they pick up makeup really well and the pouch they come in is absolutely adorable!</li>
            <li> I love this &amp; would recommend it very much!</li>
            <li> and I love how it will keep all my new brushes and the ones I already own all in one place.</li>
            <li> When I saw this deal on Amazon it had pretty good reviews and the price was right</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a quick buy without much thought since the price was really good.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to work with and easy to clean.</li>

            <li> okay these items are very soft and nice</li>
            <li> I love love love my new brushes i got today</li>
            <li> They are great I clean them with baby wash and their are soft and clean</li>
            <li> My only thing I would have liked to have seen was something that told what all the uses of the brushes were since their are so many!</li>
            <li> If you need a cheap set, these will do just fine.</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes once a week with warm water and Sephora brush shampoo and one of the large eye shadow brushes</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes and certainly affordable.  </li>
            <li> I got the brushes and felt like they aren&#x27;t the best quality ,Of course if you compare them to mac brushes your not going to like them they don&#x27;t shed and they had a little smell but</li>
            <li> I love that these are high quality, yet affordable brushes!!!</li>
            <li> the spooly brush really isn&#x27;t that great for the brows, the brush is too large for anyones brows</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with them they are very soft and pick up the eyeshadow easily.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL RED AND LOVE HOW SOFT THE BRUSHES ARE AND VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> From the beautiful leather pouch to the complete selection of high quality brushes, I was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love this because they&#x27;re so inexpensive but the brushes are still much nicer then you would possible think they could be and the variety in them is also very very good.</li>
            <li> They are also really super for making some unique looks!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to check these out!</li>
            <li> They are really smooth and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> brushes have not shed at all, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t a huge problem</li>
            <li> and these were cheap cheap CHEAP.</li>
            <li> My expectations were huge and were reached.</li>
            <li> This one was HUGE for me.</li>
            <li> and they are easy to clean and they make the make-up go on so smooth</li>
            <li> AND it doesn&#x27;t absorb product which is a huge bonus because then you&#x27;re not wasting your money.  </li>
            <li> Huge mistake.</li>
            <li> There is a huge range of sizes.</li>
            <li> The difference it makes with my makeup is huge.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice and they work very well.</li>
            <li> Cheap product,  doesn&#x27;t blend in make up</li>
            <li> So, I would recommend this, you know, if it was available........</li>
            <li> Overall a great deal for $13.</li>
            <li> They make makeup application a breeze and allow the makeup to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I never planned on using these as my primary brushes.</li>
            <li> Therefore, based on the cheap quality of the case, I was worried about the quality of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re well made, durable, and easy to clean.     </li>
            <li> The price was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Also important to note.  </li>
            <li> The bag is also extremely cheap looking</li>
            <li> i thought it was going to be some cheap dollar store type</li>
            <li> this set is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall, i am happy with my purchase and  would definetly recommend.  </li>
            <li> but I now use these everyday, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> This is a great set of make up brushes, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It holds the brushes securely.</li>
            <li> They are just cheap dollar store quality brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean and the makeup your using doesn&#x27;t cling or clump in the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Amazon prime 2day free shipping.</li>
            <li> and why should it, its made of cheap vinyl but anyway for 25 dollars you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I got a red pouch, which is great since it matches the color of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> 2nd year in a row I&#x27;ve ordered this great set</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t anything amazing, but they are very sturdy for the price.  </li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> Oh my... This brush set is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes are a great substitute in these situations.</li>
            <li> I probably will never need to buy another and some will be available for others to inherit when I&#x27;m gone.</li>
            <li> For Approx $15, they are fantastic and I adore my brushes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it came in a red plastic roll/up case which is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t back out of buying these!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and very helpful.</li>
            <li> Shany has been an awesome product for me thus far, i intend to purchase more from their company in the future.</li>
            <li> Article is acceptable, filled my expectations.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought these brushes and they are great.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made to me</li>
            <li> and i just didn&#x27;t enjoy them at all.</li>
            <li> Cheap but convenient.</li>
            <li> Folds up perfectly to fit neatly in a purse.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that they don&#x27;t have a lot of blending brushes but everything else is great.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li> This set is primarily a brush set focused on the eyes.</li>
            <li> and they look fantastic.</li>
            <li> The brushes felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and work well with mineral make up</li>
            <li> but they do not look cheap, fall apart or shed.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone, hope you enjoy them.</li>
            <li> They are really soft and so far they have worked wonderfully, I use them for personal purposes and I&#x27;m happy about the results.</li>
            <li> but the rest of brushes looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself, however I thought that it was a bit flimsy and cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I sure got my money&#x27;s worth with these.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made and bristles fall out off all brushes and irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> i bought them for my daughter and they are great for a starting up make up tips and learning how to use all the variety of brushes</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding inexpensive brushes that didn&#x27;t shed their bristles and this is definitely a great set!</li>
            <li> Yes, they are cheap</li>
            <li> Also, if this is important: It doesn&#x27;t come with a foundation/concealer brush either.</li>
            <li> I am just getting into the real routine of how to do make up and these brushes were amazing with my start.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the picture made these brushes look very luscious.  </li>
            <li> and when I pack it is is to fit in any suit case</li>
            <li> This is primarily an eye brush kit.</li>
            <li> All these brush kits are available shipped and sold by amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say again how important it is to wash them because the difference is like night and day</li>
            <li> Apply makeup evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> This will be great for those who travel regularly</li>
            <li> I really liked they picked up make up very well.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love:)  Hope this helps and potential buyers!!</li>
            <li> I thought that with the number of reviews and stars that I would enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li> Great for personal use or for gifts.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes was more than I expected and my niece indicates that she is able to apply her makeup more effectively.</li>

            <li> The storage pouch makes it easy for storage and keeps your brushes clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> but hey they were cheap.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much that I purchased a set for my sister too for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my everyday use.</li>
            <li> my makeup goes on smooth and I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> so I decided to find some cheap brushes to start off with.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I got this, but the brushes are definitely nice.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes doesn&#x27;t hold my foundation too well but a great starter kit for beginners</li>
            <li> Really cheap quality,</li>
            <li> Everything I need for home makeup application in one great set, and for the amazingly low price, cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> Might as well just take the free ones that come with drugstore eyeshadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bag to carry brushes was a nice surprise, it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> But overall, great beginner set.</li>
            <li> doesnt look cheap at all for the price.</li>
            <li> If you assume you are buying a cruelty free product because they tout that they are a member of PETA on their description, you are incorrect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to splurge for better brushes.</li>
            <li> but none show signs of breaking and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive set of makeup brushes that I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice set at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap though.</li>

            <li> These brushes are so easy to clean.</li>

            <li> Apart from that it is fantastic based on the price.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S CHEAP.</li>
            <li> The packaging looks tacky and cheap.</li>
            <li> Some cheap brushes that stick to your face.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush set...</li>
            <li> They do not feel cheap and do not shed</li>
            <li> The cover is a cheap plastic</li>
            <li> They are Cheaply made brushes and smelled of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> makes it easier to see what&#x27;s on them since I use a lot of light or saturated colors.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy these brushes and the way they are arranged on the brush bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great set for anyone just starting to experiment with makeup.</li>

            <li> Now i know why these things were so cheap...</li>
            <li> because they ARE CHEAP.</li>
            <li> They are worth much more than the price charged.  </li>
            <li> I love shopping on Amazon, too, so it was worth it</li>
            <li> I have to be honest when I say that I don&#x27;t use them all, however the ones I do use are well made, and very functional.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Its my primary set.</li>
            <li> Makeup application goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am happy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes over a year ago and they are still in fantastic condition.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, these are good brushes.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to have every available makeup brush in a tool kit ready.</li>
            <li> When I received it as I was pleasantly surprised as they seem good quality and the smell reported comes from the package.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, but it may cause an allergic reaction if you don&#x27;t wash them first.</li>
            <li> The pouch is soft and in 100% good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> But overall there good:)</li>
            <li> so far so good, I&#x27;ll say.</li>
            <li> The bag is so convenient and the brushes have worked good so far for me.  </li>
            <li> The real goat hair gives it a perfect texture and softness and just enough stiffness to maintain control.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality many different shapes for applying make up.</li>
            <li> It has everything you could want in a brush set, the case is better than most I have had the brush hair dosent shead and are very durable.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> this remains to be seen, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> My GF loved it she was surprised it came with so many things to choose from its worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is a good, all around set of brushes complete with case.</li>
            <li> I use more of the eyeshadow brushes then anything else and have got to say they are good, although I wish the bigger eyeshadow brushes had been fluffier to help with blending.</li>
            <li> I love that you can get 13 good brushes and a pouch for only 12.99.</li>
            <li> so glad I found all the brushes and more that she wanted and needed to get the look she wants at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> and I so far so good..</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter is very involved in theatre - ordered these for her stage make-up and was very happy with the quality!</li>
            <li> Be good for a &amp;#34;starter set&amp;#34; for someone young and just fooling around..</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, soft brush tips.</li>
            <li> Great looks; however, the brushes I use the most are a bit stiff, even after more than a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially love the blush brush, large powder brush, slanted eyeliner blush for applying gel eyeliner, and the three flat brushes which I use for eyeshadow, but which are probably for shadown, concealer, and foundation.  </li>
            <li> Although the price seemed too good to be true, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it beat spending $28.00 for a new Lauder eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautifully packaged in a cute case (mine was black).</li>
            <li> They came in a red cosmetic case that is cheap but very handy for all of the brushes.</li>
            <li> , otherwise I&#x27;d be more pissed than I am right now.</li>
            <li> For that many brushes the price is just right.</li>
            <li> My new brushes are super soft, there is a wonderful variety.</li>
            <li> super easy to clean and easy to take with me when I travel in the case they come in.</li>
            <li> There was a strong (not necessarily bad) smell when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Very nice set lots of shapes and sizes plenty to choose from for different uses.</li>
            <li> very useful...</li>
            <li> They are very nice and only $1-$5 a piece.</li>
            <li> All of them have been very useful.</li>
            <li> are very useful to me.</li>
            <li> honestly i have no idea what i&#x27;m doing when it comes to makeup, so it was a good start for someone like me to have all different kinds of brushes for pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes you will need for your daily routine, and easy to keep organized as it comes with a lovely pouch!</li>
            <li> These come in an adorable red pouch and they do what they are supposed to do exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> But after trying them out for a few weeks i fell in love!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes , very soft and easy to work with .</li>
            <li> They came nicely packaged in a beautiful red is soft case and protectors around the hair of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too advanced with applying makeup &amp; this kit is user friendly.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with it, would definitely purchase again from SHANY :)</li>
            <li> They are great for a first time purchase, but they will not likely sustain themselves over time like my set of brushes from Sephora which are a tad more...</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no shedding which is a must in a good brush!</li>
            <li> Ok I am not sure why so many people think these are great brushes.  </li>
            <li> they are great exactly like the picture, the Bristles are soft and do not fall out</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the best brushes ever, but they are much higher quality than I would have expected to get for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> They are full and soft, and the carrying case is good quality too.  </li>
            <li> With the carrying pouch allowing you to roll up the brushes, it makes it super easy to keep them organized.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Its pretty much just good for tickling your face.</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes!!!</li>
            <li> They really hold the Shany colors well and make applying them very easy.  </li>
            <li> These feel very high quality, have soft bristles, are easy to clean, and are great sizes.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who spend hundreds on high end brands for brushes as these brushes are truly amazing.</li>
            <li> they are so soft when they touch your face great produt again and the price amazing really thanks so much.</li>
            <li> So far the brushes are great, soft and a great variety, not to mention brushes for this price, completely unbeatable.</li>
            <li> :) With that price, even if you end up not having a favorite new set of brushes, you will gain some you didn&#x27;t have or have a travel set at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am honestly very satisfied, these brushes are amazing and the price is even better, this is a definite must have for any beginner or even someone who is more advanced, you can never have enough brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know very little about cosmetics and brushes, but she is very happy with this set, thus I would recommend this set to anyone.</li>
            <li> SUPER EASY TO CLEAN TOO.</li>
            <li> These are well worth the money and do the job more than just adequately.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely red case that folds up for easy storage and the brush quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I just got the brushes today, and I&#x27;m so excited about them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll probably fade over time, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Shany is also animal friendly so that also boosted my decision to buy these brushes.</li>
            <li> Between this brush set and the eyeshadow palette, I&#x27;m so pleased and will definitely purchase more Shany products from Amazon!</li>
            <li> The variations of brushes and the foldable cloth container they come in make it perfect for travel in a small carry on.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes so much!</li>
            <li> When they arrived I was so excited to try them.</li>
            <li> Ok girls if you are looking for a great cosmetic brush set this is it I was so excited to receive this product, and let me say these people don&#x27;t mess around</li>
            <li> I am so excited to order these brushes.</li>
            <li> item arrived on time in all original packaging.</li>
            <li> I especially enjoyed the carrying pouch that they come in and the small booklet guide to tell you what each brush is used for.</li>
            <li> it to be more puffier but over all I love everything and the red bag I love</li>
            <li> So far she is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Such a nice color!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too excited about this.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Leads me to belive these brushes are bought wholesale from china (Usually not the best quality) and sold by different vendors with defferent names.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything is in order &amp; totally worth it!</li>
            <li> i was excited to get my brushes</li>
            <li> My wife was pleased with these at first.</li>
            <li> but this is the first brush set that I have bought that has me completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure wether or not to buy these, but for the price I was willing to gamble</li>
            <li> I was really excited for the set for the price.</li>
            <li> These are the first brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I can tell they aren&#x27;t top of the line.  </li>
            <li> Love this set so much I bought two as gifts!</li>
            <li> this was so worth it!</li>
            <li> From first inspection I love the set.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind using small brushes or are prepared with glue or tape, this is great!</li>
            <li> they were definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> But it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> Comes with a nice variety of brushes and the bristles are not hard and brittle.</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice and soft, and the travel case came in very handy for my recent business trip.</li>
            <li> They come in a great case that I can easily pack with my other cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> The brushes have a very unique smell when they first come out of the plastic wrapping.</li>
            <li> I was new to wearing makeup and these were AMAZING starter brushes.</li>
            <li> I’m not a make up artist, I just wanted a nice set of brushes to experiment with some new makeup techniques.</li>
            <li> They came as new in the box with an explanation of what each brush is and what it&#x27;s for, which was handy.</li>
            <li> but I would have liked to have been able to choose my color although I got red</li>
            <li> and the fact you dont HAVE to clean the brushes all the time...</li>
            <li> I despaired of actually being able to replicate the application on my own at home...</li>
            <li> I do not put them in water to clean...</li>
            <li> I needed a nice set with some smaller thinner brushes for more precision and this delivered.  </li>
            <li> Not the best quality as far as the big brushes go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought brushes from Walmart that I&#x27;ve kept clean and treated well</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and they rarely shed hairs.</li>
            <li> They are made with quality and I like the nice red pouch it came in:)</li>
            <li> It was alright for the price, u do have to spend more on ur makeup brushes, this was  better for a young girl.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t super experienced with make-up some of the brushes feel redundant, but so far they work great and do not shed.</li>
            <li> came in cute red foldout-style pouch which made for a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I loved the variety of brushes for such a cheap brush</li>
            <li> I only wish there was a foundation brush, but I was able to find one I liked at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> it came in a nice red case and all the brushes work fabulously!</li>
            <li> Overall I think that this is a fabulous set all together for a fair price.</li>
            <li> The case is way better even than expected, and is good quality.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making these professional brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li> They stay clean and dust-free.</li>
            <li> ) they are soft on your face and last great!</li>
            <li> While these are cheap, you will pay what you would have for a good set of brushes replacing these constantly.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful at first but they will not last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for a beginner or someone who really doesn&#x27;t know much about application.</li>
            <li> I have purchesed brushes from high end retailers such as bare minerals and department store cosmetics counters and these brushes were every bit as good and came beautifully packaged in a roll-up case for easy travel.  </li>
            <li> they are very soft and trendy, I do recommend this item.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and you get a nice variety.</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes, it is very useful, very practical (can take it everywhere)</li>
            <li> I did like the brushes they are soft and pretty nice quality, it does not have a lot of face brushes mostly eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> and they are by far my favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> I am brand new to the brush experience, however these seem to be pretty good.  </li>
            <li> today got here super fast!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these especially for the price and the seemingly good quality but only the brush tips themselves are nice.  </li>
            <li> the bristles fall out very easily, not the best quality product.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was great, since the larger brushes can so easily become</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy , I&#x27;m recommend 100% to buy your cosmetics here its easy simple and fast</li>
            <li> Im sure I bought the right item at right price.</li>
            <li> However, I am in no way saying you need to go spend $15.00 on \\&quot;special brush</li>
            <li> the case is nothing too special, it&#x27;s just a pouch, but it does it&#x27;s job of holding the brushes</li>
            <li> the bristles aren&#x27;t sculpted right for me and there is no blending brush!</li>
            <li> Returned these right away!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using the brushes either personally or professionally, highly recommend getting a good make up remover- these brushes cover so well that you&#x27;ll really want to clean up or your foundation will wind up on your pillows/clothes at night.</li>
            <li> So far, I love the package it comes with, it is super cute and true to its description.</li>
            <li> So awesome that the hairs don&#x27;t fall out of these when you use them which is what I have experienced with all the other makeup brushes I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to clean before using, they stand up to being cleaned very well.</li>
            <li> Great brush kit, there&#x27;s a brush for every need in a cute little package!</li>
            <li> I was super excited when they came</li>
            <li> The brushes actually look better in person than in the pictures above, which was very surprising.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, and I am very impressed with how fluffy, soft the brush is.</li>
            <li> Minimal hair loss from the brushes and they work great</li>
            <li> Great gift for a girl of almost any age, wide variety of material.</li>
            <li> The bright red is cheerful and fun</li>
            <li> The handles are a nice length and the whole brush seems to be pretty sturdy</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the bag, only my sister can comment on product, so far I feel, it worth cost.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good and soft.</li>
            <li> Now the burshes are nice and soft.......</li>
            <li> Overall I thought it was a good price for what I was getting</li>
            <li> I really have fell in love with the brushes.</li>
            <li> definitely pleased with the price and quality of these&lt;br /&gt;brushes and can do so much with them</li>
            <li> thanks :)</li>
            <li> I use them on a daily basis, and they&#x27;re a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> on the whole i feel satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like the pricing on this item, so cheap!</li>
            <li> The blush brush is nice and soft and bushy.</li>
            <li> They were soft, applied smoothly on my skin, and loved the very organized case it came with.  </li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are nice quality and they are soo soft.</li>
            <li> The Essential line is the cheapest at $1, but some of the brushes are not that good.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft &amp; nice to the face.</li>
            <li> : I really wish i had gotten a more feminem color</li>
            <li> Very well made we both love them.</li>
            <li> Loved the overall brushes.</li>
            <li> This is such a good price for this set.</li>
            <li> i really dont write a review until im sure what im going to post!&lt;br /&gt;i bought them like</li>
            <li> The Bristles don&#x27;t fall off onto your face and it makes a nice soft touch to your makeup.</li>
            <li> : Obviously I am going to start out with the good things about this product!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t read anything else in this review, which you really should because I KNOW my make up products, make SURE you read this.</li>
            <li> Kind of flismy sort of natural looking.</li>
            <li> the brushes are good and are glued properly ...doesn&#x27;t fall off from the handle....</li>
            <li> You get such a good deal for the price of this set.</li>
            <li> the brushes seem good enough for every day use.</li>
            <li> They are not as full or dense as in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I ready love it</li>
            <li> Granted, they are inexpensive, but if you wanted something that lasts just buy individual brushes of good quality.</li>
            <li> They seem well made for the price, and are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, I being using it since I got it and also using it with my daughter (9 years old) when she has dance performances or teather plays.  </li>
            <li> She loved them and actually keeps them all togeather in the Pouch.</li>
            <li> The only brush that I would have loved to have would be an angled blush brush....</li>
            <li> and I needed brushes that were cheap and useful.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these brushes and out of the box I did.</li>
            <li> I LOVED the case that the brushes came in, it stores them compactly for ease of use, especially when traveling.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised on how nice these are</li>
            <li> Overall, some good brushes for their price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice and soft and seem like they will hold up well.  </li>
            <li> Good purchase overall.</li>
            <li> But overall for the price it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> i ordered it because not only was it a lot of brushes for a good price but came in a to go wrap carrier thing.</li>
            <li> Red brush roll is really nice and easy clean up.</li>
            <li> My teenage girl loved it.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much.</li>
            <li> In matter of fact, the E.L.F. Studio line brushes are better, and they&#x27;re at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> But love the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They are not as full as I wish they were</li>
            <li> But its true what they say</li>
            <li> brushes  dont look as good as in the picture, but would definitely would  buy again.</li>
            <li> I gave 2 stars because it is a nice, soft brush set</li>
            <li> And it is so true that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I really love it thanks, and i will tell all my friends to buy it, thank you again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft brushes and nice size selection.</li>
            <li> They look nice and feel soft.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, the brushes feel soft but they haven&#x27;t been tried out yet.</li>
            <li> I am not big on makeup but wanted some quality brushes at a good price and this is what I got.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the most high-end but for the price, I really like them.</li>
            <li> A guide for which brush is which would also be handy as I had never seen the &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; brush before and later found out that it works great for getting the extra powder off of your face without it leaving spots of color on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> None of the brushes picked up much pigment from my eyeshadows, my dollar store brushes performed better than these.</li>
            <li> The red is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This is a true case of you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is really nice soft leather</li>
            <li> but the actual brush parts are really good.</li>
            <li> i just love this product it really saved my life</li>
            <li> Bought for teen daughter and she loved and asked for again.</li>
            <li> I bought this brushes for my wife as a present after i had read so much good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> and I got a full set for the price of one brush at the stores.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good set to buy just for basic applications.</li>
            <li> Good for practice only then upgrade.</li>
            <li> This product got one star because the only brush in my set that was any good was the angled brush n</li>
            <li> I love the case and how it is real quality</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hobbies is to collect make up and make up brushes and with SHANEY COSMETICS, I can collect real quality brushes cheaper than  MAC and SEPHORA.</li>
            <li> i LOVED it only thing i wished it had was a foundation brush, i was looking foward to it !!!</li>
            <li> but, these brushes are great because they don&#x27;t shed their bristles, just enough choices in the bundle which comes in a nice leather wrap that rolls up and ties up nicely especially for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good set, especially for the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> well, they&#x27;re soft but they are kind of laking in volume?</li>
            <li> Also it comes in a nice case that folds over like a professional case.</li>
            <li> good quality, they come with a red bag for brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are only good for beginners.</li>
            <li> If only the brush was a bit thicker, but it&#x27;s good the way it is.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes hold so much shadow and applies so smoothly with almost no powder particles falling on your face!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something inexpensive and good enough to get the job done</li>
            <li> Overall a good value.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I would highly recommend this brush set to anyone who needs one! :)</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes but they don&#x27;t look professional.</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice case looks professional .</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad, though.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad buy for the money.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> There was no bad smell from my brushes and I ran my finger through the bristles and did not see any powder or dust.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not bad for 13 brushes $ price.</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush set for people setting their stride in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> not that hold some.the brush is tick and nice and the case is strong enough</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to use as well as wasy to clean!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a wide selection of brushes to choose from, so they do they job very nicely.</li>
            <li> The Essential Makeup and Brushes for Deliver a Flawless Finish of Makeup Application- Be Classy &amp; Elegant with This Professional M...]]    </li>
            <li> this is and okay product because it has some brushes that are great quality mostly the eye-shadow ones, but the big ones are a bit rough and always shedding hair</li>
            <li> I washed the brushes before using them with luke warm water mixed with baby oil and they have worked just fine.</li>
            <li> She said the bristols are nice and fine for different make up styles.</li>
            <li> Other than that this product was great.</li>
            <li> other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> the brushes isnt great as compared to what i read on other comments posted..</li>
            <li> From the other reviews it seemed they were great quality brushes but any brush I have gotten with a product</li>
            <li> These flat irons are good for the price.</li>
            <li> I Love my new Shany brushes!</li>
            <li> It smelled a bit when it first arrived, but after washing the brushes and letting the case air out, it was fine.</li>
            <li> from the first wash the hairs of the brush for powder and blush brush are out, the others are fine</li>
            <li> They clean easily and dry nicely.  </li>
            <li> And fortunately each brush comes in handy when I need a particular brush to do a particular job.</li>
            <li> will most definitely be perusing amazon and the Shany cosmentics webpage for more steals and deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this set is awesome especially for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped quickly</li>
            <li> ES UN PRODUCTO MUY UTIL PARA MAQUILLAJE, MUY PROFESIONAL, SUPER CHEVERE, LLEGO SIN NINGUN INCONVENIENTE, EMPACADO CORRECTAMENTE, SUGUIERO LA COMPRA DE ESTE PRODUCTO</li>
            <li> While red is not my favorite color, I do love the case these brushes came in.  </li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I love how fast I got these brushes!</li>
            <li> Super affordable and are not rink dink brushes that suck.</li>
            <li> I really use the smaller ones though, they are great for eyeshadow</li>
            <li> but that wore off quickly.</li>
            <li> After looking at the prices for brushes &amp; brush sets in any of the beauty stores this was a super value.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my own personal use and for $13 you can&#x27;t go wrong, they are great to use, soft, versatile and great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> super speedy delivery, pack comes with a brush guide</li>
            <li> This kit is a great buy for someone who is just starting out or if your a real pro.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li> The pouch is convenient and allows her to pack them up quickly and head out.  </li>
            <li> The chemical smell of the case went away quickly.</li>
            <li> The brushes are sturdy and most importantly the hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> but they arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I recommend washing these with mild soap before using them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my teenage daughter, who is in the process of learning to apply makeup using brushes and the different tools to help her with a flawless finished look.</li>
            <li> Luckily the brushes don&#x27;t stink so</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for a quick buy that will get the job done these should work.</li>
            <li> I got mine fairly quickly (2 days) because of my prime membership.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived quickly and were neatly packaged for delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were shipped quickly and well</li>
            <li> They come in a really convenient travel case which i lied, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I got these rather quickly and when I opened up the pouch, a chemical smell hit me.</li>
            <li> The hair falls off quickly.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem to fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li> Better than decent quality bristles.</li>
            <li> Overall, great value and high quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I have a few luxury brand makeup brushes but wanted something inexpensive - but still good - for experimenting with more daring, bold colors.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make these better is if the handles on the brushes were shorter to make them even more compact, and so when I&#x27;m leaning into the mirroe to see what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> Since red is my favorite color even better.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> the cost was unbeatable and the service was quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> High Quality brushes with cute carrying pouch and even instructions on which brushes are what.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t own such a large shadow brush like that before, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case the brushes come in is cheap but handy and a little cute.</li>
            <li> there are many brushes but there is a little slip that tells you what each brush is for, i was really happy they did that because i dont know much about</li>
            <li> I must say - I love, love, LOVE the brushes, though I wish they were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> The set has nice long handles, so they&#x27;re easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I bought some fantastic Ecotools and Real Techniques brushes that are soft and amazing.</li>
            <li> I followed the advice of other reviewers and washed them before using them and so far I am very happy with them.  </li>
            <li> I have used the blush brushes and really loved them but some of the other brushes looked a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this brush set and would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> And the red leather case it came in is very stylish.</li>
            <li> overall i am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> , the bristles of the brushes have not fallen out, they pick up a healthy amount of makeup and there&#x27;s not much left on the brush after application, and they&#x27;re fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The look of the case is very pretty.</li>
            <li> but cheap is exactly what you&#x27;re getting here.  </li>
            <li> Thank u all very much!</li>
            <li> my friends and family cannot believe I got such good quality brushes for such an amazing price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pouch smells like hot plastic when you first receive the product, so just leave the brushes in the fridge for a day if the smell honestly bothers you that much.</li>
            <li> great quality brushes and the red is soon pretty ;)</li>
            <li> Pouch is pretty cheap looking and some of the hairs came out of the brushes during use.  </li>
            <li> Also shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> I did kind of expect the brushes to be bigger, just because of how they looked in the pictures but all in all I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I soaked mine in a body mist and rinsed before I used them- very potent scent when you open them.</li>
            <li> I think some of the eyeshadow brushes are basically duplicates of each other just to make it seem like you get lots of brushes, but the bag is nice, stylish and durable.</li>
            <li> Not only does this look awesome on my makeup table, my brushes stay clean and dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as good as do scribed and the delivary was made long before the estimated date which is grate</li>
            <li> The case is beautiful, sleek, heavy duty, and there was NO stitching coming undone.</li>
            <li> I do wash them with brush cleanser which is good for long time use.  </li>
            <li> Good but no professional quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really digging Shany right now!!</li>
            <li> Im just very impatient, But the brushes are beautiful and I&#x27;m going to have alot of fun playing around with them!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I loved the color, they cleaned pretty easily and did not become rough after being cleaned</li>
            <li> Cute packaging,&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good quality (gets the job done, very little brush</li>
            <li> Now, I need to look for a new kabuki brush. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some new brushes and these really fit the bill!</li>
            <li> I love adding new tools to my collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve about had it with these and bought a new set of more plush and softer brushes that don&#x27;t lose bristles and</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite, go-to brushes.</li>
            <li> Hey, full disclosure right?</li>
            <li> They might not be professional brushes, but the quality is still pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Work great for your typical makeup use.</li>
            <li> They are great to apply make-up and cost keeps less than make-up brushes in stores.</li>
            <li> The handles are easy to hold and the ferral is really sturdy where the hairs are.</li>
            <li> I do not like short brushes, so I was particularly impressed with the long handles.  </li>
            <li> If you read the product description very closely, it says to be SURE to wash these brushes before your first use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I had a pretty good experiece with the purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for several months, and they&#x27;re holding up pretty good.  </li>
            <li> They collect and hold the makeup really well, and blending is really easy.</li>
            <li> Sweet Brushes, Nice Red Case.</li>
            <li> Brushes are made very well and easy to use and comes with a pouch too.  </li>
            <li> These are very nice, the only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars is because they smell very chemical like, I couldn&#x27;t use them right away.</li>
            <li> The brush tips are very soft, the handles are sturdy, and the carrying case is adorable.</li>
            <li> I found the brushes to be high quality, and the red pouch gave the set more of a trendy vibe.</li>
            <li> Really!!</li>
            <li> and i got the brushes first!</li>
            <li> When I first got these brushes, I was in Heaven!  </li>
            <li> but I was hoping to get it in red color my favorite!</li>
            <li> These are really pretty brushes!</li>
            <li> smell at first so wash them!</li>
            <li> WASH BEFORE FIRST USE!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> but what do you expect to get a whole set for a fraction of the price of one!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li> and she said her Cilents love how soft they were!</li>
            <li> The VERY 1st time I used them they fell apart!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Bought them over a year ago, and til&#x27; this day I continue to use these brushes, I&#x27;ve added to my collection of course, they&#x27;re not MAC brushes, but they hold up pretty well and do their job for their price!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for makeup brushes !!</li>
            <li> They are great for everyday use and the extra tools come in handy for special occasions as well.</li>
            <li> I love how every brush comes individually wrapped and how easy they are to organize.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are super soft and I love the handles, lightweight.</li>
            <li> Super soft, LOVE these brushes.</li>
            <li> Amazing set of makeup brushes.. they are very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, it&#x27;s very soft and gentle when you apply it on your face.  </li>
            <li> It is not extremely high quality, but it is good quality.</li>
            <li> Maybe not professional quality but great for a mom like me who doesn&#x27;t want to spent too much but still get good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no makeup artist, I use youtube to come up with most of my makeup tips, but I love that this kit comes with every single type of brush I&#x27;ve seen artists use.  </li>
            <li> it has pretty much every brush you could need from Eyeliner brushes to different eye shadow brushes I love them!!</li>
            <li> then those little bugs, the brushes work great.</li>
            <li> The carrying pouch has frayed a little but the brushes are in great shape.</li>
            <li> besides these two little cons, the set is great.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes are just fine, but I must say that the larger brushes shed on my face when using them for blush or bronzer.</li>
            <li> This set comes with a large set of soft brushes and a nice carrying case.</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes but for the price I paid I was hoping for little better quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful, but at times a little soft in the bristles for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting too much given how cheap these brushes are, but I fear they&#x27;d go bald within a couple applications.</li>
            <li> It would be great to have for traveling with these brushes, I&#x27;m not a fan of using the roll-up ones as a everyday item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> although the pouch is cheap quality it is very functional.  </li>
            <li> These are amazing, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> While relatively cheap, the pouch does the trick of organizing the brushes and storing them so they don&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for the brushes, and for your fantastic service.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and accurate and one time.</li>
            <li> They are real Badger and Goat hair brushes, which was important to me as I don&#x27;t care for synthetic bristles.</li>
            <li> The red color of the brush handles and case is much more bright of a red than in the picture.</li>
            <li> You can actually change what kind of brushes they are by using them a different way, and they still work amazingly.</li>
            <li> I dont like these brushs because they are cheap and they shed too much.</li>
            <li> They are the best I had in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes, they are incredibly soft and work so well with all eyeshadows&lt;</li>
            <li> I go to, they love how it gives that soft touch.</li>
            <li> Worth your money.</li>
            <li> In this case I guess you get what you pay for, but I have to say I feel that these brushes weren&#x27;t even worth what I paid for them.</li>
            <li> it just seems more professional.</li>
            <li> The case was a nice shade of red, along with the brush handles.</li>
            <li> You get a nice red bag that carries all of the brushes, I have already put mine to use.</li>
            <li> worth the price..</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are, and the fact that they&#x27;re natural bristles makes them easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These are definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> wish I would have just spent more money on a better set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Such good quality and very well</li>
            <li> These brushes are all nice, but overall quite an over-kill for me.</li>
            <li> They got the job done, I personally feel like elf brushes are better considering how cheap they are.</li>
            <li> So soft and so cheap!</li>
            <li> The brush handles are in a nice ruby red color</li>
            <li> Nice starter set and enough variety for any need you might have.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes they are soft and catch on to product well.</li>
            <li> Love the color and that they are soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves come in a nice variety and some of the fluffier, larger ones have a vinyl brush cover to help keep their shape when being stored.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I expected but good price for the set.</li>
            <li> I love how incredibly soft the brushes are.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice red pouch and it has all the brushes she would probably need.</li>
            <li> I guess if you want to rate the brush set based on value, then yes, 4 stars for a 13 pc brush set that cost $13 is worth it.</li>
            <li> These have a distinct made-in-China look (and smell--</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also true that one of the foundation brushes lost a hair on its first use.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup anymore, but when I do, I like to do it well and</li>
            <li> The faces brushes are ok but tend to leave bristles on your face and are not as soft as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft and</li>
            <li> For this price even if you were to get one or two brushes you would use often it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Love all the brushes each one has a purpose and they are all extremely soft and work well on the face.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good in the sense that they don&#x27;t shed,  however they are extremely rough.</li>
            <li> Extra carrying pouch was a nice added touch.  </li>
            <li> The pouch they come in is really handy in storing the brushes and you can even carry it your purse if necessary for touch ups.</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li> These brushes seem pretty cool.</li>
            <li> but it offers such a great variety for beginners.</li>
            <li> I love how well organized it is, and the covers that come with the fluffy brushes to keep the bristles nice</li>
            <li> I took the advice from one of the comments I read and washed the brushes with baby shampoo in warm water (I recommend the same)  </li>
            <li> I Love how soft the hair bristles are.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, they work, they aren&#x27;t rough, but you can tell when you use it that the quality (of the hairs) isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> but so far, but they seem alright. :)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are soft  </li>
            <li> Also comes in a nice red faux leather pouch.</li>
            <li> but overall they are nice brushes</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Coastal scents also have a natural and synthetic 22 piece brush mix that is much better than these.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old brushes, firm edges are great for applying makeup with definition.</li>
            <li> Come in nice red pouch.</li>
            <li> It is ok for beginners, but if you are a professional I would not</li>
            <li> This was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> probably worth</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and there&#x27;s not too many of them</li>
            <li> I do wish I got to choose the color of the set, mine is red but would have liked a choice.</li>
            <li> it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> these brushes are so soft and easy to clean i love they color and the pink on the brushes don&#x27;t chip :)</li>
            <li> love how soft and they blend well.</li>
            <li> So soft and silky I love how these brushes feel on my face.</li>
            <li> nice for makeup.everything for the basic and median makeup can be found.</li>
            <li> The set looks nice and is portable with the pouch, but those are the only positives.  </li>
            <li> inferior bristles hardly worth salvaging two of them.</li>
            <li> I do not need the big blush brushes but still nice to have.  </li>
            <li> you can never have to many makeup brushes and they&#x27;re so soft</li>
            <li> The brushes come in a nice pouch with individual slots for each brush that folds up.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a nice red leather case.</li>
            <li> I have waited several months to post this review, hoping that my first impressions of the set being nice would eventually come true, but the set just keeps degrading, and I have to advise against getting this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I wash them every couple of weeks and the brushes have rarely lost any hair.</li>
            <li> The pouch is red, and professional looking, and the brushes are great for $12.</li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it is everything it was advertised it as being, and it really is worth buying...</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes heads came off, which can be fixed with glue after about a month.</li>
            <li> worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The colors are fun and when you lie them out, it brightens up your room.</li>
            <li> My 17 yr old daughter has been after me to buy more brushes, but when I looked at the price per brush</li>
            <li> These are incredibly nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and i also love how soft it feels on my face and&lt;br /&gt;how</li>
            <li> They are nicely made and come in a nice tie-up bag and appear more expensive than the asking price.</li>
            <li> will deff recommend this product its worth the price</li>
            <li> As a beginner I think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Also - there are a couple of brushes which look almost the same, so it would have been nice to see a list of each brush and what they are used for.</li>
            <li> But overall, they a nice brushes.</li>
            <li> So they are worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but the larger face brushes leave bristles after use.</li>
            <li> I only use them to apply my own makeup</li>
            <li> Def worth the money</li>
            <li> They come in so handy for multiple things.</li>
            <li> they are easy to clean and are stredy so far</li>
            <li> Will buy more once I need to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li> she was thrilled to get them as they were on her wish list and didn&#x27;t realize that there was anything personal in the sack of gifts.</li>
            <li> for i still think they are OK just not as soft as i would like.</li>
            <li> look professional- love the colors.</li>
            <li> It comes in a really nice red, pleather case that rolls and ties.</li>
            <li> It is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a Christmas to my teen daughter, who loved it and wants to give as gifts to her friends...</li>
            <li> ...not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes with nice diversity in soft to firm.</li>
            <li> Comes in nice red bag.</li>
            <li> I love my Shany Professional 13 piece cosmetic brush set.</li>
            <li> I have waited several months to post this review, hoping that my first impressions of the set being nice would eventually come true, but the set just keeps degrading, and I have to advise against getting this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> She was surprised when she received them, but love them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and have all sizes you might need for different makeup applications.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the red color, make them look cheap, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> A couple of them are a little too stiff for my taste (kind of scratchy on the skin) but the majority of them are perfect.</li>
            <li> They barely smelled (not sure why so many people had SUPER smelly brushes), and the pouch was beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is bulky enough (even without the brushes in it) that I can&#x27;t imagine ever using it to travel with because I have no need to carry that many brushes with me, but some may find it very useful for travel/</li>
            <li> they work amazingly with the loose pigments i bought and to keep the brushes clean</li>
            <li> and they are super soft and pretty i am in love</li>
            <li> At first, they were soft and smooth, but the plastic case smells strongly of plastic.</li>
            <li> These are a nice set of brushes if you are first starting out on your make-up journey, but they wear quickly.</li>
            <li> I have a very positive experience with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> For right now, I&#x27;d say the packaging was great but the leather case that it came in had a patch missing from the front.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are perfect, they are not fluffy but not too stiff-</li>
            <li> so when applying makeup it is applied appropriately with no mess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend a little more money on something I know for a fact that is a good, high quality product.</li>
            <li> I was glad I bought a set for myself as I was originally looking to buy a set for a gift only.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is the perfect makeup brush set, at an outrageously low price.</li>
            <li> but many other manufacturers and vendors are charging much much more.</li>
            <li> pouch wore out quickly and fell apart after a month of (gentle!)</li>
            <li> Came quickly and exactly like it stated it would come.</li>
            <li> The Brushes got here within two days which was super fast!</li>
            <li> Also recieved them pretty quick &amp;</li>
            <li> I was suprised by how soft and comfortable the bristles are, the case they come in is not of extreme high quality but still very good, and extremly useful for storage with how it rolls</li>
            <li> so i suggested you keep them clean as much as possible! :)</li>
            <li> super soft, easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are decent and a good option for back up brushes</li>
            <li> Anyways I really advise you guys to invest in a brand that your familiar with and can go to a store and see, touch, and test BEFORE you buy.</li>
            <li> Other than that good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to anyone who wants quality makeup brushes for cheap!</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> Just the right stiffness and softness.  </li>
            <li> it is right at your fingertips.</li>
            <li> The case has embossing on the lower right corner of the opening flap.</li>
            <li> just right as Goldie Locks would say</li>
            <li> and I got it right on time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushes look just right, though.  </li>
            <li> I swear my throat is irritated right now.  </li>
            <li> and I always have the right brushes when I travel.</li>
            <li> you are looking for eye brushes than this may be the right set for you.</li>
            <li> I got these about a month ago, and started using the brushes right</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m about to purchase another set right now...</li>
            <li> Another thing, is right when I received them I immediately felt the powder and blush brush and some bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li> makeup falls right off.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t labeled right and some of the brushes weren&#x27;t there like they are on the pictures that were shown.</li>
            <li> the price it right.</li>
            <li> Also they pick up just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> it slid right off the wand part [which i doubt it should do].</li>
            <li> This kit had all the right stuff.</li>
            <li> all right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Aruba right now</li>
            <li> This is the right price for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> You would want to wash them right?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right number of brushes for my purposes.</li>
            <li> The blush brush is very easy to use when applying light blush on and the tiny brush 2nd to last on the right in the given picture is just so handy!</li>
            <li> great set and value, I recently bought urban decays naked contouring palette and this set help me make magic!</li>
            <li> First off, the photo makes the brushes look large and very useful.</li>
            <li> I use the brushes on my new Urban Decay Naked pallets and they are great!</li>
            <li> These were great the first few months, but after a while the brushes separated from the handles.</li>
            <li> I was really unsure about these brushes at first because they were really cheap</li>
            <li> They will be a dream for those of us who travel for work since you can fold them up into such a compact package while still being able to carry a full set of 13 brushes.  </li>
            <li> the red case is so cute and the brushes are full and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I think they are perfectly suited for your average makeup wearing individual...</li>
            <li> Since i only use make up for cosplay it ok for me but it not that great like I don&#x27;t even know what half of the brush is used for</li>
            <li> They have not shed much, was and dry really well and are all around great brushes.</li>
            <li> The pouch came in a beautiful red color and the brushes were individually wraped.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see the ferrule of one of these brushes come apart from the handle, which is something I saw happen with my older cheap brush set.</li>
            <li> , they clean well and are a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad set, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it, but it just would be a lot easier if the brushes were number correctly.</li>
            <li> I use the large full circular brushes for lightweight application and blending of face powder...</li>
            <li> The hair is very coarse and breaks off very easily.</li>
            <li> The brush heads (metal from red part) come off very easily.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I like about this brush set is the handles, they&#x27;re very easy to hold and move around.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get new brushes</li>
            <li> nothing major, ok for the price.</li>
            <li> and when I found this set at a very reasonable price, I decided it was worth trying out.  </li>
            <li> high light foundation, shadows etc.</li>
            <li> My hopes were high, since the makeup collection I have from Shany is so fantastic, I hoped the brushes would be as well.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I was expecting them to be either really bad, or totally awesome, but I find them to be pretty average and for the price I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes daily and they still look as good as new.</li>
            <li> Brush\\&quot; isn&#x27;t plush or very large in diameter at all.</li>
            <li> work great and shed very little</li>
            <li> i guess its Ok, i was expecting better quality based on previous reviews but</li>
            <li> I primarily use the brushes for applying eye shadows and I am please because the various brushes make it easy to apply the eye shadows and blend colors.</li>
            <li> I believe there are too many sticks, but you should focus more on quality instead of providing more item, for daily use we usually use around 5 brushes will be fine</li>
            <li> The handles are wooden, covered in a cheap paint that chips easily.</li>
            <li> Love them and would definitely recommend them to anyone considering purchasing a new set of brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> thanks i received my cosmetic brush set and was satisfied i like the way the brushes feel very soft and haven&#x27;t tried them yet</li>
            <li> Good quality, very professional packaging and will definitely order their products again.</li>
            <li> They come in a pretty elegant pouch that matches the brushes and trhe brushes are really pretty and soft</li>
            <li> I bought this small set as a gift for a teenager, I thought it would make a great starter set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it comes like this because you can easily take it with you in your purse if you need to, or if you dont have a big bathroom (like myself) its hard to find a spot for everything and the roll up bag makes it easy.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the brushes shed all over my face, even though I have barely cleaned them.</li>
            <li> These brushes were nice initially, however I bought them earlier this year, more than six months ago but not up to a year.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the brushes shed all over my face, even though I have barely cleaned them.</li>
            <li> Long handles are nice.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these, but after the first use the bristles on the brush were all ready falling out.</li>
            <li> If you are a person who is very experienced with putting make-up on and you have experimented with different types of brushes, you&#x27;ll be able to discern which brushes are great and worth the money and which ones are not only a waste of money but a waste of make-up.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very useful, and it is easy to use by following the guide.</li>
            <li> If u are looking to build up your make-up brush set quickly, this is a smart way to do it.</li>
            <li> The larger prowder brushes are soft and feel very good on your skin, and the smaller brushes are just dense enough to be more precise.</li>
            <li> And more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft and really hold shadow well, picking it right up and not dropping a bit as I move it to my eye.</li>
            <li> When you first open it there will be a very strong scent, please wash before use.</li>
            <li> these brushes are ok, i was expecting something a little bit more but for 26 bucks thats what you get</li>
            <li> In a sexy red hot color!</li>
            <li> Spend a little more money and get a better set.</li>
            <li> I would say pay a little more $ and buy something better</li>
            <li> I want to return this item and pay a little more for a better quality.</li>
            <li> ; brush set for a little bit more, but still had &amp;#34;PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34; brushes with more brushes in the set.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t dense enough to give you a flawless full coverage and you waste too much product by just trying to apply an even amount on your face.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the color red, the brushes are natural and there are so many.</li>
            <li> Very long handles, would be best to apply to other people.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are great, very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sigma brushes if you want amazing high quality brushes and have a little more money to spend....</li>
            <li> THese brushes came super fast and they really are Mac quality brushes, I have actually repurchased as gifts bcuz they are so amazing.</li>
            <li> Case is soft and flexible, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> I just want to wash them off in warm water and pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> It is a fun set of many different kinds of brushes.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I only use the smaller eye ones but they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li> They are soft, well shaped, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the brushes were in no way soft, and they feel apart really easily.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of professional brushes myself, but found these brushes well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and the red case is a bonus</li>
            <li> Got to my house super fast.</li>
            <li> I already had great brushes, but these are RED, and the bristles are all well made and haven&#x27;t fallen apart yet - a year later.  </li>
            <li> I do independent films and these brushes come in handy so much with make-up.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for such a low price!</li>
            <li> they ship super fast and for they&#x27;re price</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> She is very happy with this brush set, and only costs a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Good buy for a young girl just starting out with makeup.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was pleased to see how professional the brushes looked, though when i can closer to the brushes i began to notice it had an absolutely repulsive smell to it.</li>
            <li> The product did arrive FAST in 3 days in a nice red bagget</li>
            <li> the brushes are so soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are cheaply made and the bristles do not feel good on the delicate skin on your eye.</li>
            <li> But the brushes are good quality (so far) and I would purchase this set again overall.</li>
            <li> The ordered came very quickly and the brush bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> Great brushed especially for the price</li>
            <li> think this would be a fine starter kit (and a nice present) for a young lady just starting out wearing makeup or newly out on her own.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice about this is the price, all these tools that make any amateur seem like their own makeup professional.</li>
            <li> The brush case is so nice, to keep the brushes from floating loosely in the makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> While the variety of brushes and value was pretty good the brush quality is less than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Today I used them for the first time after I bought them, they are really soft, each brush is easy to access.</li>
            <li> I have good things, as well as bad things to say about this purchase, but overall, I am pleased and happy with what I purchased at the price of which I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box though, there was the gross smell of cheap cheap pleather thats been sitting in a closed warm container.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try out this very reasonably priced set.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like em very much.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This product had very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It was shipped out very fast</li>
            <li> i recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable priced at $12.99 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i ordered them and not only did they take forever to get to my house, but they were very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> pouch these brushes come in is red and the material used (some sort of plastic) feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the lip gloss brush and the eyeliner brush was pretty much a fail because it didn&#x27;t put eyeliner on my eyelid at all, it just seemed to smear right off.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look cheap and flimsy like many other brushes at this price range.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and easy to use, I absolutely love the color and overall they just rule!</li>
            <li> I used the sponge-tip applicators that came with eye shadow to apply it and owned a VERY cheap, small set of blush/eye/lip brushes that I used for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer a brush that is a little firmer and these also seem to shed a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular kit has 13 brushes in total, and gives a nice variety-</li>
            <li> They are super super soft brushes.</li>
            <li> Super soft and super durable.</li>
            <li> All in all, I definitely recommend spending a little more money for a set that will have good quality.</li>
            <li> It did have a very strong leathery smell which it takes a few washes to get rid off, but for the price and considering for who and what I bought them for very worth it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what it said and advertised.</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived on the exact date I was told it would come.  </li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> Items are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and use them daily!</li>
            <li> It has all the basic brushes, plus a couple of more &amp;#34;sophisticated&amp;#34; ones.</li>
            <li> They only shed a tiny bit the first time I washed them, but have help up remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> this is my first ever brush set</li>
            <li> so I had someone buy it for me and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> one can get better quality at lesser price.</li>
            <li> There are still many brushes I have never used, and they tend to get warped in the red sleeve they come wrapped up in.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be using these brushes till they ruin. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many left of those.</li>
            <li> Comes in plastic protectors and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> This was my first brush set</li>
            <li> First of all, shipping was a joke.  </li>
            <li> Love these brushes, especially if you are a beginner with makeup.</li>
            <li> Especially they are in her favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Very soft; which is very important to me as i have pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> I most likely will buy another set for my sister.</li>
            <li> and they most definitely are.</li>
            <li> Very Feminine!</li>
            <li> I love the red pouch they come in too</li>
            <li> love the red leather wrap case they come in too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they were shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li> but of course with a higher price tag.</li>
            <li> It came in a very cute red case and the brushes are as soft as I was hoping they would be.</li>
            <li> The brushes had a funny smell when I first opened the box not to mention the brushes were already losing hair.</li>
            <li> The brushes that are sown in the first picture are not ALL the ones you will receive.     </li>
            <li> I needed another eyebrow/eyelash brush and wanted a fan-type brush, and realized for the price, I was getting a better deal buying this entire set- especially with the $5 coupon (making the set about $8).</li>
            <li> I also got the red case! :)</li>
            <li> First off, please wash the brushes immediately.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you love to play with different eye shadows</li>
            <li> When I first saw the price I thought there was a catch</li>
            <li> The brushes are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> th biggesst brush , powder brush, a bunch of th bristles just came off when i washed it for the first time.</li>
            <li> the product came exactly as described and came to my home promptly.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> (they aren&#x27;t going to be the softest you&#x27;ve ever bought, you need to be logical when its $15 )</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> you so much!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been able to bend it back</li>
            <li> bristles were pretty sparse</li>
            <li> but if you read they say you need to wash them BEFORE you use them for the first time.</li>
            <li> first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I worked as a make up artist for Estee Lauder for several years &amp; love their brushes, however, they can be pricey to replace.  </li>
            <li> They work very well!</li>
            <li> But really, for that price?!</li>
            <li> Have I ever been so embarrassed as when she opened the set (for the first time, I hadn&#x27;t opened it yet) and bristles were sitting on the brushes.  </li>
            <li> the case kinda smelled funny when i received it in the mail</li>
            <li> The color is pretty.</li>
            <li> The case does smell at first butonce out of the box it starts to not smell.</li>
            <li> There is an insert included that lets you know what each brush is for, which I found to be helpful not knowing the first thing about makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This product is both pretty and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My pouch came in a pretty red color and I love that it has a flap that covers up all of your brush heads before you roll it up.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed playing with all the different brushes and finding out which ones do this or that.</li>
            <li> I love using all the brushes especially the face/powder and blush brush!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used them a couple of stay hairs fell out</li>
            <li> I love that I got a red Pouch to match the brushes.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using more of there products in the future.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed with these brushes, firstly the \\&quot;big\\&quot; ones are small and really only work for blush or highlighting/shading.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it can be healthy inhaling the fumes.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed is the bag or carrier (however you want to name)</li>
            <li> , it looks exactly like the online picture</li>
            <li> the first time I try all the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> will definitely order more makeup brushes again via amazon.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use them to get ready for the graduation!</li>
            <li> Recieved this product fast and intact!</li>
            <li> I was able to hot glue it back</li>
            <li> they shed a lot after the first wash.</li>
            <li> but overall they are okay.</li>
            <li> I just love eye shadows and different looks with the eye.</li>
            <li> overall, i&#x27;m satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> but they do what it says on the tin ;-)</li>
            <li> I love the ability to choose different colors</li>
            <li> This brush set is my first brush set all the brushes</li>
            <li> I would definitely look at better brushes.</li>
            <li> and I love all the individual pockets to keep the brushes organized.</li>
            <li> No weird powder either.</li>
            <li> Quality of brushes was exactly as described .  </li>
            <li> Overall no chemical smell when my friend and I opened and we are pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted in a starter kit</li>
            <li> After looking at tons of different brush sets and reading so many reviews, I decided to go with this one.  </li>
            <li> After that, I had no issues and they have been working very well for about 3 months!</li>
            <li> and I would definitely give them another try (on a better quality brush set of course)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> You really get your moneys worth with this brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it comes with so many brushes all for different purposes</li>
            <li> the hairs don&#x27;t shed and they seem to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing a cosmetic brush set.</li>
            <li> I have been using them from the first day I got them.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying them.</li>
            <li> Just remember when buying this item that the total number of brushes in the picture featured, is more than what you get.</li>
            <li> Overall I still love the Shany brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy better quality brushes next time.</li>
            <li> Love the red color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll love that there is such a variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, because I don&#x27;t use make up on a daily basics, but I figure to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I love that there are two different face brushes, I use one for bronzer and one for powder.</li>
            <li> I think for the most part they will last.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The case itself smells a bit when you first get it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It also comes in a lovely red case so the brushes are neatly organized.</li>
            <li> and they seem to be holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Other than that i am really enjoying the product!</li>
            <li> On the up side, I still love the red pouch!</li>
            <li> Came in the mail pretty fast and came with a case to take on the go!</li>
            <li> And you obviously can&#x27;t get much better on the price.</li>
            <li> pretty color and pretty case!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Just want I was expecting, arrived in expected time, nicely packaged and</li>
            <li> These brushes smell funny.</li>
            <li> There was an odor when I first opened the box</li>
            <li> The eyehadow brushes blend and pack on very well!</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> They all have a specific purpose, and thats what I love.</li>
            <li> Theyre exactly what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> this are my first brushes ever</li>
            <li> but I will definitely be buying more products by Shany.</li>
            <li> pleased with this purchase overall, would buy again!</li>
            <li> She is gonna get her Naked Platte 2 on top of this also.</li>
            <li> The red is so cute</li>
            <li> I thought it was value for money at first but upon receiving the brushes</li>
            <li> my make up has never looked better, I&#x27;ll not use the traditional make up applicators ever again it&#x27;s brushes from here on..</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these brushes and the eyeshadows. :)</li>
            <li> I use the powder brush regularly and it works so much better than the Sephora one I had before.</li>
            <li> I love these, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as needed and wanted.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived on-time and packaged in a pretty pouch.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of your products in the future.</li>
            <li> so I guess you could say these are my first &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I have found better at the same time.</li>
            <li> and you get so many different brushes.</li>
            <li> if its the same with others but the color on my eyes would spread better i believe with a softer brush.</li>
            <li> Only wish they told you what each brush was for!! :)</li>
            <li> You get so much bang for your buck here!</li>
            <li> partially why im thrilled to have these brushes.</li>
            <li> First of all they smelled funky.</li>
            <li> I love the red case the brushes are in.</li>
            <li> I received them fast and on time!</li>
            <li> but I really like the quality of these brushes, will order from Shany again!</li>
            <li> the smaller brushes work better.</li>
            <li> but i dont really have anything to complain about!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> I am confident that they will last me a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got some more solid makeups that these brushes have issues with.</li>
            <li> is pretty as well.</li>
            <li> There are the basic variety, which will work for a beginner and a more seasoned makeup artist.</li>
            <li> but I did wash them before I used them first.</li>
            <li> 2 smaller more detailing eyeshadow brushes, an eyebrow comb, lip color brush, and a smudger type brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as my first set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I became interested in buying this package of cosmetic brushes after my sister showed me the set she bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> All these brushes work very well for me!</li>
            <li> on the medium sized blush brush, the top disconnected from the red part of the brush.</li>
            <li> They are durable and pretty.  </li>
            <li> The first time for myself and then again for a friend for christmas.</li>
            <li> The ones pictured look higher quality and fuller.</li>
            <li> It is my first brush set</li>
            <li> My first ever brush set.</li>
            <li> i like my brushes they dont smell like others do at first</li>
            <li> I love the color red</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to use them first before I&#x27;ll know the quality of the brush.  </li>
            <li> I love the red pouch it comes with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for red lipstick, it was OK, but it sheds like CRAZY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, but definitely not \\&quot;fluffy,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Again, only OK.</li>
            <li> you so much!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and haven&#x27;t fallen apart, but they do seem a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty, but not functional.</li>
            <li> Brushes are exactly what advertise.</li>
            <li> The brushes look nice, but when you first use them they are rough and prick at your face.</li>
            <li> love the color i got mine in color RED .</li>
            <li> For the price they do their job, however a couple of them started to shed after first time use.</li>
            <li> I definitely will be ordering from here soon. :)</li>
            <li> Everything was there, it even came with a cute red case to store my brushes away in when I&#x27;m not using them</li>
            <li> I wanted to give them a try for that same reason, ur better off saving money to buy quality brushes</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> , I was exactly the one I was hoping to get.</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash them with some baby shampoo to get the extra dye out before the first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pro is absolutely the price!</li>
            <li> OK I HAVE ONLY USED ONE BRUSH</li>
            <li> SO FAR IT REMINDED OF A CHEAP PAINT BRUSH BUT HVNT USED THE OTHERS</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been really using because I barely wear makeup any more..</li>
            <li> So I recently started doing make up, and needed a lot more brushes than I thought.</li>
            <li> It came so fast!</li>
            <li> The packaging is so pretty as well.</li>
            <li> Love the red!</li>
            <li> First off, it was neatly and well-packaged.</li>
            <li> But the brushes were exactly the ones from the picture.</li>
            <li> They seem pretty durable and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying more of their products.</li>
            <li> I paid more but they last.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters love all the brushes and use them daily.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL THE BRUSHES SMELL.</li>
            <li> Application of products goes on smoothly and professionally.  </li>
            <li> Well, you get exactly what you paid for.</li>
            <li> i more that likely won&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> and it did smell like glue when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future for gifts.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !&lt;</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more from this company.</li>
            <li> Brushes came exactly as described here.</li>
            <li> I saw the same items in the store which was 10x more</li>
            <li> Actually they all are I&#x27;ve seen $1 brushes that are better than them.  </li>
            <li> At first look though, it looks like it will serve it&#x27;s purpose we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Overall they are not bad, I really enjoy having access to brushes while doing my make-up and others&#x27; make-up as well.</li>
            <li> they were exactly what i thought they were gonna be but softer</li>
            <li> This is my first cosmetic brush set</li>
            <li> Definitely purchasing another set with more brushes.</li>
            <li> I use the big brush mostly, maybe it can be repackaged with 6-Pieces.</li>
            <li> Also the bristles have stayed pretty well intact after being used.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I actually returned this Shany set because there are so many brushes</li>
            <li> They do have a funny smell when first opened, but I always wash my brushes before I use them anyway.</li>
            <li> so I still don&#x27;t exactly know which brush is used for what</li>
            <li> The first thing I would like to say is that it came in the time it said it would with no damage at all.</li>
            <li> They quality is stunning and it came very quickly in a red leather case!</li>
            <li> And i love the red color of the handels and the case.</li>
            <li> I will leave off a star because some bristles have come out after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I love the red pouch it comes in.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described and affordable.</li>
            <li> I chose this set of brushes because it has a lot of sizes and love the red color.</li>
            <li> i loved them i just got them used a few already.</li>
            <li> Good, firm concealer brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And even after me having these for a few months they still work just as good as when i got them.</li>
            <li> If you want good, everyday make-up brushes that won&#x27;t break the bank, then I recommend this set.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and the application is very smooth and well-covered compared to many other brushes.</li>
            <li> looks super high quality.</li>
            <li> Great at first but didn&#x27;t last very long for me.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up much eye shadow,but they are very soft and for a cheap order, I am overall pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I mean, if the price looks too good to be true, then it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are so soft and pretty!!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery time, cute pink carrying case.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging and it comes with a little apron I love the way the brushes feel I will definently order again thanks so much</li>
            <li> Overall they are good quality for a beginner make-up guru or someone that wants a little more variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> complaints are the strong plastic smell from the case and since I am new to this it would be nice if the brushes had names on them as there are a few that I am unsure of their purpose..</li>
            <li> I recieved these yesterday, although beautiful the scent is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving these brushes, I did not notice a harsh chemical smell, and thought that they would be fine; however, there are many things I dislike about these brushes.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is adorable as well and has held up to a few months of use fine.</li>
            <li> I only use it for traveling because I also own the 32 Super Professional Set from Shany (which I also highly recommend).</li>
            <li> The brushes do shed a bit, especially the fan brush, but overall they&#x27;re a pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> But other than that, they are really nice.</li>
            <li> These brushes would be better of for painting on flat paper.     </li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about the smell of the brushes but honestly my brushes didn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more flat, and does shed a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good set for a young teen new to make up.</li>
            <li> I got the Red one which is the color i wanted it is a bright Cherry Red</li>
            <li> I think the price and the way the brush has such soft bristles  feels on my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not well constructed and it doesn&#x27;t look nearly as neat or clean as the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li> I love the way the brushed are tapered and they&#x27;re super soft as well.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a good value price-wise, but several of the brushes are too similar &amp; I had hoped for a contouring eye-shadow brush which was not included.</li>
            <li> they are no where near my professional mac brushes but they are better than the ones ive bought at target.</li>
            <li> Many different ones to use and works very well..</li>
            <li> But when I opened it, I was absolutely ecstatic that mine was red :]</li>
            <li> I may just switch these for my personal brushes I like them so much. :)</li>
            <li> They are good if you&#x27;re not a huge makeup fan, it holds the make up very well.</li>
            <li> They were packaged very well and came with a cute red pouch and each brush was wrapped in a plastic protector.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed at all and are very soft to the touch..and the tiny detailer brushes are useful when doing eyeliner on top or bottom using eyeshadow and also to blend it out.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re super soft, and very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Also I was using baby shampoo which I use on all my brushes as it is very gentle and nurturing to the hair, especially natural.</li>
            <li> Ok, first off I was very hesitant to purchase these brushes simply because I don&#x27;t know that much about types of brushes and how to use them.</li>
            <li> For one, they are super soft!</li>
            <li> I can say that these are wonderful and the little hairs don&#x27;t end up all over your face like with other brands.</li>
            <li> All in all, these are a pretty decent set of brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft, and I cant wait to start experimenting with makeup with these!</li>
            <li> I mean, I only have 2 eyes, lol~!</li>
            <li> Buy one brush at a store for the same cost of these 12, you can really do anything with these and make sure to have a large variety of colors too.</li>
            <li> but I think I should have rinsed them off and let them dry first to get out most of the loose/unglued hairs.</li>
            <li> Because of previous reviews saying there was some kind of powder or dust already on them from shipping or something I did go ahead and wash them and the case when I first got them,</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re super soft and apply my eyeshadow really well!</li>
            <li> That is about all that is positive that can be said about them.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and have nice long handles.</li>
            <li> The full brush deposits the product on top of my pores and distributes it evenly for a natural finish  Also flexible flat brushes with slight pointed tip for precision application and blending are amazing to work with.   </li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are very nice, but the bigger brushes.... not as soft!</li>
            <li> And I must have ordered them right at the right time because I only paid $12.00 for the set and now they are up to $27.00, so I feel quite lucky.</li>
            <li> i loved the funky light green case it came in , I open it</li>
            <li> Her dog chewed them up pretty soon after getting them though, so she doesn&#x27;t have much idea about longevity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much smells like plastic</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve been eyeing this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> The other reason is they are so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty much get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and it really makes her look hot.</li>
            <li> and delivery was fast and came exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its not a horrible set if you are looking for a cheap set to give someone who is younger and just starting out with make up.</li>
            <li> Another minor complain is the red color of the pouch is hideous, but that&#x27;s just a minor detail, otherwise everything has been perfect.</li>
            <li> Clearly it is not MAC or Sigma, but it is OK;  Try it</li>
            <li> These are my first real brushes and I have had them for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li> the flat top really makes a difference in the appearance of your makeup</li>
            <li> Real Techniques is affordable and much much much higher quality than these brushes.</li>
            <li> This product was ok though the bristles where too long for some of the designs.</li>
            <li> I find the RealTechniques brushes to be of higher quality (but still reasonably priced) and, unlike these SHANY brushes which are made of animal hair, RT brushes are cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the RealTechniques brushes to be of higher quality (but still reasonably priced) and, unlike these SHANY brushes which are made of animal hair, RT brushes are cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the long handles.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not soo good, one of them is ridiculously small, that it doesn&#x27;t even look like a brush.</li>
            <li> THe brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li> Above all there are much much better brushes in this price range, real techniques makes an eye and face kit each about the price of these that absolutely tower over the quality of these.</li>
            <li> yes, the odor is there, but its not unpleasant or strong, it is like a new leather/chemical smell and it is only on the case not the brushes.</li>
            <li> Not exactly as seen in the photos, are more simple and the quality is not as high, but for the price are great, no brushes to blend and you have are simple</li>
            <li> like said in the other reviews and did not have a foul smell, just a kind of new scent (only a tad bit overwhelming)</li>
            <li> The brushes came quickly, they work more or less, and everything was as it said.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first makeup brush set in an attempt to use makeup more regularly and acquire some new skills.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these, but suggest you get something to help preserve and clean the brushes to help them to stay looking and feeling like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few brushes daily for over a year and a half and they are still holding up as great as the day I bought them and are super easy to put away!</li>
            <li> the smaller ones fell apart easily.</li>
            <li> brushes are cheap, smell funny and overall</li>
            <li> And the red is easy to see in your makeup case.</li>
            <li> First of let me just say, I am not a make up snob, however, after ordering this cheap brush set, I can definitely ask myself, \\&quot;what was I thinking?\\</li>
            <li> They are super soft and have a ton of variety.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you re-shape your brushes once you have them washed and that you let them COMPLETELY dry before you try and use them.</li>
            <li> They are super soft.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re still working/looking/feeling brand new.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re super soft and the makeup goes on evenly with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one issue I have with the bigger brushes is that the bristles fall off easily.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and my mom says they do not shed.</li>
            <li> Super soft and works efficiently.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not labelled with their name (i.e., \\&quot;Blush brush\\&quot;) but are labelled with a number, so as long as you keep the enclosed pamphlet, you&#x27;ll be able to keep straight which brush is for what use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved doing my makeup but never took a real interest in using eye shadow until this past year.</li>
            <li> My Shany brushes came in a red pouch, it did smelled like plastic, but not as strong as some are saying.</li>
            <li> but it does have a strong smell when you open it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional make up artist, but I do know a good beauty product when I see one, and I definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is way to bushy and large to be used as a fondation brush</li>
            <li> Opening the case you will notice it is held shut by two large silver magnetic snaps.</li>
            <li> Two blush brushes, One large, one medium.</li>
            <li> ; however I certainly would never buy them again or recommend them.</li>
            <li> and I certainly won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Large powder/blush brush-</li>
            <li> come in a large pouch that rolls up and ties around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells of pure chemicals and falls apart immediately.</li>
            <li> Large variety.  </li>
            <li> I use the large all-over shadow brush to blend powder shadow onto the rest of my eye after applying a cream shadow to just the lids, below the crease.</li>
            <li> Large shadow brush</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and dry and the pouch is easy to clean as well (I usually just take an antibacterial wipe for that).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty gross, and they aren&#x27;t very useful.</li>
            <li> Just add few more buks and buy one MAC brush!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes a few weeks ago and i love them!</li>
            <li> What i don&#x27;t like about them is that there is just many flat brushes as opposed to blending brushes and cute other brushes.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love how they have the pouch with it!  </li>
            <li> Wow so many different brushes they work really well!</li>
            <li> The pouch looks awesome and the color is very stylish - bloody red.</li>
            <li> I am not a make up artist, just a regular person that needed new brushes, and I love them.</li>
            <li> And I discovered so many new uses for some of the different brush styles.  </li>
            <li> so i just got rid of the big ones bought better new ones and kept the eye-shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and I feel like they don&#x27;t pick up the product or apply it very well.</li>
            <li> I thought the price of this collection of SHANY Professional brushes was super reasonable for all you get.</li>
            <li> Actually it is perfect, compared to other much more expensive similar products, a wide range of brushes made good materials.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these brushes - I could have paid a lot more for pretty much the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Hello I very much liked the brushes they were soft and very pretty; I love pink and black.</li>
            <li> With so many shapes and comfortable handles, these brushes will last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using them daily for about 2 months and each brush has held up just fine.</li>
            <li> Other than that small mishap, it&#x27;s a wonderful makeup brush set!</li>
            <li> Like any other Cosmetic brushes BE SURE TO WASH BEFORE YOUR FIRST TIME USE.</li>
            <li> The face brushes were fine for about 6 months, but after that, they started leaving gross hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li> They work fine for the price, but again, I&#x27;d probably buy just one or two brushes and not the set in the future.</li>
            <li> Also, the brushes look pretty decent online but do not be deceived.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are pretty decent, but after having them for one day, one of the brushes fell off of the handle.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t in the market for new brushes but for playing with eyeshadow colors I needed more than what I had and it was just cheaper to get a whole set like this instead of individual brushes.  </li>
            <li> To be quite honest I&#x27;ve always been a bit of a Tomboy in nature, you know, legos, Brio trains, and mud for me as a little girl.</li>
            <li> The little brush carrier is comes with is nice too.</li>
            <li> With that being said they work nice for how little I use them.</li>
            <li> Came in a nice little box, with a guide on how to use each brush.</li>
            <li> These contain natural fibers which make application so much smoother!!</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend you try this one first.</li>
            <li> She appears to be happy with them, and there were enough for her to give some to her little sister.</li>
            <li> This is a great little starter for a person that needs brushes for personal use.  </li>
            <li> Also I love the red, it gives it a little touch of sexy</li>
            <li> Now these are no where near Sigma soft, but fabulous eye brushes.  </li>
            <li> Think about what makeup you wear everyday/are comfortable wearing everyday, and buy brushes that fit your needs.</li>
            <li> cheap cheap not durable at all waste of money</li>
            <li> The brushes are of great quality (not cheap) and there are plenty different types.  </li>
            <li> If you want good brushes for cheap dont even hesitate, like me u wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price you can&#x27;t expect much, however this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> to be honest I thought it was going to be a bad product, but its good, I don&#x27;t give 5 stars because it came with a smell I didn&#x27;t like, maybe chemical, so I had to soak them for a bit in soap, .but</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because their products are inexpensive but the product is great and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It would also be a nice kit for someone of any age who did not have the money (or want to spend the money) on the more expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More than what I expected.</li>
            <li> They are made out of real hair (badger and goat)  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, but for the number of brushes and the price, I figured I would try them.</li>
            <li> They make putting on make up so much easier, and it stays where I put it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the brushes.</li>
            <li> I expected more quality.</li>
            <li> dog very well though.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s probably not something you should be sniffing all that much.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes, but getting them to me was the problem, it took alot longer than i expected</li>
            <li> After having had this for over a year now, I have to say it is a bit too much for my needs.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and my sister really likes it</li>
            <li> are very sturdy</li>
            <li> Given these brushes are not MAC or Sephora quality, they are really a bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Yes, shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li> However....they aren&#x27;t made from real animal hair...</li>
            <li> If you really into make up, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I was nervous as to how the quality of these brushes would be but they are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> This has lasted much longer than some of the MAC brushes I have</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take much time for the package to get to me and nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li> She says they work very well</li>
            <li> The item does cone very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> And the organizer pouch is very durable.</li>
            <li> These brushes don&#x27;t pick up much product making application take much longer than it should.</li>
            <li> I used it this morning while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> yucks, thus threw that away immediately after opening as it is really \\&quot;melted\\&quot; till out of shape.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> But who wants to spend a ton of money on one brush or a set of three?  </li>
            <li> - they work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> But I really like them.</li>
            <li> This product was ok, but not fully what expected.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From all the reviews, I expected to receive top notch brushes.</li>
            <li> really thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner with the whole</li>
            <li> If you wash these brushes before you use them, they won&#x27;t shed as much.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up the product very well either.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made and have covers.</li>
            <li> my whole bathroom stunk.</li>
            <li> the eyeshadow brushes are very thing.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had much chance to use them yet.</li>
            <li> the bristles are soft and totally worth your money I have had them since April 2014</li>
            <li> I really like the varied selection of the brushes.</li>
            <li> bristles themselves are a lot better than i expected.</li>
            <li> so I tend to avoid even purchasing whole sets.</li>
            <li> But I was very dissatisfied...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> very soft&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> The makeup brush kit was much prettier in person.</li>
            <li> All my friends and sisters want one, too, and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this set.</li>
            <li> was very please n satifide with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the set I got was defective, but I absolutely would not buy Shany brushes again because of this experience.  </li>
            <li> FAst</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes aren&#x27;t very versatile either and there isn&#x27;t much of a variety.</li>
            <li> These brushes shed so much.  </li>
            <li> I was worried what color I would get haha.</li>
            <li> I raved about these brushes so much after I got them that one of my sisters bought them.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brushes always fall out and they are very scratchy.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> and fast the package was well put to together</li>
            <li> It is alright for a starter set or a set for someone who doesn&#x27;t care about the quality as much.</li>
            <li> So if you are buying this because you really want a carrying case, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satified with the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people complain so much about the smell</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The reason it is four stars is because I don&#x27;t really like the case.  </li>
            <li> for the price you can&#x27;t ask too much.</li>
            <li> Really like the assortment and quality of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> They shed so much, I couldn&#x27;t even use one of them.  </li>
            <li> but i really like the pouch they came in.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care since the brushes are what I was ordering.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to buy really expensive/pro brushes when these do what you the pro brushes do.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a cheap last minute go to</li>
            <li> The bag however does have a real leather smell.</li>
            <li> and I use them very day</li>
            <li> I did not care much for the travel case it came with.</li>
            <li> They are made of real animal fur</li>
            <li> The product is very sheek in presentation.</li>
            <li> I dont remember how much I purchased them for but</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> love the packaging minus the smell.</li>
            <li> The one thing that you ABSOLUTELY must do is WASH the brushes with hand soap.</li>
            <li> For the money, you really can&#x27;t beat this set.</li>
            <li> Brushes work very well</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to put much product on the brushes to get it to apply.</li>
            <li> but I still use the ones that are together and they still work really well</li>
            <li> I handle it very lighltly</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much softer brush.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I used each of them, they are all very usefull.</li>
            <li> they are the softest brushes i have ever used very afforable</li>
            <li> i recommend this absolutely...</li>
            <li> the pouch is also very convinient ...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to buy this product!</li>
            <li> They are very durable.</li>
            <li> I used to have elf brushes but those brushes got really ruff with my makeup and was always falling apart and they always have an odor to them even after I wash them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The quality is very shabby and the bristles feel like animal hair.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the softest but that docent bother me too much.</li>
            <li> While they aren&#x27;t Mac quality, they are very comparable with Bamboo and Ulta brands..</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that for the price I really like them</li>
            <li> I checked each brush to see if I could gently pull out the hairs, I could not.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very content with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like their product</li>
            <li> REAL SOON ...</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush set.</li>
            <li> powder brush sheds too much though.</li>
            <li> it looks very profesional, and the set of brushes its well</li>
            <li> but I didnt like the bristles of them too much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> They shipped fast and arrived before the date is said to arrive so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but well, can&#x27;t expect that much.</li>
            <li> In addition, it smell as plastic... or as chemical... if you are looking for something to cheap, this could be enough.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect that much for this amount of money</li>
            <li> the only thing i dont like about the brushes is that the fan brush is really cheap.</li>
            <li> and before I really knew anything about makeup/brushes.</li>
            <li> Even then, they were absolute s</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind though</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> If you need a bunch of brushes for a reasonable price, then you should defenitly consider buying these brushes.</li>
            <li> Got it fast</li>
            <li> The price is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast too.</li>
            <li> I got them for Christmas from my husband because he knew I really like my brushes</li>
            <li> but he doesn&#x27;t know much about them</li>
            <li> I prefer Sigma or Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li> This brush is an absolute MUST for liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with this set.</li>
            <li> They are a lot for the money &amp; reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really mind picking them off my face...</li>
            <li> So, for the price I was not expecting much.</li>
            <li> ITS VERY CONVENIENT FOR TRAVEL.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t really shed for me, even after I cleaned them.</li>
            <li> something you really don&#x27;t want on your face, applying makeup.</li>
            <li> The plus is that it doesn&#x27;t really shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These Shany brushes are much nicer.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I gave 2 stars because of fast shipment.</li>
            <li> At the price I was not expecting much</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> I expected better quality.</li>
            <li> but they really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use them because they just aren&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> The bristols aren&#x27;t shedding and it hold makeup really well.</li>
            <li> There is an itemized description for each brush which is really helpful.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s very convenient for keeping the brushes in.</li>
            <li> I got this product soooo fast</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need all of them by any means, and probably wouldn&#x27;t order the whole set again.  </li>
            <li> but most likely will only last a year maybe two at most</li>
            <li> I expected so much more from these brushes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of these because of the price.</li>
            <li> I find myself constantly trying to re-do my makeup, because these brushes just do not have a smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes holding up really well</li>
            <li> , they keep up really neat</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to hold much shadow.</li>
            <li> Great set of different brushed and such.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to keep my $$$ brushes for my HG products, which are all gentle, neutral colors.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> It does not play much role to me, because I do not use these brushes for my makeup a lot anyway.</li>
            <li> so i was very impress by the price.</li>
            <li> these brushes work very well to apply makeup</li>
            <li> i dont wear much makeup.</li>
            <li> But, I really like this set, for the money</li>
            <li> and they really hold the powder eyeshadows and make up</li>
            <li> it is more than I expected</li>
            <li> this product is working very well</li>
            <li> , I know not everyone wants to spend 30$ on a face brush,</li>
            <li> Shipment was lightning fast.</li>
            <li> but it makes it look like just as much coverage to hide all the imperfections.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They do the job very well.</li>
            <li> pouch is sweet, but not professional, so depending on your use for these brushes will determine if it&#x27;s useful or not.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really nice for cleaning them because they are supposed to be dried upside</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since gone back to my old set while I look for a better one.  </li>
            <li> I also liked that the case was big but not too big.</li>
            <li> cannot work with that kind of brush on the contour of a round eyelid or cheek.</li>
            <li> The smell goes away on its own after a few days anyway.</li>
            <li> These are better than the ELF professional brushes (white ones).</li>
            <li> There were quite a few brushes, soft, and good quality.  </li>
            <li> The shedding is getting worse, instead of better, and I have stopped using most.</li>
            <li> I guess I was just expecting too much from low drugstore products and the smaller brushes are amazing for defining and really getting detailed but the bigger brushes arent as well as they are just stuffed with animal fur.</li>
            <li> probably purchase more from this company in the near future.</li>
            <li> Overall - nice product to have on hand and works well with my eye shadow pallete I recently purchased - also from Shany.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d say is to take a look at the different kind of brushes included in the set before you buy.</li>
            <li> I love that it offers 3 different sizes of eye shadow brushes plus a sponge brush, which I use just for blending, but can also be used for applying.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money that I paid for these brushes I was expecting far more quality than what I actually received.</li>
            <li> The shedding is getting worse, instead of better, and I have stopped using most.</li>
            <li> Too frayed and thick for eyeliner, maybe good for brow powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are professional quality and will definetely please any makeup user!!!</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes fell apart right away and many of them have a lot of fall out.  </li>
            <li> It goes great with my black and grey purse.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure I use less foundation too, but don&#x27;t quote me on this.</li>
            <li> You will find far softer brushes in your drugstore.. which because of this experience, I did check out Walgreen&#x27;s selection and was very pleased for less $$.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the Brush Set the brush fell off and I had to super glue back on.  </li>
            <li> OK I realize these are extremely cheap brushes and that you usually get what you pay for, but, wow!  </li>
            <li> because I mean it&#x27;s a good product to start off with.</li>
            <li> ( washed the case though because it had a funny smell, like a new case smell</li>
            <li> Other than that, its a good enough product.</li>
            <li> The Brushes pick up the makeup good and they arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Like, I thought the brushes were going to have soft bristles, but it was the other kind.</li>
            <li> These brushes are decent quality, you get a large variety in this set and</li>
            <li> i have this set now for over a year and still works pretty good, ill definitely buy more from this seller</li>
            <li> So far, my expierence with make up brushes in all has been that its difficult to find brushes that look nice and dont burn a hole in pockets, If you get what I mean but this set come with a roll and in a very attractive color seems like something anyone interested in makeup would want to try.</li>
            <li> It is rare to find natural hair brushes at this low of a price, this is NOT to say synthetic brushes are cheaper, synthetic brushes can be outstanding and far better than natural and in this case these are really low quality natural hairs.    </li>
            <li> You may find that you don&#x27;t need to invest in another full set, and only want certain brush upgrades.</li>
            <li> case is very soft and easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Very soft but strong enough to put eye shadow on.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this brush kit is okay.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a basic brush kit at this price...</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t gotten much use out of it because I don&#x27;t wear my full \\&quot;face\\&quot; very often and as such don&#x27;t need to use the brushes</li>
            <li> When I got them in I was so excited to open up the box, but what I found dampened my mood.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that the elf brands are way better for this price</li>
            <li> my novel helps at least one person! :P</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pretty cute little makeup pouch</li>
            <li> I have seen other sets costing incredibly more.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, for as many brushes as I received for the price, I guess I&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li> [ive even been able to add a couple other brushes i purchased to it].</li>
            <li> Other then that, I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I stopped using 6 and 8 due to the hair dropping (see more on this below).</li>
            <li> She gave a few gentle pulls on the bristles to see if the loose hairs were from the brushes and each gentle pull resulted in more and more bristles falling out of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> So I half-heatedly put this SHANY set on my wish list, not getting my hopes up too too high, though the reviews were certainly encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> If the brushes are new, it&#x27;s harder to tell when they&#x27;re clean because no makeup will be coming out, so just use your best judgement; if they are old but just need to be cleaned, swirl them in the shampoo until the makeup stops making the soap brown (blue green ext.).</li>
            <li> and I was so surprise about how much they cost.. usually to get a set like this cost about 40.00 and up and as a college student I don&#x27;t have that kind of money.</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous, on purchasing at first, it sucks that it didn&#x27;t include a foundation brush though.</li>
            <li> Such a bargain just for the great small brushes that I use all the time.</li>
            <li> I clean them individually...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a different set than others, as I bought them based on the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> quality, probably better then Sephora, Sheer Cover &amp; Bare Minerals ones, which I used to use.</li>
            <li> I received the red brushes and they are very lovely with minimal shedding (if any).</li>
            <li> The price point is rather reasonable and the quality is decent.  </li>
            <li> the brushed washed and dried nicely and didn&#x27;t shed any bristles!:</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pretty annoyed at everyone who gave this product a good rating.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes and the last a long time.</li>
            <li> I hope to have a long relationship with my new makeup brushes and be able to try new tricks that I weren&#x27;t before with my elf brushes.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with these brushes, you can&#x27;t really expect them to be high end.</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations for these Shany brushes.</li>
            <li> , Santa came through, slipping the bright red case into my stocking, and SHANY has absolutely blown me away with these unexpectedly high-quality brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I currently work as a special effects makeup artist and was looking for a set of brushes to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> or i am doing something extra special.  </li>
            <li> Some of the brushes were made a little cheap, but i got a few good ones out of it.</li>
            <li> Each brush came individually wrapped and the hairs are so soft and pick up make-up easily.</li>
            <li> The red pouch makes it much easier to spot and grab quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like the bold red color of the handles and pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work really good with wet or dry eyeshadows</li>
            <li> They are a cheery red color with contrasting black bristles.  </li>
            <li> I am very new with make up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very new into the \\&quot;makeup brush\\</li>
            <li> they r cheap and alot of different brushes but they arent very soft</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really have any kind of bad smell, each brush was wrapped in it&#x27;s own protective baggy.</li>
            <li> Not only is the set a great bargain, but it can be used for everyday makeup, traveling, and for professional use.</li>
            <li> The handles are long and sleek and so smooth and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> In cleaning them before first use there was some absolutely minimal shedding, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li> I feel pretty professional when I unroll it to get a brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a good, solid brush set, especially for someone just starting out in makeup and needing a range of brushes for their collection.</li>
            <li> Professionally, probably not; however, as a starter kit or spare kit absolutely!</li>
            <li> They are soft and exactly what was ordered.thank you</li>
            <li> The one thing that i noticed at first was how soft they are.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t notice a lot of shedding and for the price(somewhat matching its quality), they&#x27;re better than buying professional ones if you don&#x27;t have to much extra $ to spend.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty soft and if you&#x27;re a advocate for PETA this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product i am looking forward to future purchases!totally worth the money i use them everyday!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are so soft, and yet still pretty dense.</li>
            <li> No shedding so far and yes, its very recommended that you wash before use!</li>
            <li> They are also soft and have no weird smells.</li>
            <li> If you angle them better, they won&#x27;t feel as scratchy, but it&#x27;s not worth the effort when you are just trying to apply makeup and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Some of the smaller brushes are probably meant for people who are true professionals with putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> Best set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I&#x27;ve purchased some very expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the first complete brush collection that I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Each brush has a different purpose and they all work true to the descriptions in the pamphlet.  </li>
            <li> Be warned though, the red is a fairly obnoxious shade of red that definitely is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Ok, on to the brushes:  The brushes are not high quality at all, nor that soft.  </li>
            <li> These Brushes were ok, noting to jump up and down about.</li>
            <li> My fan brush did get a little crushed by the pouch because of they way it was wraped up but still great.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes in a nice little soft vinyl roll-up kit that ties.  </li>
            <li> Good care would make them last a little longer.</li>
            <li> As someone who is fairly new to make up, I luv to experiment without having to splurge on tools every time!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to get my new eyeshadow palette in the mail!</li>
            <li> I am new to the make up world and have never used mac brushes or any other better brand,</li>
            <li> Still work, look &amp; feel as if they were brand new, and I&#x27;ve had them for a year!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding good makeup brushes that are soft that don&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, she really needed new brushes.</li>
            <li> The product smells how something new would smell, it smells straight out of factory.</li>
            <li> Quality is good; for everyday, light use, I think they will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I feel bad saying it, since I absolutely love the palette, but the brushes aren&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li> I feel bad saying it, since I absolutely love the palette, but the brushes aren&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay more for brushes that don&#x27;t leave hairs all over my face or come with black chemicals still in them.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough and come apart easily.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash them before using them because there is an odd smell/powder residue on the brushes.</li>
            <li> After washing them and letting them dry I lightly tugged on the hair</li>
            <li> I was able to easily krazy glue the handle back into place but still not a good first impression.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash the brushes after every use espically if you are using black shadow.</li>
            <li> Feels rough on the skin and hairs come out to easily.</li>
            <li> As I got older I was introduced to the wonders of the bra and shorn legs...</li>
            <li> I currently have invested in a better quality of make up brushes and have given these to my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> Because it was decent looking and affordable.</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for the price</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother because I wouldn&#x27;t of used that particular brush</li>
            <li> I ordered this set mainly to replace my eye shadow applicators that kept getting destroyed.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that it was a decent deal for the price, but I&#x27;m not so enthralled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - so much better, softer, fuller - I only recommend this set if you want/need the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the red and the bristles are an auburn red</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes like the foundation, concealer and eye brushes are a lot firmer and they definitely get more product</li>
            <li> in my opinion there are a few that I really don&#x27;t see the point in, I feel like it would have been better to trade a few in... but for a starter kit it has really helped me and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li> This brush set has so many different brushes that can be used for all different makeup applications.  </li>
            <li> Decent set of beginner brushers.</li>
            <li> The only plus I have is that they came in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush set for the price.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the eye brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few brushes, but they seem fairly durable.</li>
            <li> now they are a decent purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of those classic cases of, \\&quot;You can&#x27;t judge a book by its cover.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The larger powder brushes are okay, but the bristles on the eyeshadow brushes are too coarse.</li>
            <li> Picks up quite a decent amount of makeup.</li>
            <li> i like the smaller brushes more then the larger ones.</li>
            <li> I got this 13 piece set in 2012 when i was just starting off learning how to apply make-up, and for that reason only i think this is ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I only use 4 out of 12, but I&#x27;m glad I have extra just in case</li>
            <li> I needed decent brushes with a decent price.</li>
            <li> I mainly use brushes to apply blush and mineral powder eyeliner.</li>
            <li> But this isn&#x27;t the main problem.    </li>
            <li> The main problem is shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking to purchase something better and will definitely hold on to these for back up.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t happen with the eye brushes, thank goodness since they are the ones I mainly use.</li>
            <li> Also, I have discovered that the shaft is quite short and comes apart; however, I have been able to stick the brush back onto its handle, but it&#x27;s an ongoing issue.</li>
            <li> The case is clever too, because it conveniently organizes quite a number of brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never owned decent brushes before.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are decent quality.</li>
            <li> but it is still decent quality for the amount I paid.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes hoping they would be decent.</li>
            <li> Needs a decent powder brush for 5 stars.</li>
            <li> only reason i gave it a 2 star because they are a cute red color</li>
            <li> the hair of the brush is not that soft, cheap qualified, and it is big</li>
            <li> I did not return them because the shadow and eyeliner brushes were decent and I don&#x27;t like the hassle.</li>
            <li> E.L.F essential brushes have the same feel to them, but are of much better quality.</li>
            <li> They are a decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last more than a year before the bristle starting fall apart.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is serving as a backup to my main set.  </li>
            <li> OK, but really only for people with smaller eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> White are cheaper but only cost $1 each, I love them.  </li>
            <li> but they are really nice does the work they also came later then expected</li>
            <li> but they look of decent quality.</li>
            <li> I love the way the brushes came individually wrapped and with plastic covers for each of the larger brush heads.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes is decent...</li>
            <li> If one of your main reasons for buying this set is the fact that it comes with a pouch, MOVE ON.</li>
            <li> Decent set of beginners brushes or brushes for traveling.</li>
            <li> So if you want a decent set of starter brushes I would go for these.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality item.</li>
            <li> the smaller brushed are better than the two blush/powder brushes.</li>
            <li> I am used to very high quality bushes and these by far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li> high quality, can&#x27;t live without it anymore !</li>
            <li> They are very soft, and I use one of the very small-tipped brushes for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> Brushes aren&#x27;t very soft after about 5th use, but they were very inexpensive</li>
            <li> They are very soft and Gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and put the makeup on very well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, and they pick up any product really well.</li>
            <li> Since I had been using the same make-up brushes for many years (some up to 20 years) and cleaning them on a regular basis, most of them were getting a little shabby.  </li>
            <li> and I got mine in a red color which was very pretty.</li>
            <li> and the fiber is still very soft!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> YOU WILL DO BETTER THAN THIS MESS.</li>
            <li> very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> I pulled on the brushes to make sure they were on tightly</li>
            <li> Yes these brushes are high quality.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting high quality Mac brushes.</li>

            <li> but they were always priced way to high for me to afford.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy high end brushes since I don&#x27;t want to hop on the MAC or Sigma brushes bandwagon.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love new brushes every year to a few month depending on how much I ware make up for</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick but was to be expected of Prime (we pay $80 a year for it, so it better be!)The product itself came in a pink pouch (nothing to be done about that)</li>
            <li> These are soft, the large shadow brush doesn&#x27;t apply that well.  </li>
            <li> So the brushes are great but not easily suitable for mineral powders because the brushes are not firm enough.</li>
            <li> Comes with a cute little carrying case too.</li>
            <li> Also, the brushes come in a cute little leather type bag which takes up no room at all.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a little over a year, and i have used them (most of them) every day.</li>
            <li> I would get the little hairs in my eyes, in top of my foundation, and so on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they come in a cute little case to hold all of them trust me you will not be dissapointed</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li> It also comes in a cute little pouch.</li>
            <li> But other than those few things, I would say they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and the little holder they come with.</li>
            <li> Theyre so soft!!</li>
            <li> Good for starting out not high quality but for younger girls just learning about</li>
            <li> This can certainly happen with brushes but this was more than usual.  </li>
            <li> but no they really are fine quality for such a low cost.</li>
            <li> Like in other reviews there was a strong plastic smell, you have to let it breath</li>
            <li> it is hard to find nice makeup brushes that won&#x27;t hurt your pocketbook and don&#x27;t fall apart the minute you buy them.</li>
            <li> The comb kind of brush is really hard.</li>
            <li> but I have no children or other strong responsibilities</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft, well made, and i love the color (mine were red and black).</li>
            <li> They do smell very strongly of some chemical when they first arrive, but I just set the pouch out, open, for a few days and the scent went away.  </li>
            <li> I advise that you spend a little extra on some amazing quality brushes, or if you are really on a budget, I suggest trying out the ELF Studio Brushes.</li>
            <li> But after I left it open for a few minutes, the smell went away and I could use the super cute brushes!</li>
            <li> I mainly bought these to have a new foundation brush.</li>
            <li> This product is like a real professional brush kit.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and they&#x27;re put together very well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and pick up the powders very well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> they are very sturdy and the brushes themselves are soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The box they came in looked very sleek and professional.</li>
            <li> great alterenative to expensive bruses</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that the mineral powder brush is really quite soft and doesnt feel like sandpaper to your face like kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> The brushes were soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing, case is soft and not cheap!</li>
            <li> Like if i just pull softly on the brushes some of the hairs fall out, so I&#x27;ve been scared to use them too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ware it near as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> rough like a cheap set.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, apply the makeup evenly blend everything very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the soft brushes.</li>
            <li> and they are very durable and soft.</li>
            <li> soft, and apply makeup very evenly.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, and no matter how much I wash them they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and work very well.</li>
            <li> You get all of your basics plus a few extra for such a great price.</li>
            <li> i couldnt find anything wrong, its a great buy.</li>
            <li> There soft but catches and applies product really well.</li>
            <li> Not thick.</li>
            <li> They are soft and appear to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> She threw all her old ones out and said 3 times now how much see loves them.  </li>
            <li> the brushes are too soft and cant help much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had so many quality professional brushes before at such a low price!</li>
            <li> However, the wood part does scratch, but I guess thats normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup artist but for someone that uses it on a somewhat regular basis this is worth it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are of acceptable quality, and they are soft to the skin, and the handles are long and have a comfortable hold.</li>
            <li> but i think thats normal considering its vinyl.  </li>
            <li> They take up the same amount of space as a flip flop pretty much.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up RETURNING them, and I rarely return make up</li>
            <li> Also all brushes are all good sizes, not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> But I feel like it&#x27;s worth to buy the set for the smaller eye brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes were really small only 3 were of good use):</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with my real techniques brushes and they work pretty well overall.</li>
            <li> Its not the most fantastic brushes I&#x27;ve ever used, however it does the job adequately enough especially for such a low price.</li>
            <li> It comes with pretty much all the necessary brushes.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday and they&#x27;re still fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I have now built up my collection with mostly Sigma and Coastal Scents brushes, a few MAC.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first real set I&#x27;ve ever had, so I&#x27;m obviously no expert, but I can tell when something works.</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing with nicer ones.</li>
            <li> ONCE I USE A FEW MORE</li>
            <li> only a few brushes are good do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Price is good but poor quality.</li>
            <li> After my 14 month old thoroughly destroyed one of my favorite eyeshadow brushes, I broke down &amp; decided to try my luck with a cheaper brush; boy did I make a mistake.  </li>
            <li> But the other tools I used in the kit worked fine</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to a new cosmetic brush set, so I ordered Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush 13 piece set with a Pouch.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, the full brushes were not very good but the eye shadow and smaller brushes were okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought they smelled yucky, they were more coarse feeling than I thought they&#x27;d be, and I dislike needing to wash and dry them after every use.</li>
            <li> I mean really nice brushes coast $20-30 a piece at department stores.</li>
            <li> roll them right back up</li>
            <li> I did wash them right away put them back in their plastic covers.</li>
            <li> BUT WITH THE POUCH I CAN SLIP THEM RIGHT BACK IN!</li>
            <li> Also when washing my brushes the smaller sized powder/blush brush handle came right off.</li>
            <li> But I saw it had more positive then negative ones.</li>
            <li> The only positive is that it doesn&#x27;t shed as much as the powder brush did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush set comes with a very pretty red leather soft roll up case.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the durability, because I got mine recently, but definitely worth the money so far!</li>
            <li> Its time for me to get a new set, and i am coming right back to SHANY...</li>
            <li> : The main brushes (powder, blush, bronzer, etc.) started falling apart after the first month of daily use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my other Shany Cosmetic products and thought I&#x27;d give this set a try</li>
            <li> The brochure has advertisements for other Shany products, and ways to get free samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I washed these brushes a second time before using (which I don&#x27;t normally do) and they still shed (not as much thankfully) making me very weary to use on myself.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a red brush set in my collection, the holding up pretty well, but as far as applying makeup, the eyeshadow brushes work very well</li>
            <li> I thought that little extra bit was really nice.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a little booklet that lets you know which brush is which, that is a nice touch especially if you are a beginner.</li>
            <li> So I figured it was time to get some new ones.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s just a \\&quot;new factory\\</li>
            <li> they smelled like new brushes.</li>
            <li> I would definately suggest this item to anyone if they were looking for a new brush set.</li>
            <li> The smell of the pouch is not a problem, its new therefore the smell...</li>
            <li> I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products.</li>
            <li> and I now need new brushes.  </li>
            <li> I never thought to make a review about this product, but I was searching for new brushes and I stumbled upon these</li>
            <li> Note, I just said I was looking for new brushes..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new set.</li>
            <li> so i will be a buying a new set to replace this one</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I&#x27;m going to go buy new replacements of the brand I had before.</li>
            <li> price, variety, and pouch are convenient but I will be getting new brushes.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with your brushes smelling like they are new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited almost two years to buy new brushes because I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend money on something I don&#x27;t use often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like they go out an clip the fur off a live animal to make these, they are made from fur scraped off of hides before they are tanned for leather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying another set to keep on hand because I like to use new brushes every 6 to 12 months</li>
            <li> I am still new to using make-up brushes and bought this set to try them out.</li>
            <li> And BE SURE to lay them flat on a paper towl to dry.</li>
            <li> but they are another cheap option for make up brushes if you are looking for something a little better quality but still affordable for a tight budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clearly that&#x27;s to be expected because they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li> My big mistake here was not using a brush guard, you MUST use a mesh BRUSH GUARD when on the two larger brushes in this set (made by coastal scents available here on amazon, buy the muti pack).</li>
            <li> These are not professional brushes, so you don&#x27;t really get the range or variety you would for higher end brushes.</li>
            <li> The fabulous willowy tall blonde model receiving this from her wishlist intends to use this set to their maximum potential.</li>
            <li> The only con is the cheap looking fire engine red pleatherette pouch they came in.</li>
            <li> Let me just say I love these brushes they soft and firm..</li>
            <li> These brushes a very soft and durable, (mine still look brand new)</li>

            <li> did I mention they have a strange strong smell as if they were actually dipped in paint.</li>
            <li> I washed them first, and no bristles came out during the next uses.</li>

            <li> The smaller brushes are still holding up though ;-)</li>
            <li> Also the red pleather sleeve smelled like chemicals for the first 3 months.</li>
            <li> These brushes far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> The only problem is, when I first got it I opened the bag</li>
            <li> I compared a similar set today, at a much higher price, and wondered how my Amazon purchase would compare.  </li>
            <li> but WOW!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are so soft!</li>
            <li> Love it use them everyday!</li>
            <li> /&gt;she loves the color, the material and how soft they are!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> i thought they were the same at first also.</li>
            <li> so I never got to use it, the brushes are definitely not as lush/dense as the pictures make them out to be, the pouch fell apart within my first month of using the set, and the tops of the brushes have become to fall off</li>
            <li> Save your money and either get a smaller, higher quality set, or buy a bunch of cheaper and mid-range products from CVS or Target.  </li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first and not last, oh well, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> the only downside to these is that the hairs are not cut precisely and there are no rigid flat brushes you can use to do an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> They are also not the exact same brushes you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> The only con I see with this product is when you first use them, some of the hairs fall out</li>
            <li> I noticed that other reviews mentioned the potent smell of the brushes when you open the box.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and I had extra brushes thank goodness because the first time I used them the hairs just ended up all over the models face.</li>
            <li> But it feels so soft and durable!</li>
            <li> I love them and use them everyday!</li>
            <li> They are soft, yet the bristles stay in and don&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li> I got my set in red, it comes exactly how it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> The brushes are SO soft and uber-gentle on your eyelid, and they blend like a PRO!</li>
            <li> None of the hairs are falling out and they are sooo soft!</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I was wishing for, but I now have a brush for everything I need!</li>
            <li> Next time i&#x27;ll choose to buy something most expensive and hopefully of better quality.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to everyone and anyone professional or not!</li>
            <li> Like the title says, these brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> I love the pouch (in red) because I also use it to store some other brushes that I use.</li>
            <li> I use the angled brush, a shadow brush, the foundation brush, and small powder brush every day, and often use the others on the weekends when I put more time into my makeup.</li>
            <li> come at an extremely run for your value price, the case they come in is adorable and when I apply my blushes and bronzer, I truly see a big  difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were my first makeup brushes that I bought a WHILE back.</li>
            <li> when I received the brushes they came in a pretty red pouch .</li>
            <li> These were purchased for my 15 year old daughter and she has never complained about them so that makes them a winner.  </li>
            <li> She loves the options that this set gives and she uses it with other Shany products of the same top notch quality.</li>
            <li> The reason for four stars instead of five is that some of the bristles shed which is why I wanted a different set in the first place.  </li>
            <li> the lack of texture in the bristles is more obvious in the two big ones than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> the kit has nice variaty but the brush wasn&#x27;t soft enough and the brush hair were all uneven and they tend to fall all over.</li>
            <li> The pouch was a huge let down in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I washed them for her with just normal shampoo (frutics) and they dried just fine.</li>
            <li> They are okay for personal use, but if you are interested in buying them for professional use then I would suggest buying a different and more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> These are very cheep, but at a high standard.</li>
            <li> Very soft, very professional and so far none of the hair is coming out of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Essencell® Cosmetic Brushes-12pc Makeup Brush Set -High Quality Natural and Synthetic Hair Makeup Brushes -Soft and Dense-</li>
            <li> They work fine, but they dont last very long.</li>
            <li> They do need washed with shampoo before using because of the harsh smell, but that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li> I took a quick glance and saw lots and lots of reviews with a decent average.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not good good at all, especially with liquid makeup foundation.</li>
            <li> At least they came in a pouch, so it&#x27;s really not much of a complaint :)</li>
            <li> I have washed the brushes a few times and the hair bristles are strong and durable.  </li>
            <li> The brushes feel cheap and are not full as make up brushes should be.</li>
            <li> Very pretty pink.</li>
            <li> I mean they&#x27;re not professional, but for the price I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> It is new as expected and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Instead, my order came as expected, with the pouch color I wanted (even though there isn&#x27;t an opportunity available to choose the pouch color), faster than the expected delivery date, with a high quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I actually like these brushes better than my previous brushes...</li>
            <li> make sure to condition them before prior use because they do have an odd smell.</li>
            <li> They do smell weird and bristles has fallen off; but over all I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li> My first brush set: no major brand name or exorbitant price</li>
            <li> I love to layer different colors of eyeshadows on my eyes, and realize the mess that applying them on with my fingers can create.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a very vibrant red.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes have lost their shape, even though I take extremely good care of my products, and at least one face brush has come loose in the handle and knocks about when I use</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes have lost their shape, even though I take extremely good care of my products, and at least one face brush has come loose in the handle and knocks about when I use</li>
            <li> It comes with a large blush brush and a smaller blush brush which I am assuming they think can also be used for foundation.  </li>
            <li> mine are not stiff at all.  </li>
            <li> There is such a large variety of brushes to use.  </li>
            <li> I like the large options of different types of brushes and the color</li>
            <li> but if you do your daily makeup for school or work then this certainly will get the job done.</li>
            <li> The case seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li> The brushes I received reminded me of ones I got from the toy store when I was a little girl with some cheap makeup.</li>
            <li> My daughter used them and stated that she liked them but didn&#x27;t notice much difference in them and other brushes she has used in the past.</li>
            <li> so many brushes for such a little price.</li>
            <li> The brush set smelled a little funny at first</li>
            <li> The brushes may be numbered, and indeed out of order, but I like it as the original order they are in the case is the order of brushes I typically use when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> the little red pouch is cute too.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel a little extra sexy when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that I would be lucky like the other reviewers and not have brushes that shed, but these started shedding as soon as I washed them.  </li>
            <li> These brushes shed SO much during the first wash, both the large and small brushes and there was hair all over my counter and my hands.</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of getting all these brushes with a little leather wrap up thing, but the quality is definitely on the low end.</li>
            <li> Professional brushes that if you keep them clean will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and the bristles are really soft, the bigger brushes come with a plastic cover</li>
            <li> Sheds pretty bad, but overall works pretty good</li>
            <li> If you are a proffessional it may be worth it to invest in a more expensive brand-</li>
            <li> These brushes are cheap when I got them it came in a cheap fake leather roll thing.</li>
            <li> But when I got them (fast shipping too by the way), there was no odor,no white powder, &amp; they ARE soft..</li>
            <li> It meets all needs when making up and has a clear instruction about how to use each brush.</li>
            <li> really like all the brushes, Not the biggest fan of Number 6 or 8 only because the hair did fall</li>
            <li> Th red case filled with brushes came wrapped in plastic and each individual brush came plastic wrapped and had brush covers for the bigger brushes.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, but she readily says she really only uses 4 or 5 tools in the kit, but she doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m young.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Shany Shimmer Eyeshadow Palette, 50/50 Shimmer Matte, 13 Ounce plus the Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch</li>
            <li> , they just send me 2  Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch</li>
            <li> I love the MAC brushes, but can&#x27;t stand the thought of forking out at least eighteen dollars for ONE brush.  </li>
            <li> I honestly do not know what they are all for, but I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out.</li>
            <li> They looks so professional</li>
            <li> i cant really complain since they were only 25 dollars but still for that price i would have thought that all of the brushes wold have been useable.</li>

            <li> To my knowledge all these brushes are natural hair (appear to be pony, not including the eyebrow comb).</li>
            <li> Do not I repeat DO NOT use dish soap or vinegar or any chemical like that, they will strip the natural hair and make these brushes weaker and scratchier than they already are.    </li>

            <li> This set by far exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also consider purchasing this product for a young person beginning to learn how to use makeup.  </li>
            <li> I thought the brushes are soft and apply make up well, and I&#x27;ve been using them for over a month without problems.</li>

            <li> They smell and they&#x27;re like a old rug.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 16 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> It fit the discription.an no parts were missing.</li>
            <li> The description says the brushes have a soft and silky feel and they by no means do.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft, but ont fall out.</li>
            <li> The brushes are prickly against skin, if you like soft brushes, DO NOT BUY THESE.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a Professional set of quality brushes.</li>
            <li> B001JKTTVQ Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch</li>
            <li> that I am  practicing artist with 22 yrs experience, I wouldnt use these professionally.</li>
            <li> soft brushes..</li>
            <li> For the price and what you actually get, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> the pouch is a soft material.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are really professional grade like sigma</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes but so far with the ones I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> They are soft and don&#x27;t damage my already sensitive</li>
            <li> It is so soft and</li>
            <li> Maybe let your 9 year old daughter play with them but</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money on this product ever again.</li>
            <li> For example, the all over powder brush from E.L.F is soft, not as soft as the brush from their studio line, and doesn&#x27;t scratch the face.</li>
            <li> As I stated earlier since I&#x27;m knew to makeup this makes things much easier for me.</li>
            <li> feels soft against my skin</li>
            <li> It works well with my professional skills.</li>
            <li> I just got my Shany Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch.</li>
            <li> The brushes are professional.</li>
            <li> Sometimes as an MUA, when you are on set, you really need a variety of brushes as you may not have time for cleaning properly.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely cheaply made and smell like harsh chemicals-</li>
            <li> Angled brush- NOT FIRM</li>
            <li> no fallout bristles,great for beginners and professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete set where I don&#x27;t have to go out and purchase additional brushes.</li>
            <li> These are not quality professional brushes.  </li>
            <li> far im</li>
            <li> THESE ARE NATURAL HAIR BRUSHES made from goat and badger fur.</li>
            <li> probably far out of my league with these.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The package came early, undamaged.</li>
            <li> She show me the difrrence between her drugstore brushes and this ones and the bristles on hers were really soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and velvety.</li>
            <li> She will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Love the red color, I was afraid they were going to be too pinkish, but the are a nice cherry red.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li> I received these for a christmas gift, and I like them so much I will be buying them for my mom and daughter at the next oportunity.</li>
            <li> they are soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as I thiught they would be, thats why I gave three stars.</li>
            <li> I like how soft these brushes are.</li>
            <li> Its a cheap brush set don&#x27;t waste your money unless you are on some budget as I was.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or anything, I really didn&#x27;t need like, 8 different types of eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> searched for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I like to keep some basic toiletries in the guest bath, making trips so much easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this to accompany a make-up kit SHANY products for a young girl.</li>
            <li> The only brushes I really like are the blush and powder brush.</li>
            <li> but there not fluffy</li>
            <li> They are soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li> But the hair is not so soft.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit surprised at the exclusion of a contour brush and a lip liner brush.</li>
            <li> They are quite soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, if I had known about RealTechniques brushes BEFORE ordering this SHANY Professional set, I probably would not have purchased this set.</li>
            <li> 3 1/4 starsechniques brushes BEFORE ordering this SHANY Professional set</li>
            <li> you want truly professional quality brushes, you&#x27;ll need to pay for them.  </li>
            <li> I can buy one brush at Sephora for the same quality and price for this whole set.</li>
            <li> B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch,</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter spotted my set and demanded I order her one too.</li>
            <li> They are soft and not corse like some brushes sold at stores.</li>
            <li> I Gave three  stars because the brushes were not what I expected but they were definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> but I own a $70.00 Kabuki brush and even that occasionally malts bristles and loses its softness after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> whatever I spent was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I think this set is definitely worth the money, but be careful with them if you don&#x27;t want them to break.</li>
            <li> The only brush that I use everyday and love is the brow/lash comb.</li>
            <li> The only brush that I use everyday and love is the brow/lash comb.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, brush sets mainly only come with eye shadow brushes and a few faces brushes.</li>
            <li> It came kind of messed up since it&#x27;s so thin.  </li>
            <li> They get HOT really fast extremely so!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on MAC or Sigma, these brushes are just as good for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews stating that the brushes are soft, but to me, they are nothing special.</li>
            <li> I finally decided it was time to invest in a solid set of brushes and these were right in my price range.</li>
            <li> I think the only brush I dont like is the eyeliner brush, its cheap &amp; just isnt sturdy enough to apply liner, but I really like the other ones.</li>
            <li> They are way better than the bits and pieces I had cobbled together and mean that I can take advantage of the pricey makeup</li>
            <li> Great variety of brushes, however the case is cheap-looking plastic, and the entire set has a funky smell that is very unappealing.  </li>
            <li> Also, so far the brushes have held up very nicely, possibly due in part to my rare use of them.</li>
            <li> It came so nicely packaged (in this black professional black)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 months now, and i can&#x27;t help but compare them to other brushes that I used before (and spent alot more money on).</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something I really want to use with my face or make-up due to the intense chemical smell.</li>
            <li> You get quite a few brushes in the set and for the money I would say they are worth it!</li>
            <li> The hairs constantly fall out, they are rough not soft at all, the top of the brush falls off the handle.  </li>
            <li> Some of my brushes were loose from the stick, I super glued them back together, that why you see four stars.</li>
            <li> All the small brushed works beautifully but the big ones are a mess.</li>
            <li> This will be my second Shany Professional Brush set, My daughter needed some, so I gave her my old ones and purchases some new ones.</li>
            <li> and one more thing is that the brushes come out red and the hair part is not half blonde and half brown their just brown.</li>
            <li> You seriously can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didnt like is that the powder brush (i assume its a powder brush) is too small and is a better as a blush brush.</li>
            <li> but.. I bought this set mainly for the bigger brushes and...</li>
            <li> Only problem I had with this product is the smell when you first open the box.</li>
            <li> The only problem I foresee having is having to hot glue the handles back on.</li>
            <li> A couple are okay, but overall I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Also these exact  same brushes are sold by a different name by Makeup By Ren Ren.  </li>
            <li> I got these mainly because they were red..</li>
            <li> First, the picture shown on the main search page prior to selecting it, does not match the actual merchandise as there is NO big powder brush.  </li>
            <li> The case is a vibrant red that catches the eye.  </li>
            <li> Urban Decay and MAC are my top brands usually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that there isn&#x27;t a bigger powder brush, but I am very happy with the eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when I saw this set of brushes at the price they were sold at - for a natural/synthetic hair brush product I expect to be paying a bit more.</li>
            <li> Definitely a very strong weird smell when you first open them, but that also goes away once you wash them completely.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend doing that before putting your brushes back in.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There is very little glue used to hold the handle on and to hold the hairs inplace which is a huge problem.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes seem to be OK but all the larger ones leave little brown hairs all over may face and eyes, and it takes forever to get them off.</li>
            <li> I expected a little more of a professional set.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and the basic ones needed in an everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and the basic ones needed in an everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I use them several times a week for personal use and so far, they&#x27;ve held up fine with very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because of the numerous positive reviews and the low price.</li>
            <li> For me I don&#x27;t really care about the pouch color as long as what&#x27;s inside works.</li>
            <li> So soft I can barely get any product on it..</li>
            <li> so my only complaint really is they&#x27;re kinda cheaply made</li>
            <li> The brushes ok the brush bag not good.</li>
            <li> I realized from the start that there were a number of brushes that I knew I would never use (i.e. small brushes used for precise application of eye makeup).</li>
            <li> No shedding, no missing part,  the red color is still the same, it picks up make up very well</li>
            <li> not sure if this is cruility free as it did not say anything on package</li>
            <li> Only use a few of the brushes regularly but I love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fun to pick brush hairs out of your freshly done makeup.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are ok but the big fluffy ones leave hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li> They are a hot pink reddish color with a matching case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of an expert on make up and this is my first brush set</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money doing so and the shany brushes are just as good as expensive makeup brushes but these are very affordable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2/20/13: Since the two brushes I use most (for powder and blush) are still so stiff (not soft and &#x27;fluffy&#x27; as the picture would lead you to believe), I ended up buying new brushes from Amway, since I had bought from them in the past and liked their quality and how they applied the powder products.</li>
            <li> They are not super expensive brushes but they are pretty good for what you pay.</li>
            <li> They are fluffy, nice material, don&#x27;t prickle the skin, and it comes with a little pouch.</li>
            <li> I have a few very high end brushes that I paid WAY too much for</li>
            <li> I will probably buy new set in future to replace this set.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, I uses them daily without any disappointment</li>
            <li> I just wish the handles were black, red isn&#x27;t really a favorite color of mine, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll survive based on the necessities of needing an expensive set.</li>
            <li> I really like them overall especially for the price.</li>
            <li> She has been using them constantly and has said that they are soft, professional and they are not falling apart after she washes them.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Shany Professional 13-piece Cosmetic Brush Set and it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs or wants a brush set, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Their very soft overall</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive considering there are single brushes selling for over $300.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, save your money and buy some real techniques or eco tools if you&#x27;re a beginner and want brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I was lured in by relatively good reviews and cheap price but seriously did NOT like these brushes because they were so unpleasant to use on my face.</li>
            <li> I would especially recommend this to beginners because they are easy to use and there is almost no seeding, and what does shed is very little</li>
            <li> Comparable with other higher priced make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I recommend buy EcoTools brushes (there is a set of small brushes and bigger brushes) for a couple more dollars and double the usage time.</li>
            <li> Major bang for your buck with this set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes shed like no other.</li>
            <li> I usually gently tug at the hairs before I use the brush to get rid of any loose ends.</li>
            <li> I got them very quickly using Amazon Prime (I am not sure if it was even 2 days!)</li>
            <li> after using it for a week, the black part of the brush can right off.</li>
            <li> They are firm and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like many other brushes I have owned....</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to replace my older makeup brushes, and it was long overdue.</li>
            <li> The eyelash brush was crappy, maybe just a fluke, but I threw that out and added a few of my own brushes because a few of the brush handles are small enough to fit two into one slot.</li>
            <li> They are barely satisfactory compared to the brushes I purchased from other companies; however, at a much higher cost.  </li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are soft yet stiff, and they don&#x27;t require you to mash into your make up to get the right amount to apply.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this brush set, and it not only doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this brush set, and it not only doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> 1st, they came in my fave color (red) and 2nd, they are so soft!!</li>
            <li> I saw some great reviews and some bad reviews, but I figured for the price I&#x27;ll try them.  </li>
            <li> The pouch came in a separate box with two informational leaflets - one with a description of every brush and one with general information about Shany Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> set of brushes has found itself completely integrated into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I bought the 12 brush set called the \\&quot;Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set\\&quot; and it came with a red pouch for 12 dollars in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I touched them before washing, and they were all soft except the 2 big ones.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely thought that this brush was going to get the job done (absolutely not).</li>
            <li> The foundation brushes are not firm enough for application, and when pressure is put on them, all of the bristles fall out!</li>
            <li> The hairs are really soft and don&#x27;t fall out compared to others of the same price.</li>
            <li> Some malt bristles occasionally and they are fairly soft</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes are wayy too soft..</li>
            <li> Then, the hair on both brushes are very coarse and itchy-not soft at all.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much anyway based on the price (about $20 with shipping)</li>
            <li> Mine is in my fave color - red, and in buttery soft leather.</li>
            <li> The red brush roll holder is so soft and the leather smell like leather...</li>
            <li> the 13th piece is the soft case that it comes in.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush completely fell apart the second time I washed it!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t see it coming off in the near future.  </li>
            <li> get a complete set of brushes needed to wear you facial makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for barely two weeks and they&#x27;re already shedding.</li>
            <li> You are given three brushes designed for your overall face.&lt;br /&gt;- SOFT BRISTLES.</li>
            <li> the bristles weren&#x27;t soft enough.</li>
            <li> so I washed them and aired them out for a couple of days and that helped to entirely get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a kit very similar to this in terms of the brush layout and natural hairs here</li>
            <li> They are soft, BUT way too soft to where the brush bends too much when trying to apply leading to wasted prouct.</li>
            <li> I cleaned them when I took them out of the packaging with Bare Minerals brush cleaner, and they&#x27;re still intact.  </li>
            <li> so I literarily wrapped it up and threw it in the back of my closet</li>
            <li> I am surprised that they are only this price.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than expected.</li>
            <li> These brushes really pick up color and are way softer than expected.</li>
            <li> The bristles constantly fall out and are way too soft.</li>
            <li> They are rough and do not apply make up very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommended this item.</li>
            <li> &quot; smudge brush- Not firm enough to be a pencil brush.</li>
            <li> (And I know this may be gross to some of you professional make-up artists, but I have never even cleaned them!)&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
            <li> My fan brush barely had any hairs on it and it does not do its job.</li>
            <li> No regrets on brushes.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a rough make up</li>
            <li> But the big brushes are not as soft as I thought they were.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I lost some of my old brushes in our move recently.  </li>
            <li> I am a beginner with makeup, but I have found that all the necessary essentials as far as brushes are concerned are included.</li>
            <li> What I do not quite like is that angled and &#x27;pencil&#x27; brushes are really not firm enough.</li>
            <li> And on one of the eye brushes the metal part that&#x27;s attached to the handle came completely off, and I had to glue it back on.</li>
            <li> I only used two so far, the blush brush and they eye shadow brush...one of them, anyway.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Shany professional 13 piece cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li> The big ones shed a tiny bit when washing, which is normal.  </li>
            <li> The brushes smelled like the packaging the first few days, but that went away one they aired out.</li>
            <li> one more thin gr8 shipping</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews that stated the poor quality of the brushes, but I think that for the price, they&#x27;re not terrible.</li>
            <li> Most of them have broken by now.</li>
            <li> They &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; as if they&#x27;re an expensive brush set, and the case is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You honestly cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> It did have kind of a weird smell when I opened it however.</li>
            <li> Its ok for gifting to children but not worth for women who use make up everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what people are talking about the smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pro makeup artist for 12 years, so I&#x27;m not easy to please, but these brushes were very, veryyyy high quality, and the set has quite an array of brushes that can be used professionally and personally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people left any kind of review other than 5 stars!  </li>
            <li> Super soft hair with hardly any shedding.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t apply makeup except for when the sun goes down cuz it&#x27;s hot here</li>
            <li> i am interested to see what other products this company has!</li>
            <li> I would recommend washing them prior to use in a gentle shampoo, rinse and lay out on a towel to dry.</li>
            <li> I found myself to only finding about half useful.</li>
            <li> My only negative criticism is the strong, plastic smell, but I assume it can be removed once washed.</li>
            <li> Like previous commentors said the bag smells pretty stong</li>
            <li> , the quality appears to be less than stellar.</li>
            <li> love the larger brushes for when im bronzing Seriously still using these brushes 3 years later</li>
            <li> The brushes start to fall apart pretty soon, having this kit for less than a year</li>
            <li> , the quality appears to be less than stellar.</li>
            <li> Although these brushes were cheap and delivered promptly, there have been a few loose hairs here and there, but that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> They are not HIGH quality, but we didn&#x27;t pay for high quality.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are made well, no loose hairs.</li>
            <li> No loose bristles.</li>
            <li> The large powder brush loses a few hairs but other than that, these are amazing.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as expected!</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a foundation brush so that I could use this whole set on other people and not have to use my hands to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> The brushes are long, and look so professional!</li>
            <li> Then third of all when I washed my brushes they didn&#x27;t shape back to normal and the texture of them was not the same.</li>
            <li> brushes I did receive are cheap, bristles fall out constantly, they are hard and hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> Simga brushes are expensive, so the only one I really wanted was the F80 Flat Top Kabuki Brush.  </li>
            <li> It was great for my face especially since I have bad acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not being dramatic, I love this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I have honestly never seen such cheap quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> Before owning the Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch, I never really had a complete set like this.</li>
            <li> The red leather purse/bag is retro yet classy, and was obviously made with style in mind.</li>
            <li> This is money well spent especially for someone like me who is very fussy about where I spend &amp; what I buy.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes were ok but not great when I applied powered makeup.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the powder brush it was too thin on the top</li>
            <li> I bought the Shany Brushes, I tried out a few different companies for a blush brush, and none of them were worth it.</li>
            <li> The case is pretty cute, and the brushes are very soft, but during washing them and just after 1 use it&#x27;s shedding :(.</li>
            <li> just the right feel...not too soft or hard</li>
            <li> The case smells a little funny just out of the package.</li>
            <li> The only time i use them is when I have no other choice.</li>
            <li> It dissapointed me just a little when I first saw it, but I wasn&#x27;t surprise about the quality.</li>
            <li> and so far i&#x27;ve had to hot glue the tops back on a few of them, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> My only problem was that they weren&#x27;t glued to the sticks well enough so some of the brushed came off but a little super glue and problem, solved.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with was some the brushes hair is uneven and my fan brush got a little bent.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight smell when you first open them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup brush fan, but I needed them and wasn&#x27;t going to spend an exuberant amount on just one brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a larger flat foundation brush to apply powder mineral concealer, and am still using my old brush for that.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get much of a variety of brushes and they are a bit rough and flat.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, while I have not noticed the eye brushes dropping hairs much, I have seen a LOT of dropped hairs from the larger (blush and powder) brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes have long length, to allow for professional makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I like the roll-up pouch holder - apparently the color of the pouch may vary, but mine matched the brush handles in red.  </li>
            <li> No strange smells.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> , i was afraid they could damage my skin, but the cosmetics brushes are made from a combination of natural animal hair and synthetic hair, so they are soft and silky on top.</li>
            <li> just be aware of the heavy bristle fall out.</li>
            <li> For instance -- there is no good eye blending brush, all the eye brushes are very stiff, good for lining or loading on color, but no blending eye brush.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes are a little flat, and I&#x27;m one to like more fluffy brushes for blending, but I have some of those too</li>
            <li> The handles are a pretty Chinese lacquer-type red and the ferrules are glossy black.</li>
            <li> My brushes shed a little but that was only the first wash.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little worried because there seems to be mixed reviews, but for the price I figured I would try it.</li>
            <li> The shedding is minimal, only shed the first time I used and washed them, which is pretty common.</li>
            <li> They are very soft at first but become kinda rough after a few uses..</li>
            <li> , the bristles themselves come out a little easily and the cut of them is a little jagged for the types of brushes.  </li>
            <li> Quality is too be expected for the pricing, if you are new at applying makeup &amp;#34;GO FOR IT&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used them regularly for over three months and not a single hair has fallen from the brushes.</li>
            <li> Given the other reviews here speaking about high quality, I&#x27;m hoping that this was just an aberration...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about them, besides the bristles do fall out, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good product and need a quick set that will last you a few sessions, then buy this and use it!</li>
            <li> By what I can tell, they are just firm enough to maintain my powders along with my liquids but just soft enough for my face to feel comfortable to use everyday.</li>
            <li> do the same as the first but instead of using Baby shampoo I use a mixture of dish soap and virgin olive oil, the dish soap is harsh on the brushes so use the oil to condition them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them and cleaned them many times in the past few months</li>
            <li> i dont know which brush is what because there not in same order as really small packet thing that i could hardly read... would be nice to know what bruah is what</li>
            <li> They are very soft but I feel like they are a little to soft.</li>
            <li> All of these brushes are nice, and do exactly what they are supposed to, the only problem I have encountered is that the powder brush in my set keeps losing hairs while I am applying make up, not a big problem can be a tad bit annoying though.</li>
            <li> We got this Shany Cosmetic Brush Set as a Christmas Gift for out Daughter and just before wrapping it we found that the three large brushes were missing.</li>
            <li> A little too many brushes and the pouch is rather large and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft,but I am a little dissapointed in the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> At least 2 of the heads detached within the first 2 weeks or month!</li>
            <li> At the very least, I figured it would be a good secondary travel set.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are wonderful, but the bigger ones are annoying because the little hairs are always falling out.</li>
            <li> I used 4 of these brushes every single day and after about a year they started to break and became too hard to clean.</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s if you get a good set or a bad one.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t risk getting bad or good ones.</li>
            <li> Good pricing and the makeup bag isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> since I have small eyes, I need small brushes, but I think it is imperative that a good brush set include at least one blending brush, if it is to be considered a \\&quot;professional set.\\</li>
            <li> The only thing i can say bad about this is that I don&#x27;t use every brush in this set and sometimes you get little bristles that can come off but other than that these brushes are awesome.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I was a little worried since I mainly read the bad feedback more than the good ones and there were stories about it smelling, or falling apart, or having a weird powder on the brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, the fan/highlight brush is very lightweight and not very full not sure if I like that particular brush</li>
            <li> Not sure what is up with the powder, but hey as long as the product gets the job done right.</li>
            <li> My only *real* complaint is that the bristles fall out easily.</li>
            <li> Instead of storing the brushes in the provided case, I filled a small glass container with black aquarium stones and pushed the handles of the brushes in the stone.  </li>
            <li> But this brush set is extremely soft, I agree with the other reviewer you should definitely wash these brushes before using them.</li>
            <li> But it is something that you should keep in mind before making a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are softer than other brushes of the same price, but not as soft as higher-quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> wish that when I was a beginning make up artist 22 yrs ago that I had access to decent products for so little money.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The brushes are either too small or too large for properly applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> but i can definitely say that i have not had a bad expirence with these brushes and my face powder goes on pretty smoothly....</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft but could be fuller, I feel they are on the thinner side compared to some of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> it is worth your money to buy expensive, high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> but I was tired of paying so much for the high end brand brushes.</li>
            <li> the last few years, I got back into makeup as a hobby and decided to get some new brushes.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones work really well and have held together over the past 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent years using the same dinky brushes from dollar general..</li>
            <li> but it makes things red if it left somewhere for two long</li>
            <li> The smaller ones have a long flimsy cellophane-type sleeve but the bigger brushes have have a heavier plastic protector for the brush tip that could be used to reshape the brush after washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago, mainly because of the price.</li>
            <li> you need back-up brushes, or decent everyday brushes</li>
            <li> but a few of them are of decent quality.</li>
            <li> I feel like the bristles weren&#x27;t thick or strong enough save for a few.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, and there are a few that are the same just different sizes.</li>
            <li> but I do like the small slant brush to put on my eye shadow and the large brush for my foundation.</li>
            <li> and when I do it&#x27;s never much more than everyday simple make-up (unless there is a special occassion such as a wedding or something).</li>
            <li> They felt a little rough right out of the package, but after I washed and air dried them they were soft.</li>
            <li> The smaller eye makeup brushes are okay, but the large powder brushes are worthless.</li>
            <li> The actually brushes were what you would expect for reasonably-priced brushes; they were not amazing brushes but they certainly work, especially for stage makeup.</li>
            <li> use some of the other shadow brushes to practice with really bold, heavily pigmented, unusual shades of purple, blue, green, black, and so on.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this product, I would have rather invested the money spent on this brush set on a single but professional brush.</li>
            <li> you really dont know what your missing until you get it!  </li>
            <li> A fan brush, A mascara brush, you should have one foundation brush (this will be the largest of the flat paint brush looking ones)you</li>
            <li> but im concerned at how long they will last.</li>
            <li> The look like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I especially like the long handles on these brushes.</li>
            <li> all in all the long and short of it is that i would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> These brushes have lasted a long time if taken care of properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to see how long the second set lasts</li>
            <li> Also the brushes seem like they took artist paint brushes and stuck it into a collection because the brush is EXTREMELY FLAT.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling these aren&#x27;t going to last long though, as I&#x27;ve already seen a couple of hairs break off of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about how good they were, but was ultimately disappointed in their quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft enough to blend and stiff enough to shade.</li>
            <li> they were a little dusty though, so make sure to wash them before you use them.</li>
            <li> I started looking for new brushes after a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought them about four months ago and still use then everyday because they feel brand new.</li>
            <li> sort of like new paint or nail polish, I had to wait a few days before I could stand to use them.  </li>
            <li> There was a lot of dye and dirt coming off them (no surprise) and hair did also fall out, but they kept their shape well enough once dry.</li>
            <li> , i got all the pieces, and the red color is exactly as the picture shows, the pouch they come in is not good quality either, but</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m a sucker for soft brushes, and these weren&#x27;t that soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with makeup lately and really wanted a variety of different sizes for eye shadow, eye liner, and brows.</li>
            <li> but thats really the only negative.</li>
            <li> size is pretty small, and the leather case is not real</li>
            <li> Such a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a wide variety of brushes just duplicates of a couple of the same ones in a smaller size.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday, and none of them broke so far!</li>
            <li> i mean its worth the money i spent for it.</li>
            <li> I was applying my loose powder with one of the bigger brushes &amp; the hairs of it were literally shedding off onto my face.</li>
            <li> I even used the bigger brushes with loose powder and still did not work...</li>
            <li> They are not very soft, one of my brushes came bent up</li>
            <li> Is not very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they are not very soft against the skin, and they shed A LOT.</li>
            <li> Not very soft at all</li>
            <li> So currently waiting for them to dry, and then I can begin using them!</li>
            <li> only thing i would mention is it should come with a foundation brush instead of two blush brushes ( which one is labeled powder brush, and the other is blush, basically the same thing )</li>
            <li> I especially like the extreme red case I got it in!</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I did not have the money or was not willing to spend the money to invest in expensive makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The first time you wash brushes it is common for loose hairs to come out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for a single brush and this whole set is as high quality as the expensive brushes I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> and i felt some of the other brands and these are highly comparable for 75% less money</li>
            <li> I orders this set a while back and every single on is still in tact!</li>
            <li> They remind me of a high end makeup brushes that I have used in the past for years, but at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I can think of is that some (very, very few) of the hairs were loose and uneven, but those brushed off and the rest are very secure and the brushes are all thick.</li>
            <li> but I mean the brushes really fall flat against your face.</li>
            <li> I would not even let my 5 yr old  little cousin \\&quot; play dress up\\&quot; with this brush set it sucks might be good price( and not really either ) but not  quality sorry</li>
            <li> I like things a little simpler and the pouch to me just seems bulky, and hard to get into quickly.</li>
            <li> The case it comes with is nice and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as everyone says it is.</li>
            <li> I actually burned my scalp pretty badly the first time using them.</li>
            <li> Whoever wrote here that they are real and professional, you are big fail.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup collector and this brush set SUCKS SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because the brushes were cheap</li>
            <li> The red holder is clearly made of vinyl, and not nice enough that I want to bring it with me.  </li>
            <li> I had bought these brushes not to long ago</li>
            <li> , i like that they are long</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not surprised at this.</li>
            <li> to me they looked pink but they&#x27;re red</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get a set for so long</li>
            <li> They are brittle, rough, and the hairs fall out constantly.</li>
            <li> and if the next day they are still wet use a blow dryer</li>
            <li> The brushes are not soft at all.  </li>
            <li> The bezel that holds the bristles seems like it might not hold up to constant or rough application.</li>
            <li> BUT THEY ARE NOT SOFT AND</li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES ARE NOT SOFT AT ALL.</li>
            <li> They have lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m surprised I bought these a few years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no make-up artist, and only have experience with a few low to mid range quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I order pink color but a receiver red...</li>
            <li> They are really not soft and silky.</li>
            <li> some r to plastic ish and r not soft</li>
            <li> I am not a professional makeup artist, I am just beginning to learn makeup techniques.</li>
            <li> Ive had them for a long while now</li>
            <li> The brushes shed and they are not soft like they said they were going to be.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen them hold up long term and after repeated us and wash...</li>
            <li> A wide selection of different tools and was just what the gift recipient was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li> I am not a expert makeup buff but the set has a wide range of tools for various makeup applications.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for some brushes when I stumble across these ones one day.</li>
            <li> The outside case is waterproof so my brushes don&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li> i have them for so long.</li>
            <li> the hair on the bigger brushes are a bit rough.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough, and too long/flimsy to properly apply makeup.</li>
            <li> They have awkwardly long handles too for the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> Ordered them on a Wednesday and expected delivery was the following Monday, I ended up getting them on Friday!</li>
            <li> They are not professional brushes by any standards</li>
            <li> I received my brushes well packaged and earlier than the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> but, but not for long time usage.</li>
            <li> so I do not know how they hold up long term.</li>
            <li> but it  arrived a bit later than expected.</li>
            <li> They are rough and poke you occasionally.</li>
            <li> They also have black professional line that is a little more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It makes me sick to think about how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on other brushes that were noybeven half as good as my Shany brushes are.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have scrolled down and looked at the second picture- looks TOTALLY different.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were advertised and pictured as black bristles with red tips and red handles.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are not as soft as I expected (considering previous reviews).</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong for $12 but the 3 face brushes are the only useful brushes because the rest are all flat</li>
            <li> These are nothing special at all and trying to determine what all the small brushes are actually for is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Soft brushes were soft and stiff brushes were stiff.  </li>
            <li> They are not too stiff and so far no bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> I am only writing this review because I have it outside on my deck and it smells worse than a new vinyl shower curtain!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the fan brush sheds a little at first</li>
            <li> I like this brushes,  but when I started using them some of hairs in the brushes started to fall a lot and it has annoying and hard to do my make up using the brushes, and the angle brush does not work very good, I did not like it.</li>
            <li> The smell might be annoying for some, but it didn&#x27;t bother me much, wash the brushes and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Just arrived in the mail today, which is earlier than expected!  </li>
            <li> I would even purchase these brushes if they were a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> Only the 2 face brushes are usable all the other brushes I don&#x27;t even know if their concealer brushes or eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> all my other brush&#x27;s out and only use these now.  </li>
            <li> Does not apply  make up the same as my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that it would have been a big deal because I had read this on other comments</li>
            <li> I have bought several other items that, when shipped with only other Shany items, made their way to my home without delay.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not Shany&#x27;s fault, I would just recommend shipping the item seperately from other items in your cart if you are in a hurry to get it.</li>
            <li> one thing that was not okay was that the metal brush tip was only sticky back tapped to the wooden part of the brush and</li>
            <li> I would agree with the other reviews, this does smell like paint thinner when you open</li>
            <li> This is so important because when you receive the brushes they do have an odor to them, and even though they are soft at first, after washing them with hand soap the difference is outrageous.</li>
            <li> Other than the brief smell of the packaging, I have had no problems with these brushes.</li>
            <li> they actually keep intact and don&#x27;t fall apart like other brushes I have bought..</li>
            <li> However a little dab of glue and im back in buisness- not a real big issue.</li>
            <li> They were not soft!</li>
            <li> Other than that, they get the job done and last.</li>
            <li> Everything came in one piece and with no smell...except the plastic of the red bag but its nothing extreme.</li>
            <li> I would compare these brushes to much much much more expensive sets!</li>
            <li> And there are a few brushes at first glance that might look like they are the same, but there are a few slight differences.</li>
            <li> The textures of the brushes are in the middle of soft and hard like a rock.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> And definitely going to be repurchasing them again later down the road!</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t get frizzy and you can let them air dry</li>
            <li> I took the advice of others and removed from the bag and sprayed with perfume and let dry.  </li>
            <li> dry:&lt;br /&gt;You never want to dry your brushes hair up.  </li>
            <li> I washed them with shampoo and layed them out to dry.  </li>
            <li> I then washed them &amp; let them dry overnight.</li>
            <li> The hairs ended up on my face a lot then when I tried to wash them they too 3 days to dry.</li>
            <li> In fact, I went back to applying makeup with my fingers after only using these for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Well at first i was mad because i received the wrong thing, but they fixed that very quickly.  </li>
            <li> So far none of the hairs have fallen out and they don&#x27;t feel too rough or stiff.</li>
            <li> The people who say they suck must not know how to do makeup because i can do every single style of make up with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Every single time I use them (and I&#x27;ve had them for about six months now), some of the bristles end up on my face.</li>
            <li> I now use RealTechniques brushes (the Expert Face Brush and the Stippling Brush) for powder and blush and have yet to see either drop a single hair.</li>
            <li> They are soft but with my 1st use I noticed small hairs from the brush on my face.</li>
            <li> So far for the past 6 months</li>
            <li> I would love to return it, as I have not used it due to my disappointment.</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for an above average set of brushes this wouldn&#x27;t be it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the softness of the brushes, and as a poor college student who can&#x27;t currently afford to spend $100+ on makeup brushes, this will definitely do.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed</li>
            <li> Also, the brushes were quite long, longer than expected or shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> It was pretty frustrating.</li>
            <li> Bushes seem a little hard at first but they soften up.</li>
            <li> They are all way too loose for me, and do not pick up product well at all.  </li>
            <li> These brushes loose all their hairs, leaving hairs on the face and messing up the make up application.  </li>
            <li> No hairs have come loose at all.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t loose bristles.  </li>
            <li> Where the metal piece is connected to the handle is loose.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any loose strands or hairs...</li>
            <li> They WILL loose their shape</li>
            <li> After ordering this (while waiting for it to come) I saw a few reviews saying multiple things about these brushes.. that they werent soft, that when first opened there was a horrible odor, that there was white powder all over them, &amp; that I wouldnt be getting my money&#x27;s worth..</li>
            <li> The photo given by this product is not what you receive, you get two less large brushes and a few less eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> These are not high quality, but works for my needs.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use (and not even daily, because I only wear make up every few days or so) - the big brush&#x27;s bristles started to come off on my face.</li>
            <li> It has individual spots for each brush, and a I actually have a few other of my brushes that I like to bring with me when I travel shoved in there as well.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been looking at buying new brushes lately</li>
            <li> You dont even need to use brush sleeves when you put them to dry - they will not lose shape!</li>
            <li> I bought baby shampoo because I read the previous ratings, but it turned out that mine neither smelled nor had a white residue on them.</li>
            <li> Black pouch and red Brushes.</li>
            <li> Received the brushes with red handle and black plastic fibers.</li>
            <li> Such as, there are three small eyeshadow brushes, that look the same, but the others are longer and wider.</li>
            <li> They work as well if not better than more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are too small for me to use and the brushes aren&#x27;t as soft as I had expected.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve picked black or white or purple.</li>
            <li> If you look in the picture you can see where it switches from red to black.</li>
            <li> They are an odd mixed lot, I will say that.</li>
            <li> Not particularly fancy or luxurious, but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> They are the same quality as drug store brushes for less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into makeup, and I bought these brushes to compliment the E.L.F essential brushes I&#x27;d previously purchased.</li>
            <li> This was pretty disappointing considering it titled as a professional brush set.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is up to par with more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve purchased in the past..</li>
            <li> I have no use for probably half of them, but that&#x27;s totally my fault for not checking!</li>
            <li> Only recommend if you plan on not touching it especially not for make-up use.</li>
            <li> This was my first set of makeup brushes and I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Super lame...</li>
            <li> Make up brushes are usually super expensive</li>
            <li> It stinks like petroleum and really strong plastic</li>
            <li> They smell weird when you receive them, but the smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> These are seriously some high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty soft and they truly are not as bad as some of the reviews make them out to be, especially given the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles will not grab/hold on to the eyeshadow when I try using it, it simply falls off creating a mess.  </li>
            <li> Because I chose super-saver shipping that included products from other companies, it took me twice as long to receive this item.</li>
            <li> A lot of the other ones are NOT soft and make my skin feel itchy.</li>
            <li> They make a total mess when trying to apply powered makeup.</li>
            <li> So SHANYs products are reasonably priced and some are definitely good, unfortunately these are not:(.</li>
            <li> I bought this set and was very disappointed after seeing all of the great reviews it has.</li>
            <li> I use everyone of the brushes everyday and they seem brand new everyday</li>
            <li> it has every single brush that I would ever use!</li>
            <li> And the smell goes away after you wash them, and I&#x27;ve had mine for well over a month and still haven&#x27;t had a single bristle come out!</li>
            <li> The brush is not soft and feels very rough.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard and has another little brush to blend it really well.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars if the powder brush was a little bigger and the blush brush was angled.</li>
            <li> but I would still have like to have all brushes to experiment with, and in order to get a correct order I would have to send it all back, NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I realize that you get what you pay for, but I would suggest spending a little extra money if you want quality.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll ever buy for such little money</li>
            <li> If your just starting out this set comes with a little instruction manual to help you out.</li>
            <li> When I use them I have to go back with the fan brush to pick up the little hairs that are stuck to my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the brushes are a little to bushy for me personally.</li>
            <li> I instantly unwrapped my brushes looking like a little kid on Christmas.</li>
            <li> Every brush I used left little brush hairs everywhere</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is a little on the smaller side than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> The brushes have very thick bristles, not at all gentle</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the eye shadow brushes very firm which was a let down , ALL of the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> The case is a little larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> The hairs are way too soft making it hard to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Not too hard or soft, the bristles have not started falling out yet</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t too soft or too hard.</li>
            <li> My brushes are red, but I would have preferred black or some other color.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was desperately in need of new make up brushes but on a pretty tight budget.</li>
            <li> I prefer to get great brushes and horrible pouch .. then to get great pouch and horrible brushes..  </li>
            <li> is ugly to top everything off.</li>
            <li> was afraid the brushes would be cheap quality</li>
            <li> The plastic case that holds these brushes is attractive but has a terrible plastic chemical smell  that won&#x27;t air out.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that they shouldnt have put a standard eyeshaddow brush in there and mabey in place of that a blending brush.</li>
            <li> I do not even use makeup that much, just when I go out, so i did not want to buy expensive brushes, but this ones fell apart in like the second use.</li>
            <li> I used the larger power brush once and it shed at least ten hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people complained, if you want like horse fur brushes that professional makeup artists use then you should save up and buy them.</li>
            <li> The Shany ones were rough on your skin:( she also noted that they were lost of bristles falling out even after the first usage and they weren&#x27;t picking up much product.</li>
            <li> I use all of them, except the big fan brush which I have yet to discern an everyday purpose for.</li>
            <li> it does shed but that is expected.</li>
            <li> and I was rinsing off my last few brushes.</li>
            <li> not what i expected to get.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes hoping for the big fluffy fan brush</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell at all and minimal shedding.  </li>
            <li> I really do not use any of these brushes anymore, and would suggest e.l.f.</li>
            <li> What a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My case I received was a metallic green, the case itself obviously will not stay together forever</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s 12 pieces, I use it for traveling, but I could totally see someone using this as their everyday set.</li>
            <li> The wide variety of shapes covers all of your makeup needs.</li>
            <li> However, the pouch that the brushes come in has a very nasty plastic smell, and when left on a table in a warm room, left a mark on the table that I can&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> The biggest brush is not as fluffy as I have wished but still was an nine out of an ten.</li>
            <li> I spent any money on this already.  </li>
            <li> These came in just as expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;these have a majority of the brushes i was looking for but buying a few solo brushes isn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional- just an average girl trying to improve her looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After applying my powder and eyeshadow, I had to carefully pick hair after hair off of my face that had fallen out of the brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t shed nor rough.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;  -Not very durable</li>
            <li> Wide variety of eye brushes.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I like the wide range brushes.</li>
            <li> After being left out a few days the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> Some of the bigger fluffy face brushes have hair falling out</li>
            <li> THEY WERE LIKE FALLING APART AND MAKING MY JOB WAY HARDER TO BLEND MY MAKE UP.</li>
            <li> I am also careful to not get water in the ferrule so this should not have happened.</li>
            <li> I reshaped the brushes while they were wet in my hand</li>
            <li> but when I received my set I discovered that it was missing the fan brush and in its place it had two of the same eye brush.</li>
            <li> They are a bit rough on the face</li>
            <li> the heads fell off the wooden brush after just a few months though.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who does extremely basic makeup everyday, you won&#x27;t need all 13.</li>
            <li> AND I JUST SEEN THE PINK SET ...</li>
            <li> Also, there is a strange plastic smell that is obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I expected finer hair, but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> It has enough brushes for me, an everyday, not too intricate make up user.</li>
            <li> These were a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> , i thought they were pink</li>
            <li> fell apart within only a few washes.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> These were exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t even fluffy and they lose brush hairs constantly even when not in use.</li>
            <li> I also found the eye brushes to be very \\&quot;scratchy\\&quot; and irritating.</li>
            <li> They are really rough on your face.</li>
            <li> The brushes look big and all fluffy..</li>
            <li> I have really not had a chance to use this yet</li>
            <li> I gave four stars only because I received 2 duplicate brushes, so was missing one of the set.  </li>
            <li> The only thing missing is a foundation brush</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> And only 2 of them have broken so far</li>
            <li> Very crappy quality, stiff, hard.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product a week ago and already using the foundation brush i constantly find little bristles coming out of the brush and sticking to my face, not all the brushes are like this, but a few i&#x27;ve basically had to throw away due to their quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re cheap, stale, stiff, bristles fall out, they feel rough.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think the they are stiff enough and they shed,</li>
            <li> It has all the right brushes with no extraneous, weird ones.</li>
            <li> Unless you hold them up to your nose and deeply inhale, it&#x27;s not a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Also there was a strange black powder coming out of some of the brushes...</li>
            <li> hairs fall out so much and are extremely course and irritating to use on the face.</li>
            <li> This set i thought was decent until i opened the pack and started using the brushes hard and stiff not to mention it irritated my skin in that I was pokes by the bristles, and they were rough.</li>
            <li> I just tape them upside down to my mirror and let them dry that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put these brushes in my brush tree (hanging upside down) and let them dry overnight and the glue set.</li>
            <li> My fan brush didn&#x27;t look anything like the one in the photos though, it was very thin and not useful at all, and my other brushes weren&#x27;t quite as full, so don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with that.</li>
            <li> only bad thing about the make up brushes is that when you first get the package and open the box that its in, the smell of paint just hits you.</li>
            <li> At first I was nervous that the low price would mean low quality, but I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little weird, but not bad.</li>
            <li> There is a wide variety of brushes from small to big.</li>
            <li> They we not good with regular make-up/eye-shadows and the bristles would fall off after my 2nd costume!</li>
            <li> you take make-up even a little bit seriously or if you have high end</li>
            <li> I use the larger brushes less - only when I am cleaning my really expensive big brushes and waiting for them to air dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in paying a stupid amount of money for a brush (a la Sephora, I do love the store but $30 for a single eyeshadow brush?</li>
            <li> Will be looking to see what other products are in the range.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are still the same way they were, after using them excessively.</li>
            <li> I start using the other ones.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the brushes are a steal.</li>
            <li> and on some of my other brushes the brush its self would come off of the handle.</li>
            <li> to carry around with me and I&#x27;m considering trying some of their other products.</li>
            <li> recommended to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I am returning, I tried airing it out as other had suggested and the smell didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other purchases from this company.</li>
            <li> Not sure if people are getting different products</li>
            <li> Downfall is when you first receive the brushes, they have this weird smell but after a wash or so the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> Other than that, these served the it purpose.</li>
            <li> That being said, these brushes are definitely nicer than what I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Extremely flimsly, and does not collect or distibute product well.</li>
            <li> I was having to redo parts of my makeup due to picking bristles off of my face.  </li>
            <li> I spent $20 on each of them!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about buying these Shany brush set</li>
            <li> Smelled weird at first</li>
            <li> But I suppose it is due for them.</li>
            <li> I will agree with other reviewers about the smell, but the instructions say to wash the brushes before use anyway.  </li>
            <li> It may be due to the quality of the Shany eyeshadows as well.</li>
            <li> All these other brand name brushes are so over priced</li>
            <li> which was from Amazon, even though I did see a post about this product of how customers did not receive all of the brushes, so that left me feeling anxious and scared.</li>
            <li> I have used different make up brushes in the past</li>
            <li> I was just in sephora the other day</li>
            <li> plus i have a million other brushes-</li>
            <li> so im now using the other one.</li>
            <li> Once again they were a gift for my other daughter.</li>
            <li> I told my neighbor she could have the other set.</li>
            <li> im not sure what to use a lot of these for, but my guess is that i will paint my face with some of these and paint on canvas with some of the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any white powder or small some of the other reviews have mentioned</li>
            <li> In the past she has tried similar products but none to her satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Im in the process of reviewing  other cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li> Not as quality as other reviewers stated.  </li>
            <li> They are the quality of other brushes that people spend lots of money for in the mall.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Other than that they seem to be holding up well, they do not shed that I have seen.</li>
            <li> I will be checking out your other products.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were everything I expected them to be!</li>
            <li> I will look to purchase other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I have other higher-end brushes that are softer.</li>
            <li> What I will say is that, I personally find the face brush is tooooooo small, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I will stick to my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased and when using the blush brush, I was left with shedding strands on my face.  </li>
            <li> I did get my brushes, but I did not get my other package, which was a purse, and it has been paid for</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not MAC or something sold at Sephora, but then again, for the price of these 12, I probably couldn&#x27;t even get 1 brush from Smashbox or one of the other brand names.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I got my order before the stated due date.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not very soft, but stiff and plasticy.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst set of brushes I have ever purchased, but it was also the most inexpensive.</li>
            <li> After using the brushes for only a few days I have noticed a few bristles are coming out</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase a few for gifts in the next few days</li>
            <li> I use the blush brush and big fluffy brush almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Every woman buys this same set of make up tools several times a year things are broken they get lost</li>
            <li> You basically get what you pay for the metal on the brushes are sharp and will caise serious injury if your not careful</li>
            <li> I washed these after purchase, then again after use once they dried they were loose and heads start popping off the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> When I started putting powder on my face, there were bristles loose all over the brush and a few on my face.</li>
            <li> I wish there were less of the small brushes and a couple bigger ones</li>
            <li> but I apply my makeup every day and found that the bristles were very stiff and fragile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very picky, they did smell a little funky but the smell went away when you washed it.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is a little bit rough.</li>
            <li> will have two concealer brushes that look almost identical, they are not, one is slightly longer and the brush is a bit wider then the other.</li>
            <li> As other people have said, they had a slight smell, so as soon as I got them</li>
            <li> They are hard and not dense enough for powder or blush application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I unrolled the pouch, I found that each brush was wrapped in cellophane separately, and the face brushes actually come with hard plastic protectors to keep on at all times.</li>
            <li> After reading all the bad reviews i was kinda worried, then i recieved them today and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> but when she first open them them had a really bad manufacture smell.</li>
            <li> the pouch is so cheap &amp; ugly..</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the smell.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush hairs do shed.</li>
            <li> the quality is not worth it either.thanks for the scam</li>
            <li> These are of average quality.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be there is no explanation of what each brush is used for.  </li>
            <li> I am in no way an expert of makeup products, but how this brush set has an average rating of 4 stars baffles me.</li>
            <li> They look very sleek and somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I wish these were labled with the brush number.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing i can say is the eyebrow brush/</li>
            <li> in all, these brushes are not worth your money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the stinky leather roll they come in.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not worth $12.</li>
            <li> i received this product about 1 month ago and so far, there is no sheeding at all, and none have broken or have any damage watsoever.</li>
            <li> The brushes shed a lot and aren&#x27;t good quality, plus they smelled terrible for a couple of weeks after I opened the package.</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely good quality, which is shocking for the price !</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected that....don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought brush set with much less variety at my local drug stores that end up being hard and the bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> price isnt so bad either ;)&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
            <li> I did have to throw away the fan brush since it was impossible to shape and the bristles kept bending all over the place (who uses fan brushes anyway?), and most importantly (to me, at least) there is NO BLENDING BRUSH.  </li>
            <li> I broke down and paid for the ECO brush</li>
            <li> Because any water residue will drip down into the brush and loosen the glue holding the hairs.  </li>
            <li> the one thing i did notice is that the purpose for each brush  could be stamped going down on each pocket inside the brush bag.</li>
            <li> One month down with X3 per week use</li>
            <li> I use the 5 or 9 to blend all my eye shadow together to soften down the darker crease color for daytime and blend the colors together.</li>
            <li> but none of my other brushes do that!</li>
            <li> once I put other brushes in it!</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try out some of shan&#x27;t other makeup products!  </li>
            <li> The eye brushes are also very thin and don&#x27;t apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Shany 120 palette to go with these brushes and the brushes only pick up the highly pigmented colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fan brush and eyebrow brush really are quite pathetic.</li>
            <li> I compared them to my MAC and few other brushes I possess</li>
            <li> Also, like a few other reviews said, the brushes are not labeled, so you have to decide how to use them or ask someone who knows.</li>
            <li> Today alone i had At least 5 little hairs from the brushes left over on my face...</li>
            <li> I have these mixed in with expensive brushes and I use them both the same.</li>
            <li> The black metal part of the brow brush BROKE OFF.</li>
            <li> My previous were chanel brushes and the hairs</li>
            <li> i am a black kinda guy (not skin tone) and all my make up brushes are black</li>
            <li> The bristles are all black.  </li>
            <li> but it is not a big deal because it stopped before it became a serious problem.</li>
            <li> I have typically used brushes from mark, Ulta, DHC and Sonia Kashuk for Target...</li>
            <li> For a lot less money.</li>
            <li> and i have now lost the usage of half of my brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes shed less than my previous brushes.</li>
            <li> There was a slight paint smell coming from the bag, but it went away after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about the smell that had been mentioned by previous reviews, and mine don&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> I mean when I use the big brush for my finishing powder- the little brush hairs fall on my face.  </li>
            <li> I like them a lot less.</li>
            <li> I did get the brown ones that were shown (although I wish I had gotten black).</li>
            <li> The case still has a slight odor to it, but it doesnt bother me &amp; I will use it for travel.</li>
            <li> but this was a steal during Black Friday sales.</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes less then 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a slight scratch to the bristles</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re rough and bristly, shed like crazy, and don&#x27;t pick up much product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work on my less pigmented, neutral colors.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odor to the carry case, but I am assuming it will wear off.  </li>
            <li> The bristles in mine were actually black which I prefer-</li>
            <li> For the price, I was not even expecting half of the quality I received.  </li>
            <li> There is another set that comes in a purple pouch and has, I believe, black hair brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got these brushes when I first became interested in Make up, when they came they smell awful like melted chemical plastic.</li>
            <li> I lost half of my brushes because the glue would dissipate</li>
            <li> I apply less makeup than before</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes are not very soft or thick but they do hold the makeup well</li>
            <li> Nothing bad but nothing special.</li>
            <li> It is very practical to have a lot of different brushes, but I got sick of how scratchy they were.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional in makeup in the least</li>
            <li> The larger brushes are not great quality, they don&#x27;t spread the blush powder and face powder around as easily as other brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> When I opened this product, I found that the pouch was tightly rolled up, tied, and placed in a cellophane wrapper.</li>
            <li> Also, there was only a faint smell coming from these brushes and I have had more expensive brushes that smell much MUCH worse.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> An easy fix, but annoying nonetheless.</li>
            <li> My face feels less cakey and my makeup doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy.</li>
            <li> The brushes have really long handles, but that is just a weird personal preference.</li>
            <li> and I was a little upset by the quality.</li>
            <li> , I was a little scared about ordering makeup brushes online for the fear that they&#x27;d be used.  </li>
            <li> I didnt notice that odor people said they did, i did smell it when i sniffed the little case for the brushes</li>
            <li> handle instead of on the little info sheet enclosed.</li>
            <li> The little sponge on the blending brush had come off completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little cautious about buying them because I was under the impression</li>
            <li> I wash them all the time and little to none of the bristles come out.</li>
            <li> I was using the little applicators that come with eyeshadow kits, and they have nothing on these brushes.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little softer.</li>
            <li> if you use the eye crease brush, the edges are a little bit pokey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a little over a week, using them every day, and when I stand up from doing my makeup, I am covered in little brush hairs</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little softer to the touch</li>
            <li> As soon as I was applying make up the little bristles were coming out.</li>
            <li> Brush case is a little stinky but</li>
            <li> It has every brush you&#x27;d ever need, and a neat little packet telling you what each brush is and what it is for.</li>
            <li> The only brush I don&#x27;t like is the fan brush - it&#x27;s totally weak and doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> and they scratch a little, but for the money, I&#x27;ll bear it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes shed a little, but they still work.</li>
            <li> lots of little hairs come off the brush for a while.  </li>
            <li> When I am done putting on my makeup there are little hairs all over my face.</li>
            <li> Little to no fall out on the brushes.</li>
            <li> I was just so disappointed considering how excited i was to get the brushes.</li>
            <li> The case they come in is a little tacky.</li>
            <li> They could be a little softer, but they are made out of goat and badger hair...</li>
            <li> This was a little gift I added to a sack of household gifts I had for her....</li>
            <li> The brushes shed a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT worth your money at all!</li>
            <li> , none of the little hairs have fallen off either.</li>
            <li> I bought these a little over a yr ago.</li>
            <li> The brushes stink a little.</li>
            <li> But the red case it comes in sucks!</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t complained about the hairs coming loose, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m scared to see what may happen when I try to clean them. :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a couple months of use all the brushes she uses regularly are loose.</li>
            <li> The make-up brushes are a little to harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disgusted by how much black crud dripped into my sink from brand new brushes.  </li>
            <li> I recently spent much more on a set of \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brushes and was very disappointed at how stiff the bristles were.</li>
            <li> The powder brush from this collection is very scratchy, and it shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> I had read that a few people were complaning about the smell.</li>
            <li> I had them within a few days.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> It is missing the foundation brush which is one of the brushes I was looking forward to.</li>
            <li> Thinking I was saving a few dollars for nices brushes then going to costco for there set..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned these brushes for a few months.</li>
            <li> feels like i wasted my money</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> But the smell went away after a few hours of exposing it to air.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes everyday.</li>
            <li> i kinda feel like it was a waste of money considering all that has happened over time with these brushes.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use the tops just popped off.</li>
            <li> Bristles tend to splay out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> brush tops are not secure and fall off</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d waste my money on these again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this brush set.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your make up look heavy.</li>
            <li> For everyday use, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> These products are WAY too harsh, and they will strip your bristles.</li>
            <li> And its gone in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday.  </li>
            <li> The brisels are falling off or are left behind on the face when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago to have them fall apart already.  </li>
            <li> I found the brushes worked quite well in helping me to apply my make-up, both for everyday use</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The fan brush is falling apart, and a pencil brush and blender brush are mysteriously missing.</li>
            <li> and they dried deformed.    </li>
            <li> and i use them everyday.</li>
            <li> These create lines and makes your makeup uneven</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is not the product to purchase for everyday use--the brushes will fall apart or not function as intended.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product before reading the reviews and thought I had wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Ive had them for a year now, and only two of them have broken...</li>
            <li> , I use them everyday, today one broke</li>
            <li> I have trouble using these brushes with out having to pick the brush off my face.</li>
            <li> What concerns me is the heavy petroleum vapors that are coming off the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used brushes that feel harsh on my face and it almost hurts to put shadow/liner on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are so harsh on the skin and they shed everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have recommended a few people to order these.</li>
            <li> The smell went away after a few days, though.</li>
            <li> I got tired of using those tiny disposable spongy applicators,so perhaps thats</li>
            <li> but like their not cheaply made and they use goat hair.  </li>
            <li> After they dried they weren&#x27;t like they were from the start</li>
            <li> The face brush looses a few hairs now and again</li>
            <li> And I use them everyday.  </li>
            <li> I checked reviews on the palette that gushed about the pigmentation and began to get confused as to why I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results when I did my makeup.</li>
            <li> my daughter uses everyday she luvs them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They literally hurt my skin when applying my make up because the ends of the bristles are so harsh that it feels like I&#x27;m poking myself.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of $15.00</li>
            <li> Manu brush, but Still missing some.</li>
            <li> The bristles firmly attached to the ferrule.</li>
            <li> One of my cosmetic brushes is missing from my case.</li>
            <li> Not worth $12.are also all too small to be usable.</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars because the few brushes I do use...I like; however, not that its the product fault but mine.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money</li>
            <li> I did not get an eyebrow brush, one of those foam brushes pictured, the thin brush, and the standard sized brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it was missing another brush.</li>
            <li> I just figured after a few uses they would loosen a lil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well, the brushes are fluffy</li>
            <li> I had to air them out for a few days before I used them.</li>
            <li> Waste of even a cent.</li>
            <li> Use them everyday ❤</li>
            <li> i used them almost everyday</li>
            <li> I have had them for a few years now and some of the glue is coming undone</li>
            <li> i had a few hairs shed off but</li>
            <li> I use the brushes everyday sme</li>
            <li> brushes shed after a few uses</li>
            <li> I totally wasted almost $75 on this product.</li>
            <li> After a few uses some of my brushes broke.</li>
            <li> I got it as a &amp;#34;Today&#x27;s Deals&amp;#34; deal a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I checked reviews on the palette that gushed about the pigmentation and began to get confused as to why I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results when I did my makeup.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of these brushes..if i could return it</li>
            <li> some of the brushes in my set are a little to stiff and idk</li>
            <li> They are very rough on the skin!!</li>
            <li> 1 Red and 1 Black!!!!   </li>
            <li> I did was the brushes right away, as you should, and they didn&#x27;t smell bad at all when received as indicated in some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Many of the other reviews said the products smelled horribly</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you open the pouch one of the first things you notice is what is that horrible smell?</li>
            <li> The brushes work very well and for this price can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> I am not a professional so some of the brushes I am a little confused on.</li>
            <li> Oh and there was no fowl smell that some other reviewers complained about.</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t as stiff as I&#x27;d like them, but they&#x27;ll work.  </li>
            <li> Brushes got stiff and made my face look &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The bristles are a too stiff.</li>
            <li> The lip brush and eyebrow brushes are a bit too stiff.</li>
            <li> artist).&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are stiff,</li>
            <li> I find it inhumane to make a product with actual real animal fur!</li>
            <li> and it had been awhile since I bought them so it is too late to return them, I had little black hairs all over my face from these things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be covered with small fibers, as if I had just cut my bangs and let the little hairs land where they may.  </li>
            <li> I dont use a couple of the brushes because theyre a little pointless</li>
            <li> number of brushes is a little excessive though.</li>
            <li> The prize was very reasonable and the quality of the brushes isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived as requested, but the case stinks to high heaven.</li>
            <li> The only bad things are that they came with two of the same brush and they need a little bit of shaping every so often.</li>
            <li> 5 out of 13 is pretty bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for the past 3 months, and they never cease to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Ugh..i really am disappointed I wish I had saved up my money and invested in a brand that is worth the hype.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make sense with how little make up I wear to get a big expensive set.</li>
            <li> case is a little big and cheesy, but you don&#x27;t have to keep them in there</li>
            <li> the box was all scraped up they looked like I was regifting... and they where not very nice.. and the bristles where not sofy at all</li>
            <li> but when i got the burshes i was sorely disappointed the two burshed to the right of the pic</li>
            <li> color of the brushes are misleading, it comes in an ugly red bag and the brushes are red but they work well.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it.</li>
            <li> These brushes very thin and not very dense, which is expected at this price</li>
            <li> I am very particular when it comes to smells and the smell was not as atrocious or bothersome as some made it out to be.</li>
            <li> and I cannot seem to put it down!!</li>
            <li> There was very little shedding if any.</li>
            <li> Very little fall out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything bad about them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what I was using before I bought these.</li>
            <li> Several of them have actually broken off the handle while I was applying my makeup!</li>
            <li> when you use them on your face the small hairs fall off</li>
            <li> The fan brush came messed up; shaped weird and such.</li>
            <li> Not cheap!</li>
            <li> The small ones did not shed.  </li>
            <li> The sponge brush, which I began to use to help with contouring, fell apart after 3 uses, and I was unable to put it back together.</li>
            <li> Brushes are so expensive nowadays that you can pay this amount for only one brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to glue some back together, others were useless anyway</li>
            <li> The the lash comb/brow brush tool was pointless.  </li>
            <li> Anxious to try them all.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are small and brittle.</li>
            <li> , however i didn&#x27;t use the case(brushes are worth the crap case)</li>
            <li> bought these for my granddaughter for her birthday this past august.  </li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable for the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for one of my children, and according to my daughter-she&#x27;s not pleased</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> way:&lt;br /&gt;Get a small plate and poor some Johnsons Baby shampoo into it then get your brush wet and swirl it around.  </li>
            <li> There is an extremely weird powder on these brushes when you open them.</li>
            <li> When I took the brushes out of the cellophane wrappers and ran my fingers through the bristles, this weird, gross smelling powder went flying into the air.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these; we use them for photographic preparation and dust removal, when photographing still life shots of products like jewelry and small sculpture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve heard people referencing because I don&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> &amp; I still use them everyday!</li>
            <li> So, I usually just guess on which one to use from my pouch......</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Overall, I dont think you will be disappointed, give them a try, save the big bucks for makeup.</li>
            <li> Brushes remain intact, unlike others she has used in the past which have lost lots of bristles.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> These do have a bit of a smell, but its not something excessive.  </li>
            <li> NOT better than MAC products but will do.</li>
            <li> i use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Anxious to use them.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on my blending techniques and these brushes took me from amateur to pro the moment they arrived.</li>
            <li> Small definer liner/lip brush-</li>
            <li> Small powder/blush brush-</li>
            <li> The brushes are also all too small to be usable.</li>
            <li> Also, there are 17 brushes pictured in the online image, but you only get 12 seemingly random brushes.</li>
            <li> In the past I used ecotools.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> They come with brushes that would usually cost $24 for one.</li>
            <li> I usually use department store type brushes (sable).  </li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> i seriously put my makeup on in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Small shadow brush</li>
            <li> Its such poor quality!</li>
            <li> but i was disappointed when open it gave offf a strong smell like plastic of paint smell really bad and</li>
            <li> it is red, flimsy and ugly plus it has these very long cumbersome strings</li>
            <li> The brushes are somewhat hard which makes it difficult to apply blushes and foundation and some of the bristles come off on your face if you apply it too hard which is a real turn off and frustrating.</li>
            <li> but the only thing bad about it is that they do loose a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> but frankly I&#x27;ve found very few that don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes were very thin and didn&#x27;t have a lot of fibers in the head.  </li>
            <li> I like make up brands like urban decay, tarte, benefit, these brushes are very thin and do not work well for me.  </li>
            <li> case is a little tacky and cheap in my opinion, but it isn&#x27;t horrible either.  </li>
            <li> My brushes also tend to get a little dirty, so the case will definitely help prevent that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other brushes and I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this before.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible, cheap, harsh brushes to use on your face.</li>
            <li> not very good quiality and do not look at all like the ones in the picture</li>
            <li> the handles are too long and make it difficult to maneuver.....</li>
            <li> However, after a month using the brushes, I noticed the bristles started coming off:(((  Very disappointed...that should not have happened.  </li>
            <li> aww!i hate the color so much!</li>
            <li> I hate the ugly cheap, tacky red case it comes in.</li>
            <li> Only one star but deserves NONE, the brushes are cheesy and poorly made, also harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> brushes are VERY VERY stiff.</li>
            <li> Over half have broken.  </li>
            <li> Although I got a weird green color pouch, I guess that&#x27;s not very important...</li>
            <li> When I recieved the shany set, the fan brush had weird clumps in the bristles and there were loose hairs all over the place.</li>
            <li> on one of the brushes the hairs had so kinda hard thing on it</li>
            <li> Bissell are hard and itchy</li>
            <li> The eyelash/eyebrow brush never worked well, it hardly made a difference.</li>
            <li> but hardly any</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are too hard and dont hold eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to wash the make up off the brushes.</li>
            <li> but all in all still working hard and nothing has fallen apart yet.</li>
            <li> A lot of shedding, it&#x27;s hard on face.</li>
            <li> Makes it REALLY hard to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bristles are hard synthetic fibers.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are hard and don&#x27;t pick up powder.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s been months and the shedding is quite a bit, when used they leave broken off little pieces of bristles on the face.</li>
            <li> To me the brushes are a little thin and they smell like spray paint.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment is the brow brush, it seems like \\&quot;melted\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> Within just a few weeks (but after the time for return) the brush tips all started to come away like the glue went bad to the wooden part of their handles.  </li>
            <li> I am a fanatic about softness on my face and this set exceeed my every expectation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of negative reviews here</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews &amp; didn want to buy the brushes</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teenage niece who is crazy over hair &amp; makeup.  </li>
            <li> i was afraid if the quality of these brushes was low...</li>
            <li> Obviously not as nice as the department store ones</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is a bit of shedding, however for the price it is somewhat expected.</li>
            <li> I get at least 2 bristles falling out every time.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t pay any attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Considering that at her age, EVERYTHING seems to warrant a complaint these days.  </li>
            <li> I must say all the reviews are directed in a negative way.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for quite a while now, and i can&#x27;t find one negative thing to say about them.</li>
            <li> They are not amazing</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve bought a few (expensive) brushes from Sephora and their bristles are really stiff and sometimes irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft yet very firm at the base</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered my brushes online, usually I buy in store to check quality, but I am thoroughly satisifed with the quality and price!</li>
            <li> And what I mean by fall apart-</li>
            <li> I mean in your drawers</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s usually a bunch that I don&#x27;t know what to do with!).</li>
            <li> You actually end up blending the unwanted spects into your foundation (talking about being mad).</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes really excited and am now very disappointed the bristles are coming apart in my make-up and on my face!</li>
            <li> ill be checking out some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I ever wasted my money on!!</li>
            <li> WASTE of money!!</li>
            <li> Ill buy my make up with them instead of Mac or other make up..</li>
            <li> I was very anxious to get this product.</li>
            <li> But seriously???</li>
            <li> Seriously, prepare yourself!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because I feel it unfair to give a product five stars without any previous reference or comparison.</li>
            <li> When I did open the box, the pouch and the brushes smelled horrific like it smelled like a open can of paint.</li>
            <li> I seriously do want make up</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot do a return because I&#x27;m not sure if a new one would make it here by christmas. :(</li>
            <li> They had a little bit of a weird smell (maybe the plastic purse they come in)</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because it isn&#x27;t a known brand</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I ordered these on a whim</li>
            <li> A little weird that they are made with badger and goat hair.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re not very ideal for traveling, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say is some of the brushes don&#x27;t hold the eye-shadow on it</li>
            <li> Yeah well, it smelled so bad after I opened the package that I had to put it outside to air out.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY bad thing for me personaly, was the color.</li>
            <li> I have 2 brushes missing and the one I got are just useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really good for bronzing.    </li>
            <li> This was not a good product.</li>
            <li> I have never had a brush set in my life, just a few random brushes that came with makeup.</li>
            <li> Not good for shading.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, even if they aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> I guess what i&#x27;m trying to say is I like the small brushes but hate the big ones</li>
            <li> Terrible quality, threw them in the garbage right after I bought them.</li>
            <li> It is made of thin, black plastic held together by very poor stitching.  </li>
            <li> For this price, its hard to beat!</li>
            <li> but they were a bit hard &amp; would poke me when i would apply my makeup!</li>
            <li> Cheap ugly crap.</li>
            <li> E.L.F.&#x27;s studio brushes look like superstars next to this set. :(  </li>
            <li> The worst thing ever, first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks and NEVER buy it!</li>
            <li> The pouch was pretty but the brushes were horrible .</li>
            <li> I found some pretty awful brushes that discouraged me.</li>
            <li> I did notice a faint plastic smell, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN!!!!</li>
            <li> A WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED DOLLARS!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit tough, but where it counts it works.</li>
            <li> But I WAS expecting, at the very least, for these brushes to be durable.</li>
            <li> They shed like crazy and leave little hairs/bristles all over my face.</li>
            <li> The brushes are to weak and sloppy.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical about purchasing them because some people complained about really bad odor.the ibrushes do give off an outdoor, but not as intolerable as some people complained.</li>
            <li> this is a very big thing for me as i hate brushes that shed&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely could not stand the smell and now have the worst headache ever from whatever chemical was thrown onto these brushes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet used the brushes, but was disappointment to noticed I was missing a brush.</li>
            <li> I hate to see all these knocks on the smell when it is obviously stated by the vendor to wash these before use.  </li>
            <li> poorly made product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be just as annoyed as I am when you have to return them.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not great either.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The are a bit thin.</li>
            <li> These are much worse than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive and when it did I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was poor quality and the case the brushes came in, was torn.</li>
            <li> The worse brush set ever.</li>
            <li> The fan brush is so so thin it is unusable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get these, they are poor quality.</li>
            <li> Hey gals, if you are tired of using your fingers to apply makeup these are the brushes for you.  </li>
            <li> So thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li> these brushes shed worse than my husky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really frustrating when you&#x27;re trying to apply your makeup &amp; the brush heads keep falling off.</li>
            <li> I was so annoyed because the material was sticking and ruining my foundation.</li>
            <li> The brushes are poor quality.</li>
            <li> the hair of the  brushes fall out while putting on my makeup, its frustrating at times.</li>
            <li> Just not happy.</li>
            <li> The pouch is a big plus for me because I hate leaving my brushes out for anything to get on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really confused, I bought these brushes before reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> They do leave behind some stray hairs</li>
            <li> Poor quality but what can you expect for the price.</li>
            <li> &quot; as everyone has said in poor reviews.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t blend terribly well either, but the bristle thing really chaps my hide.</li>
            <li> These brushes are poor in quality and shed as well.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> so sorry i wasted my money!!</li>
            <li> Well even if they are, they are extremely stiff and I am really afraid to even try to apply my makeup with it.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said they smelled bad</li>
            <li> The smell was not as bad as i anticipated by reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes are so expensive its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed that It didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> When I ordered them I was worried because I saw complaints of a bad smell, they so smell slightly like plastic and hair, but I imagine anything made of plastic and hair would.</li>
            <li> Worst brushes ever, not soft , they scrach my face, I was shocked when I opened the pachage because some of them didn&#x27;t even have enough hair !!!!</li>
            <li> All the eyeshadow brushes are stiff and impossible to pick up any color.</li>
            <li> I dont know why there is alot of bad reviews on this product i ordered this a few months ago</li>
            <li> Before trying these, I brought generic brushes from Walmart and absolutely hated how my makeup looked.</li>
            <li> But I should have just kept my old set because these brushes are of horrible quality.</li>
            <li> Gave them to my four year old to play with... Terrible product</li>
            <li> I saw bad reviews about how stiff they were but</li>
            <li> but when I got it I was missing 3 brushes :(</li>
            <li> my only real complaint was the GOD AWFUL SMELL from the carrier wrap.</li>
            <li> I hate the shedding it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an alternative to expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> ; Is that weird?</li>
            <li> They will merely serve as my backup...</li>
            <li> its sent to you randomly.</li>
            <li> but sadly it was not in this kit however the fan brush included</li>
            <li> THIS IS WRONG.  </li>
            <li> I bought these brushes despite the terrible reviews, because I always think that people are too critical.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> They all smell weird.</li>
            <li> and it made my brush  useless.</li>
            <li> So dont be confused!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by these brushes at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> Really sad.</li>
            <li> The teeth on the eyelash comb were melted together, rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these if you want something for traveling that isn&#x27;t too expensive. ^^</li>
            <li> &quot; I use and have always used baby shampoo on my brushes, even my expensive ones.</li>
            <li> guess since i just received them ill see how they hold up with time.</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t feel like expensive quality but the job gets done.</li>
            <li> I was sad to have two concealer brushes and no foundation brush</li>
            <li> I read multiple complaints that they smelled awful, and that people had to wash them out before using them.</li>
            <li> but it does not have all the brushes I need unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The bag they come in is a bit absurd.</li>
            <li> But needless to say there is no way we will now, and we will pass the word along.</li>
            <li> Musty weird smell.</li>
            <li> I do have some expensive brushes &amp;</li>
            <li> I thought about buying these for myself, but decided against it because I was afraid they would be poor quality.</li>
            <li> actually it smells terribly...</li>
            <li> Had a weird smell to them.</li>
            <li> I must say,l was skeptical when I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> These brushes are horrible I only used them for Halloween make-up to mix liquid latex and body paint and stage blood etc.</li>
            <li> They had a weird smell from the packaging, plasticy</li>
            <li> After 6 months they were useless.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t so overpowering like some people exaggerated.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a starter looking for a brush kit, start with this to be ahead of the game in techniques and looks!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re considering investing in a really expensive, luxury-brand brush set</li>
            <li> Sorry I cant provide any details about the product but at this price its not a gamble.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Im so angry with you.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that they would come with a weird smell like some people had reported having.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not initmidated by any expensive brush company with my Shany brush set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time applying my make-up...</li>
            <li> the brushes work well, but it smells weird even after washing the brushes..</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> This is a weird assortment of brushes.  </li>
            <li> If you are a casual user just wanting a set of brushes</li>
            <li> They are very poor quality and the fibers fall out on your face while you&#x27;re trying to use them.</li>
            <li> Moreover The brushes shed and Have very  thin bristles.</li>
            <li> Plus theres a horrible smell and the handles came loose</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, but from the other reviews I guess it&#x27;s luck of the draw.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how the brushes gets rough and nasty.</li>
            <li> I previously had some drug store brushes that i hated!</li>
            <li> Some reviews say that they smell REALLY bad, I DIDNT notice a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Disappointing purchase all around.    </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing.  </li>
            <li> just so disappointing--</li>
            <li> The brushes looked dirty and the bristles are falling out.</li>
            <li> was afraid the hairs would fall out -</li>
            <li> was afraid the brushes would feel prickly against my skin -</li>
            <li> The smell started to fade after I washed them a couple times, but every time I wash them they shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> just so disappointing--</li>
            <li> Extremely annoying and poorly made.</li>
            <li> Mad</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price but, decided to purchase after reading the reviews!</li>
            <li> I know make up brushes can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> I mean I can&#x27;t even describe it except it gave me the worst headache...</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes have about 25 bristles in them making it impossible to hold any eye shadow on the brush.</li>
            <li> The seems were sewn together VERY sloppy, and some of the sections that divide the brushes appeared to not have been sewn shut at all!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say they were bad enougj for a four star rating</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t risk getting the bad ones.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews saying that they smelled bad, but I haven&#x27;t had this problem.</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the bad reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> But not everything was bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had brushes shed so badly.  </li>
            <li> but if they still smell this bad (yes the brush hairs also smell)</li>
            <li> i was hoping sososo bad</li>

            <li> These brushes are really bad quality I don&#x27;t like it @</li>
            <li> but its smell is bad.</li>
            <li> , however I don&#x27;t think the smell was that bad.</li>
            <li> Dont listen to the bad reviews</li>
            <li> When they came out of the box, they did indeed have a smell, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> and they dnt smell as bad as sme reviewers had said..</li>

            <li> I was disappointed about this, but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of exchanging them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was surprised, these are good brushes. I have these mixed in with expensive brushes and I use them both the same.</li>
            <li> More than what I expected. Easy to clean. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an alternative to expensive brushes.  I read the reviews and decided to order.  I am seriously in love with these brushes!  I am used to very high quality bushes and these by far exceeded my expectations!  The case is great,the brushes are soft and non shedding, They apply makeup great!  They are made out of real hair (badger and goat)  I will buying these brushes from now on.  I am a customer for life!  I&#x27;m not sure why people left any kind of review other than 5 stars!  A+++</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are made of goat hair which means they apply better than the cheap brushes u buy out the store( some) i needed new make-up brushes and didnt have new money so this was a excellent buy! very happy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know jack about this product personally. Bought it as a gift and the person loved it. End of the story.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. Shipped sooner than I expected, they were packaged wonderfully and I love the variety of brushes it comes with. Super great quality for your buck.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product some time ago and I love it. Not only are you getting some really good brushes but you get them at a great price. Every brush you could want is included in this set plus a roll case to keep them in. I would recommend this to anyone. You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune for quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I have 2 brushes missing and the one I got are just useless. They shed like crazy! Made in china-enough said.</li>
            <li> Very nice set lots of shapes and sizes plenty to choose from for different uses. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes and they are the best brushes I have ever used!!!! HANDS DOWN!!!! They are firm and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like many other brushes I have owned.... They come in a  I am definitely looking at their makeup line now to see how well those products work. I am buying a set of these for all my sisters and my mom as well....</li>
            <li> To be quite honest I&#x27;ve always been a bit of a Tomboy in nature, you know, legos, Brio trains, and mud for me as a little girl. As I got older I was introduced to the wonders of the bra and shorn legs...yay. I digress, I recently have become smitten with makeup. It&#x27;s relaxing and a great method for de-stressing or just getting out of your own mind for a moment. Everyone has a routine they follow and favorite eyeshadows, lipsticks, and mascaras they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of brushes has found itself completely integrated into my daily routine. I use all of them, except the big fan brush which I have yet to discern an everyday purpose for. Hey, full disclosure right? Anyways, when I opened the box and saw the candy apple red sheath which, when unrolled, gave me a glimpse into heaven. I&#x27;m not being dramatic, I love this set of brushes. I&#x27;m not really sure what I was using before I bought these. Twigs? Leaves? Whatever it was it had no chance when put up against this set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely be perusing amazon and the Shany cosmentics webpage for more steals and deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
            <li> They are the best I had in a long, long time. They are really smooth and easy to clean. Like them a lot.</li>
            <li> The brushes are sturdy and a value for the price however the foundation brush tends to shed a bit during use.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for the price.  Case is soft and flexible, easy to travel with.  Would buy again for myself or gift.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago, mainly because of the price. I didn&#x27;t expect much, but for the number of brushes and the price, I figured I would try them. Turns out, they&#x27;re GREAT brushes! The set has nice long handles, so they&#x27;re easy to hold and use. I washed them first, and no bristles came out during the next uses. The brushes themselves are soft yet stiff, and they don&#x27;t require you to mash into your make up to get the right amount to apply. For people learning to do their makeup or are overwhelmed with the number of brushes, the set comes with an instruction sheet and all the brushes are numbered, so it&#x27;s an easy reference guide!</li>
            <li> very nice. the product is very nice to touch . the strands of hair are nice and it is worth the money</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They make putting on make up so much easier, and it stays where I put it. I had read that a few people were complaning about the smell. Mine never had a smell at all to them. The traveling bag they come in is nice too. Each brush has a spot. Shipping was really fast as well. I had them within a few days. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Gave the brushes to my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;She hasn&#x27;t said if she like them or not, but I supposed she does.</li>
            <li> Yes these brushes are high quality. I like the deep red colour they come in and the pouch. The inky reason am giving it a 4 out of 5 is a wish there was a Niger brush in the set to apply make-up. But the brushes for your eye shadow&lt;br /&gt;And lips are amazing</li>
            <li> I am loving my brushes.  Love the holder. They are perfect for my needs!  I roll them out and get my makeup done...roll them right back up and they store away easily!  :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes, they are incredibly soft and work so well with all eyeshadows&lt;br /&gt;i am honestly very satisfied, these brushes are amazing and the price is even better, this is a definite must have for any beginner or even someone who is more advanced, you can never have enough brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They DO NOT shed at all! this is a very big thing for me as i hate brushes that shed&lt;br /&gt;They are VERY soft, so beautiful feeling on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i would mention is it should come with a foundation brush instead of two blush brushes ( which one is labeled powder brush, and the other is blush, basically the same thing )&lt;br /&gt;and the spooly brush really isn&#x27;t that great for the brows, the brush is too large for anyones brows i would think, the comb part is also large as well but its not useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend anyone to get this set, its great! don&#x27;t even hesitate!</li>
            <li> i like this set a lot. it does shed but that is expected. This is definitely a nice starter set.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Good quality. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the brushes. I expected more quality. The brushes began shedding and falling apart soon after I received them. I read reviews that said these brushes were great and I was a little upset by the quality.</li>
            <li> I never used any Shany Products,Iv seen these for awhile now and wanted to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;I give 4 stars because,I do like it. i think its a good beginners set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like all the brushes, Not the biggest fan of Number 6 or 8 only because the hair did fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that i think they are good. nice price as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was very nice! received it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The Pouch is very nice and professional.</li>
            <li> Really good quality product for the price.  Love the choice of brushes and the case is lovely. Will be looking to see what other products are in the range.</li>
            <li> Buy one brush at a store for the same cost of these 12, you can really do anything with these and make sure to have a large variety of colors too. They last a long time and dont break easily.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much. It was exactly what it said and advertised. The hairs were so soft! Ordered 3 sets as gifts and they loved it!</li>
            <li> Good amount of shedding!!! Purchased these brushes because felt like I needed to upgrade my collection of brushes at the time...(\\&quot;I had them for years\\&quot;)... These looked and sounded good on reviews so gave them a try. With first applications they were good,  but now it&#x27;s been months and the shedding is quite a bit, when used they leave broken off little pieces of bristles on the face. I currently have invested in a better quality of make up brushes and have given these to my teenage daughter. The eye brushes from this kit are however pretty good for eye make up applications... Tip: wash before use!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve never had so many quality professional brushes before at such a low price!</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice and they work very well.I would recommended them for others to use.Although I got a weird green color pouch, I guess that&#x27;s not very important...</li>
            <li> Great product. Would defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like them overall especially for the price.The only complaint is that they shouldnt have put a standard eyeshaddow brush in there and mabey in place of that a blending brush.But everything is just great, no hair loss on the brushes,easy to use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes. I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Cheap product,  doesn&#x27;t blend in make up</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived on the exact date I was told it would come.  It came in appropriate packaging.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was a little scared about ordering makeup brushes online for the fear that they&#x27;d be used.  Def not the case here.  Th red case filled with brushes came wrapped in plastic and each individual brush came plastic wrapped and had brush covers for the bigger brushes.  The case seems even to be made out of a quality product. Of course I would have liked to have a case that zipped instead of tied, but for a person who is just starting to play around with makeup, this is great!    All in all, very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Nice brush set for the price.  Pouch rolls up nicely too!</li>
            <li> Got this about a year ago. All the brushes are still the same way they were, after using them excessively. No hairs falling out after time. However, the wood part does scratch, but I guess thats normal.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these brushes. They are pretty good for being inexpensive. Her dog chewed them up pretty soon after getting them though, so she doesn&#x27;t have much idea about longevity. They did not stand up to the teeth of an 80lb. dog very well though. LOL</li>
            <li> All of these tickled my nose quite well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, and I am very impressed with how fluffy, soft the brush is. These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used, and they &#x27;re literally very cheap for such a great product. I would totally recommend this for beginners, cause it&#x27;s a set with all the brushes you&#x27;ll need. GREAT product, love this! :D</li>
            <li> 5 stars. She loves it, but she readily says she really only uses 4 or 5 tools in the kit, but she doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the look and construction of them. They seem like a good kit and come in a lovely tool pouch that roll&#x27;s up.</li>
            <li> For the price of these brushes I am SO GLAD I got them. They are great and work great with my makeup. They are also really super for making some unique looks!</li>
            <li> I really like this! I have to admit, there was a smell to it. Oddly enough though, I like it ^^; Is that weird? It&#x27;s pretty much smells like plastic and it&#x27;s probably not something you should be sniffing all that much. Anyways, about the brushes themselves, I like them! They&#x27;re really soft and they feel awesome. I especially like the extreme red case I got it in! xD (I&#x27;m young. I&#x27;m allowed to use emoicons. :P) It made me smile. :D The only compliant I had was the fact the brow brush looked like it was cheapy painted on (Like, you could totally see the paint -_-). It didn&#x27;t really bother me though since the rest of the brushes were awesome and the brow brush can be easily replaced. So, I would recommend this, you know, if it was available........</li>
            <li> I washed the brushes before using them with luke warm water mixed with baby oil and they have worked just fine. I ordered them Tuesday and they arrived the next day so the delivery time was awesome! Only thing is that it is a 12 piece set, not 13. It is missing the foundation brush which is one of the brushes I was looking forward to. Overall a great deal for $13. Plus the pouch is not bulky or heavy! &#x3D;]Great for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> This was a good buy! so many brushes for such a little price. The only bad thing I can say is some of the brushes don&#x27;t hold the eye-shadow on it two well! I thought it was the eye shadow but none of my other brushes do that! so I assumed its the brush! it just has some fall out from the eye shadow that&#x27;s all! but other then that its still a great buy and would make an awesome gift</li>
            <li> I ordered a Shany Shimmer Eyeshadow Palette, 50/50 Shimmer Matte, 13 Ounce plus the Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch (Color May Vary), 13 pc.   I recently receive the order and when I open it, it was no Eyeshadow Palette, they just send me 2  Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch (Color May Vary), 13 pc!!!! 1 Red and 1 Black!!!!   What I suppose to do with so many brushes???????????!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Now the burshes are nice and soft.......but when i got the burshes i was sorely disappointed the two burshed to the right of the pic were the same exact brush i thoguth that one of them would have been a powder brush as showen in the pic.....but it came with two blush brushes.....im so so sorry i wasted my money!!</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are fine.  I have a few very high end brushes that I paid WAY too much for so I wanted to try these out.  I can tell that there aren&#x27;t as many hairs in each brush so they aren&#x27;t as stiff as I&#x27;d like them, but they&#x27;ll work.  They had a little bit of a weird smell (maybe the plastic purse they come in) so I left them out so the smell would dissipate.</li>
            <li> Really!! So I ordere theses for christmas for my sister.. Thinking I was saving a few dollars for nices brushes then going to costco for there set.. I got them the day before christmas eve.. and I was pissed.. the box was all scraped up they looked like I was regifting... and they where not very nice.. and the bristles where not sofy at all I woldnt put my own makeup on with them the hurt !! Do not get them !</li>
            <li> For the price, these are great brushes!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and washed them before using them and so far I am very happy with them.  If you want the absolute best you&#x27;re going to pay $40 a brush or more.  You can&#x27;t expect these to be like that.  For the price, these are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert in the makeup department but I feel like I made a good investment with buying these brushes. They are very sturdy and the bristles are really soft, the bigger brushes come with a plastic cover so I thought that was an added plus. Overall I thought it was a good price for what I was getting and the delivery was great. I am definitely ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li> I received my items almost immediately. Items are exactly as pictured. The only thing, I wish you choose which color you get. My brushes are red, but I would have preferred black or some other color.</li>
            <li> This Shany professional cosmetic set is amazing!! The brushes have a great texture to them. They make makeup application a breeze and allow the makeup to go on smoothly. This set includes a variety of brushes for different applications. I would recommend this set to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love these brushes! Based off the reviews, I thought that this purchase would be worthwhile. I wasn&#x27;t expecting high quality Mac brushes. But I WAS expecting, at the very least, for these brushes to be durable. This is not the case though. As recommended, I washed these brushes prior to use. Evverything was going swell and I was rinsing off my last few brushes. When suddenly, snap! The black metal part of the brow brush BROKE OFF. Ughhh. I suppose it&#x27;s nothing some scotch tape couldn&#x27;t remedy. But seriously??? I JUST recieved these in the mail this morning... I hadn&#x27;t even used them yet, and already it breaks on me? Super lame... Other than that, this brush kit is okay. For $12.99, it&#x27;s still a pretty good deal. I never planned on using these as my primary brushes. They will merely serve as my backup... so for those looking for quality brushes to use in the long-term, might I suggest you invest in some Sigma brushes? Pricey yes. But as the title of my review states, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and use them daily!</li>
            <li> I love how they look and arrived at my door very quickly. I have not gotten a chance to use them well but am hoping for the best quality. By what I can tell, they are just firm enough to maintain my powders along with my liquids but just soft enough for my face to feel comfortable to use everyday.Also I love the red, it gives it a little touch of sexy</li>
            <li> For all of us who like to do our own make up, this is a great product. It has all the basic brushes, plus a couple of more &amp;#34;sophisticated&amp;#34; ones. The quality is good, and the pouch if not the best quality is good enough to store and carry the brush set.</li>
            <li> I liked this product when I first got it because 1. It was red my favorote color and 2. Because it was decent looking and affordable. When I got it it was in good condition and was very smooth. I have used the blush brushes and really loved them but some of the other brushes looked a bit cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t say they were bad enougj for a four star rating but they weren&#x27;t  the best top-notch looking.  I really have fell in love with the brushes. They are amazing</li>
            <li> So many cosmetic brush sets are so outrageously expensive that I had resigned myself to using third rate brushes forever.  I love the MAC brushes, but can&#x27;t stand the thought of forking out at least eighteen dollars for ONE brush.  And many of the best ones are nearly forty!  These brushes are fantastic!  I&#x27;m highly impressed with them.  They only shed a tiny bit the first time I washed them, but have help up remarkably well.  They come in a great case that I can easily pack with my other cosmetics.  They&#x27;re not MAC, but they&#x27;re the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my sister at Christmas time and she loves them! Her makeup looks beautiful and she says that she loves the quality of them.</li>
            <li> As someone who is fairly new to make up, I luv to experiment without having to splurge on tools every time! Especially since I still have a steep learining curve when it comes to using brushes correctly! Thus this set is a perfect buy - the pink color is super cute and the hair do not shed even on washing! You dont even need to use brush sleeves when you put them to dry - they will not lose shape!</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the (red) pouch,&lt;br /&gt;I feel in love.&lt;br /&gt;All the brushes were intact and looked great.&lt;br /&gt;Was definitely pleased with the price and quality of these&lt;br /&gt;brushes and can do so much with them</li>
            <li> I love this brush set! I honestly do not know what they are all for, but I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out. I do wish they had a list of what they were, but it is not a big deal at all. Very pleased with this product. I also purchased the 78 color eye palette by Shany, and I love it, too. I&#x27;m really digging Shany right now!!</li>
            <li> So the brushes are great but not easily suitable for mineral powders because the brushes are not firm enough. However, the quality is impeccable for the price and the case is icing on top. I Gave three  stars because the brushes were not what I expected but they were definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve been eyeing this product for a long time. I did my homework on many makeup brushes and these by far are awesome. When I put my makeup on it doesn&#x27;t cake up and doesn&#x27;t do build up. They looks so professional and I was so surprise about how much they cost.. usually to get a set like this cost about 40.00 and up and as a college student I don&#x27;t have that kind of money. The other reason is they are so easy to clean. I just want to wash them off in warm water and pat dry with a towel. When I do everyone makeup for conventions I go to, they love how it gives that soft touch. I am so buying more for you guys thanks :)</li>
            <li> this product isnt like MAC brushes, only difference there is, is perhapse the cost. i received this product about 1 month ago and so far, there is no sheeding at all, and none have broken or have any damage watsoever. Cheap, with amazing quailty and the brushes do their job. I got it exacaly 3 days after the purchase with no damage on the packaging. Worth your money.</li>
            <li> this is my first ever brush set and i absolutely love them. they work amazingly with the loose pigments i bought and to keep the brushes clean i brought brush cleaner. this set is awesome especially for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  I&#x27;m no makeup artist, I use youtube to come up with most of my makeup tips, but I love that this kit comes with every single type of brush I&#x27;ve seen artists use.  They are durable, not cheapy where the bristles come out, and the case is just tooo cute!  I feel pretty professional when I unroll it to get a brush.  I [will] be using this company for any further makeup needs.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible, cheap, harsh brushes to use on your face. I wish nothing more than I could return them, and I would never gift them. They even smell chemically.</li>
            <li> we liked this one since it has all antural hair, compare to the one for $100 s , I rather get this one. the color of my pouch was gold, however I wish I had a choice for pouch color. its sent to you randomly. unless you call them and ask for specific colors. beside all of these, quality is not questionable,hairs are  perfectly glued to the hadnle and since last week, I dont see any sign of damage or sepration on hairs. they are very soft and trendy, I do recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I bought baby shampoo because I read the previous ratings, but it turned out that mine neither smelled nor had a white residue on them. I love this set! Very happy and what a great price! Well worth it!</li>
            <li> buen producto ¡ Gracias</li>
            <li> I would not even let my 5 yr old  little cousin \\&quot; play dress up\\&quot; with this brush set it sucks might be good price( and not really either ) but not  quality sorry this is a miss not a hit i did not return it  but im trying to warn yall before you buy it there are better brush sets and cheaper thanks &amp; have a nice day</li>
            <li> I love the brushes, but getting them to me was the problem, it took alot longer than i expected, I know its not the companies fault, Im just very impatient, But the brushes are beautiful and I&#x27;m going to have alot of fun playing around with them!</li>
            <li> My fiances review: These brushes are amazing!! For one, they are super soft! Second, their is a great variety! Third, they come is a great pouch! (mine was red) Great purchase and I would recommend them to anyone who wants some great brushes.</li>
            <li> these brushes are ok, i was expecting something a little bit more but for 26 bucks thats what you get, i wasn&#x27;t really happy with the blush and powder brush the hairs come out really easy, if your looking for professional brushes i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush set is better to pay more and get a good product and not regret it.</li>
            <li> when i got the brushes i was very excited to see how they worked but after having them for about a month now i have realized that they are deff. not what i expected to get. i cant really complain since they were only 25 dollars but still for that price i would have thought that all of the brushes wold have been useable. The only brushes i use on a daily are the face nd blush brushes, besides those, the others seem to be more like painting brushes. not very good quiality and do not look at all like the ones in the picture so please dont be fooled by that like i was.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product, it has the softest animal hair ever. I always put the pouch in my purse.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are cheaply made, I have had them for only about 3 weeks and some of them have broken. The eye brushes are also very thin and don&#x27;t apply makeup very well. Overall for the pice that the brushes are the product is somewhat satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a basic brush kit at this price...so I had someone buy it for me and the shipping was fast! i loved the funky light green case it came in , I open it all the pieces were there....after using the blush brush 2-3 times the head came off in the middle of my photoshoot as I was doing my make-up. How embarrasing?!? I had another brush thankfully but I wasnt expecting that. The smaller brushes are still holding up though ;-)</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes for my 15 yr old daughter. She loved them and what a great price. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> Great at first but didn&#x27;t last very long for me. Brushes got stiff and made my face look &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> these brushes are just about okay...i was particularly disappointed with the ones for eye make-up. the handles are too long and make it difficult to maneuver.....one can get better quality at lesser price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes,  use them every day</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst set of brushes I have ever purchased, but it was also the most inexpensive. In this case I guess you get what you pay for, but I have to say I feel that these brushes weren&#x27;t even worth what I paid for them. They shed heavily and are cheaply made. Several of them have actually broken off the handle while I was applying my makeup! I wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend to others.</li>
            <li> After having had this for over a year now, I have to say it is a bit too much for my needs. There are still many brushes I have never used, and they tend to get warped in the red sleeve they come wrapped up in. Also the red pleather sleeve smelled like chemicals for the first 3 months. As far as the quality of the brishes themselves, all mine have held up well and feel great.</li>
            <li> I have only used these for about a 2weeks, but they seem to be the best brushes I have ever had. My previous were chanel brushes and the hairs kept coming off, these hasn&#x27;t happen once. Very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Great quality set of brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and my sister really likes it</li>
            <li> The brushes came quickly, so I was happy there.  As soon as I opened the box though, there was the gross smell of cheap cheap pleather thats been sitting in a closed warm container.  Therefore, based on the cheap quality of the case, I was worried about the quality of the brushes.  I was surprised by the softness of the brushes, and as a poor college student who can&#x27;t currently afford to spend $100+ on makeup brushes, this will definitely do.  I just wish the handles were black, red isn&#x27;t really a favorite color of mine, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll survive based on the necessities of needing an expensive set.</li>
            <li> no me gusto cuando llegaron muchos pinceles estab doblados. y asi permanecieron. solo hay 3 pinceles rescatables. y no encontre ningun blending brush en la coleccion::::</li>
            <li> You get so many brushes for an excellent price!  They are very soft, and I use one of the very small-tipped brushes for eyeshadow.  I also use one of the blush brushes for face powder.  I use one of the concealer brushes for eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> my brushes wre really old so i bought this one, i was afraid they could damage my skin, but the cosmetics brushes are made from a combination of natural animal hair and synthetic hair, so they are soft and silky on top. im happy with my new brushes one more thin gr8 shipping</li>
            <li> I love this product! Like in other reviews there was a strong plastic smell, you have to let it breath so I did that over night. I love the brushes through they are very sturdy and I got the red case like in the picture. Im a beginner for makeup I&#x27;ll be 19 in a month and it&#x27;s great for me because I&#x27;m learning about makeup and application, so it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> i would buy these but the color is horrible. i am a black kinda guy (not skin tone) and all my make up brushes are black (I&#x27;m a cosmetologist) it just seems more professional.</li>
            <li> Great brushes , most of them have lasted me 2 years</li>
            <li> It has a nice variety and I loved the price. The smaller brushes are wonderful, but the bigger ones are annoying because the little hairs are always falling out.</li>
            <li> I bought the 12 brush set called the \\&quot;Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set\\&quot; and it came with a red pouch for 12 dollars in 2 days. Right off the bat I was impressed with the speedy delivery and the quality of the brushes upon inspection. I was expecting to use these brushes for my stage make up class, but after giving them a run through of my daily make up application I can&#x27;t help but want to keep them for myself and buy another set for my class! I highly recommend these brushes. They&#x27;re well made, durable, and easy to clean.     Given these brushes are not MAC or Sephora quality, they are really a bang for your buck. I&#x27;ve been in college for almost 5 years now cross training into stage make up for production, and on screen design and I will definitely be using these brushes till they ruin. :)</li>
            <li> Good product for the price!! Great inversion for the money. Very good beauty products!! I recommended this products works very nice!!</li>
            <li> Just arrived in the mail today, which is earlier than expected!  I was super excited to check these out! While the packaging was amazing, and it looked cool, it smelled like a dying rat snuffed with some molten chemicals as soon as I unwrapped the case. I absolutely could not stand the smell and now have the worst headache ever from whatever chemical was thrown onto these brushes. I washed these brushes out and a lot of the strands fell out, and no matter how many times I washed it still REEKS! I am NOT going to be putting this to my face! About to go look up how to go about returning these. Would NOT buy again and do not recommend.</li>
            <li> after reading all the reviews I decided to give it a shot, this item plus shany 40 color, are the best items in my drawer now, i had never had such an elegant product. quality is awesome,Im very happy with amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a make up and Brush hoarder.  I bought these brushes hoping for the big fluffy fan brush but sadly it was not in this kit however the fan brush included is nice quality.  Now these are no where near Sigma soft, but fabulous eye brushes.  Just the right stiffness and softness.  The price was fantastic.  Perfect set if you need extra eye brushes.  Note these are badger and goat hair.  They don&#x27;t smell at all and minimal shedding.  Also important to note.  The brushes were advertised and pictured as black bristles with red tips and red handles.  The bristles are all black.  I was kind of disappointed but it&#x27;s okay.  Definitely perfect first brush set for your preteen or teen.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with these brushes, you can&#x27;t really expect them to be high end. I like the softness of the larger brushes but the smaller ones fell apart easily. I don&#x27;t have many left of those. The bag is also extremely cheap looking I tossed it.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong for $12 but the 3 face brushes are the only useful brushes because the rest are all flat brushes- there are no angled, shading, contouring or dome brushes of any kind.</li>
            <li> I couldnt be happier with this purchase.  A beautiful stylish red bag to hold brushes.  The brushes have long length, to allow for professional makeup application.  Soft natural bristles.  Very impressive for the price</li>
            <li> when you use them on your face the small hairs fall off</li>
            <li> i loved them i just got them used a few already. the bag is great and the color. no damage and on time.</li>
            <li> I got my items on the second day. Yes, shipping is really fast. Black pouch and red Brushes. However....they aren&#x27;t made from real animal hair...Well even if they are, they are extremely stiff and I am really afraid to even try to apply my makeup with it. I compared them to my MAC and few other brushes I possess and my brushes are way softer! Whoever wrote here that they are real and professional, you are big fail. They are professional as my....If you really into make up, don&#x27;t buy it. Even tough they are very cheap! Just add few more buks and buy one MAC brush!</li>
            <li> Brushes shed a bit. Pretty much get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> GREAT SET FOR PRO AND BEGINNER SET.  PERFECT FOR MINERAL POWDERS, LOOSE POWDERS.  BEAUTIFUL RED AND LOVE HOW SOFT THE BRUSHES ARE AND VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned these brushes for a few months. I use them several times a week for personal use and so far, they&#x27;ve held up fine with very minimal shedding. They aren&#x27;t the best brushes ever, but they are much higher quality than I would have expected to get for the price I paid. I would have given 5 stars if the powder brush was a little bigger and the blush brush was angled. Overall, I am very pleased with this brush set and would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> just received it and i realy love them i thought it was going to be some cheap dollar store type but no they look realy good and feel great</li>
            <li> My new brushes are super soft, there is a wonderful variety. The case was a nice shade of red, along with the brush handles. I&#x27;m thinking of buying more for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes are so expensive its ridiculous. I was nervous as to how the quality of these brushes would be but they are holding up very well. I wash my brushes daily and they still look as good as new. Comes with a cute little carrying case too.</li>
            <li> Awesome set. Comes inside in nice convinient bag....very useful... I wanted a brush set and this is just perfect! Comes in plastic protectors and shipping was fast! I love this from Shany!</li>
            <li> The pouch reeked of petroleum when i got it, it almost made me throw up. The brushes also stank but after i washed them they were fine. I put the pouch in front of my a/c and it didn&#x27;t smell anymore. all in all this is a great product except for the smell</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for my wedding. I needed to replace the brushes I have used for years. These were a great deal for the price. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist but for someone that uses it on a somewhat regular basis this is worth it. It&#x27;s very inexpensive for what you get. Some of the brushes I haven&#x27;t even used. The only complaint I have is the smell. I washed and let the brushes sit out over night. The pouch (I&#x27;m assuming the paint on the pouch) smelled horrible. I let it sit outside on my deck for two days straight before I brought it in. It was much better after that. So I highly recommend doing that before putting your brushes back in.</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive product, very well packaged and with a good variety of brushes. I use it every day. My only complaint is that the brush hairs do shed.</li>
            <li> The wife loved this stuff.  The item was shipped quickly so it was here before vacation time. Gain a lot of husband points</li>
            <li> These brushes far exceeded my expectations! They are actually \\&quot;goat hair\\&quot; at this incredibly low price! I was glad I bought a set for myself as I was originally looking to buy a set for a gift only. Shipping was superb too.</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for the price but they she&#x27;d alot even after alot of use they still shed. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for affordable brushes that don&#x27;t have this issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this within the last 6 months.  It came on time and in a lovely brush holder.  Although I haven&#x27;t gotten much use out of it because I don&#x27;t wear my full \\&quot;face\\&quot; very often and as such don&#x27;t need to use the brushes, I know I have a variety in case I start using the other ones.  Also, so far the brushes have held up very nicely, possibly due in part to my rare use of them.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because of the numerous positive reviews and the low price. Thee packaging and the appearance of the&lt;br /&gt;set was really nice. It also comes with a booklet that lets you know what each brush is for. However, the brushes do shed&lt;br /&gt;and you can get some stuck to your face when using the blush or foundation brushes. Other than that the brushes are a steal.</li>
            <li> brushes are cheap, smell funny and overall feels like i wasted my money</li>
            <li> These are soft, the large shadow brush doesn&#x27;t apply that well.  I washed these after purchase, then again after use once they dried they were loose and heads start popping off the eyeshadow brushes. I do like the blush, face brush,and fan. I would go with ELF professional over these. waste of money</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Never had good quality brushes, because I couldn&#x27;t afford it. Now I do! LOVE LOVE LOVE &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> This is a good, solid brush set, especially for someone just starting out in makeup and needing a range of brushes for their collection. It smelled a bit when it first arrived, but after washing the brushes and letting the case air out, it was fine. The brushes do shed a bit, especially the fan brush, but overall they&#x27;re a pretty good quality. I use them on a daily basis, and they&#x27;re a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> this set is fantastic. I think it&#x27;s a must have for anyone who goes through a lot of brushes. This has lasted much longer than some of the MAC brushes I have</li>
            <li> For the price this product is amazing. You get a nice red bag that carries all of the brushes, I have already put mine to use. This is a really great value, I don&#x27;t think you would find this good of a deal anywhere else.</li>
            <li> i dont have a great makeup skills and am a beginner for me it&#x27;s a good buy.. worth the price.. easy to handle ...on the whole i feel satisfied.You can afford the product.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very good quality, and I couldn&#x27;t find any flaws with the brushes themselves, but the case they come in is kind of annoying to roll it up and wrap the straps all the way around, and if I were to change it, I would make it have a velcro or a button or a clasp of some sort instead of the straps, but otherwise, great!</li>
            <li> This brush set is exactly what I wanted, it has a good variety of brushes. The larger prowder brushes are soft and feel very good on your skin, and the smaller brushes are just dense enough to be more precise. My only complaint is that the fan brush sheds a little at first but it is not a big deal because it stopped before it became a serious problem. Also, like a few other reviews said, the brushes are not labeled, so you have to decide how to use them or ask someone who knows. They are very good quality, shipped promptly and in perfect condition. I will buy more brushes from Shany. I used this with their 40 color eye palette and the results were perfect. :)</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick but was to be expected of Prime (we pay $80 a year for it, so it better be!)The product itself came in a pink pouch (nothing to be done about that) and it did smell chemical but a good wash took care of that, and it looks well made.  The brushes are of acceptable quality, and they are soft to the skin, and the handles are long and have a comfortable hold. I did wash the brushes that very same day as it is recommended.  There was a lot of dye and dirt coming off them (no surprise) and hair did also fall out, but they kept their shape well enough once dry. I did have to throw away the fan brush since it was impossible to shape and the bristles kept bending all over the place (who uses fan brushes anyway?), and most importantly (to me, at least) there is NO BLENDING BRUSH.  I do like the brushes&#x27; sizes, since I have small eyes, I need small brushes, but I think it is imperative that a good brush set include at least one blending brush, if it is to be considered a \\&quot;professional set.\\&quot; Overall, it was a fair price for a fair brush set, but it would improve galaxies if the Shany people included a good blending brush in their sets.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for me for Valentines Day and considering he knows nothing about makeup, he made a really great choice. Lots of eye shadow brushes in this and I like that. The only thing I didnt like is that the powder brush (i assume its a powder brush) is too small and is a better as a blush brush. Not terrible quality but not the best, but pretty good considering what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product is like a real professional brush kit. It is so nice to have every available makeup brush in a tool kit ready. The bristles are amazing, soft and flawless. I love this purchase.</li>
            <li> The bristles come out. Looking nice and well made caught my eye, but they are not well made at all</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews that stated the poor quality of the brushes, but I think that for the price, they&#x27;re not terrible. They seem to be put together well, and the bristles are soft. Again, not the best brushes out there, but if you can&#x27;t spend $200 on brushes, they&#x27;re not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with my brushes!! I was kind of nervous, on purchasing at first, it sucks that it didn&#x27;t include a foundation brush though.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are great and a great price! I would recommend these brushes.  They are affordable and have great coverage.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes, make-up application is so easy with these tools. I love how soft they are, and the fact that they&#x27;re natural bristles makes them easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush set and I was totally satisfied. The quality of the brushes were good for a first timer but others may not think so. It didn&#x27;t take much time for the package to get to me and nothing was damaged. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with was some the brushes hair is uneven and my fan brush got a little bent. Other than that this product was great.</li>
            <li> First of all, shipping was a joke.  It got here and had been shipped UPS EXPRESS but yet still took 10 days? I honestly believe they didn&#x27;t ship when they stated at all. Also, customer service?? HA! there was none, I contacted (tried to) twice to get a tracking number when the package didn&#x27;t arrive and didn&#x27;t arrive, and i NEVER to this day got a response to either email.  Ok, on to the brushes:  The brushes are not high quality at all, nor that soft.  For instance -- there is no good eye blending brush, all the eye brushes are very stiff, good for lining or loading on color, but no blending eye brush.  The \\&quot;Face Brush\\&quot; isn&#x27;t plush or very large in diameter at all. If you are a casual user just wanting a set of brushes these are fine, however, if you are looking for good quality and versatility, these are not the brushes. Disappointing purchase all around.    the one good thing I can say is the bag is good for traveling -- once I put other brushes in it!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!! They don&#x27;t fall apart and I&#x27;ve been using them since they got here, plus I&#x27;ve washed them 3 times already!!!!  I intend on buying more for my friends.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, especially if you are a beginner with makeup. The quality it great, and I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. The bristles are SO soft. I only wish the set came with a foundation brush. Other than that, this is the perfect makeup brush set, at an outrageously low price. At first I was nervous that the low price would mean low quality, but I was completely wrong. The brushes are great!</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife. And she is really loving the brushes. Especially they are in her favorite colors. She says they work very well and it really makes her look hot. Good brushes for the Mrs.</li>
            <li> I just received this item yesterday. It does have a strong smell when you take it out of the bag. But the quality of brushes is pretty good for the price-doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions on what to use for what. Great pouch color too.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with these brushes! They are of great quality and I highly recommend them! The brush tips are very soft, the handles are sturdy, and the carrying case is adorable.</li>
            <li> A very nice variety of sized brushes. Very soft; which is very important to me as i have pretty sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these well made makeup brushes as they are good quality, awesome price, love the case they come in. As an added touch they have plastic covers for some of the brushes that need more protection. Love the color... I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though... The fan brush came messed up; shaped weird and such. I&#x27;m not sure if this is something that is done often or not but just something for someone to be aware of. It didn&#x27;t bother because I wouldn&#x27;t of used that particular brush anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional in makeup in the least but this is my opinion... Take it as you will.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes but did not come with the exact set pictured. But still a great starter set. Also hasn&#x27;t shed AT ALL with lots of use</li>
            <li> I bought this set and loved it! Not cheap! Brushes do not shed! Great for professional and first time users!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best. There is no need to go and buy brushes from any one else. Compared to some of the other brushes that I have bought these are the best. It makes me sick to think about how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on other brushes that were noybeven half as good as my Shany brushes are.</li>
            <li> after one time they started to all apart.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my brush set.  I received it on the day promised for shipment and to my surprise, they have an AUTHENTIC leather pouch.  It&#x27;s not a big deal but I would have liked to have been able to choose my color although I got red and it is still very nice.  The brushes are very soft yet very firm at the base so when applying makeup it is applied appropriately with no mess.  BUT the description stated that it came with a foundation brush.  THIS IS WRONG.  It comes with a large blush brush and a smaller blush brush which I am assuming they think can also be used for foundation.  NO.  This brush is way to bushy and large to be used as a fondation brush so if you are looking for a set with a foundation brush this is NOT for you.  But i fyou are looking for good eye makeup and blush brushes.. this is absolutely perfect!  And how convenient to have your own pouch to keep things organized! SUPER EASY TO CLEAN TOO.</li>
            <li> Well at first i was mad because i received the wrong thing, but they fixed that very quickly.  The item does cone very well packaged.  I didnt notice that odor people said they did, i did smell it when i sniffed the little case for the brushes but i think thats normal considering its vinyl.  I touched them before washing, and they were all soft except the 2 big ones.  They werent rough, they werent soft.  But after i washed them with baby shampoo they all got softer.  The big ones shed a tiny bit when washing, which is normal.  The small ones did not shed.  These brushes look  good quality.  I think the case is cute and will be very handy for storing them.  Overall, i am happy with my purchase and  would definetly recommend.  I most likely will buy another set for my sister.</li>
            <li> ES UN PRODUCTO MUY UTIL PARA MAQUILLAJE, MUY PROFESIONAL, SUPER CHEVERE, LLEGO SIN NINGUN INCONVENIENTE, EMPACADO CORRECTAMENTE, SUGUIERO LA COMPRA DE ESTE PRODUCTO</li>
            <li> I ordered this set mainly to replace my eye shadow applicators that kept getting destroyed.  It is a fun set of many different kinds of brushes.  Probably not the most professional set, but for my purposes it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought them as they seemed fair quality for the price, I was a bit scared about the complaints of the smell. When I received it as I was pleasantly surprised as they seem good quality and the smell reported comes from the package. The brushes are amazing, I&#x27;ve used them some times already and are great and soft.</li>
            <li> In a sexy red hot color! These beautiful brushes are best ones for applying powder, foundation, blush, and eye shadows! Brushes are very soft to the skin yet durable. And the organizer pouch is very durable. All you need in one place! And the red is easy to see in your makeup case.</li>
            <li> great quality. can be cleaned and used over and over. Comparable with other higher priced make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews stating that the brushes are soft, but to me, they are nothing special. I believe that this set would be perfect for someone starting to wear make-up. These brushes don&#x27;t pick up much product making application take much longer than it should. I suppose that it was a decent deal for the price, but I&#x27;m not so enthralled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that my next brush purchase will be the Sigma roll.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great, I was impressed with the quality,they are sturdy, and don&#x27;t fall apart, unlike others from department stores, that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product! The brushes are soft and they&#x27;re put together very well. I pulled on the brushes to make sure they were on tightly and they most definitely are. The case it comes with is nice and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as everyone says it is. I would even purchase these brushes if they were a little more expensive. Also, if you think about it your getting these brushes for about a dollar a piece.</li>
            <li> These were great the first few months, but after a while the brushes separated from the handles. Extremely annoying and poorly made.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the brushes! Very Feminine! Each brush came individually wrapped and the hairs are so soft and pick up make-up easily.</li>
            <li> I just got the brushes today, and I&#x27;m so excited about them. They all look very nice, and the case is adorable.. I got a red one! It goes great with my black and grey purse. The smell is a little weird, but not bad. It&#x27;ll probably fade over time, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I just got my product yesterday. I used it this morning while getting ready for work. I was applying my loose powder with one of the bigger brushes &amp; the hairs of it were literally shedding off onto my face. I absolutely thought that this brush was going to get the job done (absolutely not). I hate the shedding it was just a mess. But the other tools I used in the kit worked fine so I have no problems with that. My rating is based on the shedding of the brush</li>
            <li> When I recieved the shany set, the fan brush had weird clumps in the bristles and there were loose hairs all over the place. Maybe I was expecting too much given how cheap these brushes are, but I fear they&#x27;d go bald within a couple applications. I will say the shipping was speedy and the set had all it&#x27;s pieces, 12 brushes and 1 pouch. I will be returning.</li>
            <li> Cute packaging,&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good quality (gets the job done, very little brush shedding),&lt;br /&gt;Easy to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good buy :)</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, but it may cause an allergic reaction if you don&#x27;t wash them first. They are great brushes but they shed for awhile, if ur allergic to animals this may cause an allerigc reaction and/or allergies.</li>
            <li> My Hubby bought for me and I love it. They are great brush set. they are so soft when they touch your face great produt again and the price amazing really thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I am a cosplayer, I was always needed to buy brush set whenever I attend the conventions. This brush set, however, is the most amazing brushes! The cost is just good deal, I highly recommend it. Brushes, when I used it, it just soft and works perfect.</li>
            <li> Received mine in red. Yup, pouch as a rubber smell but I&#x27;m not so concerned as I&#x27;m keeping them my cute brush container. Brushes are soft and pick up the powders very well. The only disappointment is the brow brush, it seems like \\&quot;melted\\&quot;.... yucks, thus threw that away immediately after opening as it is really \\&quot;melted\\&quot; till out of shape.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, it&#x27;s very soft and gentle when you apply it on your face.  It&#x27;s very affordable and It has a lot of brushes for a basic make-up kit. I really like the pricing on this item, so cheap! The only problem is, when I first got it I opened the bag and it smelled like chemicals. I didn&#x27;t like the smell, it was too strong. But the smell went away after a few hours of exposing it to air. I had to leave the bag open so it wont smell like chemicals anymore.  I just hope that they will improve their bags/cases in the future.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet used the brushes, but was disappointment to noticed I was missing a brush. Price was fair for so many pieces but I would still have like to have all brushes to experiment with, and in order to get a correct order I would have to send it all back, NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> For the price these brushes are amazing! I was a little skeptical because it isn&#x27;t a known brand but I now use these everyday, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my beauty supplies, and let me just say these gorgeous brushes way exceeded my expectations! They are so soft and so luxurious, do not even hesitate to buy these. You will be as thrilled as I am. They are amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is a great set of make up brushes, especially for the price. Shipping was really fast and they work great. Would definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Since I had been using the same make-up brushes for many years (some up to 20 years) and cleaning them on a regular basis, most of them were getting a little shabby.  So I figured it was time to get some new ones.  But who wants to spend a ton of money on one brush or a set of three?  I decided to try out this very reasonably priced set.  I like the feel of the brushes - they work very well for me.  While red is not my favorite color, I do love the case these brushes came in.  It holds the brushes securely.</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes, they&#x27;re great and firm. Works really good with my make up. I recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I am a makeup collector and this brush set SUCKS SO MUCH. The ones from elf and walmart are even WAY better. Only the 2 face brushes are usable all the other brushes I don&#x27;t even know if their concealer brushes or eyeshadow brushes. All the eyeshadow brushes are stiff and impossible to pick up any color. I hate this brush set. Save your money and order from elf or something. I know some people said theirs was good but I guess that&#x27;s if you get a good set or a bad one. It all depends. But don&#x27;t risk getting bad or good ones. Just get elf ones which are WAYY better quality. I was so disspointed in this. Plus theres a horrible smell and the handles came loose and they were all glued slanted. They are just cheap dollar store quality brushes. Don&#x27;t risk getting the bad ones. I hopes this helps.</li>
            <li> I just got these brushes today and I&#x27;ve only used them once. But I really like them. I read a lot of reviews saying that they smelled bad, but I haven&#x27;t had this problem. These are definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes. I use these brushes everyday. They are very very soft. I love that there are 13 brushes for everything I could want to apply makeup with. Eyeshadow, blush, liner, lipstick...you name it it is right at your fingertips. All in one place, and you have to love the hip color!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous set of brushes in a handy pouch to keep them organized and clean.  Can&#x27;t beat the price - I stocked up to have extras!</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift and she loves them. Minimal hair loss from the brushes and they work great</li>
            <li> I really liked these they look great, no issues at all I love the red pouch they come in too, it didn&#x27;t even mention that it came with that. These were a really good deal. I would highly recommend purchasing these.</li>
            <li> Just like all Shany products these brushes are great! I don&#x27;t understand how these brushes are such a great price at such a great quality!</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes seem to be OK but all the larger ones leave little brown hairs all over may face and eyes, and it takes forever to get them off. I broke down and paid for the ECO brush - so much better, softer, fuller - I only recommend this set if you want/need the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> This product was ok, but not fully what expected. I will probably buy new set in future to replace this set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft, they came packaged well, and they don&#x27;t shed at all that I have seen. They&#x27;re easy to clean and the makeup your using doesn&#x27;t cling or clump in the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the red leather wrap case they come in too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will be returning to Shany for all of my makeup needs!</li>
            <li> I like the bigger brushes, but the heads on the smaller ones tend to fall off. Not well made.</li>
            <li> I compared a similar set today, at a much higher price, and wondered how my Amazon purchase would compare.  It&#x27;s a winner.  From the beautiful leather pouch to the complete selection of high quality brushes, I was quite pleased.  I plan to order more product from this company.</li>
            <li> Great brushes especially great because of the price.  Such a deal!  The brushes work great, love that they are real hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes despite the terrible reviews, because I always think that people are too critical. Upon receiving these brushes, I did not notice a harsh chemical smell, and thought that they would be fine; however, there are many things I dislike about these brushes. If you are planning on wearing more than one shade of eyeshadow, these brushes are not helpful. The brushes are either too small or too large for properly applying eyeshadow. The sponge brush, which I began to use to help with contouring, fell apart after 3 uses, and I was unable to put it back together. The foundation brushes are not firm enough for application, and when pressure is put on them, all of the bristles fall out! I really do not use any of these brushes anymore, and would suggest e.l.f. for about the same price.</li>
            <li> Looked great when I opened them! I will be giving this as a Christmas present to my sister so I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they looked great!</li>
            <li> They feel so nice!!&lt;br /&gt;And they were shipped extremely fast! So impressed&lt;br /&gt;The price isnt so bad either ;)&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
            <li> This kit is the most perfect kit anyone could buy for its price. Great deal for anyone who is looking to get the best for their buck.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews, I expected to receive top notch brushes. They are what I would expect for the price. They are soft but with my 1st use I noticed small hairs from the brush on my face. Don&#x27;t get me wrong they are still good brushes but I have used better but of course with a higher price tag.</li>
            <li> I am so upset and wanted to return. However through amazon its a lot of work so I decided not to do that. how come you give a picture of 17 brushes and then the title says 13 pc and you send 12 pc???!! the quality is not worth it either.thanks for the scam</li>
            <li> I had bought these brushes not to long ago and i wasn&#x27;t sure if i liked them or not. on one of the brushes the hairs had so kinda hard thing on it so i can&#x27;t use it now. and on some of my other brushes the brush its self would come off of the handle. i kinda feel like it was a waste of money considering all that has happened over time with these brushes. think twice before you buy.</li>
            <li> I am  so glad i bought this brush set its so nice, i like that they are long so you dont have to do much and they are so soft when they touch your face great produt again and the price amazing really thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes in the mail yesterday and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It came in a very cute red case and the brushes are as soft as I was hoping they would be. Overall a very good product that won&#x27;t hurt your pocket :)</li>
            <li> I just received my brushes and I can tell you that I&#x27;m very happy with them. I&#x27;m on a budget and these fit the bill nicely. And I must have ordered them right at the right time because I only paid $12.00 for the set and now they are up to $27.00, so I feel quite lucky.</li>
            <li> I actually bought 24pcs and 12pc brushes together, I wanted to give away one set as a gift to my mom, I kept the 24pcs but my mom is so happy with these 12pc brushes, and Im sure I bought the right item at right price.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase these brushes. What a total waste of money. The brushes had a funny smell when I first opened the box not to mention the brushes were already losing hair. I&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your time or your money. You&#x27;ve been warned! Buyers be ware</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I love how fast I got these brushes! I ordered then August 26 and they were here on August 27. I used Amazon prime 2day free shipping. My case I received was a metallic green, the case itself obviously will not stay together forever and why should it, its made of cheap vinyl but anyway for 25 dollars you can&#x27;t complain. The case has embossing on the lower right corner of the opening flap. It reads \\&quot;Profound\\&quot; my guess is that is the makers trademark. Opening the case you will notice it is held shut by two large silver magnetic snaps. The snaps are just punctured into the vinyl so once they come out they are gone for good. Each brush is held in place netting. The brushes that are sown in the first picture are not ALL the ones you will receive.     The brushes you should receive will be as follows: Two blush brushes, One large, one medium. A fan brush, A mascara brush, you should have one foundation brush (this will be the largest of the flat paint brush looking ones)you will have two concealer brushes that look almost identical, they are not, one is slightly longer and the brush is a bit wider then the other. you will have an angled brush that is best used for lining the top of the lids, a small lip brush, a brow comb/brush and an applicator. Each brush will come in plastic wrap to protect the brush. Four of the brushes will have a strong plastic \\&quot;topper\\&quot; keep the plastic that comes with the lip brush, fan brush and two blush brushes to help these keep their shape ladies.    The bristles on these brushes appear to be glued in fairly well, again for 25 dollars you shouldn&#x27;t complain you are not getting M.A.C. brushes nor are you getting Dior. So if you are going to complain then just do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy the brushes.    I will add my pictures of the case and each brush as soon as I find the connector to my digital camera. Then you can see what I think are more accurate photos of each brush..</li>
            <li> I needed another eyebrow/eyelash brush and wanted a fan-type brush, and realized for the price, I was getting a better deal buying this entire set- especially with the $5 coupon (making the set about $8). I love the red color, the bright red organizer that is rolled up will keep everything nice and separated, and each brush is perfect.  I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this- they are definitely worth the regular price, but it&#x27;s always awesome to get a better deal.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality for such a low price. I&#x27;m a beginner with the whole make up thing and i was looking around at brushes and i felt some of the other brands and these are highly comparable for 75% less money and i love the cute lil case</li>
            <li> okay, i ordered a book 4 days before this and i got the brushes first! i ordered them saturday and recied monday (today!). they are a pretty color and the brushes are great for people who love creating their own eyeshadows and want soft brushes! the cost is cheap and the quality is great!!!</li>
            <li> My brushes came in a week.  I got a red pouch, which is great since it matches the color of the brushes.  I saw bad reviews about how stiff they were but mine are not stiff at all.  They&#x27;re really soft and gentle on my face.  In fact, I&#x27;ve bought a few (expensive) brushes from Sephora and their bristles are really stiff and sometimes irritate my skin.  The Shany brushes don&#x27;t do that.    I haven&#x27;t used them all yet, but from the ones I have used, the only one I didn&#x27;t like was the fan brush.  It came kind of messed up since it&#x27;s so thin.  It&#x27;s not really good for bronzing.    As a college student, I&#x27;m always looking for cheaper cosmetic alternatives and this brushes were a great buy for that.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great buy!! Wonderful quality for the money. it is hard to find nice makeup brushes that won&#x27;t hurt your pocketbook and don&#x27;t fall apart the minute you buy them. These won&#x27;t do either!!!</li>
            <li> This brush set is a great value for the price. Since it&#x27;s 12 pieces, I use it for traveling, but I could totally see someone using this as their everyday set. I only use it for traveling because I also own the 32 Super Professional Set from Shany (which I also highly recommend). If you wash these brushes before you use them, they won&#x27;t shed as much. I love the way the brushed are tapered and they&#x27;re super soft as well.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be better quality. I got them almost a year ago and still haven&#x27;t used them however every time I look at them they are shedding. The hairs are way too soft making it hard to apply makeup. They don&#x27;t pick up the product very well either.</li>
            <li> I thought for this price i would what i paid for...cheapish brushes! but WOW! i got an amazing deal! These brushes are sooo nice! they feel like $100 brushes! so soft. *I also got the red case! :)</li>
            <li> These flat irons are good for the price. They get HOT really fast extremely so! I actually burned my scalp pretty badly the first time using them. However they don&#x27;t leave my hair as sleek and frizz free as I like, but again for the price they are an extremely good value:)</li>
            <li> 2nd year in a row I&#x27;ve ordered this great set</li>
            <li> this brush set is awesome, i love how soft the brushes are and the fact that they are made from real hair! and the fact you dont HAVE to clean the brushes all the time... i dont think my makeup ever looked so good!</li>
            <li> First off, please wash the brushes immediately.  I hate to see all these knocks on the smell when it is obviously stated by the vendor to wash these before use.  Once washed, all the smell disappeared.  Shipped fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is a little tacky and cheap in my opinion, but it isn&#x27;t horrible either.  I know the colors vary, mine came in red.  It would be great to have for traveling with these brushes, I&#x27;m not a fan of using the roll-up ones as a everyday item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brushes have not shed at all, which is a huge plus.  They aren&#x27;t anything amazing, but they are very sturdy for the price.  It is an amazing deal for a product that doesn&#x27;t just fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need back-up brushes, or decent everyday brushes I would recommend moving forward and purchasing!  :) With that price, even if you end up not having a favorite new set of brushes, you will gain some you didn&#x27;t have or have a travel set at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> This is great! The brushes are very well made and have covers. The case is great too, I love how it rolls up. I will be recommending this to my friends!</li>
            <li> I guess for the price they are good.To me the brushes are a little thin and they smell like spray paint. as soon as i opened the box my whole bathroom stunk.</li>
            <li> Cheap and it broke apart</li>
            <li> Oh my... This brush set is perfect for everyday use. It is great, no fall out at all and it is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The Good: There are a lot of brushes in this set. The smaller ones work really well and have held together over the past 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: The main brushes (powder, blush, bronzer, etc.) started falling apart after the first month of daily use. They leave brush hairs all over my face, stuck in my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have just spent more money on a better set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Sheds pretty bad, but overall works pretty good</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you love to play with different eye shadows this is a must have. Such a bargain just for the great small brushes that I use all the time. I use the larger brushes less - only when I am cleaning my really expensive big brushes and waiting for them to air dry. The larger brushes are a great substitute in these situations. For this price, its hard to beat!</li>
            <li> When you say \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; these brushes fit the description perfectly. the eyeshadow brushes are very thing. Not dense at all. brushes are VERY VERY stiff. They all smell weird. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> These are amazing brushes, and are cruelty free! I love them: made of goat and badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wash with gentle, diluted shampoo and warm water before using!&lt;br /&gt;They are so soft!</li>
            <li> i have purchased these brushes myself and i love them. they have every brush that you could possible need. i am recommending this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost year now and they still work great. The hairs are really soft and don&#x27;t fall out compared to others of the same price. Price wise it&#x27;s just speechless. When I first saw the price I thought there was a catch but no they really are fine quality for such a low cost. For me I don&#x27;t really care about the pouch color as long as what&#x27;s inside works. Shany is also animal friendly so that also boosted my decision to buy these brushes.</li>
            <li> You get any brush you could possible need in this set. 12 brushes of this quality for $13 can&#x27;t be beat anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good product but I haven&#x27;t had much chance to use them yet. I will try to report back when I do.</li>
            <li> The selection is of brushes is great and although the pouch is cheap quality it is very functional.  The brushes however are so fine that they don&#x27;t pick up powder or shadow and you end up wasting makeup and don&#x27;t get coverage on your skin.   Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> A brush for everything imaginable.  I there all my other brush&#x27;s out and only use these now.  Pouch is great and the brush&#x27;s are easily cleaned with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the brushes in this set. The wide variety of shapes covers all of your makeup needs. However, the pouch that the brushes come in has a very nasty plastic smell, and when left on a table in a warm room, left a mark on the table that I can&#x27;t get out. I will be making my own pouch to keep the brushes in.</li>
            <li> The brushes are exactly what I was looking for.  Professional and sleek.  I love the color and feel of the brushes.  I also love the case they came in.  Definitely a great buy for a great price.</li>
            <li> Shany brush set affordable and good quality! Love it use them everyday! The case is really cute! The brushes work very well and for this price can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes!!! Just got them today got here super fast!!! I like how it has a case soo i can travel with it!! Great price also!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this set thinking I was getting a good deal which it is, lots of brushes for the price! BUT when I opened the box, the plastic/petroleum/PVC smell was so strong it gave me a headache. This was even before I took it out of the outer plastic bag it came in. The red pouch the brushes come in is not the best quality, but what can you expect for the price right? When I took the pouch out of the plastic the smell got stronger. The optimist in me thought I&#x27;ll just not use the pouch &amp; throw it away...but when I inspected the brushes, they smelled really bad too! If this smell was giving me a headache, I can&#x27;t possibly use these brushes on face. I don&#x27;t know if Shaney has any control over how their products are manufactured but if I had known it was made in china, i wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. Buyer beware - take the time to look at the zoomed in images to see where these products are made &amp; make an educated decision on price vs quality.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for anyone who enjoys doing their own makeup. Just enough brushes to create a beautiful look for any day of the week.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived way before the estimated date. They&#x27;re beautifully packaged in a cute case (mine was black). They&#x27;re in perfect shape with no haywire bristles. It has all the right brushes with no extraneous, weird ones. It&#x27;s perfect! I&#x27;m so, so satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes. They aren&#x27;t high end brushes but they are pretty nice! The brushes are really soft but could be fuller, I feel they are on the thinner side compared to some of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes did not fall apart or come apart and did not shed.The biggest brush is not as fluffy as I have wished but still was an nine out of an ten. The eyeshadow brushes are perfect, they are not fluffy but not too stiff-just right as Goldie Locks would say and they are perfect because you can control what amount you are getting on your brush, although I haven&#x27;t used all of these, these are a good buy.Whoever is reading this, you should give this a try and take a chance like I have done and many others. Great price two.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. The blush brush is nice and soft and bushy. The foundation brush works great. I love the eye liner brush- it&#x27;s hard and has another little brush to blend it really well. The eye shadow brushes come in a nice variety so you can use different ones depending on your look. And if you&#x27;re an amature like me, you can always google what to do for different types of brushes. Very inexpensive considering there are single brushes selling for over $300. Get it! :)    Oh! Also, the brushes come in a cute little leather type bag which takes up no room at all. All of these brushes fit in my purse very easily if they are in the pouch.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fabulous!  Such good quality and very well made.&lt;br /&gt;They look nice too: you won&#x27;t want to hide them in a drawer..&lt;br /&gt;The case is very soft and easy to open.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are all nice, but overall quite an over-kill for me. I probably will never need to buy another and some will be available for others to inherit when I&#x27;m gone.</li>
            <li> This is great the bristles are soft and totally worth your money I have had them since April 2014 and they are still going strong and I wash them every week</li>
            <li> Brushes are so expensive nowadays that you can pay this amount for only one brush. This is a great set with very soft brushes. It has everything you need. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> ok so i boght this item and i got it in 2 days! but they shed A LOT ! th biggesst brush , powder brush, a bunch of th bristles just came off when i washed it for the first time. and it made my brush  useless. other than that they are great. size is pretty small, and the leather case is not real but it gives the brushes some protection ! hope it helps !</li>
            <li> These are of average quality.  If you are looking for something for a young girl they are great.  If you are looking for top of the line, go somewhere else.</li>
            <li> the product came exactly as described and came to my home promptly. I could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the varied selection of the brushes. I also like the fact that the brushes are made of goat hair. I am dissappointed by the fact that the hairs are already starting ro fall-out of some of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the bad reviews of this product. But I saw it had more positive then negative ones. I do not even use makeup that much, just when I go out, so i did not want to buy expensive brushes, but this ones fell apart in like the second use. Save your self time and frustration and get better quality ones. Do not be fooled by the good reviews that this product has.</li>
            <li> Definitely more than I need or even know how to use, but this will prompt me to learn! Entire set came in perfect condition. The carrying case is so great and I love how it will keep all my new brushes and the ones I already own all in one place. Between this brush set and the eyeshadow palette, I&#x27;m so pleased and will definitely purchase more Shany products from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I just resived my brushes threw the mail and they are super soft and pretty i am in love and i can&#x27;t wait to use them i know you will love them too. They come in a pretty elegant pouch that matches the brushes and trhe brushes are really pretty and soft i just cant wait so order your Shany Cosmetic Brushes today :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautifully constructed and they WORK! They are exactly what I was looking for. I always saw tutorials of how to do smokey eye, etc, and these brushes help you do that! They are professional brushes for Makeup Beginners. The pouch makes them easy to store and keeps any dust or unwanted particles away! Great product! :)</li>
            <li> I received all individual items as described, each in their own plastic packaging and in good condition. I cant wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> Great gift for a girl of almost any age, wide variety of material.</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay..... Definitely not the best ( you get what you pay for)  bought these to take with me on a cruise because I did not want to bring my good stuff. They got the job done, I personally feel like elf brushes are better considering how cheap they are.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes. They are okay for personal use, but if you are interested in buying them for professional use then I would suggest buying a different and more expensive brand. The eye shadow brushes are not very soft or thick but they do hold the makeup well and that is why I gave them four stars.</li>
            <li> Had a smell, but i washed them.  Does not apply  make up the same as my other brushes. Bissell are hard and itchy</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back, and I&#x27;m still using it today.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to replace my makeup brushes for sometime and when I found this set at a very reasonable price, I decided it was worth trying out.  At the very least, I figured it would be a good secondary travel set.  Mine came in a red pouch that rolls up and ties. I especially love the blush brush, large powder brush, slanted eyeliner blush for applying gel eyeliner, and the three flat brushes which I use for eyeshadow, but which are probably for shadown, concealer, and foundation.  I prefer to use a larger flat foundation brush to apply powder mineral concealer, and am still using my old brush for that.  I have typically used brushes from mark, Ulta, DHC and Sonia Kashuk for Target... I actually like these brushes better than my previous brushes... Now, I need to look for a new kabuki brush. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> daughter loves these brushes... great buy and fast delivery</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever had. After a few days of use the tops just popped off. Also the bristles on the brush don&#x27;t hold any eyeshadow pigment at all! I started looking for new brushes after a few days. DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
            <li> I bought this small set as a gift for a teenager, I thought it would make a great starter set. The delivery was VERY prompt and the price is EXCELLENT! It did have a very strong leathery smell which it takes a few washes to get rid off, but for the price and considering for who and what I bought them for very worth it.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for the price. No shedding at all. Soft. Mine came in a beautiful red. I couldnt be happier with them. I think the quality is better than any drugstore brush your going to find. For a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters. They say that they love them. \\&quot;They&#x27;re so much better than the cheep ones we were using.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Received the brushes with red handle and black plastic fibers. Not at all in accordance with the claim of \\&quot;natural fibers\\&quot;. The only \\&quot;good\\&quot; thing about this set is the pouch which smells and feels like buttery leather...great if I hadn&#x27;t ordered it for the BRUSHES! Very disappointed, but from the other reviews I guess it&#x27;s luck of the draw.  Returning these, and ordering more studio line brushes and calling it a day.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes are not great quality, they don&#x27;t spread the blush powder and face powder around as easily as other brushes I have used. All the other brushes are excellent so I am only taking one star off because this set is so reasonably priced. The carrying case is quite nice and very pretty.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews before buying these in hope they will be okay. For Approx $15, they are fantastic and I adore my brushes. They have every brush I require, the handles are sturdy and the wood &amp; finish on them isn&#x27;t chipped.&lt;br /&gt;People on here have gone on about the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; of them. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s just a \\&quot;new factory\\&quot; kind of smell and i wasn&#x27;t bothered by it at all. The pouch is soft and in 100% good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles themselves are a lot better than i expected. Some malt bristles occasionally and they are fairly soft (they aren&#x27;t going to be the softest you&#x27;ve ever bought, you need to be logical when its $15 ) but I own a $70.00 Kabuki brush and even that occasionally malts bristles and loses its softness after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend buying these for any home make up use. Professionally, probably not; however, as a starter kit or spare kit absolutely!</li>
            <li> I loved loved loved this set when I received it, and the case it came in I fell in love.</li>
            <li> fantastic brushes! soft and good quality. they make makeup application so easy, and the finshed look is s smooth and even!</li>
            <li> Make up brushes are usually super expensive so I tend to avoid even purchasing whole sets. This set is awesome! The variations of brushes and the foldable cloth container they come in make it perfect for travel in a small carry on. They take up the same amount of space as a flip flop pretty much. Great quality and they arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome makeup brush set.  The only thing I wish it had was an inscription on each brush to tell you what type of brush it is.  I am not even close to being a professional makeup woman and I have no idea what most of these brushes are supposed to be used for.</li>
            <li> The Brushes are wonderful, exactly what I needed for my profession. Can&#x27;t wait to start using all the brushes.They are soft and exactly what was ordered.thank you</li>
            <li> When I saw these brushes online they immediately caught my eye because of the color. I absolutely love the red and the bristles are an auburn red so it&#x27;s a real nice contrast.. These brushes look real fancy, I thought I was getting a good deal for the price.. But I was very dissatisfied... The bigger brushes are wayy too soft.. So soft I can barely get any product on it.. I use compressed powder blush and bronzer and every time I use it with these brushes it looks like I am putting nothing on my face... The fan brush is the same... I don&#x27;t see how anyone can use these brushes at all... The smaller brushes like the foundation, concealer and eye brushes are a lot firmer and they definitely get more product but.. I bought this set mainly for the bigger brushes and... They are of no use to me... I even used the bigger brushes with loose powder and still did not work... However.. I was impressed with the time I received my purchase and the nice red pouch that the brushes came in... But.. I hate these brushes.. I probably will use maybe 3 out of the twelve that come with this set..</li>
            <li> I loved the product and I got it right on time.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad but nothing special. Good for teenager but not woman who needs reliable application. Bristles tend to splay out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. One thing about them they sometimes shed.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase I believe. Brushes are good for the price. One thing I thought was misleading is it says 13pc set with pouch. There are not 13 brushes, there are 12. So I guess the pouch is considered one of the 13 pieces, even though its mentioned seperately. Probably my fault for not counting the brushes in the pictures on there. Oh well, overall, 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I saw this brush set on a beauty website calling it the best buy in brushes for the money.  It just arrived in the mail and I am thrilled!!!</li>
            <li> Love them overral. They felt a little rough right out of the package, but after I washed and air dried them they were soft. Definitely a very strong weird smell when you first open them, but that also goes away once you wash them completely.</li>
            <li> When I first got these brushes, I was in Heaven!  They were soft, applied smoothly on my skin, and loved the very organized case it came with.  However, after a month using the brushes, I noticed the bristles started coming off:(((  Very disappointed...that should not have happened.  I&#x27;m going to try to get it exchanged somehow.</li>
            <li> This was my first step to buying a brush set, but I heard great reviews and decided to try it out... in my opinion there are a few that I really don&#x27;t see the point in, I feel like it would have been better to trade a few in... but for a starter kit it has really helped me and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li> i got my sister this makeup brushes for her birthdya and she says that she is in love with them!&lt;br /&gt;she loves the color, the material and how soft they are!</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I loooooove them! The one thing that i noticed at first was how soft they are. They feel like... they are as soft as... THEY ARE SO SOFT! Anyway, it came in a red plastic roll/up case which is great for traveling. And there are a few brushes at first glance that might look like they are the same, but there are a few slight differences. Such as, there are three small eyeshadow brushes, that look the same, but the others are longer and wider. So dont be confused! i thought they were the same at first also. I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> The brushes shed a lot and aren&#x27;t good quality, plus they smelled terrible for a couple of weeks after I opened the package. Most of them have broken by now. I&#x27;ve had to glue some back together, others were useless anyway so I tossed them.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered my brushes online, usually I buy in store to check quality, but I am thoroughly satisifed with the quality and price!</li>
            <li> ( I used my sis husband account to buy this product, lol )I am so happy I received the brushes in perfect conditions, an excellent packaged, and I got it in red color! I did not ask for that but I was hoping to get it in red color my favorite! I am not worry if the red-imitation leather bag its not fancy etc I can get another one anytime, anyways the most important thing here is that brushes are beautiful and useful, thanks and good luck in your shopping!....

            <li> I was not impressed by these brushes at all. They are not very soft, one of my brushes came bent up and I&#x27;ve never been able to bend it back so I never got to use it, the brushes are definitely not as lush/dense as the pictures make them out to be, the pouch fell apart within my first month of using the set, and the tops of the brushes have become to fall off and i have now lost the usage of half of my brushes. But not everything was bad. I loved the color, they cleaned pretty easily and did not become rough after being cleaned, they came to my house very quickly and they were a pretty good price. Granted buying two sets of EcoTools brushes is only slightly more expensive and I&#x27;ve never had problems with their brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Came quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Good price&lt;br /&gt;-Pretty color&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-One brush came ruined&lt;br /&gt;-Not very soft&lt;br /&gt;-The bristles were pretty sparse&lt;br /&gt;-Black tops holding the bristles are falling off; appear to not actually be adhered the red sticks&lt;br /&gt;-Red pouch wore out quickly and fell apart after a month of (gentle!) daily use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these brushes we just okay. I recommend buy EcoTools brushes (there is a set of small brushes and bigger brushes) for a couple more dollars and double the usage time.</li>
            <li> I just got this set in today and I already love them! Yes, they stink but if you read they say you need to wash them BEFORE you use them for the first time. I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t back out of buying these! These will definitely get used on my wedding day in September!</li>
            <li> I ordered fro my grand daughters and a daughter and they were thrilled with them.  They have been using them since Christmas and love them.  Shows that you can still get a good buy that some one will love.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> My wife loved these brushes. She liked the leather travel pack it came in as well. She said the bristols are nice and fine for different make up styles.</li>
            <li> This brush set has so many different brushes that can be used for all different makeup applications.  I love them!</li>
            <li> Brushes are lush and well made. However it would&#x27;ve been perfect if each brush&#x27;s use were etched on the brush handle instead of on the little info sheet enclosed.</li>
            <li> If u are looking to build up your make-up brush set quickly, this is a smart way to do it. These are very cheep, but at a high standard. If you have a collection of good brushes already, you probably don&#x27;t need this set.&lt;br /&gt;The pouch is sweet, but not professional, so depending on your use for these brushes will determine if it&#x27;s useful or not.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and at a very cheap price! The brushes are very soft so they don&#x27;t irritate your face, as well as there are multiple types of brushes. One for your every need!!</li>
            <li> I think this has been one of my best purchases !!! The brushes are soft and they work awesome on your skin!!! It brings all the brushes needed !!! ITS AWESOME !!!</li>
            <li> I love my Shany brush set. All of the bristles are incredibly soft. The bright red is cheerful and fun -especially first thing in the morning. There is a brush for everything. This set is great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I spent years using the same dinky brushes from dollar general..you really dont know what your missing until you get it!  I only use the smaller eye ones but they&#x27;re great.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a pretty color and they come in a nice pouch.  That is about all that is positive that can be said about them.  They are very poor quality and the fibers fall out on your face while you&#x27;re trying to use them.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, so I&#x27;m not as educated in brushes as others might be, but I love this set! It&#x27;s incredible, the colors are bright and really cute. Would recommend for the great price, and the quality -- have not had a brush be damaged yet, just make sure you wash them first!</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews on these brushes, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get them. I was looking for some new brushes and these seemed like the perfect fit. When I got them in I was so excited to open up the box, but what I found dampened my mood. Both blush brushes and foundation brush were in shambles, the hairs were all messed up and bent, going in all sorts of directions. Then, the hair on both brushes are very coarse and itchy-not soft at all.  The little sponge on the blending brush had come off completely.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m sad. Really sad. Because I had high hopes for these brushes based on all the great reviews. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much anyway based on the price (about $20 with shipping) but I would have rather gone to the grocery store and bought brushes that were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I lOVE it ! So soft and so cheap! It is so much better than I thought! Thank you! Perfect!</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely good quality, which is shocking for the price !&lt;br /&gt;Easy to carry around with me and I&#x27;m considering trying some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.,  i only use like one brush out of all them. and the brush carrier thing is pretty handy though but it makes things red if it left somewhere for two long</li>
            <li> Love my brushes. Got the red color that was pictured. This was a great buy . Going to buy some for my friend.</li>
            <li> First of let me just say, I am not a make up snob, however, after ordering this cheap brush set, I can definitely ask myself, \\&quot;what was I thinking?\\&quot;  I worked as a make up artist for Estee Lauder for several years &amp; love their brushes, however, they can be pricey to replace.  After my 14 month old thoroughly destroyed one of my favorite eyeshadow brushes, I broke down &amp; decided to try my luck with a cheaper brush; boy did I make a mistake.  Although the price seemed too good to be true, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it beat spending $28.00 for a new Lauder eyeshadow brush.  It&#x27;s my fault for expecting slightly better quality than the synthetic bristles that make up some of these brushes.  The bristles will not grab/hold on to the eyeshadow when I try using it, it simply falls off creating a mess.  The the lash comb/brow brush tool was pointless.  The teeth on the eyelash comb were melted together, rendering it useless.  I realize that you get what you pay for, but I would suggest spending a little extra money if you want quality.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price! They work very well! I even purchased a second set for my teenage daughter. We both use every day.</li>
            <li> After using the brushes for only a few days I have noticed a few bristles are coming out this isn&#x27;t a huge problem but im concerned at how long they will last. So far the brushes are great, soft and a great variety, not to mention brushes for this price, completely unbeatable. but be nice to your brushes!</li>
            <li> Great service! Very speedy delivery. The makeup brush kit was much prettier in person. I&#x27;m a pro makeup artist for 12 years, so I&#x27;m not easy to please, but these brushes were very, veryyyy high quality, and the set has quite an array of brushes that can be used professionally and personally. I cheat and use mine for myself, too, after cleaning, of course. The case is what I absolutely love. Mine is in my fave color - red, and in buttery soft leather. All my friends and sisters want one, too, and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced, I think I know what I&#x27;m getting everyone for Christmas. Probably my fave purchase ever online!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and  a great product. The package got here in one day and I was in love with the case it comes in. The brushes themselves are nice quality and they are soo soft. Definitely an awesome buy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that the quality would be good because of the price, but I was very surprised! But really, for that price?! they&#x27;re super soft, and very gentle on my skin. very awesome. (Y) :}</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing for the price.  They are full and soft, and the carrying case is good quality too.  I plan to get a set of these for each of my nieces for Christmas.  They will be a dream for those of us who travel for work since you can fold them up into such a compact package while still being able to carry a full set of 13 brushes.  I absolutely adore this set.</li>
            <li> brush tops are not secure and fall off</li>
            <li> I was amazed how nice this set was when i received it. the red case is so cute and the brushes are full and sturdy. a + set.</li>
            <li> it came in a timely matter. was very please n satifide with it. had lots of make up tools you need to do make up. very good price n nice bag.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated these brushes. At first, they were soft and smooth, but the plastic case smells strongly of plastic. I didn&#x27;t think that it would have been a big deal because I had read this on other comments but it was nauseating. Also, the brushes were quite long, longer than expected or shown in the picture. Also, they shed a lot. I used the larger power brush once and it shed at least ten hairs on my face. They felt very nice, but flimsy as well. I loved the price, but that was about it. I am saving my money for a good quality set from Sigma, Sephora or MAC. But if that is not an option for you, they try the ELF brushes. They are very nice and only $1-$5 a piece. The Essential line is the cheapest at $1, but some of the brushes are not that good. So I would go with the Studio line at $3 a piece. Much better and have never shed on me. Good Luck finding a set!</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a Christmas gift for my sister after reading all of the good reviews.  Have I ever been so embarrassed as when she opened the set (for the first time, I hadn&#x27;t opened it yet) and bristles were sitting on the brushes.  She gave a few gentle pulls on the bristles to see if the loose hairs were from the brushes and each gentle pull resulted in more and more bristles falling out of the brushes.  I have honestly never seen such cheap quality brushes.  Save your money and either get a smaller, higher quality set, or buy a bunch of cheaper and mid-range products from CVS or Target.  The item did come properly packaged and on time.  The case the brushes come in is cheap but handy and a little cute.</li>
            <li> This Brush set from Shanys Cosmetics are so Amazing! The red brush roll holder is so soft and the leather smell like leather...Love the quality of the brush holder and Brushes..The handles are easy to hold and the ferral is really sturdy where the hairs are. These Brushes are really soft and great to use. Feel great to the touch...Im very impressed! so happy with this set...I will defiantly be buying more from this wondeful company. The shipping was super fast and everything was wrapped perfect so my products would not come damaged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Treishapromua</li>
            <li> I cannot believe these brushes get good reviews!  Nevermind the fact that the bag is cheap-looking and has an overwhelming chemical smell, because I could air that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my Estee Lauder brush cleaner to clean the brushes, because they too had the overwhelming smell of chemicals.  I was pretty disgusted by how much black crud dripped into my sink from brand new brushes.  Still, I got them cleaned and figured they&#x27;d be okay.  NOPE!  I&#x27;ve never had brushes shed so badly.  I don&#x27;t know if the set I got was defective, but I absolutely would not buy Shany brushes again because of this experience.  I&#x27;d rather pay more for brushes that don&#x27;t leave hairs all over my face or come with black chemicals still in them.</li>
            <li> After reading all the bad reviews i was kinda worried, then i recieved them today and they are fantastic. it says 13 piece it comes with 12 brushes and the 13th piece is the soft case that it comes in. I recieved the color that was pictured and thats what i was hoping for so that was a bonus for me..the brushes dont shed, they are soft and i love it!!!</li>
            <li> My brushes just arrived and I thought the packaging was really cute! The brushes are soft &amp; nice to the face. Good price for this quality.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter She loved the brushes I used them a couple of times and loved the texture of the brushes for the  value!  I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> This set is okay but I have bought better brushes at the drug store. The bristles are a too stiff. Even with the low price, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I would spend the extra money to get my brushes elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Decent set of beginner brushers. Have been using them daily for about 2 months and each brush has held up just fine. Brushes aren&#x27;t very soft after about 5th use, but they were very inexpensive so I&#x27;m not surprised at this. No shedding as of yet.</li>
            <li> Just received the order so have not had time to try it.  Brushes look just right, though.  Anxious to try them all.  My only complaint would be there is no explanation of what each brush is used for.  That would be nice.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes in this work well! That said, I was less than impressed with the eyelash/eyebrow brush, foundation brush, and blush brush.  The foundation and blush brushes shed constantly!  I&#x27;d be covered with small fibers, as if I had just cut my bangs and let the little hairs land where they may.  The foundation brush completely fell apart the second time I washed it!  The eyelash/eyebrow brush never worked well, it hardly made a difference.</li>
            <li> The brushes are ok... But I find that when I&#x27;m putting my makeup on a lot of the hair in the brushes will be pulled out easily...</li>
            <li> I like the variety it gives you. Easy to use and wash. Plus the cute case it comes in is super handy</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a quick buy without much thought since the price was really good.  Yeah well, it smelled so bad after I opened the package that I had to put it outside to air out.  I am only writing this review because I have it outside on my deck and it smells worse than a new vinyl shower curtain! I swear my throat is irritated right now.  I noticed that one of the brushes had some old silver paint? on it that won&#x27;t rub off.  And since I am no makeup expert I don&#x27;t know which brush to use for what.  I agree with the other reviewer that the elf brands are way better for this price and I would have known which brush to use for which part of my face!  I don&#x27;t know how the brushes are but if they still smell this bad (yes the brush hairs also smell) I am throwing them out!  Mad I spent any money on this already.  I should have read the reviews first and not last, oh well, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I love love love my new brushes i got today (: The standard shipping was fast . The ONLY bad thing for me personaly, was the color. i was hoping sososo bad i would get ANY color besides red...but thats what i got/: I really wish i had gotten a more feminem color but i guess i cant complain for the price! thanx alott&lt;3</li>
            <li> Just ordered these brushes on saturday night and got them monday evening. FAst shipping. When ordering i was a bit hesitant, but now that i got them, and i see them with my eyes, they are great. The brush handles are in a nice ruby red color they are very sturdy and the brushes themselves are soft to the touch. I love how they just glide on my skin when applying my beauty products. I am planning on ordering another set for my sister.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes so much! i bought some and are in love! i hope to buy more soon they dont shed!</li>
            <li> These are good brushes that are easy to wash to clean, without losing most of their bristles as soon as you use or wash them. Nice starter set and enough variety for any need you might have.</li>
            <li> These came in just as expected and I got a red/orange color. It didn&#x27;t really have any kind of bad smell, each brush was wrapped in it&#x27;s own protective baggy. I found myself to only finding about half useful. So far I don&#x27;t notice a lot of shedding and for the price(somewhat matching its quality), they&#x27;re better than buying professional ones if you don&#x27;t have to much extra $ to spend.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes they are soft and catch on to product well. love the pouch it comes in too. came faster than i thought also:)</li>
            <li> DO NOT get these brushes. They fell apart in my hand the second I used them. I know they are cheap, but they are cheap for a reason!</li>
            <li> I HATE these brushes. First off, the photo makes the brushes look large and very useful. Not the case. The brushes are small and brittle. The eyeshadow brushes aren&#x27;t very versatile either and there isn&#x27;t much of a variety. The bristles are rough and come apart easily. I&#x27;m constantly having to pick them off my face. The only plus I have is that they came in the mail quickly. I guess you get what you pay for and these were cheap cheap CHEAP. Do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> These brushes shed less than my previous brushes. The odor of the case does fade, as others have mentioned. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> These brushes shed so much.  I would not recommend me them. Particulary the powder brush and blush brush.  Spend a little more money and get a better set. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a really greast set of brushes; quality of brush fibers are great and handles are beautifully manufactured. Even the red bag that comes with the set is made to last. Packaging was eye catching as well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are not the greatest quality.  The brushes are constantly loosing bristles.  They serve the purpose but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Great starter set without breaking the bank. There are A lot of brush sets on amazon but i saw a makeup tutorial on YouTube and these were advised by the video&#x27;s guru after she had disastrous luck looking for good quality brushes on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these have a majority of the brushes i was looking for but buying a few solo brushes isn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this i would recommend getting a pencil brush because this set doesn&#x27;t have one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also the case kinda smelled funny when i received it in the mail, however i didn&#x27;t use the case(brushes are worth the crap case)</li>
            <li> I found these brushes to be of great quality for the price. I&#x27;ve had them for almost two weeks and I&#x27;m pretty happy with them, and would recommend these to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend, who didn&#x27;t have many brushes to begin with, and she LOVED them! The box they came in looked very sleek and professional. The brushes themselves are very good quality (especially for the price). I would definitely recommend this set to anyone, especially if they are just starting out.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes in a nice little soft vinyl roll-up kit that ties.  The brushes aren&#x27;t phenomenal quality, but they&#x27;re pretty nice for the amazing price.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set for myself and my sister. They are wonderful. Very well made we both love them. Would definitely recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> The hairs keep falling out. It is a disaster to try to put makeup on with them. DO NOT BUY THESE! it is worth your money to buy expensive, high quality brushes. If you take care of them they will last forever. This was not a good product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them.  I am going to purchase a few for gifts in the next few days I am so satisfied!</li>
            <li> great alterenative to expensive bruses</li>
            <li> Is not very soft. It&#x27;s nice and very helpful. The color is pretty. Is the thing I need. Like it.</li>
            <li> Loved the overall brushes. They serve their purpose and are great for the price. Have been using them almost regularly.</li>
            <li> Love them very pretty</li>
            <li> The brushes are some of the best I have ever bought. The case does smell at first butonce out of the box it starts to not smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these especially for the price and the seemingly good quality but only the brush tips themselves are nice.  Within just a few weeks (but after the time for return) the brush tips all started to come away like the glue went bad to the wooden part of their handles.  Some of them are still usable and the tips themselves are quite nice and there are a lot of them for $12.99 so I guess its suitable in that way; however I certainly would never buy them again or recommend them.</li>
            <li> The delivery was excellent and very quick and I love the brushes, well worth the price - everything went smoothly and I am very pleased. I tried ordering a set of brushes from another vendor here and it was disastrous but this transaction made up for it.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of brushes and the price, the bag is beautiful nice leather, the brushes aren&#x27;t super soft may be is because am used to the painting brushes, am new in the world of make up, but one thing i say they are a very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Obviously these are not the fanciest or best made brushes out there, but that&#x27;s why they are so affordable. I think they are perfectly suited for your average makeup wearing individual...There is an insert included that lets you know what each brush is for, which I found to be helpful not knowing the first thing about makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought it as part of a birthday gift for my sister. She was very excited and pleased with this product. I will be buying one for myself. and delivery was fast and came exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Love the color and that they are soft. is perfect when buying with a makeup set. One thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell of the material .is very strong but I would recommended for those makeup lovers.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to replace my older makeup brushes, and it was long overdue. The product comes in a beautiful red leather carrying case with individual slots for each brush, great for traveling. My brushes also tend to get a little dirty, so the case will definitely help prevent that. I used super-saver shipping on this item, and I kind of regret it. I have bought several other items that, when shipped with only other Shany items, made their way to my home without delay. Because I chose super-saver shipping that included products from other companies, it took me twice as long to receive this item. This is definitely not Shany&#x27;s fault, I would just recommend shipping the item seperately from other items in your cart if you are in a hurry to get it. Shany has been an awesome product for me thus far, i intend to purchase more from their company in the future. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional- just an average girl trying to improve her looks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of these brushes.  In fact, I went back to applying makeup with my fingers after only using these for a few weeks. I thought they smelled yucky, they were more coarse feeling than I thought they&#x27;d be, and I dislike needing to wash and dry them after every use.</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  I truly love them.  they are handy in their own carring case and make appling make up so much easier. There is such a large variety of brushes to use.  I am so happy I purchased this item, I keep mine in my travel bag and I always have the right brushes when I travel.</li>
            <li> These make up brushes are ok I guess they aren&#x27;t the best quality and to me they looked pink but they&#x27;re red but anyways they were a pretty good price so my only complaint really is they&#x27;re kinda cheaply made</li>
            <li> Article is acceptable, filled my expectations. recommended to other buyers. is very practical and good presentation, good quality and is appropriate to the publication and price. Thanks for the prompt delivery and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing these brushes and i have to say i love them! They&#x27;re super soft, well made, and i love the color (mine were red and black). Also concerning the smell mine, didn&#x27;t smell horrible they smelled like new brushes.</li>
            <li> I have had these for nearly a year. Still working great and in excellent shape. These lasted longer than my MAC set!</li>
            <li> bought these for my granddaughter for her birthday this past august.  the set seemed nice although I haven&#x27;t used them myself.  one thing that was not okay was that the metal brush tip was only sticky back tapped to the wooden part of the brush and the brush tips were falling off. could be fixed I suppose. poorly made product.</li>
            <li> Only use a few of the brushes regularly but I love them. They&#x27;ve held up well after a year or so of use.</li>
            <li> This is such a good price for this set. I bought one for my daughter who is just starting to use make-up.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush set for the price. If you enjoy makeup this is a great starter set. Just make sure to wash them before using them because there is an odd smell/powder residue on the brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes for the u get get good quality brushes. And the red leather case it came in is very stylish. I would buy these again</li>
            <li> I recieved these items on time and in good shape.  I love these brushes.  They are soft natural hair.  They really hold the Shany colors well and make applying them very easy.  I like to use brushes to apply makeup anyway. These are quality brushes.  They work as well if not better than more expensive brushes.  I highly recommend these brushes to all women.  They are soft, well shaped, and easy to use. I think everyone will agree if they try these, that they are wonderful.  LINDA W</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t tried these brushes out, I am strongly contemplating getting them, because they look great.  I love to layer different colors of eyeshadows on my eyes, and realize the mess that applying them on with my fingers can create.  I am looking for an eyeshadow applicator that will last, and will not get destroyed with repeated use. I am also looking for a good foundation brush and a good blush brush, and feel that these would be good items to get.</li>
            <li> This product is both pretty and inexpensive. So far, my expierence with make up brushes in all has been that its difficult to find brushes that look nice and dont burn a hole in pockets, If you get what I mean but this set come with a roll and in a very attractive color seems like something anyone interested in makeup would want to try.</li>
            <li> Before owning the Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch, I never really had a complete set like this. I have been wanting to get a set for so long but they were always priced way to high for me to afford. I really enjoy my other Shany Cosmetic products and thought I&#x27;d give this set a try and I cannot seem to put it down!!! I&#x27;ve always loved doing my makeup but never took a real interest in using eye shadow until this past year. My pouch came in a pretty red color and I love that it has a flap that covers up all of your brush heads before you roll it up. It&#x27;s great that it comes like this because you can easily take it with you in your purse if you need to, or if you dont have a big bathroom (like myself) its hard to find a spot for everything and the roll up bag makes it easy. I have really enjoyed playing with all the different brushes and finding out which ones do this or that. I would definately suggest this item to anyone if they were looking for a new brush set. I forgot to mention that the mineral powder brush is really quite soft and doesnt feel like sandpaper to your face like kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve used before. I used to be a Mary Kay Senior Consultant and used their mineral power \\&quot;kabuki\\&quot; brush for what seems like years. I now realize that The Shany brush Set has really great quality and spreads the powder effotlessly and evenly.I&#x27;ve only had these a couple of weeks but they seem to be holding up well. Of course you get your occassional shedded hair but I think I should have rinsed them off and let them dry first to get out most of the loose/unglued hairs.</li>
            <li> I been researching many brushes so I can start my makeup collection. I didn&#x27;t want to buy high end brushes since I don&#x27;t want to hop on the MAC or Sigma brushes bandwagon. I just want something that gets the job done at a great price. So when found this brush set I didn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase them. 13 pc brush set for $12.99!! That&#x27;s a dollar each ladies! You cant beat that. When they arrived I was so excited to try them. After washing them and letting them dry I lightly tugged on the hair and I had no fall out. I love using all the brushes especially the face/powder and blush brush!! So soft by the way. So don&#x27;t hesitate and purchase the set if you have been looking for brushes :)</li>
            <li> I just recently bought these brushes and they are great. The first time I used them a couple of stay hairs fell out but they have been fine since then. There is a nice verity in size which is great and you get a lot of brushes for the price. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li> These brushes do amazing things for the price! And the carrying pouch is awesome!! I use these anytime I&#x27;m traveling to save from having to pack up individual brushes! Definitely check these out!! The shedding is minimal, only shed the first time I used and washed them, which is pretty common.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great way to jump into makeup application.  You get 12 brushes for applying face, eye, lip products and the neat brush roll.  These are great for beginners because you can learn how to use the brushes and care for them without having to pay $30 per brush at the fancy stores.</li>
            <li> First of all, THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING. They work perfectly, and there SOO soft. Some reviews say that they smell REALLY bad, I DIDNT notice a weird smell. i think they smelled like cupcakes when i opened them. and the carrying case it comes in is so cute. Sephora and Mac charge 15.00 per brush.. BUY ON AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these brushes - I could have paid a lot more for pretty much the same thing.  I like the roll-up pouch holder - apparently the color of the pouch may vary, but mine matched the brush handles in red.  The tie for the pouch appears to be sewn on well so I don&#x27;t see it coming off in the near future.  The brushes themselves come in a nice variety and some of the fluffier, larger ones have a vinyl brush cover to help keep their shape when being stored.</li>
            <li> I like this brushes,  but when I started using them some of hairs in the brushes started to fall a lot and it has annoying and hard to do my make up using the brushes, and the angle brush does not work very good, I did not like it.</li>
            <li> I needed something bigger than just what comes in the make up package. These are great and have a leather-like case to keep them all in. Love it. Just what I needed! I haven&#x27;t used them all, but when I need to I&#x27;ll have what I need. It&#x27;s nice to have a bundle rather than not have what you need.</li>
            <li> Wow!I didnt expect these brushes to be so huge!!!! So many brushes too,its a great buy for only $15. I love that I got a red Pouch to match the brushes. I was worried what color I would get haha.These brushes really feel and look like they will last. My fan brush did get a little crushed by the pouch because of they way it was wraped up but still great.</li>
            <li> for my make up. Not the quality I expected but good price for the set. The brushes ok the brush bag not good.</li>
            <li> I received the 24pc Shany Cosmetic Professional Brush set as a christmas gift this year. I love how incredibly soft the brushes are. The eye shadow brushes are a little flat, and I&#x27;m one to like more fluffy brushes for blending, but I have some of those too so it&#x27;s not a big deal on my part. The brushes don&#x27;t shed, which I LOVE! I highly reccomend this product. The price is unbelievable for the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for one of my children, and according to my daughter-she&#x27;s not pleased w/the quality of the brushes and suggested Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> the brushes were in no way soft, and they feel apart really easily. Cheaply made to me and i just didn&#x27;t enjoy them at all.</li>
            <li> Super affordable and are not rink dink brushes that suck. These brushes ROCK! Shany is the best! I look forward to using more of there products in the future.</li>
            <li> Loved how good they are so glad I got it. Only thing is it tool awhile to get her but they are awesome.</li>
            <li> The brushes came well packaged and on time. None of them were damaged or bent. The brushes were soft and gentle. All of the brushes it shows in the picture were in the set. I just wish there was a bigger variety</li>
            <li> These are great brushes. They are easy to work with and easy to clean. And I have recommended them to my friends. I love makeup and have had a blast using all these great brushes. They are great for everyday use and the extra tools come in handy for special occasions as well. The loss of bristles stopped after one or two uses for me. For the price I would have to say they are the best buy I could find after searching for days.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect because of the price! If you are a proffessional it may be worth it to invest in a more expensive brand- but for me- they work great- and are very cheap.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes and I LOVE them! In my opinion, they&#x27;re great for beginners because they&#x27;re durable,there&#x27;s plenty of choices in this package and they&#x27;re inexpensive. My makeup looks so much better since I started using these and they make applying makeup kind of fun!</li>
            <li> This is a good starter set of brushes. They lasted about a year before they started shedding and the hair started fraying. My fan brush didn&#x27;t look anything like the one in the photos though, it was very thin and not useful at all, and my other brushes weren&#x27;t quite as full, so don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with that.</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are awesome quality.  They look good and suit my wife&#x27;s needs.  The look like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are very soft and Gentle on my skin. There is a brush for everything in the kit. There are 12 makeup brushes and a gorgeous pouch. I got the Red one which is the color i wanted it is a bright Cherry Red and i love it. My only complaint is that when you open the pouch one of the first things you notice is what is that horrible smell? It is the brushes. The smell will go away after you wash the brushes though. I washed the brushes with some makeup remover, a tiny bit of lotion, and water. Over all great bushes i love them!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed with these brushes, firstly the \\&quot;big\\&quot; ones are small and really only work for blush or highlighting/shading.  I really use the smaller ones though, they are great for eyeshadow but I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d waste my money on these again.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a good price, live the texture soft and works perfectly blended the make n eye shadow LUV it</li>
            <li> This set seriously stinks! I couldn&#x27;t handle it, literally, the handles stink too, not just the bag. I am returning, I tried airing it out as other had suggested and the smell didn&#x27;t budge. I personally don&#x27;t think it can be healthy inhaling the fumes.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife after reading the reviews and sure it did not disappoint. She loves it. It comes in a nice red pouch and it has all the brushes she would probably need. Nice product.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed is the bag or carrier (however you want to name) and I like a lot!&lt;br /&gt;You get a complete set of brushes needed to wear you facial makeup. As far as price, I dont even have to say anything about that, its perfect for what I got. Im happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you love getting done up and don&#x27;t want to spend $100+ on make up brushes, GET IT!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes a few weeks ago and i love them! I previously had some drug store brushes that i hated! im so happy i got these but the only thing bad about it is that they do loose a lot of hair. But overall there good:) overall it was about $20 very good price!</li>
            <li> amazing price. great prouduct! i am very happy with the brush set and the carrying case is small and just perfect! i am interested to see what other products this company has! great buy</li>
            <li> These are really pretty brushes! So far none of the hairs have fallen out and they don&#x27;t feel too rough or stiff. It&#x27;s not a chore to apply makeup with them either. Yay! :)</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for myself after Christmas and I absolutely love them! I was a little cautious about buying them because I was under the impression good brushes cost a lot - that is not at all true! These brushes a very soft and durable, (mine still look brand new) they also do a good job of picking up a lot of pigment. I raved about these brushes so much after I got them that one of my sisters bought them. She uses them all of the time now too!</li>
            <li> This set comes with a large set of soft brushes and a nice carrying case. I love these brushes, they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!!!! They are everything I have ever wanted in a brush set. The case is perfect for on the go, I take it everywhere. They are super easy to clean and feel good when you are using them!!! A must have in the collection, that is for sure!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pretty annoyed at everyone who gave this product a good rating. I am in no way an expert of makeup products, but how this brush set has an average rating of 4 stars baffles me. I guess if you want to rate the brush set based on value, then yes, 4 stars for a 13 pc brush set that cost $13 is worth it. As for the brushes themselves, they don&#x27;t even deserve one star. They are brittle, rough, and the hairs fall out constantly. After applying my powder and eyeshadow, I had to carefully pick hair after hair off of my face that had fallen out of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this brush set. You&#x27;ll be just as annoyed as I am when you have to return them. Thank goodness I have Prime, otherwise I&#x27;d be more pissed than I am right now.</li>
            <li> Not only is the set a great bargain, but it can be used for everyday makeup, traveling, and for professional use. I would especially recommend this to beginners because they are easy to use and there is almost no seeding, and what does shed is very little</li>
            <li> I have never had a brush set in my life, just a few random brushes that came with makeup. I can say that these are wonderful and the little hairs don&#x27;t end up all over your face like with other brands.</li>
            <li> okay these items are very soft and nice but ive had them for about three months already and the brushes have been shedding and the I liner brush was way to fluffly and I would. rather use a more stuck together brush. and one more thing is that the brushes come out red and the hair part is not half blonde and half brown their just brown. besides that these brushes are great.</li>
            <li> I just received my brush set and I am very pleased, it looks exactly like the online picture and I can&#x27;t wait to use them. It has a lovely red case that folds up for easy storage and the brush quality is pretty good. It is a great buy for a beginner like myself.</li>
            <li> These have a distinct made-in-China look (and smell--ugh--though I assume this will fade over time), but let&#x27;s put things this way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already owned a bunch of miscellaneous makeup brushes, but I recently went to the clinique counter at the department store and got made over and left with a not insubstantial amount of makeup. I despaired of actually being able to replicate the application on my own at home...then these brushes arrived. They are way better than the bits and pieces I had cobbled together and mean that I can take advantage of the pricey makeup I now own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also true that one of the foundation brushes lost a hair on its first use. Given the other reviews here speaking about high quality, I&#x27;m hoping that this was just an aberration...so far so good, I&#x27;ll say.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright. i&#x27;m neither very satisfied nor unsatisfied. What i don&#x27;t like about them is that there is just many flat brushes as opposed to blending brushes and cute other brushes. But the hair is soft, and it doesn&#x27;t fall out on your face, which is very nice. however, one of the brushes actually fell apart on me, when i was washing it. i guess the glue got messed up :(</li>
            <li> The brush set smelled a little funny at first but that wore off quickly. This was a gift for my daughter. After looking at the prices for brushes &amp; brush sets in any of the beauty stores this was a super value.</li>
            <li> Cheap but convenient. Love the color scheme and the carrying case. Folds up perfectly to fit neatly in a purse.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Tons of brushes for a great price. They barely smelled (not sure why so many people had SUPER smelly brushes), and the pouch was beautiful. They make a great gift!</li>
            <li> HATE!!!! do not get!!! they shed really bad!!!. the eyebrow brush is terrible. I couldn&#x27;t even use it. the first time I try all the bristles fell out. no I just have the comb side and that&#x27;s not great either. terrible quality!!! DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Brush Set the brush fell off and I had to super glue back on.  I&#x27;m scared to see what may happen when I try to clean them. :(</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I think quality of them are amazing. Before trying these, I brought generic brushes from Walmart and absolutely hated how my makeup looked. These brushes provides a flawless finish. What I&#x27;m really excited about is that it comes with a cute case which helps me keep the brushes in one place! Thank you SHANY! Keep making amazing products! :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how the brushes gets rough and nasty. I &#x27;m not buying these brushes anymore. I got new ones for pretty good deal and they were nice and efficient. I rate it 2 stars. :/</li>
            <li> I love it. Comes with a nice variety of brushes and the bristles are not hard and brittle. Sh any products are great</li>
            <li> Worth the price and attractive! I don&#x27;t use all of them but they don&#x27;t shed nor rough. I would use them when traveling too.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are a beginner or even if you are a pro with make up. It doesn&#x27;t make your make up look heavy. I tried using the foundation brush with a different brush and it looked as though I had too much foundation on. However, with this brush it didn&#x27;t even look like I had foundation on, which is a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about the make up brushes is that when you first get the package and open the box that its in, the smell of paint just hits you. Its not even a joke, it smells just like paint. I had to wash all my brushes before I used them. When you wash them you have to straighten the hairs out so they don&#x27;t get frizzy and you can let them air dry and if the next day they are still wet use a blow dryer and it should be fine. Just remember to straighten the hairs out with your fingers, you don&#x27;t want a frizz ball. But after that it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad or it doesn&#x27;t smell at all. It just needs a couple of washes. Also, I would recommend putting a bit of perfume in the pouch and the box if you are going to use them. Because if you don&#x27;t it will just smell like paint.&lt;br /&gt;Other then those little bugs, the brushes work great. I love using them, they are smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was new to wearing makeup and these were AMAZING starter brushes. Some of the brushes are not as good as others but they are worth the $13</li>
            <li> I just got my brush set today and I&#x27;m so phyced on using them. They are great hair quality and actually beautiful brushes. They came nicely packaged in a beautiful red is soft case and protectors around the hair of the brushes. I&#x27;m very satisfied and look toward to buying more from shany.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brushes always fall out and they are very scratchy. I was wanting a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Very soft, very professional and so far none of the hair is coming out of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for barely two weeks and they&#x27;re already shedding. It&#x27;s not fun to pick brush hairs out of your freshly done makeup.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Shany Cosmetic brushes. They work great. The bristles are soft but hold makeup well. And application is easy. Has every type of brush one could need. There was a slight paint smell coming from the bag, but it went away after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> A nice variety of brushes but the quality is just okay.  The brushes are not very soft, but stiff and plasticy.</li>
            <li> well they are nice, i have no problem with them. not the best quality, but it will get the job done, i got all the pieces, and the red color is exactly as the picture shows, the pouch they come in is not good quality either, but thats ok too. exactly what i expected. they were a little dusty though, so make sure to wash them before you use them.</li>
            <li> im in love with them. they are so soft, so gorgeous, and the pouch and everything is made of such quality you can be sure these are the best brushes set you&#x27;ll ever buy for such little money</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup anymore, but when I do, I like to do it well and for that, one needs the proper brushes.  These are amazing, especially for the price!  The brushes are soft, good quality materials and a great variety.  The case folds up nicely and should keep the brushes in good condition for some time.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my own personal use and for $13 you can&#x27;t go wrong, they are great to use, soft, versatile and great quality for the price! the only downside to these is that the hairs are not cut precisely and there are no rigid flat brushes you can use to do an eyeliner. I was disappointed with the angled brush, i wish it was stiffer but again i got 12 brushes and a great roll-up sleeve to put them away so can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing quality. I wash them all the time and little to none of the bristles come out. They are super soft and have a ton of variety. The only thing I wish is that they don&#x27;t have a lot of blending brushes but everything else is great. I love them.</li>
            <li> super speedy delivery, pack comes with a brush guide and I love them. The brushes came really fast and are wonderful quality and they fit in a nice case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some new brushes and these really fit the bill! I travel a lot and the fact that this set comes with its&#x27; own pouch that rolls up and fits in my suit case without taking up a lot of room really made it an excellent purchase. There is a brush for every thing I can imagine!  I especially like the long handles on these brushes. I do not like short brushes, so I was particularly impressed with the long handles.  I would recommend this to every one who likes to use brushes to apply makeup and especially to someone who travels.</li>
            <li> My wife said that she was really happy to get these amazing real animal bristles in a set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these brushes.  I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use all of them yet, but I love shadow brush.  The amount of shadow this applies is surprising.  I have been using very cheap brushes and these are amazing by comparison.  I took the advice of others and removed from the bag and sprayed with perfume and let dry.  I also washed them with Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo before using them.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these brushes.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a good value price-wise, but several of the brushes are too similar &amp; I had hoped for a contouring eye-shadow brush which was not included.</li>
            <li> I loved the price and it was worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order more makeup brushes again via amazon.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are ok but the big fluffy ones leave hairs all over my face. The hair is very coarse and breaks off very easily. Save your money and get a nicer set from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes. All of them have been very useful. Worth buying nice strong bristles. My makeup goes on great.</li>
            <li> The Shany professional is a great set to have. It has all the necessary elements in makeup application needed had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous. The blush brush&#x27;s bristles are soft against the skin. The red leather purse/bag is retro yet classy, and was obviously made with style in mind. It comes with twelve brushes, each with plastic covers on them so that they are not dirtied in the mail. It also comes with a pamphlet and a brochure. The pamphlet explains what the brushes are used for (this brush gets the clumps out of mascara, this is a blush brush, etc.) The brochure has advertisements for other Shany products, and ways to get free samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll feel famous applying powder or getting clumps out of mascara. And if you know how to use the brushes correctly, you&#x27;ll look like a movie star.</li>
            <li> hairs started coming out, gave foundation a streaky look</li>
            <li> These brushes were a great value! There are many brushes for all sorts of makeup uses. They are soft to the skin. I can&#x27;t wait to try other purchases from this company.</li>
            <li> lot of brushes for the price</li>
            <li> I like the brushes they are nice and long very nice colors and it comes in a beautiful case but the brushes shed while putting on makeup.I WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> The powder brush sheds a lot. I&#x27;m better off using my elf powder blush. Besides that i like the variety in the set.</li>
            <li> The brushes feel cheap and are not full as make up brushes should be. I don&#x27;t know how so many people gave it all these stars but its not worth it!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of all these people who said these are good quality brushes.... I bought them and received it last week. I wanted to use them to get ready for the graduation! As I opened the brushes to check the quality.... The hair on these brushes were already falling off! I was so upset! I returned them the next day... I may not believe in the reviews again the same way. I need more than the reviews to make sure I get a good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t believe me, when you get them you will know how good these brushes are and the quality of them. These should be for a dollar instead of 12 something dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with these if you are buying them. :)</li>
            <li> This kit is a great buy for someone who is just starting out or if your a real pro. The brushes are well made and oh-so-soft! It comes with a faux leather carrying pouch that&#x27;s great for travel. If your just starting out this set comes with a little instruction manual to help you out. I thought that little extra bit was really nice.</li>
            <li> No blending brush which I knew beforehand but it&#x27;s a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;They smell at first so wash them! I used baby shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Four of the brushes come with protective covers (I wish and thought all did) but that&#x27;s really nice for cleaning them because they are supposed to be dried upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I clean:&lt;br /&gt;I know there&#x27;s a lot of fancy brush cleaning products but I&#x27;ve done it two different home remedy ways.&lt;br /&gt;first way:&lt;br /&gt;Get a small plate and poor some Johnsons Baby shampoo into it then get your brush wet and swirl it around.  If the brushes are new, it&#x27;s harder to tell when they&#x27;re clean because no makeup will be coming out, so just use your best judgement; if they are old but just need to be cleaned, swirl them in the shampoo until the makeup stops making the soap brown (blue green ext.). Then paint circles on your hand as you rinse wish warm water so make sure each hair gets the shampoo off.&lt;br /&gt;Second way:&lt;br /&gt;I do the same as the first but instead of using Baby shampoo I use a mixture of dish soap and virgin olive oil, the dish soap is harsh on the brushes so use the oil to condition them.&lt;br /&gt;To dry:&lt;br /&gt;You never want to dry your brushes hair up.  Because any water residue will drip down into the brush and loosen the glue holding the hairs.  So that is when brush covers come in handy there is a product called the Brush Guard that you can buy separately that will protect your brushes.  I just tape them upside down to my mirror and let them dry that way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my novel helps at least one person! :P</li>
            <li> I got the 7 layer kit also and they work so well together and I am so happy with all of my makeup right now! Love Shany!!</li>
            <li> I mainly use the eye brushes in this kit. The faces brushes are ok but tend to leave bristles on your face and are not as soft as I would like.  They get the job done and are a great price.</li>
            <li> Recieved this product fast and intact! The brushes are amazing, case is soft and not cheap! Plan on buying more shany products, this one made my day!</li>
            <li> The set came very quickly. I&#x27;ve only used a few brushes, but they seem fairly durable. The bag it comes in is handy and keeps the brushes organized. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the amount I paid for them.</li>
            <li> These brushes smell like a factory or something wierd.  The brushes are not soft at all.  Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are not Salon quality, but for the price you cannot beat them!  Definitely better than anything you can find in a drugstore!  The bag is so convenient and the brushes have worked good so far for me.  The eyelash brush was crappy, maybe just a fluke, but I threw that out and added a few of my own brushes because a few of the brush handles are small enough to fit two into one slot.</li>
            <li> Ok girls if you are looking for a great cosmetic brush set this is it I was so excited to receive this product, and let me say these people don&#x27;t mess around it was delivered to my front door 2 days after I ordered it. The brushes are soft and the quality is beyond what I expected for the price. So I am a very happy costumer.</li>
            <li> I believe that these brushes are priced well but there are better brush sets out there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  -I liked that there were a lot of good eye brushes and a nice variety of eye brushes&lt;br /&gt;  -The eye brushes held up well through many washings and applications&lt;br /&gt;  -The brush selection is good. There is a power brush, blush brush, fan brush, lip brush, and many eye brushes.&lt;br /&gt;  -The eye brushes do not shed&lt;br /&gt;  -The leather pouch is good quality and rolls up nicely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  -THE FACE BRUSHES! They shed like crazy! When I use them I have to go back with the fan brush to pick up the little hairs that are stuck to my face.&lt;br /&gt;  -The metal part of the brush, along with the brush head, popped of after two uses. I was able to hot glue it back on.&lt;br /&gt;  -Not very durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for eye brushes than this may be the right set for you. If you are looking for face brushes, this is not the set for you.&lt;br /&gt;-C</li>
            <li> The brushes shed like crazy when you use them!  I bought them to replace a set I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 years and I&#x27;ve since gone back to my old set while I look for a better one.  For $11 they&#x27;re definitely the quality you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> well i liked them alot i really dont write a review until im sure what im going to post!&lt;br /&gt;i bought them like 8 months go i still use them every day i don&#x27;t remember any smell at all some hairs do fall off but hardly any i like them and have recommended them to many friends!!</li>
            <li> I was very anxious to get this product. My expectations were huge and were reached. I encannta this product. I would buy again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I wanted a set of brushes for traveling and I thought that this would be perfect. It was nicely packaged but the pouch smelled of paint, I&#x27;m sure that will go away. The brushes were nice and I got mine in a red color which was very pretty. I would recommend these if you want something for traveling that isn&#x27;t too expensive. ^^</li>
            <li> Love the colour and the variety of brushes. Puts on the makeup well. Seems durable.  The pouch is soft and gives a professional appearance.</li>
            <li> These are high quality cheap brushes that work wonderfully! I don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars on Sephora or mac brushes, these are all I need. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants quality makeup brushes for cheap!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing quality love the traveling case it comes with it&#x27;s been over a year now and still in great shape.  Good quality.  My sisters are asking for the set for christmas.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and durable. I have had mine for a little over a year, and i have used them (most of them) every day. Its time for me to get a new set, and i am coming right back to SHANY...</li>
            <li> Asked for these on my wishlist for Christmas and received them as a gift. Glad I got  them, much better price than others I looked to buy and quality seems very good so far.  The pouch isn&#x27;t of the highest quality but it works well enough for me and I didn&#x27;t buy it for the pouch.  Glad I got them.</li>
            <li> These are great quality. I was using the little applicators that come with eyeshadow kits, and they have nothing on these brushes. The little brush carrier is comes with is nice too. The only reason I took a star off it because the image is misleading. Has 17 pieces, there are several in the image there that are not in the kit. But it is advertised as a 13pc kit. They are also not the exact same brushes you see in the picture. Overall I&#x27;m happy though!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality !! They shed!! They swallow all the color and they stink like paint thinner! Case is not leather like stated either</li>
            <li> WASH BEFORE FIRST USE! Comes with a strong smell, but if you wash them when you get them, it goes away immediately. Other than that small mishap, it&#x27;s a wonderful makeup brush set! I&#x27;ve used it everyday for the past 3 months, and they never cease to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Worst brushes ever, not soft , they scrach my face, I was shocked when I opened the pachage because some of them didn&#x27;t even have enough hair !!!!</li>
            <li> i recieved these brushes as a christmas gift. overall i am very pleased with them. they are no where near my professional mac brushes but they are better than the ones ive bought at target. its a great price for what you get. only think i wish it would have came with is a kubiki foundatiin brush but i would reccommend them to anyone who isnt looking to pay $20 per brush</li>
            <li> I ordered these toreplace some old ones that were getting too ratty to use.  I only do occasional make up work these days, so I think these brushes will work fine for me.  For everyday use, I don&#x27;t know.  The bezel that holds the bristles seems like it might not hold up to constant or rough application.</li>
            <li> Professional brushes that if you keep them clean will last a very long time.  Love they way they work with makeup and would buy again.  Got my daughter some for Christmas; she loves them too.</li>
            <li> The pouch is cute and convenient and the brushes work like a charm ! Great purchase if you love makeup!</li>
            <li> I love my brushes!! the shipment was so quick!!! and fast the package was well put to together I love how soft and well it puts up with eye shawdows and blushes etc! I will order more of there product in the furture</li>
            <li> Some of the eye brushes work well. I use them for eye shadow application. The fan brush after one wash is destroyed so don&#x27;t wash it. A few of the brushes fell apart right away and many of them have a lot of fall out.  I don&#x27;t like the powder or blush brushes. They are hard and not dense enough for powder or blush application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not a horrible set if you are looking for a cheap set to give someone who is younger and just starting out with make up. I do use a handful of the brushes on a regular basis. Expect about the quality you get from ELF brushes. They are not amazing but a few of them are of decent quality. Overall after using them for about 6 months and knowing what I know now they are a decent purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a brush set from costco for about $20 which I prefer. They are not the quality you get from mac or sigma  but they are another cheap option for make up brushes if you are looking for something a little better quality but still affordable for a tight budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigma brushes if you want amazing high quality brushes and have a little more money to spend....cheaper then Mac and in my opinion as good or better quality&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costco Kirkland make up brushes, I bought my set about 2 years and they still have them on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I received this within two days and I love it!!!!!! You have everything you need to play makeup!! Wonderful!! It&#x27;s a must get!!</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are amazing and they get the job done. They look very sleek and somewhat expensive. Only problem I had with this product is the smell when you first open the box. Its not that bad but its still there. It does ware off though-after having it out for a while. Like any other Cosmetic brushes BE SURE TO WASH BEFORE YOUR FIRST TIME USE. Over all the product is good. Oh and I didn&#x27;t get any form of shedding either which is a PLUS.</li>
            <li> product was shipped on time and the product was nice everything was there my girl loved it and thank me so I guess it a okay product</li>
            <li> Some of them were great, but the face brushes are rough.&lt;br /&gt;Also they shed a lot after the first wash.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing . They blend my stuff well,&amp; they are easy to use . The Bristles don&#x27;t fall off onto your face and it makes a nice soft touch to your makeup.</li>
            <li> The brush set includes everything in the picture. It is alright for a starter set or a set for someone who doesn&#x27;t care about the quality as much. I noticed the brushes shed a lot which is annoying but overall they are okay.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes, thinking that I would receive the ones on the picture...I didn&#x27;t..&lt;br /&gt;The brushes I did receive are cheap, bristles fall out constantly, they are hard and hurt my skin. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of those classic cases of, \\&quot;You can&#x27;t judge a book by its cover.\\&quot; I have good things, as well as bad things to say about this purchase, but overall, I am pleased and happy with what I purchased at the price of which I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Obviously I am going to start out with the good things about this product!&lt;br /&gt;- Sleek appearance. These brushes have a professional look with the sleek handles.&lt;br /&gt;- Wide variety of eye brushes. This set is primarily a brush set focused on the eyes. You are given three brushes designed for your overall face.&lt;br /&gt;- SOFT BRISTLES. This one was HUGE for me. I recently spent much more on a set of \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brushes and was very disappointed at how stiff the bristles were. I actually ended up RETURNING them, and I rarely return make up products.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to store. With the carrying pouch allowing you to roll up the brushes, it makes it super easy to keep them organized.&lt;br /&gt;- Shipped with extra protection. When I opened this product, I found that the pouch was tightly rolled up, tied, and placed in a cellophane wrapper. When I unrolled the pouch, I found that each brush was wrapped in cellophane separately, and the face brushes actually come with hard plastic protectors to keep on at all times. I really thought this was great, since the larger brushes can so easily become mis-shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Cause every review has to have em right?&lt;br /&gt;- SMELL. The smell when you take this out of it&#x27;s box will literally almost knock you over. It is terrible! This is where my comment, \\&quot;You can&#x27;t judge a book by its cover,\\&quot; or by its smell in this case. Seriously, prepare yourself!&lt;br /&gt;- The pouch itself. The pouch was a huge let down in my opinion. However, I did not buy this product for the case. So if you are buying this because you really want a carrying case, don&#x27;t buy this product. The seems were sewn together VERY sloppy, and some of the sections that divide the brushes appeared to not have been sewn shut at all! Very disappointing in this aspect.&lt;br /&gt;- There is an extremely weird powder on these brushes when you open them. If you read the product description very closely, it says to be SURE to wash these brushes before your first use. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you don&#x27;t read anything else in this review, which you really should because I KNOW my make up products, make SURE you read this. When I took the brushes out of the cellophane wrappers and ran my fingers through the bristles, this weird, gross smelling powder went flying into the air. Now, I am giving this company the benefit of the doubt by assuming this powder was something that settled in these bristles upon shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, I really do like this product and for the price, I am very happy I bought it. BUT you NEED to make sure you wash these before you use them. Trust me, you do NOT want that smelly, gross stuff on your face. DO NOT WASH THESE BRUSHES WITH YOUR SHAMPOO OR DISH SOAP! These products are WAY too harsh, and they will strip your bristles. However, I am in no way saying you need to go spend $15.00 on \\&quot;special brush soap.\\&quot; I use and have always used baby shampoo on my brushes, even my expensive ones. It works great and easily washes out. Also, make sure you re-shape your brushes once you have them washed and that you let them COMPLETELY dry before you try and use them.</li>
            <li> These make-up brushes were brought to my attention on Pinterest and I ordered them immediately even though I was a bit suspicious about the low price.  I have purchesed brushes from high end retailers such as bare minerals and department store cosmetics counters and these brushes were every bit as good and came beautifully packaged in a roll-up case for easy travel.  I am a fanatic about softness on my face and this set exceeed my every expectation.  Soft brushes were soft and stiff brushes were stiff.  The price was extremely fair and I will be purchasing additional sets for both my daughter and daughter-in-law for stocking stuffers, but they would also make great bridal shower or teacher gifts as well.</li>
            <li> amazing i love the softness of these brushes. for price wise you can beat it they are so cute thinking of re ordering</li>
            <li> I am so excited to order these brushes. I have heard nothing but great things about them and they look fantastic. I love adding new tools to my collection. These are great for beginners and experts a like. Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my wife and she was thrilled with them. Even more thrilled was I with the price, these are a bargain and would recommend them to any guy looking for a gift for their woman.</li>
            <li> item arrived on time in all original packaging. nothing was damaged. The brushes felt so smooth. It stated that colors vary but i received the one in picture (red one) which i wanted. This product is under priced. Great buy for what i paid. i want to try more of Shany products. i&#x27;m going to try her eye shadow pallette next!</li>
            <li> I LIKED THE STYLE BAG THAT CAME WITH THIS PRODUCT BUT IT HAD SOME KIND OF SMELL THAT WONT GO AWAY. THE BRUSHES ARE GOOD BUT THEY ARE NOT SOFT AND SOME COME OFF WHILE APPLYING MAKE UP. I DONT RECOMMAND THIS IF YOU ARE PLANNING IT FOR A GIFT OR WANT SOMETHING GOOD. FOR THE PRICE I GUESS IT IS GOOD BUT THE PRODUCT IT NOT SO GOOD. THE BRUSHES ARE NOT SOFT AT ALL.</li>
            <li> What a great buy! All the pieces looked and felt great! I loved the packaging as well, came in a cute box with it&#x27;s own brush holder. Very cute.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good, even tho there is some shedding of the brushes. Its natural hair and for 13$ i dont have any complaints;-)Thanks!</li>
            <li> This brush set is just What I was looking for thank you. Easy to clean and work well with mineral make up</li>
            <li> I got these about a month ago, and started using the brushes right away.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are good, and for the price you are paying for them they are actually great! The smell of the pouch is not a problem, its new therefore the smell... And its gone in a few days.  Brushes are good size, shed just a bit. Again, you cannot get a better set for the money. Good quality and a good deal altogether.</li>
            <li> For this price even if you were to get one or two brushes you would use often it would be worth it.  But Shany brushes are good and pick up color well.</li>
            <li> I did like the brushes they are soft and pretty nice quality, it does not have a lot of face brushes mostly eyeshadow brushes. and the brushes are a little to bushy for me personally.</li>
            <li> Just ordered this and it arrived in 3 days. I&#x27;m very satified with the product. The brushes are a good quality. I love the color of the handles and the storage case, It&#x27;s a very vibrant red. The brushes themselves are very soft. The only con I see with this product is when you first use them, some of the hairs fall out but that&#x27;s to be expected. (not all of those tiny hairs are going to stay in). Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased. The set contains just about every brush you would need for day to day make up application.</li>
            <li> The brushes are alright I&#x27;m not in LOVE with them and I certainly won&#x27;t buy them again. Kind of flismy sort of natural looking.</li>
            <li> after receiving the item,i noticed that one of the brush sheds hair already..the pouch is so cheap &amp; ugly..the brushes isnt great as compared to what i read on other comments posted..how i wish i could return this item..i was so disappointed how are this brushes look like..u cant even choose any color..aww!i hate the color so much! will never recommend this to anybody!</li>
            <li> thanks i received my cosmetic brush set and was satisfied i like the way the brushes feel very soft and haven&#x27;t tried them yet but i think they will be good</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter who is just beginning to use makeup.  She loves the brush (her mother told her&lt;br /&gt;it is actually better than hers!)  Thank you Shany!!</li>
            <li> I am not a make up artist, just a regular person that needed new brushes, and I love them. I found these affordable for the amount of brushes you get but they do not look cheap, fall apart or shed.  I am very happy with my purchase. I would recommend these to anyone, hope you enjoy them.</li>
            <li> The larger powder brushes are okay, but the bristles on the eyeshadow brushes are too coarse. Not good for shading.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people complain so much about the smell, mine smell alright. The brushes actually look better in person than in the pictures above, which was very surprising. They are really soft and so far they have worked wonderfully, I use them for personal purposes and I&#x27;m happy about the results. My only complain is they don&#x27;t specify what each brush is for, like I knew but say I give this to my mom as a present, she would have no idea. Another minor complain is the red color of the pouch is hideous, but that&#x27;s just a minor detail, otherwise everything has been perfect.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 4 because I mean it&#x27;s a good product to start off with. I like the wide range brushes. The product works but the material that it was made could be better. But it still works perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t do a lot of face make up. I just love eye shadows and different looks with the eye. These brushes are perfect for me! Great price too :)</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes each one has a purpose and they are all extremely soft and work well on the face. I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> i guess its Ok, i was expecting better quality based on previous reviews but guess since i just received them ill see how they hold up with time.</li>
            <li> I got this by request for my 17 yr old daughter.  She loves the set and she uses it every day for her makeup needs.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these; we use them for photographic preparation and dust removal, when photographing still life shots of products like jewelry and small sculpture. Camel hair removes the dust without scratching fine metals and plastics. Good to have in the photographer&#x27;s kit!</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first makeup brush set in an attempt to use makeup more regularly and acquire some new skills. I realized from the start that there were a number of brushes that I knew I would never use (i.e. small brushes used for precise application of eye makeup). The larger brushes were ok but not great when I applied powered makeup. The bristles felt limp and like I was using cheaply made plastic fibers. For the price its ok but I think that if you&#x27;re going to spend money on make up brushes, spend them on some quality ones. Think about what makeup you wear everyday/are comfortable wearing everyday, and buy brushes that fit your needs. Overall I don&#x27;t think I would get them again.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it!! also it&#x27;s a full collection for her makeup set! for all females get this product now!</li>
            <li> Got my package yesterday took only 3 business days.. Delivery was very quick.. happy about that. The set is really nice and the brushes feel very good. It got 4stars because I do not like the pouch. it is red, flimsy and ugly plus it has these very long cumbersome strings BUT that is not a reason not to get it. the important thing is that the brushes are great . I prefer to get great brushes and horrible pouch .. then to get great pouch and horrible brushes..  all in all the long and short of it is that i would recommend this to a friend. will post another review once i have put these brushes to the test..</li>
            <li> She loves the set  it is very professional looking. The pouch is a nice touch adds elegance.  We  were both very  impressed.</li>
            <li> brushes are constantly shedding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmologist so I use mine every day a lot! I love tem they are great for the price I payed as great as the $200 brushes I have</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up daily. I wear it maybe once a month. With that being said they work nice for how little I use them. The price was good and they are smooth. The seem to apply well, but I am by no means a make up expert. The bag that they came in had a strong smell. After being left out a few days the smell was gone. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re okay. they get the job done. i think i prefer elf brushes over these though, but those cost a bit more. overall, i&#x27;m satisfied with them. they do have a chemical smell so let them air out, and wash them before you use them.</li>
            <li> These are really great! I have had them for about 2 or so years and they work well and get the job done. Not the best but they do the job.... Great price!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes for my daughter who was just entering the workplace after finishing college.  She doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but these brushes are a great starter set for someone just getting into wearing make-up.  I have a lot of professional brushes myself, but found these brushes well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Not fantabulous either. The brushes don&#x27;t feel like expensive quality but the job gets done. Good color too.</li>
            <li> Nice brush set for beginners. A good deal for this price......the brushes are good and are glued properly ...doesn&#x27;t fall off from the handle....overalll a good buy!</li>
            <li> It comes out to be a dollar per a brush! What better deal can you ask for? It&#x27;s a steal! The brushes are perfect for traveling! The brushes are pretty good quality. Picks up quite a decent amount of makeup. All in all, these are a pretty decent set of brushes! Give these brushes a try to see for yourself! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the color of these brushes! so Bright! and the pouch it comes with is lovely! its amazing the brushes are so great. they have a brush for everything! high light foundation, shadows etc. High recommend if you like that hot red color and great quality brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes are ok. They have a smell to them but it doesnt bother me. I do wish the blush and foundation brushes were thicker. The are a bit thin. There is no mascara wand as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I got bought these brishes by a friend and when i saw them i thought omg!! But after trying them out for a few weeks i fell in love!!! Yeah there not MAC quality or anything but they do what it says on the tin ;-)</li>
            <li> You get such a good deal for the price of this set. I love the ability to choose different colors so my kit can all match. Brush roll is so convenient.</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes! They were everything I needed for my makeup kit, with my sisters always stealing them I always stock up and this was just a easy cheep kit that was amazing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I&#x27;m a newbie and these brushes are a nice introduction into the make up world. They are super soft. I&#x27;m not sure what people are talking about the smell is not bad at all. I had no issues with the brushes. I love the variety, perfect set for a newbie.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set for both beginners and professionals. I found the brushes to be high quality, and the red pouch gave the set more of a trendy vibe. I like the fact that the set includes a brow and lash brush, which a lot of sets at this price point do not. I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> well packaged professional set of brushes. loved the carrying case they came with. the brushes seem good enough for every day use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good in the sense that they don&#x27;t shed,  however they are extremely rough. I wish they were a little softer. They have lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and it looks great. This is a gift for my daughter for Christmas. I am sure she will like it.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a foundation brush. I was sad to have two concealer brushes and no foundation brush but the rest of brushes looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> These brushes are cheap when I got them it came in a cheap fake leather roll thing. Every time I use these brushes the hairs either fall out or poke me and they are not quality at all. I bought better brushes at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of negative reviews here and i&#x27;m surprised I bought these a few years a go and i love them and still use them. My only problem was that they weren&#x27;t glued to the sticks well enough so some of the brushed came off but a little super glue and problem, solved. Not sure if people are getting different products but i haven&#x27;t experienced the hairs coming off at all. I would recommend these</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected. There hasn&#x27;t been any noticeable shedding. The only problem I foresee having is having to hot glue the handles back on. They don&#x27;t feel all that secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**See updated review below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have held up awesome!!</li>
            <li> Over half have broken.  I do not put them in water to clean... I clean them individually... but it didnt seem to help. The brushes still started to fall off.</li>
            <li> Love these. Good quality and price. Don&#x27;t go anywhere without them. Probably buy another set as a gift for someone that I think would love them also</li>
            <li> Hi.. This brush set is my first brush set all the brushes are very useful to me. I love it.. I bought to amazon seller I recomend it</li>
            <li> The hair in brush seem to already be coming out which is annoying and Ive only used it twice. I will be buying better quality set of brushes. I only got these bc of the the reviews. There is no foundation brush either. Or if they say there is one I don&#x27;t know which they think it is bc none of these brushes are made  to put foundation on with. I would definitely look at better brushes.</li>
            <li> Can never have too many.  I just added to my current collection.  I have shared one or two with my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect based on the other reviews. The brushes are very nice, and very soft. They came in a cute leather pouch. I read multiple complaints that they smelled awful, and that people had to wash them out before using them. I didn&#x27;t notice that at all. They had a smell to them, but it was the smell of plastic and leather left out in the heat. No big deal...</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time Prime service is awsome. great quality. I will keep trying and buying new Shany Products. Products are very easy to use and work perfectly for make up.</li>
            <li> I like the brushed a lot. I use them everyday.  They are in really good quality and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> OK I realize these are extremely cheap brushes and that you usually get what you pay for, but, wow!  These are much worse than I was expecting.  They are all way too loose for me, and do not pick up product well at all.  I&#x27;m not sure if I got a different set than others, as I bought them based on the great reviews.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson, and will have to continue paying high prices for quality brushes.</li>
            <li> The face brushes were fine for about 6 months, but after that, they started leaving gross hairs all over my face. I still like the eyeshadow brushes and haven&#x27;t had any problem with them.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this particular set of brushes. I noticed that other reviews mentioned the potent smell of the brushes when you open the box. I am very particular when it comes to smells and the smell was not as atrocious or bothersome as some made it out to be. There was a smell but nothing to exaggerate about. As instructed, I washed them and the smell was gone. I have been using them for 2 months and I love them.</li>
            <li> she seems to like the brushes and had no problems with them, she liked that they held up with out the brushes falling out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good quality. They do not fall apart or shed. The are soft and durable. I like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes! I&#x27;ve had them for over a year and still no problems, the bristles of the brushes have not fallen out, they pick up a healthy amount of makeup and there&#x27;s not much left on the brush after application, and they&#x27;re fairly easy to clean. Glad I purchased them, definitely worth the money! And definitely going to be repurchasing them again later down the road!</li>
            <li> If you are a person who is very experienced with putting make-up on and you have experimented with different types of brushes, you&#x27;ll be able to discern which brushes are great and worth the money and which ones are not only a waste of money but a waste of make-up. All of these brushes are not made well. The ONLY brush that I actually like is the eyebrow brush. The brush isn&#x27;t dense enough to give you a flawless full coverage and you waste too much product by just trying to apply an even amount on your face. Also, the brushes look pretty decent online but do not be deceived. They are not as full or dense as in the pictures. I advise that you spend a little extra on some amazing quality brushes, or if you are really on a budget, I suggest trying out the ELF Studio Brushes. The studio brushes are excellent quality at a low price.</li>
            <li> from the first wash the hairs of the brush for powder and blush brush are out, the others are fine</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself, however I thought that it was a bit flimsy and cheap looking. Wasn&#x27;t too bad to return. gave away as a gift for someone now starting to use make up</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after reading the reviews, but I decided to order these anyway and hope for the best. I am absolutely delighted that I ordered these! I received brushes with a red handle and a red storage case. I absolutely love the case. It hass a soft leather-like feel and I love all the individual pockets to keep the brushes organized. As for the brushes themselves, I am very happy with the quality especially for the price. These are some of the nicest brushes that I own!</li>
            <li> I currently work as a special effects makeup artist and was looking for a set of brushes to add to my collection. These brushes are awesome! I was a bit worried about the smell that had been mentioned by previous reviews, and mine don&#x27;t smell at all. The brushes may be numbered, and indeed out of order, but I like it as the original order they are in the case is the order of brushes I typically use when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> They are Okay.. They are very soft at first but become kinda rough after a few uses.. i like the smaller brushes more then the larger ones. But they are a good deal and do the job!</li>
            <li> the one thing i did notice is that the purpose for each brush  could be stamped going down on each pocket inside the brush bag. this will help the beginners know and it will eliminate having to keep up with that paper or having the cost print it.</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes. Was expecting a bad smell because of some reviews. There was none. Smelt like stuff wrapped in plastic. No weird powder either. I did wash them right away put them back in their plastic covers. They got back their shape. Love the quality. Future amateur make up artist ;-)</li>
            <li> I read some conflicting reviews, but all in all they were a good buy. I&#x27;ve had them over a year now and so far i&#x27;ve had to hot glue the tops back on a few of them, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. They work just fine and they were a bargain, no complaints here!</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice for what they are. Pretty good quality, not my favorite brushes for actual makeup, but they&#x27;re surprisingly good for stage makeup. If you need a cheap set, these will do just fine.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging and it comes with a little apron I love the way the brushes feel I will definently order again thanks so much xoxo</li>
            <li> This is my first makeup brush kit, and I have found it easy to use and not in any way negative.  I give it four stars because I feel it unfair to give a product five stars without any previous reference or comparison.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes and the last a long time.</li>
            <li> For this price you will get OK product. Clearly it is not MAC or Sigma, but it is OK;  Try it</li>
            <li> These are nice, quality brushes. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them and don&#x27;t foresee any arising.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft... but not the best. They lasted me about 6 months before they started falling apart. Oh well</li>
            <li> These are perfect for me. I use some on a daily basis, while others I use every once in awhile. They&#x27;ve held up so far.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product and a very nice thank you I advise you to buy it on your dealings beautiful will buy again in the coming months</li>
            <li> This brush set is really good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is a amazing and the brush quality is good.</li>
            <li> Quality brushes for not a lot of money.  I was a make-up artist and paid $50 - $150 for each individual brush.  I sure got my money&#x27;s worth with these.  I would highly recommend them.  They way they are packaged makes them perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I needed a nice set with some smaller thinner brushes for more precision and this delivered.  I&#x27;ve never had a fab brush before, but I have highlighter and bronzer that I&#x27;m trying it out with and I like the affects.  The real goat hair gives it a perfect texture and softness and just enough stiffness to maintain control.  I love the angled eyeliner.  I think this red set must have been on sale and was an excellent value.  The reason it is four stars is because I don&#x27;t really like the case.  It stinks like petroleum and really strong plastic and My morning sickness won&#x27;t tolerate it.  I don&#x27;t like the wrap around cords.  But it might be okay for travel if I let it air out somewhere.  I keep my brushes in a jar on my vanity anyway.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I&#x27;ve had no problems with them shedding as mentioned and the only smell it had ws from the bag.</li>
            <li> for the price you can&#x27;t ask too much. They don&#x27;t feel very soft and one or two strands of hair fall every time I use them.</li>
            <li> Really like the assortment and quality of these brushes.  I use them for everything makeup and they are affordable enough if you love one or two of them you can purchase more.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it :3 and that is good and the gift  note was epic she hugged attacked me !! !</li>
            <li> Not the best quality as far as the big brushes go. Congress packaged nicely, Good looking product. Got in on time.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and bristles fall out off all brushes and irritate the skin. E.L.F.&#x27;s studio brushes look like superstars next to this set. :(  I&#x27;d only recommend to preteens who want a set to practice their makeup with...just be aware of the heavy bristle fall out.</li>
            <li> lots of variety. Brushes are nice. Bristles don&#x27;t come out when I use it. The case seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li> I loved this set, it was exactly what advertised and it arrived in a great condition and fast. Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ready love it and it came in to my door in like not even a week off placing an order. I use it all the time. Wouldnt mind to have another set! :-)</li>
            <li> These brushes look like good quality. I am very very excited to try them and happy overall with my purchase.</li>
            <li> great quality! i have this set now for over a year and still works pretty good, ill definitely buy more from this seller</li>
            <li> love these brushes! shipping was fast, and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Quality of brushes was exactly as described .  Good bang for your buck.  Extra carrying pouch was a nice added touch.  Would recommend this item</li>
            <li> Packaging was nice, everything was packed accordingly and also they had a chart, which was really awesome as to what kind of brushes to use. Since this was a gift with the nyx makeup kit, and for the price it was to good to pass. Overall no chemical smell when my friend and I opened and we are pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> ok product. im hesitant to use these on permanent basis. will update in couple of months after regular use and switch permanently.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted in a starter kit I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase looking to many more in the future.. Very soft on the face ...easy to clean :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price. The bristles are a bit tough, but where it counts it works. Also all brushes are all good sizes, not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty but the quality is not so good. The brisels are falling off or are left behind on the face when applying makeup. Their very soft overall I would say they are great for their price they get the job done.</li>
            <li> After looking at tons of different brush sets and reading so many reviews, I decided to go with this one.  I liked the brush selection and the look of them (and the price!).  As other people have said, they had a slight smell, so as soon as I got them I washed them with shampoo and layed them out to dry.  After that, I had no issues and they have been working very well for about 3 months!</li>
            <li> I bought this product last week. It arrived on time as promised.So I was very happy about that! It comes in a pretty cute little makeup pouch so I always have a place for my brushes when traveling. I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve heard people referencing because I don&#x27;t have that issue. The only concern I have (which is also my reason for giving 3 stars versus 5) is that my powder brush is shedding. So therefore I belive it&#x27;s safe to say I got what I paid for. Overall, I had a pretty good experiece with the purchase and I would definitely give them another try (on a better quality brush set of course)</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are nice. They are very soft and have nice long handles. There&#x27;s a wide selection of brushes to choose from, so they do they job very nicely. While relatively cheap, the pouch does the trick of organizing the brushes and storing them so they don&#x27;t take up much space. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because they sent me two of the X-Large eyeshadow brushes and no eyeliner brush. I was disappointed about this, but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of exchanging them. I contacted the company through their website to see if they&#x27;d send me the eyeliner brush, but never heard back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the brushes are great. Just hope you get all the ones you want. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought brushes from Walmart that I&#x27;ve kept clean and treated well that have lasted 1-2  year.  I bought this a few months ago to have them fall apart already.  Granted, they are inexpensive, but if you wanted something that lasts just buy individual brushes of good quality.</li>
            <li> I got these a while ago and they are in perfect condition still.&lt;br /&gt;They never came with a chemical smell and the bristles stay in place and don&#x27;t fall out.  They are easy to clean and dry and the pouch is easy to clean as well (I usually just take an antibacterial wipe for that).  I guess the only con would be is if you use the eye crease brush, the edges are a little bit pokey so they COULD be softer.  But other than that, they are really nice.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old sister is learning the wonderful world of make-up, so a nice brush set to help her play is a great idea</li>
            <li> These are beautiful makeup brushes. I recommend them without hesitation. They are well made and the bristles donot fall out.</li>
            <li> The look of the case is very pretty. Red is my favorite color and its the perfect shade. The brushes are good quality many different shapes for applying make up. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes as a Christmas gift and I am very impressed with them. There is a wide variety of brushes from small to big. You really get your moneys worth with this brand. Some of the brushes are too small for me to use and the brushes aren&#x27;t as soft as I had expected. Those are the only cons. I especially enjoyed the carrying pouch that they come in and the small booklet guide to tell you what each brush is used for. Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great selection of brushes. They feel nice are a good quality, i have yet to have any of them shed their fibers.</li>
            <li> they came shipped very excellent condition and work good i bought them for my daughter and they are great for a starting up make up tips and learning how to use all the variety of brushes</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are easy to clean and they rarely shed hairs. The pouch they come in is really handy in storing the brushes and you can even carry it your purse if necessary for touch ups. Downfall is when you first receive the brushes, they have this weird smell but after a wash or so the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> These are a great set. I know make up brushes can be very expensive. It didn&#x27;t make sense with how little make up I wear to get a big expensive set. This is exactly what I was looking for and they look truly great.</li>
            <li> We got this Shany Cosmetic Brush Set as a Christmas Gift for out Daughter and just before wrapping it we found that the three large brushes were missing. Just check your order as soon as you get it so that you can return it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the merchandise I will recommend your site to my friends for future purchases because I feel I did a good business</li>
            <li> Really liked the variety they have in this set.  Brushes are soft and also the the leather pouch is the best.</li>
            <li> This set is nice and I love the traveling case it comes in but it does not have all the brushes I need unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes and inexpensive.  There is a brush for every type of make-up.  Easy to clean and the red case is a bonus</li>
            <li> Came in a nice little box, with a guide on how to use each brush. Great for a person beginning in makeup.</li>
            <li> I received these as a gift from my boyfriend. The pouch they came in is very pretty, nice and sturdy. And it is a beautiful red color. It also comes with a little booklet that lets you know which brush is which, that is a nice touch especially if you are a beginner. I would have liked to seen more blending brushes in the set. Also, the fan/highlight brush is very lightweight and not very full not sure if I like that particular brush but overall I am satisfied!!!!</li>
            <li> I luv this&lt;br /&gt;it comes with so many brushes all for different purposes&lt;br /&gt;its such a good price!!!!! GET IT</li>
            <li> I got this 13 piece set in 2012 when i was just starting off learning how to apply make-up, and for that reason only i think this is ok for the price. But the brushes will not last longer than about 3months and once you attempt on cleaning them its lights out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes buy this product for practice... thats it.</li>
            <li> cheap cheap not durable at all waste of money it took forever to get it and poooooooooorrrrr quality &amp;#62; . . . . .</li>
            <li> I bought this set on recommendation from a friend. I found the brushes worked quite well in helping me to apply my make-up, both for everyday use and when I had to do my own bridal make-up. It includes all the key brushes you need as a novice. But for pros, you will still need to purchase additional brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price! This set includes just about everything you could possibly need and they are descent quality. I had trouble finding inexpensive brushes that didn&#x27;t shed their bristles and this is definitely a great set!</li>
            <li> I love the color. Got to my house super fast. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the powder brush it was too thin on the top I like it to be more puffier but over all I love everything and the red bag I love</li>
            <li> They shed so much, I couldn&#x27;t even use one of them.  This was a waste of money, even if they aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> These brushes loose all their hairs, leaving hairs on the face and messing up the make up application.  I am a makeup artist and I had extra brushes thank goodness because the first time I used them the hairs just ended up all over the models face.</li>
            <li> I love the way the brushes look and feel, but they fall apart really easily. Like if i just pull softly on the brushes some of the hairs fall out, so I&#x27;ve been scared to use them too much.</li>
            <li> I saw some great reviews and some bad reviews, but I figured for the price I&#x27;ll try them.  I love them.  I haven&#x27;t had the problem with them shedding either.  I only use 4 out of 12, but I&#x27;m glad I have extra just in case I misplace one :P</li>
            <li> Because i though i was going to use more of the brushes and i have&#x27;nt.  So i have not used some brushes.</li>
            <li> I needed decent brushes with a decent price. These are great! the hairs don&#x27;t shed and they seem to be pretty sturdy. the case is nothing too special, it&#x27;s just a pouch, but it does it&#x27;s job of holding the brushes</li>
            <li> I was looking for a x-mas gift and found one with this item! great seller and even great price. Saved me alot of time</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing a cosmetic brush set. They are made with quality and I like the nice red pouch it came in:)</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes with alot of variety.  I bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves them alot</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive and when it did I was disappointed. It was poor quality and the case the brushes came in, was torn. the brushes are ok i guess.</li>
            <li> so happy to get my replacement I love new brushes every year to a few month depending on how much I ware make up for I don&#x27;t ware it near as much as I used to. but I do love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing.  I took a quick glance and saw lots and lots of reviews with a decent average. These are nothing special at all and trying to determine what all the small brushes are actually for is ridiculous.  The company should or could have labeled or even numbered them.  Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I bought these as part of my best friends Christmas present. This set has everything! The brushes are so soft and look sturdy.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get these brushes. I have been using them from the first day I got them. Good quality, very professional packaging and will definitely order their products again.</li>
            <li> My daughter specifically asked for this item. It is great and she was sooooo happy to get it on xmas morning.</li>
            <li> This was a gift fro my  granddaughter. She loved it. She raved about the quality, the assortment of brushes and the pouch that contained them all.  She and I were very pleased.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the color red, the brushes are natural and there are so many. This is my first time trying them. Good product for the price!!</li>
            <li> i love it so much it has a great carrying case and it has a piece of paper that tells you what brushes are for what I would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Although these brushes were cheap and delivered promptly, there have been a few loose hairs here and there, but that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they&#x27;re not very ideal for traveling, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I am all-in-all satisfied.</li>
            <li> With an actress in the family, this was a great set to enhance her makeup collection.  Arrived quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li> Great buy! I read the negative reviews &amp; didn want to buy the brushes but I&#x27;m glad I did they are a good price &amp; they are good quality of course I had to condition them as you do all brushes! But I was pleased</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are a great deal for the price. They are my first set of actual makeup brushes and I am very happy with them. I loved that they came in a carry case.</li>
            <li> So far she is very pleased.  The brushes aren&#x27;t shedding and there are enough for her to stop stealing mine!  The pouch is convenient and allows her to pack them up quickly and head out.  They clean easily and dry nicely.  Very satisfied with them.  Would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> the bristles fall out very easily, not the best quality product. i used them once and threw them away, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> nice set of brushed... granddaughter  loved  nice gift idea for someone  glad I purchased  received quickly  great service  happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Some of the bigger fluffy face brushes have hair falling out and that&#x27;s certainly annoying. But I feel like it&#x27;s worth to buy the set for the smaller eye brushes. They don&#x27;t shed at all and are very soft to the touch..and the tiny detailer brushes are useful when doing eyeliner on top or bottom using eyeshadow and also to blend it out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter.  She was very pleased.</li>
            <li> The brushes are the ones that leave strands on your face... So you itch and are embarrassed. I don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t worth the money.  Yes, they are cheap but cheap is exactly what you&#x27;re getting here.  One of them was broken upon arrival and the rest are awful.  The fibers keep coming out and they won&#x27;t pick up any powder.  My wife hates them and we are returning them and ordering the Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> its a nice starter kit but the bristles weren&#x27;t soft enough. rough like a cheap set. the comb for your eyebrows piece fell off already</li>
            <li> I only use a couple of brushes from the set. I don&#x27;t like em very much. I gave most of them away but i really like the pouch they came in. the bristles aren&#x27;t sculpted right for me and there is no blending brush!</li>
            <li> Just remember when buying this item that the total number of brushes in the picture featured, is more than what you get. It shows about 17, when it actually comes with only 12. Other than that, its a good enough product. The only reason I bought it was because I had a gift certificate to Amazon and didn&#x27;t know what else to spend it on..... So just know if your expecting 17 you get only 12.</li>
            <li> I loved the color of the brushes and they felt fine- but months later I see that they are beginning to fall apart and I now need new brushes.  And what I mean by fall apart- I mean when I use the big brush for my finishing powder- the little brush hairs fall on my face.  thats a no no!</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time. It did have some sort of chemical smell to it so I washed them and aired them out for a couple of days and that helped to entirely get rid of the smell. They work really great.</li>
            <li> These brushes are professional grade and my daughter loves them. Shany products are excellent and the price is great. If you are looking for professional type makeup and products, try Shany. You will love them</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this set again, for myself or as a gift.  The brushes come in this nice roll out case. I’m not a make up artist, I just wanted a nice set of brushes to experiment with some new makeup techniques. Definitely a great starter set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Cheap！Beautiful! LOVELY~ 5points</li>
            <li> This will be my second Shany Professional Brush set, My daughter needed some, so I gave her my old ones and purchases some new ones. The brushes are soft to the touch, I did not have any powder on my brushes at all. They were each wrap separately in cellophane. My Shany brushes came in a red pouch, it did smelled like plastic, but not as strong as some are saying. Some of my brushes were loose from the stick, I super glued them back together, that why you see four stars. I did not want to go  through the process of returning them. Overall I still love the Shany brushes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful red pleather case to hold these superb brushes! The bristles are soft, apply the makeup evenly blend everything very well. Major bang for your buck with this set.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Great price.</li>
            <li> These are really good quality for the price. Like previous commentors said the bag smells pretty stong but I don&#x27;t really care since the brushes are what I was ordering.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem pretty cool. The biggest problem with them is that when I got them two of the brushes both said number nine. Number five and number nine both had a number nine on them. I can figure out which is which, but it would be a lot easier if they were just numbered correctly. Besides that, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the lip gloss brush and the eyeliner brush was pretty much a fail because it didn&#x27;t put eyeliner on my eyelid at all, it just seemed to smear right off. However, the blush brush was pretty much amazing, as it did a really good  job concentrating the blush on the apples of the cheeks. Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad set, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it, but it just would be a lot easier if the brushes were number correctly. They&#x27;re very professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(EDITED)Okay, now that I&#x27;ve had these brushes for awhile I like them a lot less. I might as well have not even bought brushes. The fan brush is falling apart, and a pencil brush and blender brush are mysteriously missing. I guess you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll probably buy better quality brushes next time.</li>
            <li> My Honey got me these for Christmas and I LOVE them!  I already had great brushes, but these are RED, and the bristles are all well made and haven&#x27;t fallen apart yet - a year later.  No hairs have come loose at all.  And I discovered so many new uses for some of the different brush styles.  I never knew I wanted a set like this, and am so happy I now have it!</li>
            <li> Just as pictured. Works well</li>
            <li> So affordable and good quality. Not the greatest but it offers such a great variety for beginners. The bag they come in is a bit absurd. These brushes have lasted a long time if taken care of properly. I would recommend keeping their plastic the individual brushes come so they keep their shape and do not get destroyed when rolling the bag back up.</li>
            <li> Love them. Every shape and size brush. Had it for a year and they hold up nicely. Love the red color</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed. I&#x27;ll love that there is such a variety of brushes. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> There are some brushes that aren&#x27;t in the bundle that I would&#x27;ve loved to see. Other than that, these served the it purpose. No need to buy really expensive/pro brushes when these do what you the pro brushes do.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, she really needed new brushes. She&#x27;s loving them and the leather carrying case. She hasn&#x27;t complained about the hairs coming loose, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> great for the price and perfect for me who is new to trying a smokey eye and need easy tools!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as good as do scribed and the delivary was made long before the estimated date which is grate</li>
            <li> I have this and it was totally purchased by mistake. Like the red pouch but if it has a clasp or a snap on it would be better than the tie around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no make-up artist, and only have experience with a few low to mid range quality brushes. That being said, these brushes are definitely nicer than what I have purchased in the past. They seem well made for the price, and are nice and soft. This particular kit has 13 brushes in total, and gives a nice variety- I mainly use brushes to apply blush and mineral powder eyeliner. And they come in a cute vinyl holder, which is great since i&#x27;m moving soon and will want them to be protected.&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped and sold through amazon by SHANY and arrived about a week after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with them- Go for it!</li>
            <li> Thank u all very much! I just received it 2day &amp; I absolutely love it. I needed all these brushes! they r good quality &amp; I will be trying 2 get more products from the Shany company!&lt;br /&gt;thank u all &amp; blessings</li>
            <li> wife loved it. great price</li>
            <li> I would agree with the other reviews, this does smell like paint thinner when you open it.&lt;br /&gt;But I love how well organized it is, and the covers that come with the fluffy brushes to keep the bristles nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of brushes because a friend of mine recommended to me.  I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, because I don&#x27;t use make up on a daily basics, but I figure to give it a try.  I really liked it, I being using it since I got it and also using it with my daughter (9 years old) when she has dance performances or teather plays.  it is easy to carry and the brushes sizes are good.</li>
            <li> Great starting kit for people getting more into make up</li>
            <li> I bought these as a cheap last minute go to and I must say, you definitely get what you pay for. You don&#x27;t get much of a variety of brushes and they are a bit rough and flat. I&#x27;ve had them for a little over a week, using them every day, and when I stand up from doing my makeup, I am covered in little brush hairs so shedding is definitely a problem. If better quality is in your budget, then I would go for a better brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are definitely good for the price. I did get the brown ones that were shown (although I wish I had gotten black). They came as new in the box with an explanation of what each brush is and what it&#x27;s for, which was handy. I&#x27;ve actually never used a brush for my eyeshadow-- only a sponge-- and I have to say, I&#x27;m in love with it. I wish this kit included a stippling brush, because they&#x27;re a must-have for contouring.</li>
            <li> Great value for brushes. Make a great gift! but go ahead and order 2 sets -- once you receive these, you&#x27;re going to want your own set!</li>
            <li> The worse brush set ever. They are not firm. Extremely flimsly, and does not collect or distibute product well. Better to find something that is worth more because it is better quality.</li>
            <li> I got these for Christmas from my husband I love them they are a good quality and they are great for makeup applications. I jsut hate that they do not list that the brush is on the handle. I am not a professional so some of the brushes I am a little confused on. but over all they are great!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teenage niece who is crazy over hair &amp; makeup.  She screamed &amp; was very impressed with the quality of the brushes.  She loved them!  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little softer to the touch but I guess you get what you pay for .</li>
            <li> My order just got here I&#x27;ll say about an hour ago. I&#x27;ve already used the brushes. Lol anywho. Before I tried them out I did the pull test to see if the brushes shed. They didn&#x27;t. The bag however does have a real leather smell. Kind of funky but not unbearable. The brushes are very soft. I&#x27;d order again</li>
            <li> The majority of these brushes are not useable.  The bristles fall out constantly.  I was having to redo parts of my makeup due to picking bristles off of my face.  The reason I gave it two stars vs. 1 star is because the eyeshadow applicators and eyebrow brush are quite handy.  5 out of 13 is pretty bad</li>
            <li> These brushes are well made and so far hold up well. The bristles don&#x27;t come off on your face. Long handles are nice. The travel bag is well made too.</li>
            <li> Since i only use make up for cosplay it ok for me but it not that great like I don&#x27;t even know what half of the brush is used for</li>
            <li> The brushes are okay for the price, but you get what you pay for. I primarily use the brushes for applying eye shadows and I am please because the various brushes make it easy to apply the eye shadows and blend colors. I took the advice from one of the comments I read and washed the brushes with baby shampoo in warm water (I recommend the same)  The make-up brushes are a little to harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> These are good for the price. They &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; as if they&#x27;re an expensive brush set, and the case is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they are not very soft against the skin, and they shed A LOT. However, this is only the &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34; brushes. Those used for blush, powder, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye makeup brushes are excellent and work like a charm.</li>
            <li> This set is the best set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love the pouch it comes in. I love that there are two different face brushes, I use one for bronzer and one for powder. I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of stuff that comes with this set for the price it is set at! Very nice brushes, and easy to wash. I recommend these to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on brushes.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when they arrived. I Love how soft the hair bristles are. No disappointment&#x27;s on this product it works great!</li>
            <li> Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all the brushs are in gret conditions and very comfort to use, the color is nice too, loved it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter. trying to keep her away from my brushes.  She loved them and actually keeps them all togeather in the Pouch.</li>
            <li> I never thought to make a review about this product, but I was searching for new brushes and I stumbled upon these so I figured it&#x27;d be the perfect time to make a review. Note, I just said I was looking for new brushes..These brushes were nice when I first purchased them, but honestly there was nothing great about them. I&#x27;m not very picky, they did smell a little funky but the smell went away when you washed it. However, I&#x27;m a sucker for soft brushes, and these weren&#x27;t that soft. Clearly that&#x27;s to be expected because they&#x27;re cheap and they use synthetic fibers, but the quality wasn&#x27;t up to par. Also, if this is important: It doesn&#x27;t come with a foundation/concealer brush either. I felt like I had to spend extra time doing my makeup because the brushes didn&#x27;t collect enough of the makeup. A pro to these are that I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakage or shedding. To sum it up, they work, they aren&#x27;t rough, but you can tell when you use it that the quality (of the hairs) isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> I am just getting into the real routine of how to do make up and these brushes were amazing with my start. Especially at a great price, you get the main helpful brushes needed to get started. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Honestly, the picture made these brushes look very luscious.  I wish I would have scrolled down and looked at the second picture- looks TOTALLY different.  I bought these because they looked like big brushes, but they may as well be the skinny $1.00 make-up brushes from Target.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes! They are very soft and you get a nice variety. The only brush that I would have loved to have would be an angled blush brush....but I do use these brushes daily and they are good quality for the price! One of mine broke but they do not shead and I think for the most part they will last.</li>
            <li> they are very good quality and I use them very day</li>
            <li> I KNOW I PAID ONLY 12 $ FOR THIS BRUSHES BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DID NOT LIKE THEM AT ALL. EVERY TIME I WAS GOING TO USE THEM THEY WERE LIKE FALLING APART AND MAKING MY JOB WAY HARDER TO BLEND MY MAKE UP. I DID NOT LIKE THEM AT ALL... I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND THEM.</li>
            <li> This is my second set. I used 4 of these brushes every single day and after about a year they started to break and became too hard to clean. For the money they are worth buying once a year because they hold up great for a while. I&#x27;m going to see how long the second set lasts and if it&#x27;s a year again I&#x27;m probably going to invest in better brushes. But if you are an occasional make up user than I would definitely suggest these brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not soo good, one of them is ridiculously small, that it doesn&#x27;t even look like a brush. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you spending you money on them. A couple are okay, but overall I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes are just fine, but I must say that the larger brushes shed on my face when using them for blush or bronzer.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for the price they are listed at! They are seriously such a steal! They don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> The brush is not soft and feels very rough.  I haven&#x27;t use it even once.  2 star for the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great !!I love how they came with instructions on what do with each one. The price is great and they have quality to them.</li>
            <li> but it does have a strong smell when you open it. I haven&#x27;t regularity used them but so far, but they seem alright. :)</li>
            <li> It was alright for the price, u do have to spend more on ur makeup brushes, this was  better for a young girl.</li>
            <li> O like it. Very beautiful, and  the price was good too. I recomend. I order pink color but a receiver red... but, its Ok.</li>
            <li> my friends and family cannot believe I got such good quality brushes for such an amazing price!&lt;br /&gt;before I bought the Shany Brushes, I tried out a few different companies for a blush brush, and none of them were worth it. I spent $20 on each of them! thank you so much for the brushes, and for your fantastic service.&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day!!!</li>
            <li> I like everything: the package, the color and the number of brushes.. I received on time. It is just what I wanted :)</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and am very happy! I did not care much for the travel case it came with. I wish there was a larger brushincluded. THe brushes are soft and full. THey have not had problems falling apart during washing. Great product over all for the price.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product. They do need washed with shampoo before using because of the harsh smell, but that is an easy fix.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set. I use the blush brush and big fluffy brush almost everyday. The only thing i can say bad about this is that I don&#x27;t use every brush in this set and sometimes you get little bristles that can come off but other than that these brushes are awesome. They are made of real animal fur so i suggested you keep them clean as much as possible! :)</li>
            <li> For good brushes, I think these are the best for the price.  They are almost as good as my Mary Kay brushes, but not quite.  I&#x27;d buy them again if I needed more brushes. Update:  t Many of the brushes fell off the tips. Didn&#x27;t even last a year.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are soft  and when I pack it is is to fit in any suit case</li>
            <li> Amazing set of makeup brushes.. they are very soft and gentle. I love them already. The product is very sheek in presentation.</li>
            <li> I wish this set had a buffer and blush brush but besides that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I bought them about four months ago and still use then everyday because they feel brand new.</li>
            <li> love love love..all i can say</li>
            <li> Great quality and good brushes in the kite. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better, especially for the price. Also comes in a nice red faux leather pouch. Love it!</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSES FEEL GREAT!!!!! I LOVE HOW THE TEXTURE GOES ON MY EYES. SO HAPPY I GOT BRUSHES THAT ARE LONGER I WAS USING THE SMALLER BRUSH SETS YOU GET FROM LIKE CVS OR WALGREENS. LOVE THE POUCH I USEALLY HAVE BRUSES ALL OVER PLACE AFTER I FINISH MY FACE BUT WITH THE POUCH I CAN SLIP THEM RIGHT BACK IN!</li>
            <li> I am a beginner on makeup and I needed brushes that were cheap and useful. I got exactly what was shown in the picture. My brushes shed a little but that was only the first wash. The Brushes pick up the makeup good and they arrived earlier than expected! I love them!! The pouch had a strong smell of plastic. But it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I carry them everywhere!</li>
            <li> After washing them with baby shampoo, they are good to go.  Nice set of brushes with case, washed it too. :)</li>
            <li> Very good brushes for the price. I like the softness.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! Super soft, professional looking, great variety, amazing value! I read others comment about a smell. Ok, if you literally stick your nose in them there is a faint smell, but nothing overpowering or obnoxious. I only mention it because others did in their reviews...sooo not an issue. Nice case too. These are the best deal I could find and I am very happy with them!</li>
            <li> there are many brushes but there is a little slip that tells you what each brush is for, i was really happy they did that because i dont know much about make up brushes. these are very good for beginners.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and come in a lovely case. The case itself smells a bit when you first get it. The brushes shed just a bit but overall they are nice brushes and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> My Venezuelan friend is so glad with this item because he has a beauty salon and he is going to use it!</li>
            <li> I love this kit. It came with a Brsuh kit pouch and the brushes them self are amazing. They are easy to use and the basic ones needed in an everyday makeup routine. I would def recommend this to a friend and anyone else looking to buy this set.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes because they are soft and the bristles do not come out during use. I would recommend these brushes to a friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a birthday gift for a teen girl.  It contains all the brushes that you could need to apply makeup.  It was a good by as my daughter enjoys watching video tutorials on hair, nails, and makeup applications but did not have the brushes they recommend for certain looks.</li>
            <li> i love it i cant wait to order more shany cosmetics!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I really like the soft brushes. Amazing deal for all the brushes you receive. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice makeup brushes. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> bristles everywhere!!!!</li>
            <li> Heidy said that the product was very good.</li>
            <li> This was a present to my niece and she loves them! She has been using them constantly and has said that they are soft, professional and they are not falling apart after she washes them.  I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> The ladies I gave these too loved them</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these brushes and out of the box I did. These are completely gorgeous brushes and by FAR the most beautiful $13 brushes you will ever see. Out of the box I was in love. They are a hot pink reddish color with a matching case. The handles are long and sleek and so smooth and silky to the touch. The case is beautiful, sleek, heavy duty, and there was NO stitching coming undone. They look very professional. Also, there was only a faint smell coming from these brushes and I have had more expensive brushes that smell much MUCH worse. It seems SHANY took peoples suggestions with the smell and the case as I had no issues with either. So looks get 5 stars here.    This is primarily an eye brush kit. To my knowledge all these brushes are natural hair (appear to be pony, not including the eyebrow comb). It is rare to find natural hair brushes at this low of a price, this is NOT to say synthetic brushes are cheaper, synthetic brushes can be outstanding and far better than natural and in this case these are really low quality natural hairs.    The hairs, especially of the larger brushes feel like straw against my face. They are really not soft and silky. These brushes very thin and not very dense, which is expected at this price but I mean the brushes really fall flat against your face. The fan brush is so so thin it is unusable. But this isn&#x27;t the main problem.    The main problem is shedding. The first time you wash brushes it is common for loose hairs to come out but after that shedding should stop. These brushes shed SO much during the first wash, both the large and small brushes and there was hair all over my counter and my hands. Also there was a strange black powder coming out of some of the brushes... I am also careful to not get water in the ferrule so this should not have happened. Also when washing my brushes the smaller sized powder/blush brush handle came right off. There is very little glue used to hold the handle on and to hold the hairs inplace which is a huge problem. I was able to easily krazy glue the handle back into place but still not a good first impression. I put these brushes in my brush tree (hanging upside down) and let them dry overnight and the glue set. My big mistake here was not using a brush guard, you MUST use a mesh BRUSH GUARD when on the two larger brushes in this set (made by coastal scents available here on amazon, buy the muti pack). I reshaped the brushes while they were wet in my hand but that wasn&#x27;t enough and they dried deformed.    I washed these brushes a second time before using (which I don&#x27;t normally do) and they still shed (not as much thankfully) making me very weary to use on myself. Also I was using baby shampoo which I use on all my brushes as it is very gentle and nurturing to the hair, especially natural. Do not I repeat DO NOT use dish soap or vinegar or any chemical like that, they will strip the natural hair and make these brushes weaker and scratchier than they already are.    Above all there are much much better brushes in this price range, real techniques makes an eye and face kit each about the price of these that absolutely tower over the quality of these. Eco tools also makes better brushes than these. Coastal scents also have a natural and synthetic 22 piece brush mix that is much better than these. All these brush kits are available shipped and sold by amazon. If you are looking for a kit very similar to this in terms of the brush layout and natural hairs here it is (plus it includes makeup sponges!):    [[ASIN:B00LJDDKH2 Essencell® Cosmetic Brushes-12pc Makeup Brush Set -High Quality Natural and Synthetic Hair Makeup Brushes -Soft and Dense- The Essential Makeup and Brushes for Deliver a Flawless Finish of Makeup Application- Be Classy &amp; Elegant with This Professional M...]]    Around the time of purchasing these I also purchased SHANYs pro-signature kit for $40 and those are significantly better brushes in every way superior to these. So SHANYs products are reasonably priced and some are definitely good, unfortunately these are not:(.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for beginners</li>
            <li> I dont remember how much I purchased them for but whatever I spent was well worth it. I have had then maybe close to a year and they are very durable and soft. I would recommend this product if you are looking to buy alot of brushes but dont want to spend alot.</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s price i was afraid if the quality of these brushes was low... But it feels so soft and durable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought brush set with much less variety at my local drug stores that end up being hard and the bristles fall out. These brushes are great so far. They are soft. There&#x27;s a good number of them with great variety and no lose bristles! Blending my shadows is such a breeze now! Plus it comes with it&#x27;s own roll up holder which makes it perfect for storage or travel. This is a must have. Totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had...lasted long and blended my makeup  well... just the right feel...not too soft or hard just perfect...I love them and I&#x27;m about to purchase another set right now...I can&#x27;t really say anything bad about them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a 3 months and I love them!! I use them everyday, and none of them broke so far! Such a nice color! I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> Brushes seem to work great.  Great price for what you get! The chemical smell of the case went away quickly.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!! Highly Recommend! Fast delivery! Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> These are crappy. Don&#x27;t know why so many people have bought them. Don&#x27;t get these, they are poor quality. They fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> This is a must have! I can not believe it was so cheap!! I am very happy with this buy and would reccomend it for the make up fan!</li>
            <li> There are many choice that I can use but It does not have soft touch than I thought. The hair comes out esily.</li>
            <li> Price is good but poor quality. The brushes are to weak and sloppy. I would say pay a little more $ and buy something better</li>
            <li> I do independent films and these brushes come in handy so much with make-up. Build well and great price in my opinion</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and perfect!!! Easily compact too! The red pouch makes it much easier to spot and grab quickly. I use the brushes on my new Urban Decay Naked pallets and they are great! No clumping makeup at the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Hey gals, if you are tired of using your fingers to apply makeup these are the brushes for you.  I bought these as a gift for my step-daughter and she loves them.  They seem to be of good quality and are much cheaper than buying the &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> Very good quality! Much better than my old brushes, firm edges are great for applying makeup with definition. Great deal!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about buying these Shany brush set but I decided to give it a go and bought it. The product came within a day of ordering it. The bristles are pretty soft and if you&#x27;re a advocate for PETA this is the brush for you. For the price I&#x27;m very happy with these brushes. I would recommend anyone who&#x27;s reading this to buy it. It also comes in a lovely red case so the brushes are neatly organized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t use it the hairs fall out when applying make up, would not buy again. Not for a professional</li>
            <li> The actually brushes were what you would expect for reasonably-priced brushes; they were not amazing brushes but they certainly work, especially for stage makeup. The only problem was that the seller is based internationally and the product did not arrive for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Great variety of brushes, however the case is cheap-looking plastic, and the entire set has a funky smell that is very unappealing.  It&#x27;s a plastic odor that doesn&#x27;t go away over time.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Smelled weird at first but I love them!</li>
            <li> So thin and flimsy. It also sheds a lot. Returning.</li>
            <li> Nice value for the money.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They smell weird when you receive them, but the smell goes away quickly. This is a good deal.</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay. A good started set. I&#x27;ve had them for almost a year now and they seem to be holding up pretty well. I&#x27;m looking to purchase something better and will definitely hold on to these for back up.</li>
            <li> Very long handles, would be best to apply to other people.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Shany Professional 13-piece Cosmetic Brush Set and it far exceeded my expectations. I took a chance on these but I was tired of paying so much for the high end brand brushes. I LOVED the case that the brushes came in, it stores them compactly for ease of use, especially when traveling. The brushes are sturdy and most importantly the hair is soft and manageable. They remind me of a high end makeup brushes that I have used in the past for years, but at a fraction of the cost. Yay!</li>
            <li> love the packaging minus the smell. The only thing i dont like is the brushes arent labeled. Other than that i am really enjoying the product!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re very professional looking and very nice to use, also very easy to clean when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> Ok, first off I was very hesitant to purchase these brushes simply because I don&#x27;t know that much about types of brushes and how to use them. I do know that brushes are VERY important for the process of applying make-up. I must say that I am very happy with my purchase! ESPECIALLY, for the price. They came in a red cosmetic case that is cheap but very handy for all of the brushes. The one thing that you ABSOLUTELY must do is WASH the brushes with hand soap. I used lavender hand soap. This is so important because when you receive the brushes they do have an odor to them, and even though they are soft at first, after washing them with hand soap the difference is outrageous. Another thing, is right when I received them I immediately felt the powder and blush brush and some bristles fell out.  Wasn&#x27;t too excited about this.  And when I washed them, bristles fell out in the sink as well. This didn&#x27;t happen with the eye brushes, thank goodness since they are the ones I mainly use. Now, when I use them (AFTER WASHING) no hair shedding!! And the odor is gone as well! I can&#x27;t say again how important it is to wash them because the difference is like night and day, you will know what i&#x27;m talking about. I would recommend this product to people who use eye makeup every day because of the SOFTNESS of the bristles!</li>
            <li> Love the brush set. I&#x27;m not too advanced with applying makeup &amp; this kit is user friendly. Great quality also!!</li>
            <li> Sign up for the subscription and get a better deal! Such an awesome set! I havent seen a better deal for the quality of brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush set is Amazing!!....The hairs on the brush are soft and they don&#x27;t shed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great set to have with your make up kit!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I wanted to save money and have a good product. Well guess what I got what I paid for. As soon as I was applying make up the little bristles were coming out. I&#x27;m not just talking about one or two. I want to return this item and pay a little more for a better quality.</li>
            <li> Every woman buys this same set of make up tools several times a year things are broken they get lost but they are tools of the trade so we buy and rebuy .</li>
            <li> My daughter earned some money and decided she wanted to order these.  She appears to be happy with them, and there were enough for her to give some to her little sister.</li>
            <li> this is and okay product because it has some brushes that are great quality mostly the eye-shadow ones, but the big ones are a bit rough and always shedding hair it is ANNOYING so i just got rid of the big ones bought better new ones and kept the eye-shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> Great looks; however, the brushes I use the most are a bit stiff, even after more than a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/20/13: Since the two brushes I use most (for powder and blush) are still so stiff (not soft and &#x27;fluffy&#x27; as the picture would lead you to believe), I ended up buying new brushes from Amway, since I had bought from them in the past and liked their quality and how they applied the powder products. Also, I have discovered that the shaft is quite short and comes apart; however, I have been able to stick the brush back onto its handle, but it&#x27;s an ongoing issue. On the up side, I still love the red pouch!</li>
            <li> Loveee the Shany makeup brushes! Came in the mail pretty fast and came with a case to take on the go! Many different ones to use and works very well.. I&#x27;m liking it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into makeup, so I was in hunt of inexpensive and quality brushes and I found these. I love that SHANY added an insert of how to use each brush. I also liked that the case was big but not too big. I was able to fit it inside of my makeup bag. All in all I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  Don&#x27;t loose bristles.  Apply makeup evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Other than the brief smell of the packaging, I have had no problems with these brushes. I have used them regularly for over three months and not a single hair has fallen from the brushes. The have maintained their structure and softness. For the money, you really can&#x27;t beat this set.</li>
            <li> The descriptions say 12 brushes but the pouch had only 9 brushes in it</li>
            <li> Good set!  Christmas gift for someone who loved using them for her make-up.  She said it was one of the better sets she has ever received.</li>
            <li> I hate the quality of these brushes. I did not even use once after some swatches. It feels like some father flying on your skin and not covering anything at all. They are just sitting in my drawers now. Such a complete waste of money and I thought these will be good since a lot of positive comments are on these products. I dont get amazon sometimes.</li>
            <li> High Quality brushes with cute carrying pouch and even instructions on which brushes are what. I love them and use them everyday!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!!! They are soft, yet the bristles stay in and don&#x27;t flake! I will totally buy from Shany again!</li>
            <li> Brushes work very well there was a smell but that went away with the washing of the brushes. I would recommend these brushes especially for the price I paid. There was very little shedding if any.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, Jus washed them and they are great! Come in nice red pouch. It was a good buy !</li>
            <li> looks super high quality. so far no complaints and works well. reasonably priced and you get a lot of different brushes</li>
            <li> I have all this cosmetic brush for this price!!! great an they are so good my make up is awsome!!</li>
            <li> Affordable and effective. I use these brushes on my clients for makeup. They are soft, they do the job and they look legitimate. If you do not want to spend an arm and a leg for those MAC brushes......these will suffice.</li>
            <li> They are great I clean them with baby wash and their are soft and clean I love my case also fits good in my purse</li>
            <li> Love the quality of these brushes.  Really qood product at good price. If you are considering buying these -just do it! You wont regret it. Lovely leather satchel it comes with, too.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s nothing great about it. I really like the blush brush and some of the smaller eye brushes, but that&#x27;s it. A lot of the other ones are NOT soft and make my skin feel itchy. (and yes I washed before using)</li>
            <li> Would not recommend these at all. Save your money and buy good quality brushes.. even target has better brushes than these. They are soft, BUT way too soft to where the brush bends too much when trying to apply leading to wasted prouct. They are WAY to soft to work with and makeup falls right off. Also the brushes seem like they took artist paint brushes and stuck it into a collection because the brush is EXTREMELY FLAT. cannot work with that kind of brush on the contour of a round eyelid or cheek. These brushes would be better of for painting on flat paper.     Also these exact  same brushes are sold by a different name by Makeup By Ren Ren.  THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT. Leads me to belive these brushes are bought wholesale from china (Usually not the best quality) and sold by different vendors with defferent names.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting out with make up these are great to use. I dont use a couple of the brushes because theyre a little pointless but thats just me. The power brush and the blush brushes are my favorite and i use them everyday. The came on time too.</li>
            <li> If your a Beginner than these brushes are great..they actually keep intact and don&#x27;t fall apart like other brushes I have bought..I got these mainly because they were red..and I wanted a red brush set in my collection, the holding up pretty well, but as far as applying makeup, the eyeshadow brushes work very well but the others not quite up to my standards</li>
            <li> these brushes shed worse than my husky. I would get the little hairs in my eyes, in top of my foundation, and so on. after using it for a week, the black part of the brush can right off. it&#x27;s very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I find it inhumane to make a product with actual real animal fur! How cruel and that&#x27;s not what animals were put on earth for. I am glad that I read through the description, I have 2 friends and myself whom were going to order these. But needless to say there is no way we will now, and we will pass the word along.</li>
            <li> I love using these brushes! I was super excited when they came and I still love them. The only bad things are that they came with two of the same brush and they need a little bit of shaping every so often. Other than that, they are a great buy!</li>
            <li> They are lovely, packed in a leather case, that´s so chic, I am very happy with them.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised on how nice these are I have no complaints. I would happily recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. They do smell weird and bristles has fallen off; but over all I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li> Heard nothing but good things from this product, &amp; from make up artists :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is in order &amp; totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I loved this set at first...now the brush heads are coming off of the handles. It&#x27;s really frustrating when you&#x27;re trying to apply your makeup &amp; the brush heads keep falling off. I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new set. Other than that they are great, very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> GREAT brush set. Best out there for the price.</li>
            <li> These are my first real brushes and I have had them for about 2 years now. They are still holding up, but now they are shedding alittle. But I suppose it is due for them. They are fluffy, nice material, don&#x27;t prickle the skin, and it comes with a little pouch. So good deal and good product.</li>
            <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product i am looking forward to future purchases!totally worth the money i use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Really good quality brushes. Had mine for 1year now and there still going strong and applying just as great as day 1</li>
            <li> I love mine, but it would&#x27;ve been nice to be able to pick out what color of handles and roll up bag you want.  I got red.  I would&#x27;ve picked black or white or purple.</li>
            <li> Great brush kit, there&#x27;s a brush for every need in a cute little package! Def recommend, great price! Awesome gift!</li>
            <li> I will agree with other reviewers about the smell, but the instructions say to wash the brushes before use anyway.  After you do this, it&#x27;s not so bad.  The brushes work well.  I use them to apply mineral makeup, and my makeup goes on evenly with these brushes.  I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a bit scratchy and need to be constantly washed. It is ok for beginners, but if you are a professional I would not but it.</li>
            <li> The two reasons I give it three stars is because they have lasted about a year now, but I&#x27;ve noticed the bristles are falling out like crazy now! And you obviously can&#x27;t get much better on the price. So if you don&#x27;t mind not getting such great quality with a great price then do buy.</li>
            <li> These brushes look like good quality. I am very very excited to try them and happy overall with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This set by far exceeded my expectation. High quality storage case and each brush has a protective cover. This will be great for those who travel regularly</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding good makeup brushes that are soft that don&#x27;t cost a lot. These brushes are great and if I ever need more brushes I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> it was really good at the best price, for my first time with amazon... I&#x27;m happy , I&#x27;m recommend 100% to buy your cosmetics here its easy simple and fast</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes but so smelly! I think it&#x27;s the bag and I&#x27;m hoping the smell will go away after a while.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than scheduled and everything was in tact.  This is going to be perfect for my daughter who wants to practice makeup.</li>
            <li> I fell in love! The set color gets your eye attention! Being my first official set they were great, and good price. Couldn&#x27;t be happier .…however my eyelash/eyebrow spoolie head came off the 1st time I used it :(</li>
            <li> i was excited to get my brushes but i was disappointed when open it gave offf a strong smell like plastic of paint smell really bad and the smell is very strong the seller said they 13 pieces and are only 12</li>
            <li> I have just recently started getting into makeup &amp; I bought these brushes to go with a 78 color eyeshadow palette... I am very pleased with them they are very soft and pick up the eyeshadow easily. The handles are a nice length and the whole brush seems to be pretty sturdy (I have a different set that the metal part holding the brushes together came off the handle) pretty color and pretty case!!&lt;br /&gt;Only complaints are the strong plastic smell from the case and since I am new to this it would be nice if the brushes had names on them as there are a few that I am unsure of their purpose.. But you cant beat it for the price!!!</li>
            <li> This product had very fast delivery. I kind of pretended like I wasn&#x27;t home so they could just drop the package off at my doorstep. But when I opened it, I was absolutely ecstatic that mine was red :] But I&#x27;m trying out all the brushes now, and I must say that I&#x27;m impressed. This was totally worth it. I love this product. The brushes are very comfortable on my face and around my eyes. I&#x27;ve never owned a brush set that wasn&#x27;t just utterly flimsy or very coarse on my face, so this takes the cake. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs or wants a brush set, especially for the price! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I use the large full circular brushes for lightweight application and blending of face powder... The full brush deposits the product on top of my pores and distributes it evenly for a natural finish  Also flexible flat brushes with slight pointed tip for precision application and blending are amazing to work with.   No complaints what so everrr. I wash this set regularly and no issues with shedding  Honestly I was unsure about buying this product but now I am 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for such a low price! Most of the brushes you will need for your daily routine, and easy to keep organized as it comes with a lovely pouch! I can&#x27;t speak for the durability, because I got mine recently, but definitely worth the money so far! They don&#x27;t look cheap and flimsy like many other brushes at this price range.  Bottom line- A great buy!!</li>
            <li> i like this brush it is cheap and almost perfect  but it is not smoothe enough and i do not know that brand made in china</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. You don&#x27;t have to put much product on the brushes to get it to apply. It may be due to the quality of the Shany eyeshadows as well. Loving this purchase.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived as requested, but the case stinks to high heaven. They appear to be sturdy and will probably serve the purpose they were purchased for.</li>
            <li> didnt like the quality</li>
            <li> Excellent pricing and customer service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush set for about 3 years and only recently they&#x27;ve started falling apart which to me is no big deal. And only 2 of them have broken so far but I still use the ones that are together and they still work really well</li>
            <li> I love how great these work, my makeup comes out very even and my cousins love the ones I gave them for Christmas. I&#x27;d recommend these for people on a budget who need good brushes that come with a sweet roll-up case for them.</li>
            <li> The brushes have very thick bristles, not at all gentle</li>
            <li> Love the new brushes, and package for brushes are great for transport. Feel great on face when applying make up.</li>
            <li> The hairs fell out daily.  It is best to invest in a good set of makeup brushes.  These create lines and makes your makeup uneven</li>
            <li> i love it the brushes are so smooth, it looks like a professional brush and it arrived on time, it has an order but an packaging order, it will go away in a week, but its so nice and works good on me, the packaging and handling are so nice too, its really safe and nothing is damage inside,</li>
            <li> I love the brush set. I guess you could consider me not that picky, but the brush set is excellent I handle it very lighltly so the red bag it came with is sufficient for storage I absolutley love it.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all. I got my set in red, it comes exactly how it&#x27;s pictured. It&#x27;s cute, I even have a brush to my sister since there&#x27;s so many.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brushes (specifically the blush brushes) fall off more than I would like.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for a very good deal, ordered them last year &amp; I still use them everyday! The eye brushes are my favorite out of them all!</li>
            <li> I found these to be nice brushes for the price. I ordered 3 sets. 1 for myself, 2 for stocking stuffers for Christmas.  Other reviews said they smelled bad, I did not find that at all. And I checked the 2 that were gifts and they were also great. I can not complain about them at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set knowing that quality wasn&#x27;t going to be the best, but for 13$ who could say no? After reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and purchase it but when I received my set I discovered that it was missing the fan brush and in its place it had two of the same eye brush. I was really disappointed because That brush was one of the reasons I bought the set.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer!</li>
            <li> LOVE this set! The brushes are SO soft and uber-gentle on your eyelid, and they blend like a PRO! The red faux leather bifold pouch/purse it came in was alone probably worth the entire price of this set...</li>
            <li> Beautiful lovely...........</li>
            <li> Great product. Sturdy brushes.</li>
            <li> Hairs fall out of the brushes</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much softer brush.  They are a bit rough on the face and I wish I had returned them when I had the chance but I just kept hoping they would improve over time :(  They did not.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These brushes were okay for the price..</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes but for the price I paid I was hoping for little better quality. I still use them on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> My wife was pleased with these at first. Unfortunately after a couple months of use all the brushes she uses regularly are loose. Where the metal piece is connected to the handle is loose. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> The brushes came quickly, they work more or less, and everything was as it said. The only problem I have with these is that they shed EVERYWHERE and when I say everywhere I mean in your drawers (or wherever you put your brushes), on your face, everywhere. The second problem is that the handle kept separating from the brush part. If you look in the picture you can see where it switches from red to black. That&#x27;s where it kept falling off. An easy fix, but annoying nonetheless. Overall, some good brushes for their price.</li>
            <li> This collection seems to carry each and every known sized Brush. . These brushes don&#x27;t seem to shed as some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Evers</li>
            <li> The brushes I use the most seem to shed and I get the bristles all over my face...maybe it&#x27;s just me!!!</li>
            <li> Just want I was expecting, arrived in expected time, nicely packaged and yeah I was pretty happy with it, would definitely purchase again from SHANY :) Cheers!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice and soft and seem like they will hold up well.  I got them very quickly using Amazon Prime (I am not sure if it was even 2 days!), so I am very impressed with this company.  Be sure to wash them with shampoo before use like they say in the instructions.  Very nice and inexpensive too!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good quality, but it sheds like a cat. Keep that in mind when purchasing.</li>
            <li> Love Shany products already but this is the first brush set that I have bought that has me completely satisfied.  I highly recommend this set.  Its great quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> If you travel extensively, this product is for you.  Every type of make up brush one could possibly want is provided in the case.  The case is clever too, because it conveniently organizes quite a number of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitate to recommend this product because quality is absent from the brushes.  They are barely satisfactory compared to the brushes I purchased from other companies; however, at a much higher cost.  This is not the product to purchase for everyday use--the brushes will fall apart or not function as intended.  But as a travel companion for very occasional use, this product is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also consider purchasing this product for a young person beginning to learn how to use makeup.  Again, quality is absent from this product, but this product is inexpensive.  Something has to give.  I hope this is helpful.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister. I am very impressed with the bag, only my sister can comment on product, so far I feel, it worth cost.</li>
            <li> This brush set is terrific.  It has every brush you can possibly need to put on makeup and the quality of the brushes is excellent.  You also can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes! they are great for a beginner makeup junkie like myself. the case is convenient to store. One issue though - the case smelt strongly of paint. otherwise, best 12.99 i ever spent</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I ordered these on a whim but they arrived quickly and it&#x27;s a very nice set. The brushes are soft and there&#x27;s not too many of them (there&#x27;s usually a bunch that I don&#x27;t know what to do with!). I do wish I got to choose the color of the set, mine is red but would have liked a choice. Other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Brushes are great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Mine came in a red pouch like the one in the picture.  I cleaned them when I took them out of the packaging with Bare Minerals brush cleaner, and they&#x27;re still intact.  I was concerned the bristles would fall out; but they didn&#x27;t, and the brushes kept their shape.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> These brushes are made from great materials. The bristles don&#x27;t fall off and are very soft on the face. I only wish they had an option where we could choose the color of our liking, but at this price I would take any color!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, I uses them daily without any disappointment</li>
            <li> Very good set, had it about a year, then it started to shed so i will be a buying a new set to replace this one</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you</li>
            <li> gave this to my co worker</li>
            <li> Food tools for my art projects</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product and cheap</li>
            <li> Good brushes. I really liked they picked up make up very well.</li>
            <li> These brushes smell funny. Musty weird smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of brushes just to qualify for free shipping:) However I am really pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I used each of them, they are all very usefull. They are soft and a perfect quality for it&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;The pouch is also helpful, I can easily carry it in my bag, it is compact and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend if you want a good product for a very good price.</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVEEE WITH SHANYS BRUSHES. they are the softest brushes i have ever used very afforable the brushes are dense and easy to use and clean, its so afforable , and perfect for gift ideas.</li>
            <li> these makeup brushes are amazing! they ship super fast and for they&#x27;re price it is completely worth it. they pick up makeup really well and the pouch they come in is absolutely adorable! i will definitely recommend this to a friend! thanks shany cosmetics for your great products!!</li>
            <li> I have to say for the people complaining, that these brushes need to be taken with a grain of salt given the price. I mean really nice brushes coast $20-30 a piece at department stores. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with makeup lately and really wanted a variety of different sizes for eye shadow, eye liner, and brows. This satisfied my expectations. I thought the brushes are soft and apply make up well, and I&#x27;ve been using them for over a month without problems. Obviously not as nice as the department store ones but what do you expect to get a whole set for a fraction of the price of one!!</li>
            <li> These brushes did shed a bit as others mentioned but still a price for the total of brushes included. Good purchase overall.</li>
            <li> these brushes are so soft and easy to clean i love they color and the pink on the brushes don&#x27;t chip :)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they apply your make up so good i mean its worth the money i spent for it. All these other brand name brushes are so over priced i was so glad to find good quality brushes that are worth my money. Yeah Me!!!1</li>
            <li> I gave the Brush Set as a gift to my girlfriend and she love it. This one is the second one I bought, now for my sister. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and the brushes are giving a clean finish...i recommend this absolutely... the pouch is also very convinient ...it was shipped and delivered on tiem as well....</li>
            <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li> I love it! The color sizes and everything is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend to buy this product! I was waiting for something smaller and once on hands It took out my breath!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are pretty decent, but after having them for one day, one of the brushes fell off of the handle.</li>
            <li> These are not professional brushes, so you don&#x27;t really get the range or variety you would for higher end brushes. For the price, they are great. And the work wonders for beginners!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product before reading the reviews and thought I had wasted my money. I just received them yesterday (2 days before the delivery date estimate). There was an odor when I first opened the box but I think it is the pouch and not the brushes. Just to see before I washed the brushes I took them out the pouch and left them in the box, the pouch was still stinky but the brushes aren&#x27;t. They are very soft, and there are a few that are the same just different sizes. To be complete it should have a bent eyeliner brush. But overall for the price it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The most amazing brushes i ever used. I recommend ppl to buy them, u wont regret it!I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> its a great deal. i didnt use the pouch, however. it has become one of my favorite brush sets. i keep them within reach of me where ever i go.</li>
            <li> I recieved these brushes about a week ago, and I absolutely love them! They are very durable. soft, and apply makeup very evenly. The eyehadow brushes blend and pack on very well! I wasn&#x27;t so sure wether or not to buy these, but for the price I was willing to gamble and I am so glad I did!! Perfect for the everyday makeup guru :)</li>
            <li> This product is very great! It was shipped out very fast which was from Amazon, even though I did see a post about this product of how customers did not receive all of the brushes, so that left me feeling anxious and scared. But, I did receive everything that I have paid for. When I did open the box, the pouch and the brushes smelled horrific like it smelled like a open can of paint. I didn&#x27;t want to apply it on my face until the smell was gone because I didn&#x27;t want my face to smell like it. I did let it air out for about 2-3 days so the smell would disappear. When it did, the brushes were soft they felt like feathers, the brushes did not shatter on my face, and it was very light weight. I used to have elf brushes but those brushes got really ruff with my makeup and was always falling apart and they always have an odor to them even after I wash them.I hope to have a long relationship with my new makeup brushes and be able to try new tricks that I weren&#x27;t before with my elf brushes.</li>
            <li> This product is a great value.  The brushes are made natural hair.  I have seen other sets costing incredibly more.  I travel and with the pouch this one will be traveling.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my younger sister, who loves makeup. This set arrived on time and she loved the quality of the brushes. The brushes work well on a variety of products and help her create that perfect smokey eye. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I thought they were very cheap in quality. They look nice, but the brush sheds, there are two brushes that are ok..</li>
            <li> I recieved my order in just a couple days and I am very pleased with this product! I have used different make up brushes in the past and I threw them away after using these ones. They are wonderful! The best part is you get 13 pieces for what $15-17.00? I was just in sephora the other day and they had a 4 or 5 piece for like $80.00. That is insane! The only complaint I have is that I wish these were labled with the brush number. I watch a lot of turorials on youtube and all their brushes have the standard brush number. So, I usually just guess on which one to use from my pouch......Be sure to wash the brushes after every use espically if you are using black shadow. You can wipe them off with a baby wipe or use soap and water. And BE SURE to lay them flat on a paper towl to dry. Never stand them upright, as this will damage the hairs. I also purchased the BH Cosmetics 120 pallette. Love, Love, Love:)  Hope this helps and potential buyers!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed when I recieved these sets of brushes. I bought them for our two daughters for Christmas. They are nice looking and I&#x27;m thinking about buying myself one now that I know what they look like. The shipping was fast and accurate and one time. I Love Amazon.com I am hooked. :-)</li>
            <li> came pretty quick which I was really happy about. i ordered it because not only was it a lot of brushes for a good price but came in a to go wrap carrier thing. my only real complaint was the GOD AWFUL SMELL from the carrier wrap. I mean I can&#x27;t even describe it except it gave me the worst headache... so I literarily wrapped it up and threw it in the back of my closet, the brushes I put in my draw and have been using them a lot, some bristles fall out but not a big deal, i still really like them. plus i have a million other brushes- i say go for it!</li>
            <li> So awesome that the hairs don&#x27;t fall out of these when you use them which is what I have experienced with all the other makeup brushes I have purchased in the past.  Definitely buying these for my daughter for Christmas!</li>
            <li> For the price, these are great brushes. Ive had them for a year now, and only two of them have broken...But I only use like three of them. The eyeshadow brushes are too hard and dont hold eyeshadow. The foundation brushes work great, I use them everyday, today one broke so im now using the other one.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment, The brushes are well made. Once again they were a gift for my other daughter. She loved them.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gave to my gf for her birthday and she loved them. They came within 2 days and in perfect packaging. thanks</li>
            <li> These are ok brushes... the heads fell off the wooden brush after just a few months though.  Don&#x27;t soak your brushes when you clean them!</li>
            <li> The quality is very shabby and the bristles feel like animal hair. No amount of washing or moisturizing makes it better. Do yourself a favor and buy quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a year now and they&#x27;re still working/looking/feeling brand new.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re super soft and the makeup goes on evenly with them.</li>
            <li> they r ok I can work with them but not all. some r to plastic ish and r not soft</li>
            <li> love how soft and they blend well. so far no shedding. great brushes at a great price!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes over a year ago and I still use them to this day, they are my favorite brushes to use. They aren&#x27;t the softest but that docent bother me too much.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift... daughter loved it !!!</li>
            <li> Red brush roll is really nice and easy clean up. The brushes are ok but not the best quality. The set is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Update :10/1/12  Love this set! Very little fall out. They work so well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving these brushes more and more all the time. They are so soft, and no matter how much I wash them they don&#x27;t shed. Great brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are so soft, and yet still pretty dense. They all work so well. I&#x27;m very pleased about these, I&#x27;ll probably order more soon :)</li>
            <li> While they aren&#x27;t Mac quality, they are very comparable with Bamboo and Ulta brands.. Very satisfied! I have a set in my bathroom and also at the office..&lt;br /&gt;*Their make-up is very nice and pigmented too!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I thought that with the number of reviews and stars that I would enjoy these brushes. I have trouble using these brushes with out having to pick the brush off my face. The worst thing ever, first thing in the morning. I mistakenly bought two of them. I told my neighbor she could have the other set. After using them I won&#x27;t even give them to her.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and seem durable.  Brush case is a little stinky but after just one night set out seems to have lost the smell.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I work in theatre and these are performing great for my stage makeup needs.  Great price, highly recommended.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> These brushes exceeded my expectations! They were wrapped nicely and the bag is well made. The brushes themselves are soft and durable. Even the handles fit my hand quite nicely! The brushes smelled like the packaging the first few days, but that went away one they aired out. All in all, I am so happy with this purchase, if you&#x27;re contemplating; look no further!!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes and they work amazingly. I did a lot of research on this item, and I did not know they were made of animal hair. I love animals and I love the brushes. I got a red pouch and I made an acception to use these brushes. I would not reccomend them to my friends because we all love animals alot.</li>
            <li> The brushes were really small only 3 were of good use):</li>
            <li> and they are by far my favorite brushes! They all have a specific purpose, and thats what I love. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> After ordering this (while waiting for it to come) I saw a few reviews saying multiple things about these brushes.. that they werent soft, that when first opened there was a horrible odor, that there was white powder all over them, &amp; that I wouldnt be getting my money&#x27;s worth.. So I was worried. But when I got them (fast shipping too by the way), there was no odor,no white powder, &amp; they ARE soft.. Theyre exactly what I was looking for..I love this &amp; would recommend it very much!</li>
            <li> Good product, very good condition and presentation. It works in perfect condition. Good choice. Great for personal use or for gifts.</li>
            <li> It has every brush you&#x27;d ever need, and a neat little packet telling you what each brush is and what it is for. The pouch they all come in is cute and organized! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> You get a lot of brushes in this set. Im not a makeup guru by any means, so im not sure what to use a lot of these for, but my guess is that i will paint my face with some of these and paint on canvas with some of the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> My teenage girl loved it. She makes all kind of makeups; she is a great artits and this set of brushes helps her a lot .  Thank you</li>
            <li> So soft and silky I love how these brushes feel on my face. It has everything you could want in a brush set, the case is better than most I have had the brush hair dosent shead and are very durable. I didnt notice any white powder or small some of the other reviews have mentioned but I did wash before use. I would def recomend</li>
            <li> I purchased the SHANY Professional 13-piece Cosmetic Brush Set for my niece&#x27;s 17th birthday. She was estatic! The quality of the brushes was more than I expected and my niece indicates that she is able to apply her makeup more effectively.</li>
            <li> I love this because they&#x27;re so inexpensive but the brushes are still much nicer then you would possible think they could be and the variety in them is also very very good. I&#x27;m a big makeup user and i use some of thess brushes every day.</li>
            <li> The bristles break off while applying my face makeup.  I have to pick them of my face. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awful!! They weren&#x27;t labeled right and some of the brushes weren&#x27;t there like they are on the pictures that were shown. Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> this are my first brushes ever and I have to say that for the price I really like them I&#x27;m still learning which ones are for what but so far so good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> beautiful very happy. great purchase gave this away as a gift my friend is still giving me props for it</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d my brushes in the red pouch &amp; yes, the odor is there, but its not unpleasant or strong, it is like a new leather/chemical smell and it is only on the case not the brushes. I checked each brush to see if I could gently pull out the hairs, I could not. I then washed them &amp; let them dry overnight. I have had them for a couple of weeks now &amp; I like them. I have not had any shedding, they are very soft. They are an odd mixed lot, I will say that. I think the only brush I dont like is the eyeliner brush, its cheap &amp; just isnt sturdy enough to apply liner, but I really like the other ones. I read all the reviews before my purchase &amp; was hesitant about such an inexpensive set, but I thought I would check them out &amp; I am very glad I did. I do have some expensive brushes &amp; honestly I cannot tell the difference. I do not leave them in the case, I have a brush stand that I made. The case still has a slight odor to it, but it doesnt bother me &amp; I will use it for travel. Overall, I dont think you will be disappointed, give them a try, save the big bucks for makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for myself for my Birthday. I love them. I am not a professional makeup artist, I am just beginning to learn makeup techniques. I like how soft these bristles are and I like that they are sturdy. The case they came in is cute, but I prefer to keep my brushes in a cup so they can breath. I recommend washing these with mild soap before using them.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. Excellent variety. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I will definitely be buying more products by Shany.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this set of brushes for about a month now &amp; i am so happy i got them! 1st, they came in my fave color (red) and 2nd, they are so soft!! I had brushes b4 but they were a bit hard &amp; would poke me when i would apply my makeup! I LOVE LOVE LOVE these!!! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> these brushes are of a better quality than i was expecting. my daughter will love them. they also arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> It came so nicely packaged (in this black professional black) all of the brushes were nicely packaged. From the moment I opened it I started to pull on the bristles and not one hair came out, I was astonished and they were very soft. Love them! I havent used it yet but I just felt compelled to write this review because I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price! The brushes are soft and very good quality. I would recommend to wash them before using because it has this factory smell. Happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to a new cosmetic brush set, so I ordered Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush 13 piece set with a Pouch. The set arrived in a timely manner and the brushes looked exactly as shown which was great. However, when I started using the larger brushes, pieces of the brush material kept sticking to my face. As I brushed over my eyes, nose, and cheeks brush material remained. I was so annoyed because the material was sticking and ruining my foundation. Overall, I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I&#x27;ve had other brushes and I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this before. On the other hand, for as many brushes as I received for the price, I guess I&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li> These brushes work so well and they r easy to clean I must say that these are prob the best brushes I have ever owned</li>
            <li> Very good brushes. Good quality and nice colors and the case is stylish. They delivered in just two days. And the price is honest. I&#x27;m very content with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> The brushes are poor quality. They are described as professional, but do not hold make up on the brush. Also, Received a set that looked used.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much. Their soft but not too soft. They apply the color I need and are easy to clean and are stored neatly in the cute pouch. I am so happy I bought this item~ &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Received these on time and in good condition. Not of the best quality, but with the price as it is, I didn&#x27;t expect these brushes to be of highest quality. Seem to work alright; they are very soft. Probably not for those who desire heavy coverage though; much product seems to fall off of the brush during application.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got to use them yet as they are for cosmetology school but they look and feel great, and the case looks great too. Can&#x27;t wait to use this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the price, the brushes aren&#x27;t that good quality. In matter of fact, the E.L.F. Studio line brushes are better, and they&#x27;re at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The packaging is great. The brushes come in a neat leather pouch, with each brush individually wrapped. It looks very professional. The brushes are soft and work very well. The product has a great value, the price is much lower than it&#x27;s worth. Recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great set of brushes.</li>
            <li> This happens to be my favorite brush set. I love them. They work perfectly and they also clean very easily! Great product! :]</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes! I love the case that they come in. I have gotten tons of compliments on the set!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft,but I am a little dissapointed in the eye brushes. They don&#x27;t pick up much eye shadow,but they are very soft and for a cheap order, I am overall pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the way this looks for the price.  Only time will tell if the brushes hold up.  The case smells a little funny just out of the package.</li>
            <li> The only brush I don&#x27;t like is the fan brush - it&#x27;s totally weak and doesn&#x27;t do anything. My only *real* complaint is that the bristles fall out easily. I have enjoyed these and they&#x27;re great as a first set of brushes. They&#x27;re fairly soft too. If you&#x27;re someone who does extremely basic makeup everyday, you won&#x27;t need all 13. I would get a smaller set.</li>
            <li> I thought about buying these for myself, but decided against it because I was afraid they would be poor quality. To my surprise, my sister bought them for me for Christmas and I LOVE them. There&#x27;s a slight smell when you first open them but it goes away. None of the hairs are falling out and they are sooo soft! Buy them!</li>
            <li> I would rather buy dollar store brushes because thats what they look and feel like! I hate the ugly cheap, tacky red case it comes in. The fan brush is the thinest fan brush i have ever used in my life. It doesnt even wipe the excess fallouts on your face. You actually end up blending the unwanted spects into your foundation (talking about being mad). I would recommend this to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of brushes for not a lot of cash. A little weird that they are made with badger and goat hair. If you aren&#x27;t super experienced with make-up some of the brushes feel redundant, but so far they work great and do not shed.</li>
            <li> These brushes work good for me..They were a great price for all you get in the set and the carrying case is nice to keep them all together.</li>
            <li> brushes seem okay for the money. came in cute red foldout-style pouch which made for a nice gift. pleased with this purchase overall, would buy again!</li>
            <li> Good for starting out not high quality but for younger girls just learning about make-up it works just great. Thanks</li>
            <li> The brushes are of excellent quality. I wish the case did not smell so strong...actually it smells terribly...try a better one.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my teenage daughter, who is in the process of learning to apply makeup using brushes and the different tools to help her with a flawless finished look. The tools are sturdy and the brushes have kept their shape.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my wife for Christmas. Great selection of brushes &amp; all very top quality. Brushes remain intact, unlike others she has used in the past which have lost lots of bristles.</li>
            <li> She loved it. Really professionally packaged. Valentines day was a blast! She is gonna get her Naked Platte 2 on top of this also. She&#x27;s a happy camper</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes.  The price is also very good and will recommend and order again.  The class loves  the set.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Came quickly and exactly like it stated it would come. Great quality product for sure!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday! it has every single brush that I would ever use! and its a good quality too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using my boyfriend account but I just wanted to give SHANY cosmetics a Thumbs up! I really like their product and I can&#x27;t wait to get my new eyeshadow palette in the mail!</li>
            <li> I am a make up noob so I needed to get  some of the essentials to start my own make up collection. And I must say for this price this is quite the deal, and I like the idea that you get more than four brushes. Unlike on eBay where I have seen 4 brushes costing up to $21.00. I seriously do want make up but I can&#x27;t afford some of those high end items. So I always stick to either Asian cosmetics or things like elf. But this brush set is extremely soft, I agree with the other reviewer you should definitely wash these brushes before using them. Not sure what is up with the powder, but hey as long as the product gets the job done right. C:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m.so happy that it got this. I order this and it came sooner then it said it was... So I got this in two days....</li>
            <li> What a great set of brushes! The red is so cute and so is the bag and for a great price!</li>
            <li> it contains all sizes of what I need and is in a quality. nice for makeup.everything for the basic and median makeup can be found.</li>
            <li> Had a weird smell to them.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product. The brushes are so soft and easy to use. I love them!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the softest and best quality. I am surprised that they are only this price.I am in love these products.</li>
            <li> When this brush set arrived at my house I was more than excited!! I instantly unwrapped my brushes looking like a little kid on Christmas. They were such high quality item! I know what to get my friends for the holidays now!!</li>
            <li> These are the worst brushes I have ever used. They smell and they&#x27;re like a old rug. Only gave 2 stars because there two things I use, the brow brush and angled brush.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC :)  I LOVE THIS BRUSH SET .... AND I JUST SEEN THE PINK SET ...I WANT IT ... WILL BUY IT REAL SOON ...</li>
            <li> The smaller eye makeup brushes are okay, but the large powder brushes are worthless. They leave hairs all over my face and bathroom counter. Also, there is a strange plastic smell that is obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> First, the picture shown on the main search page prior to selecting it, does not match the actual merchandise as there is NO big powder brush.  The set looks nice and is portable with the pouch, but those are the only positives.  I had hoped that I would be lucky like the other reviewers and not have brushes that shed, but these started shedding as soon as I washed them.  They shed during cleaning and when I used them to put on powder.  Since the price for these was so low, I&#x27;m tempted to just eat the cost and throw them away.  Although, I may still return them.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t a mistake to buy at all! They&#x27;re very soft brushes and the pouch is gorgeous, when I opened it everyone asked where I had gotten it, and when I used them this morning they blended extremely well and were great for putting on fondation, eyeliner, eye makeup, even lip products! I am just so pleased with what I got, and for how inexpensive these brushes are, it&#x27;s an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful set and the brushes seem to be well made. The case is a vibrant red that catches the eye.  What concerns me is the heavy petroleum vapors that are coming off the case. It sat in my bathroom for 20 min. and stunk up the room with what I can only describe as a gasoline scent. Luckily the brushes don&#x27;t stink so I&#x27;m just going to throw the case away and search for one that doesn&#x27;t make me want to pass out. Otherwise this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are fantastic! They hold makeup very well and offer great control during application. The carrying case rolls up to a manageable size that fits perfectly in my vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok. There are better brushes out there. They fall off the wooden part when washed.</li>
            <li> I bought the SHANY brushes because I use their Cosmetics and like them. I have no problem with the brushes, there are better ones on the market. However, I plan on getting another set for my Studio.</li>
            <li> I thought it was value for money at first but upon receiving the brushes I was quite disappointed because there&lt;br /&gt;is No name on the brushes or product booklet so newbies like me are not be able to identify which brush is meant for what use. Moreover The brushes shed and Have very  thin bristles. The comb kind of brush is really hard.</li>
            <li> I have never owned decent brushes before.  These are great for the value and the variety of brushes makes the deal a steal.  I especially like the storage pouch since I have a tendency to misplace or mistreat my brushes.  This way they are all there when I need them and they are kept in good shape.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves it. In the past she has tried similar products but none to her satisfaction. free flow.</li>
            <li> I recieved these yesterday, although beautiful the scent is not pleasant. I bought these soley on the great reviews, boy was I disappointed. I washed them, and the scent still lingers. How this product is rated 4+ star baffles me.</li>
            <li> great set and value, I recently bought urban decays naked contouring palette and this set help me make magic!</li>
            <li> fantastic product, no breaks or anything.</li>
            <li> It was a gift so hopefully she likes it. But love the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Others have said that the brushes have some sort of stench, but mine didn&#x27;t. At this price, the quality is just fine.</li>
            <li> love love love ..&lt;br /&gt;shipped quickly.package was nice.&lt;br /&gt;love the different sizes and my make up has never looked better, I&#x27;ll not use the traditional make up applicators ever again it&#x27;s brushes from here on..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup brush fan, but I needed them and wasn&#x27;t going to spend an exuberant amount on just one brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is a little big and cheesy, but you don&#x27;t have to keep them in there, they fit perfectly in a cheap toothbrush zip up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also aren&#x27;t the softest in the world.  I have sensitive skin and they scratch a little, but for the money, I&#x27;ll bear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, these brushes shed, so prepare for that.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this product, but still need to get use to how to use them.  The quality of the brushes are fair.  These are not high quality, but works for my needs.</li>
            <li> The price is awesome! Quality is too be expected for the pricing, if you are new at applying makeup &amp;#34;GO FOR IT&amp;#34;. The lip brush and eyebrow brushes are a bit too stiff.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with my real techniques brushes and they work pretty well overall. You get quite a few brushes in the set and for the money I would say they are worth it!</li>
            <li> The best.  After 5 years or so, I guess I need to get another set.  Really nice quality brushes.  I have a very positive experience with these brushes.  Use them every day.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay and MAC are my top brands usually. For Christmas last year I received a Shany eyeshadow pallet. I loved it. I just received my brushes a week ago. Perfect for the price and function. I definitely recommend these brushes and the eyeshadows. :)</li>
            <li> Love the case. The brushes are decent quality. So far so good. Great variety for all the uses you can get out of this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to wash the make up off the brushes. Bits and pieces also come off as I use it but it is still decent quality for the amount I paid.</li>
            <li> Perfect set for a beginner at makeup like myself. I use these brushes to apply makeup for work, and these brushes are perfect! Great price as well!</li>
            <li> One month down with X3 per week use and they are fraying. Beautifully red all the same</li>
            <li> I really like the brush set. I use the powder brush regularly and it works so much better than the Sephora one I had before. The hairs are fine so it spreads my foundation powder thinner without sacrificing coverage. My face feels less cakey and my makeup doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy. Pretty sure I use less foundation too, but don&#x27;t quote me on this. Also, I love how the brushes feel. I&#x27;ve used brushes that feel harsh on my face and it almost hurts to put shadow/liner on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I have with the bigger brushes is that the bristles fall off easily. I usually gently tug at the hairs before I use the brush to get rid of any loose ends. Nothing came off when I did this. When I started putting powder on my face, there were bristles loose all over the brush and a few on my face. It doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, and even when it does, I still prefer this brush over the Sephora one I had.</li>
            <li> These do have a bit of a smell, but its not something excessive.  Just wash them, and it goes away.  Great value for number of brushes - and they work fine.  I like them and the pouch they come with are as pictured/described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The brush heads (metal from red part) come off very easily.  Especially if you travel with them.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but since there are so many brushes on the market I&#x27;d rather have ones that don&#x27;t fall apart.  Downgrading rating from 5 stars to 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please click &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; below.

            <li> the price it right. NOT better than MAC products but will do. powder brush sheds too much though. Awesome price</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect makeup brush set for quite awhile, and I think I chose right. The brushes are long, and look so professional! I love these, especially for the price! Would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> These brushes look very nice. Much nicer than expected. They are a Christmas gift so I can&#x27;t speak to performance but they look like they are going to be wonderful.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush set is nice. It&#x27;s good quality for the price, and a great variety of brushes. These brushes really pick up color and are way softer than expected. Unfortunately there is a bit of shedding, however for the price it is somewhat expected. Overall they are good quality for a beginner make-up guru or someone that wants a little more variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> This was a great Christmas gift! The packaging was really nice and the brush set even had a case for the brush for travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 16 year old granddaughter.  She was very pleased with the variety and quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Very good price, however, these brushes aren&#x27;t high quality if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. It&#x27;s a good price for a beginner or someone who really doesn&#x27;t know much about application. I feel like the bristles weren&#x27;t thick or strong enough save for a few. But still satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I was wishing for, but I now have a brush for everything I need! I Love my new Shany brushes! And the smell goes away after you wash them, and I&#x27;ve had mine for well over a month and still haven&#x27;t had a single bristle come out!</li>
            <li> These are ok. Not the best brushes but for the price I guess they are fine. They are not as full as I wish they were and I don&#x27;t think they will be lasting a lifetime but if you&#x27;re looking for a quick buy that will get the job done these should work.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as needed and wanted. it arrived on time. It fit the discription.an no parts were missing.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for the set for the price. But I have found that a lot of brushes are loosing their brisles I guess you could call them. For the price though it isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> the quality of the brushes weren&#x27;t what I thought I was buying. They work fine, but they dont last very long. After one month the metal connecting the brush to the handle starts to pop off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use these brushes at all. The description says the brushes have a soft and silky feel and they by no means do. They are very rough on the skin!!</li>
            <li> Im in the process of reviewing  other cosmetic brushes. I wanted to do a six months review with the product. Pros are very good applying my makeup and easy on my eye application. Cons the hair of the  brushes fall out while putting on my makeup, its frustrating at times. I hope this help</li>
            <li> I got this and Im surprise it looks very profesional, and the set of brushes its well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice quality and cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes hoping they would be decent. But I should have just kept my old set because these brushes are of horrible quality. The bristles are so harsh on the skin and they shed everywhere. I even have bristles in my makeup now. But its true what they say, you get what you pay for. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m going to go buy new replacements of the brand I had before.</li>
            <li> Really good variety of brushes. Great quality for the price. Some of the brushes shed a little, but they still work. This is great for a travel set if you don&#x27;t want to travel with your regular makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> they are fairly nice, nothing overly fancy. lots of little hairs come off the brush for a while.  but there are tons of brushes and i use them often</li>
            <li> I love this set. I end up using this instead of the brushes that come with my foundation. And it does matter too. And the pouch is amazing.</li>
            <li> Its not the most fantastic brushes I&#x27;ve ever used, however it does the job adequately enough especially for such a low price. No shedding so far and yes, its very recommended that you wash before use!</li>
            <li> Not particularly fancy or luxurious, but they get the job done.  These are the first brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I can tell they aren&#x27;t top of the line.  Not bad, though.  I&#x27;ve been using them for several months, and they&#x27;re holding up pretty good.  Some shedding.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product a week ago and already using the foundation brush i constantly find little bristles coming out of the brush and sticking to my face, not all the brushes are like this, but a few i&#x27;ve basically had to throw away due to their quality. Next time i&#x27;ll choose to buy something most expensive and hopefully of better quality.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to everyone and anyone professional or not! i soon plan to buy more SHANy products.</li>
            <li> Would not reorder these, and the case they come in smells so plastic you will have to air and spray with something to use.</li>
            <li> i havent use all the brushes yet but i think the quality is good and the price is not that expensive//</li>
            <li> They worked out great and use them every day.  I especially like the eye shadow brushes.  Not 5 star but close to it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who spend hundreds on high end brands for brushes as these brushes are truly amazing. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 months now, and i can&#x27;t help but compare them to other brushes that I used before (and spent alot more money on). These brushes are strong and I would recommend this for everyone! A great buy I won&#x27;t ever regret!</li>
            <li> Love this set so much I bought two as gifts! Everyone that sees my set loves it as do I! I&#x27;ve used a few brushes daily for over a year and a half and they are still holding up as great as the day I bought them and are super easy to put away!</li>
            <li> I believe there are too many sticks, but you should focus more on quality instead of providing more item, for daily use we usually use around 5 brushes will be fine</li>
            <li> brushes  dont look as good as in the picture, but would definitely would  buy again. Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft on your face, but sturdy. Also they pick up just the right amount of product. All around great product!</li>
            <li> Good for travel you have everything you need on one spot. Brought this with me to Cancun and it was ahhh-mazing!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she absolutely loved it! it ships fast and comes in a cute case ! :)</li>
            <li> For 12.99 you get what you pay for. These brushes look nice until you go to use them and they start falling apart as soon as you take them out of the packaging. I have since thrown these away. I couldn&#x27;t deal with it</li>
            <li> The quality was inferior.  I could use two out of the set and threw the others away....inferior bristles hardly worth salvaging two of them.</li>
            <li> I was having some difficulties picking up color on the brushes but they are very soft on skin and i love it for light hand application.</li>
            <li> My brushes were fully intact.  Shipped on time. They are not super expensive brushes but they are pretty good for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I ordered these Christmas day and just received them. They are just what I needed to improve my makeup. I love the roll up case they come in.</li>
            <li> Recipient really liked this set.  Good variety and well made for the price.  Nice packaging, nice presentation.  Should have gotten one for myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter to play makeup. What a nice set! And for the price I don&#x27;t mind her abuse on them.</li>
            <li> I gave 2 stars because it is a nice, soft brush set but the chemical smell from the packaging is overwhelming. This isn&#x27;t something I really want to use with my face or make-up due to the intense chemical smell.</li>
            <li> This items works for getting the job done, like if you only had these to use in a hurry. They shed like crazy and leave little hairs/bristles all over my face. For that reason, I&#x27;m not a fan of these brushes. The only time i use them is when I have no other choice. Very disappointed with them!</li>
            <li> I loved the variety of brushes for such a cheap brush but I apply my makeup every day and found that the bristles were very stiff and fragile. When I am done putting on my makeup there are little hairs all over my face. I wish they were a little more natural and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of makeup brushes to go with a makeup case I bought my 13yo for Christmas. The brushes arrived on-time and packaged in a pretty pouch. The quality of the brushes is good, and there is a good variety of them. Overall, we&#x27;re very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Shany brushes. I can tell the difference in the way my make up goes on. I love it. I have recommended a few people to order these. I will be purchasing more of your products in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was desperately in need of new make up brushes but on a pretty tight budget. And it is so true that you get what you pay for. These brushes aren&#x27;t horrible or anything but I didnt like the bristles of them too much. I am new to the make up world and have never used mac brushes or any other better brand, so I guess you could say these are my first &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brushes that i have bought. But I have bought drug-store brushes that I feel are better quality than these are. Again, they aren&#x27;t horrible but I have found better at the same time.</li>
            <li> They are my fav brushes.  I used them anytime i have a big occasion or i am doing something extra special.  I wish the brushes were labelled but otherwise from that they all work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give them 5 stars because they have lived through many applications and disinfecting and haven&#x27;t fallen apart. That&#x27;s a big deal lol!</li>
            <li> Brushes she&#x27;d a lot and for a starter makeup junkie to start a collection.Came on time and packaged well.DIDNT CARE FOR THE CHEMICAL SMELL</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Great brushes fantastic price!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. After only 30 days the hair is coming out of the brushes</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE these brushes. Good quality, sleek look, longevity for use. Ive had them for a long while now and they still work just as well. Bristles are soft, but ont fall out. They collect and hold the makeup really well, and blending is really easy. The pouch smells like hot plastic when you first receive the product, so just leave the brushes in the fridge for a day if the smell honestly bothers you that much. The smell goes away on its own after a few days anyway.</li>
            <li> I order these brushes because i wanted to try out the quality of the brand. They shipped fast and arrived before the date is said to arrive so that was a plus. The packaging was good so no complains there. The brushes shed and they are not soft like they said they were going to be. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price.  These brushes are nothing spectacular but they work.  Needs a decent powder brush for 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Wife was very happy with purchase... The price seemed to be good and the product offered a good selection for multiple application purposes.</li>
            <li> I really love it thanks, and i will tell all my friends to buy it, thank you again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naz Sami</li>
            <li> i recommend this product very much. My wife loved it. And was very surprised with the quality of it. You should try it.</li>
            <li> Hoping to find something \\&quot;professional\\&quot; with an afordable price but well, can&#x27;t expect that much. It dissapointed me just a little when I first saw it, but I wasn&#x27;t surprise about the quality. the kit has nice variaty but the brush wasn&#x27;t soft enough and the brush hair were all uneven and they tend to fall all over. In addition, it smell as plastic... or as chemical... if you are looking for something to cheap, this could be enough. However, if you are looking for good brushes, then not, you may wanna search something else. Don&#x27;t expect that much for this amount of money</li>
            <li> The cost and the amount of brushes you get and variety of them are what sold me on 5 stars. They might not be professional brushes, but the quality is still pretty amazing. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about them, besides the bristles do fall out, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good product and need a quick set that will last you a few sessions, then buy this and use it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very cute product...I bought this for a friend who was in love with her gift. I just might get one for myself</li>
            <li> Like the title says, these brushes are so soft! Everything I needed and the price is unbeatable. Great set for a novice like myself.</li>
            <li> very lovely brushes. they pick up product well, easy to clean. Nothing bad to say about this product. Oh and there was no fowl smell that some other reviewers complained about. The only thing I wish was that each brush came labeled with its name and not the number only, this is not a deal breaker though. It took the liberty of labeling my brushes.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT. BUT IS MORE USEFUL IF YOU ARE REALLY GOOD AT MAKEUP</li>
            <li> Every brush I used left little brush hairs everywhere</li>
            <li> Not as quality as other reviewers stated.  The brushes are prickly against skin, if you like soft brushes, DO NOT BUY THESE.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes for the price. Love them and use them all the time. Little to no fall out on the brushes.</li>
            <li> I soo love these brushes. They came in a timely manner. Also included with my brushes was a great carry all pouch. I was unable to pick the color of my brushes, but that was okay they sent my favorite color \\&quot;RED\\&quot;. Great quality, they have gain a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I am so excited and happy i ordered these:))) the only thing i dont like about the brushes is that the fan brush is really cheap. but all the other brushes are WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these a while back on a whim and before I really knew anything about makeup/brushes. Even then, they were absolute s***. Like some have said, shedding in ALL the places. Feels synthetic as fuark and the packaging is ugly to top everything off. It obviously doesn&#x27;t do the job. I mean, if the price looks too good to be true, then it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t cheap out on stuff for your face/skin, save up for MAC or something on that level.</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes, it is very useful, very practical (can take it everywhere) and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> You can tell these brushes were made with pride. Great price and you get so many different brushes. I found no flaws in any of them.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes really excited and am now very disappointed the bristles are coming apart in my make-up and on my face! Just not happy.</li>
            <li> Definitely a Professional set of quality brushes. You can feel it in the bristle hair, handle weight and construction and varied type. Note - for laymen there&#x27;s no instructions or key printed on the handle, just numbers for professionals who know what # brush they want for which effect and medium but many other manufacturers and vendors are charging much much more. These are well worth the money and do the job more than just adequately. Haven&#x27;t seen them hold up long term and after repeated us and wash...this remains to be seen, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> these brushes rock i use them everyday! i &lt;3 the eyeliner brush it is sooooo small yet creates the smoothest line !!!!!! i am very happy with these and you would think that the bristles would fall out but not a chance i am in love with these brushes</li>
            <li> Love it... i never bought make up brushes before..this was so worth it! Umm i don&#x27;t have anything else to say but this thing is telling me to write more lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist/makeup artist &amp; I purchased these brushes for my work makeup kit. They are by no means top of the line but they work great! I&#x27;m still networking &amp; building my business so it makes no sense for me to pay $100&#x27;s for brushes...I may never make the switch depending on how well these hold up. Every brush I regularly use was included. I am very satisfied! ....I may just switch these for my personal brushes I like them so much. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of an expert on make up and this is my first brush set but i can definitely say that i have not had a bad expirence with these brushes and my face powder goes on pretty smoothly....only thing some of the brushes in my set are a little to stiff and idk if its the same with others but the color on my eyes would spread better i believe with a softer brush. Thats my only problem tho.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and I love it. It works excellent with their other beauty products. It will be a great gift for the women in you family.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really bad quality I don&#x27;t like it @ all and wish to return please advise how to do this!!!</li>
            <li> I received my Brush Set about 5 days ago and so far, I love them!! There have been complaints of shedding, but I always make sure to wash my brushes with baby shampoo before using them and I haven&#x27;t seen any hairs from the brushes. I only wish there was a foundation brush, but I was able to find one I liked at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. This set is great for personal use and you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price. Only wish they told you what each brush was for!! :)</li>
            <li> You get so much bang for your buck here! Good quality brushes, a great way to store them and keep them neat, and such a variety! You get all of your basics plus a few extra for such a great price.</li>
            <li> These brushes were given to me as a gift and I love them!! I have recently gotten back Into makeup to the point Im going to school for It and thats how these brushes came about. You get all the basics with the pouch and even better[[ASIN:B001JKTTVQ Shany Professional Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch (Color May Vary), 13 pc.]] with no fall out and no breakage.I have used brush cleaner, brush shampoo and taken them on tripps and no problems. If your looking for brushes look no further than these.</li>
            <li> for the price you&#x27;re paying they are really good. portable and easy to carry not a lot of hairs, but still good</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. My only comment is that they still smelled like lacquer or paint when they arrived. I don&#x27;t know if it was the handle of the brushes, or if it was the vinyl pouch. The smell went away after a few days, though. I&#x27;ve been using them for 2+ weeks now, and they don&#x27;t have any fall out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any shading with them. Very nice brushes for the money and I bought a set for my bestfriend who also does makeup and she said her Cilents love how soft they were!</li>
            <li> awesome set ... beautiful... works amazing... best brushes yet.... arrived on time and perfect !! couldnt ask for a better product.... great... truly happy</li>
            <li> I got tired of using those tiny disposable spongy applicators,so perhaps thats partially why im thrilled to have these brushes. They&#x27;ve made putting on makeup a breeze. Overall this set of brushes is a great bargin/value. There are a variety of sizes, and allows numerous options for tailoring makeup for my entire face [instead of just kit for say eye makeup only]. I was suprised by how soft and comfortable the bristles are, the case they come in is not of extreme high quality but still very good, and extremly useful for storage with how it rolls [ive even been able to add a couple other brushes i purchased to it]. The only negative thing i can say is the eyebrow brush/comb- it slid right off the wand part [which i doubt it should do]. However a little dab of glue and im back in buisness- not a real big issue. And though i do wish there were lables/ info on what each brush are for- it&#x27;s really not necessary- as the options for thier use are what you make of them.</li>
            <li> This brush set comes with a very pretty red leather soft roll up case. I actually didn&#x27;t remember what it was when I opened it as a gift. The brushes seem to be good quality. Soft brushes and nice size selection.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my SHANY Makeup Artists Must Have Pro Eyeshadow Palette, 96 Color with the intention to learn how to do the &amp;#34;hooded eye shadow&amp;#34; look.  The red case is great and it&#x27;s nice to have something to carry and store my brushes.  The brushes are of great quality (not cheap) and there are plenty different types.  I do not need the big blush brushes but still nice to have.  Great deal for that many brushes.</li>
            <li> This item was delivered exactly as promised at a very reasonable price and made for a wonderful holiday gift idea!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to give as a gift for Christmas.  The receipient was very pleased.  They came in a very nice case, and appeared to be of good quality.  Not having used them myself, I can&#x27;t attest to any qualities beyond this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Shany brushes I bought....because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that when I was a beginning make up artist 22 yrs ago that I had access to decent products for so little money.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am  practicing artist with 22 yrs experience, I wouldnt use these professionally. They wont stand up to daily washes. I use them for myself at home, however.&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to try more Shany items.&lt;br /&gt;Sunny Fire</li>
            <li> The bristles constantly fall out and are way too soft. I&#x27;ve already thrown out 3 of the brushes. You definitely get what you pay for with this set.</li>
            <li> This is a great set. There are a lot of brushes and for a great price. The only problem I have is with the larger brushes. The bristles on them fall out every time I use them. I get at least 2 bristles falling out every time. I don&#x27;t really mind though; I still think it is a great set!</li>
            <li> This set i thought was decent until i opened the pack and started using the brushes hard and stiff not to mention it irritated my skin in that I was pokes by the bristles, and they were rough. Never again</li>
            <li> My GF loved it she was surprised it came with so many things to choose from its worth every penny</li>
            <li> great quality brushes and the red is soon pretty ;) but when I got it I was missing 3 brushes :( but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal haha</li>
            <li> I love these brushes I think I&#x27;ll  buy some more you can never have to many makeup brushes and they&#x27;re so soft</li>
            <li> This is a good, all around set of brushes complete with case. It is not extremely high quality, but it is good quality. Worth the money I spent on it. I&#x27;ll be buying another set for my teenage daughter so she will stay out of mine.</li>
            <li> Es un buen material y todas son muy util es un producto bueno y los pinceles son grandes ideal para todo tipo de maquillajes.</li>
            <li> This kit had all the right stuff. A wide selection of different tools and was just what the gift recipient was looking for.</li>
            <li> First off I love these brushes! They are excellent quality for an extremely GREAT price! I&#x27;ve always loved doing makeup and I&#x27;m always looking for great quality items without paying a fortune for it. I can say I will continue to buy these brushes and recommend them for everyone. The eyeshadow brushes are my favorite and it makes eyeshadow applications very easy. The brushes come in a nice pouch with individual slots for each brush that folds up. The storage pouch makes it easy for storage and keeps your brushes clean and sanitary. The pouch is a big plus for me because I hate leaving my brushes out for anything to get on them. I have been trying to buy good brushes for awhile and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money doing so and the shany brushes are just as good as expensive makeup brushes but these are very affordable.  I have read other reviews about the smell of the brushes but honestly my brushes didn&#x27;t smell at all. I can&#x27;t wait to try out some of shan&#x27;t other makeup products!  These are a must buy!</li>
            <li> This is one of those things where you get what you pay for. I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed with the quality of the brushes but I liked the variety in the brushes and sizes. Not a bad buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes however this is the second time I purchase them and this time they did have a smell :( but good for price ......</li>
            <li> After a few months of use (and not even daily, because I only wear make up every few days or so) - the big brush&#x27;s bristles started to come off on my face. I had to toss it and buy a different one. The eyeshadow ones are still working just fine, though.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, these brushes are the most fantastic set out there. The quality is unparalleled. And the price, oh my, you cant get a better deal anywhere. There are professional quality and will definetely please any makeup user!!!</li>
            <li> I had bought this brush set thinking I would love it. First of all they smelled funky. Second of all they shed!! While putting on blush or powder it was annoying to have the brushes shed. Then third of all when I washed my brushes they didn&#x27;t shape back to normal and the texture of them was not the same. I would not recommend this brush set. In my opinion the e.l.f brushes are way better!</li>
            <li> Hello I very much liked the brushes they were soft and very pretty; I love pink and black. It was great for my face especially since I have bad acne.</li>
            <li> I was suprised by the quality of the brushes for $12.00!  I havent used mine yet but like their not cheaply made and they use goat hair.  Anxious to use them.  My only thing I would have liked to have seen was something that told what all the uses of the brushes were since their are so many!</li>
            <li> I love the red case the brushes are in. They look nice and feel soft. The brushes dont seem to be frying ir falling out. But always wash ur brushes w a mild/baby soap.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of these brushes..if i could return it i would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: super soft, easy to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: bristles keeps getting stuck to my face when i apply my foundation on.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. I bought this for my niece as a gift and she loves it. The brushes are soft and feels great on your skin ( I had to try them as well). It&#x27;s a great beginners set of brushes for a teenager to have fun with. Very reasonable priced at $12.99 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought these a year ago and they still are in perfect condition, they were wonderfully.  No issues with fallout hair and no issues with washing. Also has a great variety for pretty much anything you might need a brush for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I decided to buy this brush set. I love how every brush comes individually wrapped and how easy they are to organize. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my make up brush set! it came in a nice red case and all the brushes work fabulously! I received them fast and on time! and as soon as I opened my package I wanted to get started putting make up on. Absolutely loved the product!</li>
            <li> This brush set wasn&#x27;t very good, the brushes hairs shed and after I am done with my makeup,  I have itchy hairs all over my face.  I was using one of the brushes (I didn&#x27;t know which because they aren&#x27;t labeled) and my eyelids were scratched all over.  I never use it, I just have to use paintbrushes.  I literally hate this brush set.  This thing sucks and NEVER buy it! I regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and brushes are great no shedding. I&#x27;m not a brush expert but I do love make up and these work great for me. They are also soft and have no weird smells. The pouch is also cute and pretty handy.</li>
            <li> The set is pretty nice, it has a lot of variety. They were on time and the package is nice to carry on.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife. She is very happy with this brush set, and only costs a few dollars. Recommended</li>
            <li> I bought these as part of a gift for my sister. The color is nice, the brushes feel soft but they haven&#x27;t been tried out yet. I will edit feedback once they are used after christmas. For right now, I&#x27;d say the packaging was great but the leather case that it came in had a patch missing from the front. Looks as if they taped it and ripped the top layer of leather off before packaging it. Unfortunately I cannot do a return because I&#x27;m not sure if a new one would make it here by christmas. :(</li>
            <li> this brush set is amazing I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Good buy for a young girl just starting out with makeup.  Gave them as a Christmas gift and all I heard was ooooh aaaaah.</li>
            <li> My worst purchase goes out to these brushes</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Cheap.</li>
            <li> Not amazed by this. it serves the purpose for the price paid.</li>
            <li> I did not like the brushes at all. They are rough and do not apply make up very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommended this item.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the quality of the brushes. She uses her gift daily now. I would recommend this for people who wear and blend makeup.</li>
            <li> honestly i have no idea what i&#x27;m doing when it comes to makeup, so it was a good start for someone like me to have all different kinds of brushes for pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes and didn&#x27;t know how good they would be.  Once I used them for the first time, I loved them.  They are great brushes. If you need a bunch of brushes for a reasonable price, then you should defenitly consider buying these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set!  quality is amazing for the price.  Has everything you need for that perfect look! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> They were good brushes. I love makeup, I wear it even when I am not going anywhere. Quick delivery time, cute pink carrying case. I did love the eyebrow, and concealer brush, but the rest were just OK. The hairs ended up on my face a lot then when I tried to wash them they too 3 days to dry. After they dried they weren&#x27;t like they were from the start but hey they were cheap. I guess good product for the quality.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes they are soft and the price is great! I am not a professional makeup artist but I really like the quality of these brushes, will order from Shany again!</li>
            <li> Definitely was impressed with the style and quality.  Being an individual who travels alot I can say that this is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for to get in and out of any hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the color too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for really good brushes that wouldn&#x27;t break my pockets. These are awesome. Very soft but strong enough to put eye shadow on. The packaging however is horrible. The case I just threw out because I don&#x27;t like the feel or the God awful smell coming from it. I read a review that wrote about the smell and I didn&#x27;t believe it. Please believe it. Other then that, I love these brushes. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend buying these brushes. They are the quality of other brushes that people spend lots of money for in the mall. You honestly cannot go wrong. I liked them so much that I purchased a set for my sister too for Christmas.</li>
            <li> They are what you pay for.  The bigger brushes tend to she a lot.&lt;br /&gt;But the smaller brushes work better.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get new brushes so I was stoked when i came acrossed these, at such an awesome price :)&lt;br /&gt;They are super soft and I love the handles, lightweight.</li>
            <li> i was very pleased with the product..i did expect the brushes to be softer than they actually were but i dont really have anything to complain about! Whenever i do my makeup with them i get the look i&#x27;m going for! Deffinite;y would buy from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Do NOT get these.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re cheap, stale, stiff, bristles fall out, they feel rough.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i gave it a 2 star because they are a cute red color -_-</li>
            <li> I am not big on makeup but wanted some quality brushes at a good price and this is what I got. Work great for your typical makeup use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my granddaughter at Christmas at her request. The order was shipped very quickly in great shape and my granddaughter loves the brushes and recommends them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I gave them 4 stars because i didn&#x27;t like some of the brushes on this set. I didn&#x27;t like the spoolie brush and the lipliner brush. I did like the others a lot. These are better than the ELF professional brushes (white ones). It does have a strong plastic scent that goes away after time.</li>
            <li> I am not a expert makeup buff but the set has a wide range of tools for various makeup applications.  I have washed the brushes a few times and the hair bristles are strong and durable.  The price is great for the amount of brushes it includes.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes now for about 4 months. The case works wonderfully and keeps the brushes much cleaner. It comes with pretty much all the necessary brushes. I use this product daily and have not had any issues.</li>
            <li> When I had purchase this item.I thought that the the quality would be good.When I use the brushes the hair falls out.I guess a couple uses I&#x27;m not gonna be able to use them...</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are perfect! i couldnt find anything wrong, its a great buy. These are some of the best make-up brushes i have bought before.</li>
            <li> Got it fast and my wife loves it..soft brushes..it says i have to write 11 more words smh ahhh yeahhh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. At first I was a little worried because there seems to be mixed reviews, but for the price I figured I would try it. There was no smell at all like I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews. The brushes are made well, no loose hairs. These are perfect for my everyday use. I mean they&#x27;re not professional, but for the price I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> For the price and what you actually get, you really can&#x27;t beat it. For someone who is just doing makeup at home and not in a salon, it&#x27;s perfect. :) I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I loved the price of this set and checked the reviews. I have not regreted my purchase. I received it two days after purchasing which was great. The smell was not as bad as i anticipated by reading other reviews. Just smells like factory made products so just wash before use in the proper manner. Love my brushes. FYI haven&#x27;t had any shedding after washing.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time, and the packaging was nice. I love the case that the brushes come in and the brushes themselves are nice. They aren&#x27;t the most high-end but for the price, I really like them. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these brushes for two reason:&lt;br /&gt;1) These brushes aren&#x27;t as soft as I expected&lt;br /&gt;2) These brushes are constantly shedding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price, variety, and pouch are convenient but I will be getting new brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Makeup Artist for about 8 years and have YET to find better brushes than these!!! And I LOVE the fact that Shany is a proud member of PETA, just like me!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> I am a makeup whore but i dont have the budget to lash out $150 for sigma brushes. I saw these brushes and decided to try them out and I couldnt be happier!! THese brushes came super fast and they really are Mac quality brushes, I have actually repurchased as gifts bcuz they are so amazing. If you want good brushes for cheap dont even hesitate, like me u wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It even came with a great red pouch that was nice. The brushes were all soft and packaged perfect. You cant find a better deal then this. I am so glad I bought these. I really like the bold red color of the handles and pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi again, Its been 4 months and I still use the brushes all the time. The face brush looses a few hairs now and again but all in all still working hard and nothing has fallen apart yet. Im kinda pleased I got the brushes..</li>
            <li> This is my first set of brushes.  And I use them everyday.  I am confident that they will last me a while.  I like that they are easy to bring with me, thanks to the handy travel case.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teen daughter for Christmas and she loves it. The brushes are good quality for the price. It also comes in a nice red leather case.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my friend and they&#x27;re beautiful. They feel nice and she absolutely loved them</li>
            <li> I really like this set of brushes they arent perfect as i like firmer brushes but they are of a nice quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  But the brushes sheds.  Like the color.</li>
            <li> I expected finer hair, but it&#x27;s alright. It&#x27;s a good set if you&#x27;re really into eyes.</li>
            <li> very affordable and loved it</li>
            <li> A brush for every need.  Great set, great price quality materials.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the brushes! Such good quality and cute too for such a good price!</li>
            <li> The brushes have a very unique smell when they first come out of the plastic wrapping. I would reccomend that you wash the brushes with baby shampoo so you do not damage them before use. Other than that they seem to be holding up well, they do not shed that I have seen.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful, but at times a little soft in the bristles for my tastes. I&#x27;ve got some more solid makeups that these brushes have issues with. A guide for which brush is which would also be handy as I had never seen the &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; brush before and later found out that it works great for getting the extra powder off of your face without it leaving spots of color on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case they came in is wonderfully sturdy and keeps everything wrapped up in a nice neat little package. It has individual spots for each brush, and a I actually have a few other of my brushes that I like to bring with me when I travel shoved in there as well.</li>
            <li> the pouch is a soft material. the brushes are very nice and very soft bristles. my makeup goes on smooth and I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very useful, and it is easy to use by following the guide. but its smell is bad.</li>
            <li> I like my brush set it is so cute red is the best the brush set apply nice they are a good buy  use them on myself and just love them</li>
            <li> I bought this based on most of the reviews.  From first inspection I love the set.  I don&#x27;t think there could be more options for makeup brushes in this set.  I did read about the residue on them but have washed them yes as stated in some reviews since i have not used them yet.  I will wash them and hope to get good use out of them.  Please with the purchase for sure....</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They do not shed bristles and are a good quality. A couple of them are a little too stiff for my taste (kind of scratchy on the skin) but the majority of them are perfect. I like the large options of different types of brushes and the color is pretty as well.</li>
            <li> There were quite a few brushes, soft, and good quality.  Hair pieces are not falling out like the brushes I&#x27;ve had.  I like these brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice brushes for the price. I sold Mary Kay years ago, and theirs sold for 3 times what these did so you can&#x27;t beat that! They are real Badger and Goat hair brushes, which was important to me as I don&#x27;t care for synthetic bristles. There are the basic variety, which will work for a beginner and a more seasoned makeup artist. A couple of the brushes seem to be almost the same, they look like domed or crease brushes, wish it was a smudger but it&#x27;s always good to have extras. I would recommend washing them prior to use in a gentle shampoo, rinse and lay out on a towel to dry.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by this brush set. I love my Shany Neutral Eye Palette and I thought the brushes would be a perfect companion, and I received this set as a gift when I requested Shany brushes. They appeared to work well at first, but I started to wonder if the eye palette just wasn&#x27;t good quality. I checked reviews on the palette that gushed about the pigmentation and began to get confused as to why I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results when I did my makeup. On a hunch, I grabbed one of my ultra-cheap synthetic brushes and used that instead. Wow--the palette was great! The issue was these brushes! I have to use a LOT of eyeshadow to get ANY pigment on my eyes whatsoever because the fibers soak up all of the color. On top of that, the brushes shed all over my face, even though I have barely cleaned them. The shedding is getting worse, instead of better, and I have stopped using most. The eyeshadow brushes have lost their shape, even though I take extremely good care of my products, and at least one face brush has come loose in the handle and knocks about when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just so disappointing--I had such high hopes for this brush set, and it not only doesn&#x27;t work well, the quality appears to be less than stellar. I feel bad saying it, since I absolutely love the palette, but the brushes aren&#x27;t good at all. I have waited several months to post this review, hoping that my first impressions of the set being nice would eventually come true, but the set just keeps degrading, and I have to advise against getting this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Love them,but the brushes arnt really soft as I&#x27;d like but there very nice quality an. I&#x27;m happy:)</li>
            <li> my daughter uses everyday she luvs them.&lt;br /&gt;sturdy / holding up 6 months now</li>
            <li> I havent used the brushes yet, I just received them today and washed them. So currently waiting for them to dry, and then I can begin using them! So far, I love the package it comes with, it is super cute and true to its description. The brushes are super soft, and I cant wait to start experimenting with makeup with these! Good buy! Good price!</li>
            <li> I was looking for some brushes when I stumble across these ones one day. For around $12 and some decent reviews I thought they were a great bargain. I got mine fairly quickly (2 days) because of my prime membership. The brushes were in excellent condition when I opened them up and they came in a convenient red pouch! I did not have an odor problem with the brushes when I received them but I did wash them before I used them first. They are super super soft brushes. I use more of the eyeshadow brushes then anything else and have got to say they are good, although I wish the bigger eyeshadow brushes had been fluffier to help with blending. You receive 2 bigger fluffier blush/bronzer brushes, 1 fan brush, 2 bigger eyeshadow brushes, 1 medium sized eyeshadow brush, 1 angled eyeshadow brush, 2 smaller more detailing eyeshadow brushes, an eyebrow comb, lip color brush, and a smudger type brush. I love the pouch (in red) because I also use it to store some other brushes that I use. I wash them every couple of weeks and the brushes have rarely lost any hair. Overall I think that this is a fabulous set all together for a fair price.</li>
            <li> the hair of the brush is not that soft, cheap qualified, and it is big so i can&#x27;t bring it traveling with me</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as my first set of brushes. So far for the past 6 months or so they&#x27;ve worked great! Super soft hair with hardly any shedding. One of the brushes did break at the metal part :( but thats really the only negative. I don&#x27;t think these are really professional grade like sigma but still they do a great job!</li>
            <li> It has all the brushes i need, i love using the eye liner one. The hair brushes are very soft, it contains instructions on what the brushes are for. Love this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have just started wearing makeup and these brushes are amazing. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering some for my sister for her birthday.</li>
            <li> These feel very high quality, have soft bristles, are easy to clean, and are great sizes. I didn&#x27;t notice any smells when I received them. It has enough brushes for me, an everyday, not too intricate make up user. I use the angled brush, a shadow brush, the foundation brush, and small powder brush every day, and often use the others on the weekends when I put more time into my makeup. I don&#x27;t use the pouch, but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li> This product is a good deal for the buy. The brushes come in a beautiful wrap that holds all your brushes and has a beautiful presentation.</li>
            <li> The Brushes got here within two days which was super fast! they are great exactly like the picture, the Bristles are soft and do not fall out and they are easy to clean and they make the make-up go on so smooth it has pretty much every brush you could need from Eyeliner brushes to different eye shadow brushes I love them!! would def recommend buying them</li>
            <li> I am very new with make up so I decided to find some cheap brushes to start off with. I bought this set and was very disappointed after seeing all of the great reviews it has. The hairs fall out, even after washing the brushes. There isn&#x27;t a wide variety of brushes just duplicates of a couple of the same ones in a smaller size. None of the brushes picked up much pigment from my eyeshadows, my dollar store brushes performed better than these. Not even the lip brush was able to pick up any lip stick to apply. All in all, I definitely recommend spending a little more money for a set that will have good quality. I did not like these brushes one bit.</li>
            <li> I became interested in buying this package of cosmetic brushes after my sister showed me the set she bought from Amazon. I got my brushes really fast in the mail and at a wonderful price. I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes but so far with the ones I&#x27;ve used I have had great results with my makeup!</li>
            <li> They look great and are exactly as pictured. The case is way better even than expected, and is good quality. The red is gorgeous. The only criticism I can think of is that some (very, very few) of the hairs were loose and uneven, but those brushed off and the rest are very secure and the brushes are all thick.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I got this, but the brushes are definitely nice. The price is extremely reasonable. The outside case is waterproof so my brushes don&#x27;t get wet. Shipping was extremely fast too. I got it within 3 days.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush set. The hairs to not fall out, the carrying case is so compact, and the variety of the brushes in the set is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really confused, I bought these brushes before reading the reviews. I checked out the reviews before the brushes got here. They terrified me, some of the reviews said the brushes smelt bad, that they were falling apart, that the pouch was horrible. I got my brushes today and I&#x27;m in love. The pouch is red, and professional looking, and the brushes are great for $12. They are the same quality as drug store brushes for less. I can&#x27;t believe people complained, if you want like horse fur brushes that professional makeup artists use then you should save up and buy them. For $12 I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not good good at all, especially with liquid makeup foundation. Parts of the brush came off when I tried to apply it with my liquid foundation. It didn&#x27;t work for me, I don&#x27;t think it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> All these brushes work very well for me! I did have one problem though- on the medium sized blush brush, the top disconnected from the red part of the brush. This actually isn&#x27;t a huge problem for me though, because now it&#x27;s travel sized! I think this set is definitely worth the money, but be careful with them if you don&#x27;t want them to break.</li>
            <li> I have used them now for a week and they seem to be great brushes. They are not too stiff and so far no bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> These make-up brushes are perfect for applying make-up.  There is a brush for everything. They are durable and pretty.  I recently started using brushes and am amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> Again I have the larger set but this was a steal during Black Friday sales. I love these brushes and have found no others that match the price for what you are getting. These will definitely surprise you for their price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The variety for these brushes are great! They are soft and don&#x27;t damage my already sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come at an extremely run for your value price, the case they come in is adorable and when I apply my blushes and bronzer, I truly see a big  difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional make up artist, but I do know a good beauty product when I see one, and I definitely recommend these brushes! So happy.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes twice! The first time for myself and then again for a friend for christmas. She loves them too.Good quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, the full brushes were not very good but the eye shadow and smaller brushes were okay for the price. I definitely will rethink purchasing lower quality brushes next time. Again not HORRIBLE but could definitely be better.</li>
            <li> i love this brushes. i have them for so long. i gave a set as a gift and my sister is very happy with them</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever seen,  but I did end up replacing them. I got them for Christmas from my husband because he knew I really like my brushes but he doesn&#x27;t know much about them so this is the set he got. It is very practical to have a lot of different brushes, but I got sick of how scratchy they were. They literally hurt my skin when applying my make up because the ends of the bristles are so harsh that it feels like I&#x27;m poking myself. If you angle them better, they won&#x27;t feel as scratchy, but it&#x27;s not worth the effort when you are just trying to apply makeup and be done with it. I prefer Sigma or Real Techniques.  Simga brushes are expensive, so the only one I really wanted was the F80 Flat Top Kabuki Brush.  This brush is an absolute MUST for liquid foundation.  It is so soft and the flat top really makes a difference in the appearance of your makeup AND it doesn&#x27;t absorb product which is a huge bonus because then you&#x27;re not wasting your money.  I bought the Real Techniques set (Core Collection) to replace a few essential brushes from this Shany collection. Real Techniques is affordable and much much much higher quality than these brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes suck! i ordered them and not only did they take forever to get to my house, but they were very cheaply made. a lot of the brushes came off the handles. There was alot of shedding. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. It was a waste of $15.00</li>
            <li> Ok.  Pouch is pretty cheap looking and some of the hairs came out of the brushes during use.  May just have been my set.</li>
            <li> I wish there were less of the small brushes and a couple bigger ones but I only know this now after this purchase since I&#x27;ve never bought makeup brushes before. These brushes helped me learn what I want in makeup brushes and were inexpensive enough to not be bothered that they aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> Manu brush, but Still missing some. But its a great deal cuz good price. i recommand it its a good deal</li>
            <li> These were a total waste of money. The brushes looked dirty and the bristles are falling out. They do not look like the brushes in the picture either which I&#x27;m just now realizing. The ones pictured look higher quality and fuller. The brushes I received reminded me of ones I got from the toy store when I was a little girl with some cheap makeup. Maybe let your 9 year old daughter play with them but that the only use I can think of. I did not return them because the shadow and eyeliner brushes were decent and I don&#x27;t like the hassle. I would not waste my money on this product ever again. I bought some fantastic Ecotools and Real Techniques brushes that are soft and amazing. Invest in quality brushes not these!!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes as a gift for my daughter. They were not expensive and she works in the cosmetology industry and said they were good quality and she is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I use each brush differently depending on what i&#x27;m applying. And fortunately each brush comes in handy when I need a particular brush to do a particular job. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with this set. It is my first brush set and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into makeup, and I bought these brushes to compliment the E.L.F essential brushes I&#x27;d previously purchased. I read the reviews about how good they were, but was ultimately disappointed in their quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The E.L.F essential brushes have the same feel to them, but are of much better quality. For example, the all over powder brush from E.L.F is soft, not as soft as the brush from their studio line, and doesn&#x27;t scratch the face. The bristles firmly attached to the ferrule. The powder brush from this collection is very scratchy, and it shed like crazy. I ultimately had to throw it away because of the quality. The same goes for the blush brush in this set. The only positive is that it doesn&#x27;t shed as much as the powder brush did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the E.L.F brushes are that they are labeled. As I stated earlier since I&#x27;m knew to makeup this makes things much easier for me. The Shany brushes don&#x27;t. I have an idea of what they&#x27;re supposed to do based on comparison between these brushes and my E.L.F set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these brushes are not worth your money. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a brush set.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my mom and she seems to like them alot. I ordered myself another set and when I opened these I was kind of jealous! I washed them for her with just normal shampoo (frutics) and they dried just fine. They are super soft and my mom says they do not shed. Most reviews complain about a smell when you receive the product but it&#x27;s nothing out of the ordinary. I propbaly wouldnt of noticed it if it wasnt for the reviews. If you have a problem with your brushes smelling like they are new then i guess you wont like them! I would say good buy!</li>
            <li> Very good quality brushes and very useful for expertly applying my makeup.  The carrying pouch is very handy when travel.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for. A lot of shedding, it&#x27;s hard on face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these, for my daughters, after reading about them in Good Housekeeping Magazine (seal of approval).  They are a lot for the money &amp; reasonably priced.  They arrived quickly &amp; in perfect condition.  I would recommend them</li>
            <li> The fan brush is a bit skimpy, hence the four star rating. Otherwise, I have had these brushes for over a year. They have survived daily use and cleanings without losing their shape.</li>
            <li> I requested and received these brushes for Christmas 2 years ago.  I use them everyday and they&#x27;re still fantastic!  The carrying pouch has frayed a little but the brushes are in great shape.</li>
            <li> My first ever brush set. Mine never smelled like everyone else on here. I really only use the two biggest brushes. They do leave behind some stray hairs but I don&#x27;t really mind picking them off my face... its maybe 1 or 2 hairs total. No big deal...</li>
            <li> So, for the price I was not expecting much. I am floored by the quality! Truly a great buy and blows the price out of the water for what you get. I recommend these for both beginning artists and the pros.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the product! I still use them and would buy from again.</li>
            <li> I guess I was just expecting too much from low drugstore products and the smaller brushes are amazing for defining and really getting detailed but the bigger brushes arent as well as they are just stuffed with animal fur. They pick up too much product and when you tap it off, all of the product comes off of the brush and it just a waste of money. I could&#x27;ve gone to Sephora and bought a &amp;#34;PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34; brush set for a little bit more, but still had &amp;#34;PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34; brushes with more brushes in the set. I guess what i&#x27;m trying to say is I like the small brushes but hate the big ones</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it is everything it was advertised it as being, and it really is worth buying...I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> brushes and applicator tips seem to be solid quality...I haven&#x27;t noticed any loose strands or hairs...I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product</li>
            <li> I love this kit. It came with a Brsuh kit pouch and the brushes them self are amazing. They are easy to use and the basic ones needed in an everyday makeup routine. I would def recommend this to a friend and anyone else looking to buy this set. GOOD BUY!(:</li>
            <li> I ordered mine yesterday and it came in today, great shipping speed, they are great brushesfor beginners, I bought it as a gift and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> i like my brushes they dont smell like others do at first, i thought they were pink but they actually a bright red was kind of upset at firt but now i dont mind it at all they are good make up brushes</li>
            <li> I think this is a good start set of brushes.  Some of the brushes needed a &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; to make even but for the money...their good.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these, but after the first use the bristles on the brush were all ready falling out.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived quickly and were neatly packaged for delivery. They are a decent quality for the price. They aren&#x27;t the best, but they&#x27;re a good backup and get the job done. The red color of the brush handles and case is much more bright of a red than in the picture. I love the color red but I&#x27;m not a fan on this shade of red. That&#x27;s just a personal preference and doesn&#x27;t alter the performance of the tools. Good variety of brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> While the variety of brushes and value was pretty good the brush quality is less than I&#x27;d like. Hairs fall out all the time, and not just. one or two, several.</li>
            <li> The prize was very reasonable and the quality of the brushes isn&#x27;t too bad. Plus they even come in a nice box and bag. My only negative criticism is the strong, plastic smell, but I assume it can be removed once washed. All in all, 3 stars from me.</li>
            <li> fast shipment, awesome price</li>
            <li> I had bought this set awhile ago... &amp; I must say it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m still using this set every day. Brushes great quality. I don&#x27;t have a favorite brush, they&#x27;re just that great. You won&#x27;t regret buying these at all. Just make sure you wash before use.. Should always be a pre-caution regardless if you buy online or in store.</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes heads came off, which can be fixed with glue after about a month. I don&#x27;t like that it sheds the bristles all over my face every time I use them. I&#x27;ve about had it with these and bought a new set of more plush and softer brushes that don&#x27;t lose bristles and the heads don&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> These brushes are of good quality. The case is a little larger than I expected. Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these make-up brushes! They really are great quality for an inexpensive price! Love them and would definitely recommend them to anyone considering purchasing a new set of brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> Well you know the saying,you get what you pay for. Feels rough on the skin and hairs come out to easily. They are good to have as backup, but I will be buying a high quality set instead. Also does not work well with my mineral makeup at all.</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes less then 6 months ago. I use them maybe 2x a week, if that. They work great. Pick up colors, spread them evenly, and blend well. About the time I had them for about 2 months the bristles started falling out when I would use them. Not a lot. Every time I used them about 2-4 individual bristles fall out. That is the only issue I have with them.</li>
            <li> They are good if you&#x27;re not a huge makeup fan, it holds the make up very well. They are very soft and put the makeup on very well. Sweet Brushes, Nice Red Case.</li>
            <li> The brushes look good.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I love the case they came in.  I&#x27;ll have to use them first before I&#x27;ll know the quality of the brush.  I will be checking out your other products.  :)  Thank you again.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and easy to use, I absolutely love the color and overall they just rule! You should definitely get these brushes!</li>
            <li> This is a ok product and nothing great about the brushes . The bristles aint that good n inspite of good care they have started falling after a couple of months of use but again don&#x27;t expect a lot . I love the red pouch it comes with. Good care would make them last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Poor quality but what can you expect for the price. This is a true case of you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved them</li>
            <li> Great make-up set.  I would by again.  It comes with more brushes than I know what to do with.</li>
            <li> Elf is better than these.. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last more than a year before the bristle starting fall apart. Good set for a young teen new to make up.</li>
            <li> One of my cosmetic brushes is missing from my case. But I still like the product&lt;br /&gt;I probably purchase more from this company in the near future. Just check product before u ship</li>
            <li> ITS VERY CONVENIENT FOR TRAVEL. AND THE BRUSHES WORK WELL .  I WASH THEM AFTER EACH USE  I AM A SATISFIED CUSTOMER</li>
            <li> Great brushes that do what they are supposed to do.  My only complaint is the stinky leather roll they come in.  It has a strong smell and had to air out for a couple of days before I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that it looks nice and all brushes came cover protection!!  very easy to use the hair feels soft against my skin I will commend people to buy it</li>
            <li> I must say,l was skeptical when I purchased this item. Based on the reviews, however, I decided to give it a go. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I am pleased and happy with what I purchased at the price of which I paid. They were nicely packaged, however I noticed that the brushes were losing some hair. Still works and leaves your make up evenly put on your face</li>
            <li> For the price this product is great but the quality is what you get. The bigger brushes doesn&#x27;t hold my foundation too well but a great starter kit for beginners</li>
            <li> Really cheap quality, oh well. I guess you get what you pay with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited almost two years to buy new brushes because I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend money on something I don&#x27;t use often. Especially since cosmetic brush sets can be so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid the hairs would fall out - they didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid the brushes would feel prickly against my skin - they didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid the brushes would be cheap quality - they aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend; I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this set. It is ideal for an artist. It works well with my professional skills. Great brushes and I love them!</li>
            <li> Everything I need for home makeup application in one great set, and for the amazingly low price, cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for my needs. I finally decided it was time to invest in a solid set of brushes and these were right in my price range. The carrying case is really nice soft leather and I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !&lt;br /&gt;i strongly recommend buying these amazing brushes&lt;br /&gt;they come in a cute little case to hold all of them trust me you will not be dissapointed</li>
            <li> I orders this set a while back and every single on is still in tact! No shedding, no missing part,  the red color is still the same, it picks up make up very well and the fiber is still very soft!</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift and I&#x27;m happy I did! They work great. Mine didn&#x27;t smell when I got them in and they don&#x27;t really shed for me, even after I cleaned them. Overall, they&#x27;re great :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! Super soft and super durable. I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re so good, yet so cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your money on MAC or Sigma, these brushes are just as good for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> I just got my Shany Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch. I love it! The brushes are professional. Please don&#x27;t pay any attention to the negative reviews. The smell is not bad at all. I have asthma. I was not bothered by the smell at all. Thank you so much for making these professional brushes at a great price. I will tell my family and friends about them.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product for people looking for good quality brushes for a great price! This is my favorite drugstore brush set, I think it is the best one your going to find. The colors are fun and when you lie them out, it brightens up your room. They are durable and very easy to clean. I highly recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> I personally love all Shany&#x27;s products!  This set of brushes is serving as a backup to my main set.  Sometimes as an MUA, when you are on set, you really need a variety of brushes as you may not have time for cleaning properly.  Thanks so much for this great set!</li>
            <li> The brushes were everything I expected them to be! 13 brushes for not even $20? They are amazing! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This was a wedding gift for my wife and she loved it. They are soft and a great buy. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on my blending techniques and these brushes took me from amateur to pro the moment they arrived. I love these brushes and I love the Shany brand !</li>
            <li> I love that you can get 13 good brushes and a pouch for only 12.99. They work really good with wet or dry eyeshadows and I don&#x27;t have any fall out. I would recommend these brushes to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot but still wants great brushes.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes&#x27; handles broke... but the actual brush parts are really good. If you don&#x27;t mind using small brushes or are prepared with glue or tape, this is great!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because the brushes were cheap but i have had them since May.&lt;br /&gt;The color of the brushes are misleading, it comes in an ugly red bag and the brushes are red but they work well.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was pleased to see how professional the brushes looked, though when i can closer to the brushes i began to notice it had an absolutely repulsive smell to it. I tried to wash the brushes and yet still...the odor remained. I was just so disappointed considering how excited i was to get the brushes. Huge mistake.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I think the price and the way the brush has such soft bristles  feels on my skin is amazing. You should try this if you are a beauty lover!</li>
            <li> These were my first makeup brushes that I bought a WHILE back. I have now built up my collection with mostly Sigma and Coastal Scents brushes, a few MAC. Let me just tell you: you get what you pay for with these  brushes. They are extremely cheaply made and smell like harsh chemicals- something you really don&#x27;t want on your face, applying makeup. The smell started to fade after I washed them a couple times, but every time I wash them they shed like crazy. Definitely beginner&#x27;s brushes, because of the quality. I&#x27;d recommend Coastal Scents brush sets, they&#x27;re quite affordable and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINI REVIEWS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. Small definer liner/lip brush- I&#x27;ve tried this for red lipstick, it was OK, but it sheds like CRAZY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. Large powder/blush brush- OK, but definitely not \\&quot;fluffy,\\&quot; like you would like to apply powder or blush. It&#x27;s more flat, and does shed a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 3. Small powder/blush brush- Again, only OK. The plus is that it doesn&#x27;t really shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 4. Brow/Lash comb- LOVE THIS. I use it every day. Great for blending brows and getting rid of mascara clumps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 5. Concealer brush- Good, firm concealer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 6. \\&quot;Foundation\\&quot; brush- TINY. Basically another concealer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 7. Angled brush- NOT FIRM AT ALL. Too frayed and thick for eyeliner, maybe good for brow powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 8. Sponge applicator brush- Meh. It&#x27;s okay, if you like those. Might as well just take the free ones that come with drugstore eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 9. Fan brush- TINY. Again, not big enough, like the foundation brush, to do anything. Maybe dust away eyeshadow fallout, but that&#x27;s it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Standard eyeshadow brush- Standard. Nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. \\&quot;Pencil\\&quot; smudge brush- Not firm enough to be a pencil brush. Tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. \\&quot;Crease\\&quot; blending brush- TINY. OK, but really only for people with smaller eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all- you get what you pay for. Not worth it in my opinion. The brushes are also all too small to be usable. The only brush that I use everyday and love is the brow/lash comb. Not worth $12.are also all too small to be usable. The only brush that I use everyday and love is the brow/lash comb. Not worth $12.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product to give to my daughter for her birthday.  well they were a hit!  she has used each one and displays then on her bathroom counter.  ill be checking out some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Omg these are so awesome.Great quality no fallout bristles,great for beginners and professional makeup artist.I will recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> My 17 yr old daughter has been after me to buy more brushes, but when I looked at the price per brush I said no.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;m so glad I found all the brushes and more that she wanted and needed to get the look she wants at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was really happy with these brushes. It&#x27;s the first real set I&#x27;ve ever had, so I&#x27;m obviously no expert, but I can tell when something works. When I ordered them I was worried because I saw complaints of a bad smell, they so smell slightly like plastic and hair, but I imagine anything made of plastic and hair would. Unless you hold them up to your nose and deeply inhale, it&#x27;s not a strong smell.</li>
            <li> We love Shany products. The makeup brushes are high quality and the price can&#x27;t be beat. The brush case is so nice, to keep the brushes from floating loosely in the makeup drawer. They stay clean and dust-free. I like having a sanitary place to put them after they have been washed. The last set I had (not from Shany) was in an unsatisfactory plastic holder. These Shany brushes are much nicer.  My hopes were high, since the makeup collection I have from Shany is so fantastic, I hoped the brushes would be as well. With so many shapes and comfortable handles, these brushes will last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t decide between Shany makeup and/or brushes vs.another brand, go with Shany! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I will definitely stick with this brand.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t in the market for new brushes but for playing with eyeshadow colors I needed more than what I had and it was just cheaper to get a whole set like this instead of individual brushes.  I don&#x27;t believe in paying a stupid amount of money for a brush (a la Sephora, I do love the store but $30 for a single eyeshadow brush? no) and when I bought my eyeshadow pallet Amazon recommended this brush set.  It looked fine to me and had the eyeshadow applicators I was looking for so I snagged it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fold out case it comes in and the brushes themselves are just okay.  In this case you get what you pay for with the brushes.  Will they serve their purpose?  Yes but there&#x27;s a slight scratch to the bristles, the bristles themselves come out a little easily and the cut of them is a little jagged for the types of brushes.  They&#x27;ll function all right but there are better brushes out there that won&#x27;t break the bank either.</li>
            <li> The brushes work fine. I wish they were labeled as to which brush is for which purpose. They&#x27;re soft and haven&#x27;t fallen apart, but they do seem a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> The fabulous willowy tall blonde model receiving this from her wishlist intends to use this set to their maximum potential.</li>
            <li> This brushes have become my favorite for the days I choose to wear make-up! They are face, and apply the makeup evenly and smoothly quickly!</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars because the few brushes I do use...I like; however, not that its the product fault but mine.  I would love some instructions how to use some of these brushes and maybe I would love this product.</li>
            <li> this product is very attractive however the handle seal for the brushes is not that hold some.the brush is tick and nice and the case is strong enough</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes so I wouldn&#x27;t have to ruin my good brushes this year when I would do my Halloween make-up&lt;br /&gt;(I had 5 costumes this year 2012) I wasn&#x27;t expecting great brushes for the prize but DARN! These brushes are horrible I only used them for Halloween make-up to mix liquid latex and body paint and stage blood etc. They we not good with regular make-up/eye-shadows and the bristles would fall off after my 2nd costume! They were not soft! I threw them away after 10/31 past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The product did arrive FAST in 3 days in a nice red bagget so that&#x27;s why I gave 2 stars because of fast shipment. I would probably re purchase again next year for Halloween and dispose of them again but definitely not to use them as my every day brushes. (I&#x27;ll stick to buying my make-up brushes at Sephora&amp;Mac)</li>
            <li> At the price I was not expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. It is a quality product with a quality carrying case. I would purchase from this company again and I would also recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very nice and very good value for the price. I will look to purchase other products from this company. Thanks,</li>
            <li> These are incredibly nice, especially for the price. The large powder brush loses a few hairs but other than that, these are amazing. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The Brushes are really soft and have great coverage, I love that I have a good variety of eye shadow brushes, that was the main reason for this purchase. I love that it comes in n organized bag, it makes for easy travel and storage. But I&#x27;ve had this product for about a week and the rissoles are already starting to fall out. This was pretty disappointing considering it titled as a professional brush set. I expected better quality. Today alone i had At least 5 little hairs from the brushes left over on my face... While pulling several out of the brushes themselves that were starting to stay away. It was pretty frustrating. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I&#x27;d rather spend a little more money on something I know for a fact that is a good, high quality product.</li>
            <li> Nice set. Nice variety. Nice quality. I feel like there is a brush for everything in this set. It&#x27;s a complete set where I don&#x27;t have to go out and purchase additional brushes. Work wonderfully and easy to clean. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Returned these right away!  These are not quality professional brushes.  If you are looking for cheap but good brushes get them from ELF.  They have two lines.  White are cheaper but only cost $1 each, I love them.  They also have black professional line that is a little more expensive.  Both are great and well worth looking into.</li>
            <li> Very nice assortment of quality brushes.</li>
            <li> the hair on the bigger brushes are a bit rough. the brushes for eye makeup are pretty good quality considering the price</li>
            <li> These brushes are TERRIBLE I have no idea why they are so highly rated.... Very crappy quality, stiff, hard. They shed all over the place. CRAPPPPPP</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas gift and when it arrived I wanted to check the quality of the brushes. They were so nice I bought a second one for myself.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes! I am very impressed. This set comes with so many face brushes. Most of the time, brush sets mainly only come with eye shadow brushes and a few faces brushes. This one has an amazing assortment of face brushes. I definitely recommend this to someone who is looking to start a brush collecting. This gives you a perfect start!</li>
            <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had! Still work, look &amp; feel as if they were brand new, and I&#x27;ve had them for a year! (And I know this may be gross to some of you professional make-up artists, but I have never even cleaned them!)&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING quality, probably better then Sephora, Sheer Cover &amp; Bare Minerals ones, which I used to use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty, but not functional. The bristles are rough, and too long/flimsy to properly apply makeup. The handles are wooden, covered in a cheap paint that chips easily. They shed even after washing (with baby shampoo). I had to toss them.</li>
            <li> I got the brushes and felt like they aren&#x27;t the best quality ,Of course if you compare them to mac brushes your not going to like them they don&#x27;t shed and they had a little smell but nothing that horrible .The Pouch is ok keeps them all in one place .</li>
            <li> My sister did not know this brand but is satisfied with its quality. The bag to carry brushes was a nice surprise, it&#x27;s very convenient. The packaging was excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this set, thank you!It is very nice and complete, and de pouch is beautiful. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> About once a week a bristle or two falls out, which is a bit annoying. I have other higher-end brushes that are softer. But overall, great beginner set.</li>
            <li> doesnt look cheap at all for the price. it doesnt hurt my skin and im gonna wash them to remove the odor.&lt;br /&gt;so far im glad i got it ! :)</li>
            <li> The hair they use is very unpleasant against the skin and falls out of the brush. They had a weird smell from the packaging, plasticy scent.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, save your money and buy some real techniques or eco tools if you&#x27;re a beginner and want brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I was lured in by relatively good reviews and cheap price but seriously did NOT like these brushes because they were so unpleasant to use on my face. They have awkwardly long handles too for the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> These are great quality and perfect brushes overall! They also come with an awesome price! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Actually it is perfect, compared to other much more expensive similar products, a wide range of brushes made good materials.</li>
            <li> What else can I say?&lt;br /&gt;They seem well made.&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped quickly and well packed.&lt;br /&gt;They come in a large pouch that rolls up and ties around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a user, but she seems pleased.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use this a lot but they are really nice does the work they also came later then expected &amp; they come whit instructions which is pretty nice</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They are a good quality and the carrying case is a great thing to have. The price was a bonus!</li>
            <li> Brushes are exactly what advertise.Was a little skeptical about purchasing them because some people complained about really bad odor.the ibrushes do give off an outdoor, but not as intolerable as some people complained.I figured for that price iwll take a chance.i purchased them as a birthday gift for my teenage daughter and I also purchased another set for myself.I haven&#x27;t use them yet but they look of decent quality. my daughter has already use them and like the product.I also like the pouch and the fact that they come with a booklet that indicates what each brush is for.overall Iam pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, with high quality and surpassed my expectations. Congratulations for the beautiful work. Back to shop with you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always believe you have to pay a lot for quality, but when it comes to beauty products I may have just been taught a  lesson. The brushes look nice, but when you first use them they are rough and prick at your face. Every time I use this brushes, bristles are left on my face. And I am not exaggerating.... EVERY TIME. They get the job done, but if you are looking for quality, these are not brushes for you.</li>
            <li> Not too hard or soft, the bristles have not started falling out yet and at this point I have had the set for over a month now. What I will say is that, I personally find the face brush is tooooooo small, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a gift and she loves it. Also purchased the SHANY 88 color eyeshadow and these brushes are perfect. The price was good.</li>
            <li> when I received the brushes they came in a pretty red pouch . The pouch was pretty but the brushes were horrible . The brushes shed all over the place . I had more brush shedding on me than the poweder I was putting on . I wasted my money</li>
            <li> i just love this product it really saved my life it has every thing i need and i also love how soft it feels on my face and&lt;br /&gt;how i can control the movement of the brush thank you soooo mutch.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes , very soft and easy to work with . love the color i got mine in color RED . Also recieved them pretty quick &amp; the rapping/shipping/Handleing was PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Love this set and will buy these again when I need to replace these. super easy to clean and easy to take with me when I travel in the case they come in.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter. She uses it daily. The assortment of brushes lets her do her make up in a variety of styles which she needs for performances. It was a great price. Nice quality.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE NATURAL HAIR BRUSHES made from goat and badger fur. If you assume you are buying a cruelty free product because they tout that they are a member of PETA on their description, you are incorrect. It&#x27;s not like they go out an clip the fur off a live animal to make these, they are made from fur scraped off of hides before they are tanned for leather. Sure, you can say that using &#x27;spare parts&#x27; makes you cruelty free, but let&#x27;s be serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is lacking as well. These are a nice set of brushes if you are first starting out on your make-up journey, but they wear quickly. I wash my brushes once a week with warm water and Sephora brush shampoo and one of the large eye shadow brushes fell apart within only a few washes. Also, there are 17 brushes pictured in the online image, but you only get 12 seemingly random brushes. I did not get an eyebrow brush, one of those foam brushes pictured, the thin brush, and the standard sized brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take make-up even a little bit seriously or if you have high end make-up that you want to apply correctly, please go buy quality brushes. If you are on a budget, the gift sets from Sonia Kashuk at Target are perfect and all under $25.</li>
            <li> This is gift for a loved one. So had lots of expectation. Loved the brushes, yet to use. Will review it later once used.</li>
            <li> A little too many brushes and the pouch is rather large and difficult to use. I like things a little simpler and the pouch to me just seems bulky, and hard to get into quickly. I love the eye lash brush the most from this set. Some of the smaller brushes are probably meant for people who are true professionals with putting on makeup. Me? I&#x27;m just a housewife... probably far out of my league with these.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 starts bcause the quality is great for the price. They are better then drug store brushes, but not as nice as my Mac brushes. I did order this set for my teenage daughter and she is very happy with them. I do suggest you wash them before use as another person stated who wrote a review. But you should do that anyway. Happy about his purchase:) My daughter is happy and I am happy I didnt spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!! I purchased this to have a travel set to the 40 piece set I got. This is money well spent especially for someone like me who is very fussy about where I spend &amp; what I buy. Packaging is perfect. Brushes are soft and manageable. In cleaning them before first use there was some absolutely minimal shedding, but nothing significant. I would recommend this product to anyone considering it.</li>
            <li> Loved them so much, we bought them again.  Good, cost-effective, starter set.  Bought for teen daughter and she loved and asked for again.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for Christmas for my niece. She loved having really good brushes instead of the junky ones she had before.</li>
            <li> Works great for when i do my eyeshadows...love them! use them daily...they were definitely worth the money! love the larger brushes for when im bronzing Seriously still using these brushes 3 years later</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing with nicer ones. I bought these as my first set and thought they were great but they really aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re rough and bristly, shed like crazy, and don&#x27;t pick up much product. I&#x27;ve since upgraded to ecotools and sigma brushes and the difference is night and day. It&#x27;s worth it to splurge for better brushes. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These brushes shed all over my face..it&#x27;s pretty gross, and they aren&#x27;t very useful. I will stick to my other brushes. Mac brushes and Target/Walmart brushes are way better than these. Total waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for about a year. At first they were good, but after 2 months or so they started shedding. After 6 months they were useless.I take really good care of my brushes, but these just didn&#x27;t impress me. I recommend getting something of better quality.</li>
            <li> The only one she has problems with is the mop brush. It sheds but frankly I&#x27;ve found very few that don&#x27;t. She told me to still give it five stars though because she would recommend the quality of the brushes and variety, as well as the case to anyone. Still looking for a good mop brush (which she still uses, btw, just has to brush off a hair every once in a while).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use them because they just aren&#x27;t working for me. Thank you and have a nice day. Your awesome.</li>
            <li> i love it too much very useful and good quality material . its good very useful and good quality material</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this brush set! They are nicely made and come in a nice tie-up bag and appear more expensive than the asking price.</li>
            <li> i bought this set after much debate and surprisingly it turned out to be a perfect buy its soft and easy to work with i will deff recommend this product its worth the price</li>
            <li> Brush material is very good, in the face to use no uncomfortable feeling, often use, can be uniformly coated on cosmetics, very good, outside of the bag is also very good. Love it.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I was expecting them to be either really bad, or totally awesome, but I find them to be pretty average and for the price I am very happy with them. The brushes aren&#x27;t too soft or too hard. Quality is good; for everyday, light use, I think they will last a very long time. Also shipping was very fast! Ordered them on a Wednesday and expected delivery was the following Monday, I ended up getting them on Friday!</li>
            <li> For the price they do their job, however a couple of them started to shed after first time use. I love the smudge and eyeliner brushes the most. Some of the others dont pick up the eyeshadow too well</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift for a sister that you don&#x27;t know what to get something for because she has everything. :)</li>
            <li> All of these brushes are nice, and do exactly what they are supposed to, the only problem I have encountered is that the powder brush in my set keeps losing hairs while I am applying make up, not a big problem can be a tad bit annoying though.</li>
            <li> I just want to say that I love the packaging the brush set comes in! It&#x27;s very nicely packaged, it also comes in a protective bag. The pouch is of great material (for the price), I didn&#x27;t experience the \\&quot;strong odor\\&quot; as everyone has said in poor reviews. I love the way the brushes came individually wrapped and with plastic covers for each of the larger brush heads. And the ONE thing that I absolutely loved the MOST was the fact that it came with a booklet describing each brush and its uses. Thank you so much Amazon.com for my SHANY product and a nice and easy delivery! I definitely will be ordering from here soon. :)</li>
            <li> My wife is raving about these brushes.  I know very little about cosmetics and brushes, but she is very happy with this set, thus I would recommend this set to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received the red brushes and they are very lovely with minimal shedding (if any). I did not notice white powder on the brush hairs like some people but I washed them anyways. I did notice a smell. But it wasn&#x27;t so overpowering like some people exaggerated. I only smelled it if i put the pouch to my face. Open the pouch and let it air out for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brushes depends on what brush is used. Some work better than others. These brushes are super soft and I feel like they don&#x27;t pick up the product or apply it very well. They don&#x27;t work on my less pigmented, neutral colors. I ordered the Shany 120 palette to go with these brushes and the brushes only pick up the highly pigmented colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fan brush and eyebrow brush really are quite pathetic. My fan brush barely had any hairs on it and it does not do its job. Its pretty much just good for tickling your face. The eyebrow brush is very cheap but it does an okay job. I will continue to use my ELF eyebrow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for $13 and for that price I would recommend them. They are not professional brushes by any standards but if you do your daily makeup for school or work then this certainly will get the job done. Four stars.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful. I use them any time I put on makeup. I haven&#x27;t used all of them but none show signs of breaking and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The package came early, undamaged. Everything was there, it even came with a cute red case to store my brushes away in when I&#x27;m not using them</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing, I was considering ordering the Sigma brushes.  However, I kept coming back to Amazon and looking at the Shany brushes. The price point is rather reasonable and the quality is decent.  No regrets on brushes.  The only con is the cheap looking fire engine red pleatherette pouch they came in. But what can one expect for such a low price? At least they came in a pouch, so it&#x27;s really not much of a complaint :)</li>
            <li> There was one brush that was doubled ..hence i had two of the same brushes..which I did not need. And it was missing another brush. The quality of the brush is not all that good. It can be used ok..but I was as good as the picture makes it look.</li>
            <li> you do get what you pay for ! if you like the hairs falling off and getting stuck to your makeup by all means get them ! I wanted to give them a try for that same reason, ur better off saving money to buy quality brushes</li>
            <li> They come in a really convenient travel case which i lied, so far so good. The bristols aren&#x27;t shedding and it hold makeup really well. Overall i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! Great value! Great product! The quality of the brush is up to par with more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve purchased in the past..</li>
            <li> These brushes are of good quality and they have a great price! The case they come in is a little tacky.</li>
            <li> I love these make up brushes. Noe that I have one for every different use and were cheaper this way then if i bought them in the store.</li>
            <li> All brushes have held up great. No loose bristles. Love the fold up bag it comes with. Thank you. Good product.</li>
            <li> Very nice easy to use I loved the bag and the color its perfect as a valentine gift . Many brushes for different&lt;br /&gt;uses so cool loved it .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are the best brushes but for the price there are pretty good quality. Mines came with a red plastic cover. Everything was in place and the brushes were nice. It did have kind of a weird smell when I opened it however. Overall, for the price I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive set of makeup brushes that I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice set at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> $12.99 for 12 brushes, it&#x27;s like getting it for $1 a brush. It also comes with a pouch which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL SHANY COSMETICS BRUSHES..VERY GOOD QUALITY...DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND...I WILL ALWAYS RETURN BACK TO SHANY COSMETICS FOR ANY PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> I bought this brushes for my wife as a present after i had read so much good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving her gift she was exited, but she was very disappointed after opening it. The package were the brushes came in she like but when she first open them them had a really bad manufacture smell. She show me the difrrence between her drugstore brushes and this ones and the bristles on hers were really soft. The Shany ones were rough on your skin:( she also noted that they were lost of bristles falling out even after the first usage and they weren&#x27;t picking up much product. As for the arrival it was good!! But I would reccomond to anyone whose buying this brushes to save your money for something better like my wife said \\&quot;you get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great deal, and also is great if you&#x27;re just starting out in the makeup world.</li>
            <li> I bought these and I can say they are the WORST set of brushes I ever wasted my money on!! The VERY 1st time I used them they fell apart!! I don&#x27;t wear makeup all that often and it had been awhile since I bought them so it is too late to return them, I had little black hairs all over my face from these things. WHAT A WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED DOLLARS!!! Can&#x27;t believe I even gave these one star! Tried to take it back but it does not allow that!!</li>
            <li> Bundle that I recieved was in a red glossy carring case. It&#x27;s nice you can keep your brushes all organized together. The brushes come all individually wrapped and are not curly or falling out. Definatly better eyeshadow application with brushes than with sponges. The bristles are soft and velvety. Iv&#x27;e been looking at buying new brushes lately and I got a full set for the price of one brush at the stores. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this product as a gift for my daughter. Arrived fast and as expected! She will be pleasantly surprised. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good set to buy just for basic applications. WELL I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;4 of the pieces broke instantly (I&#x27;m not a rough make up artist).&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are stiff, yes but that in my opinion isn&#x27;t a good thing. I just figured after a few uses they would loosen a lil. But they didn&#x27;t. Makes it REALLY hard to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Atleast it&#x27;s cheap though.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! They are soft &amp; the pouch they came in is perfect to use on the go!</li>
            <li> There is an itemized description for each brush which is really helpful.  The set comes in a great case to keep them all organized and I am really happy with this purchase - would order a second set as a gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> You basically get what you pay for the metal on the brushes are sharp and will caise serious injury if your not careful</li>
            <li> Poor cheap quality. Strong smell. Brushes left hair fibers on my face. Never would I purchase this again. These brushes look like they were made for painting.....did I mention they have a strange strong smell as if they were actually dipped in paint. They don&#x27;t hold makeup on them unless you use a lot and I had on primer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I was exactly the one I was hoping to get. I will do it agian.</li>
            <li> Great brush kit! Because of previous reviews saying there was some kind of powder or dust already on them from shipping or something I did go ahead and wash them and the case when I first got them, but I didn&#x27;t notice there was any dust ( washed the case though because it had a funny smell, like a new case smell i guess )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the brushed washed and dried nicely and didn&#x27;t shed any bristles!:) they are soft on your face and last great! I bought these almost a year ago now and they are all still holding up great and i haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding or weirdness. They work wonderfully! and its nice to have a pouch to put them all in too so you don&#x27;t lose them and they stay nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Each brush also came with a plastic cover for the brush bit at the end, they were really nice plastic covers so i keep on them when I&#x27;m not using the brushes to help them keep their form and stay nice.</li>
            <li> I got these rather quickly and when I opened up the pouch, a chemical smell hit me. I thought I was going to have to return it! But after I left it open for a few minutes, the smell went away and I could use the super cute brushes! Love the red color, I was afraid they were going to be too pinkish, but the are a nice cherry red. Super soft and works efficiently.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay these brushes are good. They are great for beginners. They are cheap and u get a lot to play around with. Make sure to wash them with some baby shampoo to get the extra dye out before the first use. I wish it would of had a better blending brush for the eyes, and that the blush brush was angled.</li>
            <li> I love this product. As a beginner I think it was worth the money. For such a cheap price you can&#x27;t expect much, however this product exceeded my expectations. Many of the other reviews said the products smelled horribly, however I don&#x27;t think the smell was that bad. The product smells how something new would smell, it smells straight out of factory. The smell might be annoying for some, but it didn&#x27;t bother me much, wash the brushes and you&#x27;ll be fine. I love the product!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fine and I received this ok.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, the brushes are fluffy but sometimes they lose some pieces.&lt;br /&gt;The pro is absolutely the price! It&#x27;s really cheap!</li>
            <li> These are soft brushes that blend very nicely! I love the pouch too,it&#x27;s very convenient for keeping the brushes in.</li>
            <li> OK I HAVE ONLY USED ONE BRUSH SO FAR IT REMINDED OF A CHEAP PAINT BRUSH BUT HVNT USED THE OTHERS JUST RECENTLY ORDERED ANOTHER SET DIFFERENT BRAND . ONCE I USE A FEW MORE I&#x27;LL COMMENT ON THEM!!</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m always looking for great brushes for great prices. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think they existed until I found these brushes. These are seriously some high quality brushes. Minimal to no shedding, great size, and work great. You seriously can&#x27;t ask for more. I love that these are high quality, yet affordable brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter to learn about makeup and how to apply it with brushes and I must say it was a great learners item. they are so soft and pretty!! i couldn&#x27;t have found better brushes for her anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes well packaged and earlier than the expected arrival date. I must say - I love, love, LOVE the brushes, though I wish they were a little thicker. They are great for a first time purchase, but they will not likely sustain themselves over time like my set of brushes from Sephora which are a tad more... durable? Also - there are a couple of brushes which look almost the same, so it would have been nice to see a list of each brush and what they are used for. Overall - nice product to have on hand and works well with my eye shadow pallete I recently purchased - also from Shany.</li>
            <li> I got this product soooo fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s soft haven&#x27;t been really using because I barely wear makeup any more..</li>
            <li> I took a chance ordering these brushes, I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for so many of them. Make sure to clean before using, they stand up to being cleaned very well. The roll up case that came with the brushes is nice and helps to keep them together. Very good purchase for the quality.</li>
            <li> So I recently started doing make up, and needed a lot more brushes than I thought. So, based on the reviews, I just purchased. It came so fast! In two days! It&#x27;s great. The packaging is so pretty as well. But the big brushes are not as soft as I thought they were. In the past I used ecotools. The smaller brushes are very nice, but the bigger brushes.... not as soft!</li>
            <li> Excited to use these, they&#x27;re nice</li>
            <li> I received these for a christmas gift, and I like them so much I will be buying them for my mom and daughter at the next oportunity. They have not shed much, was and dry really well and are all around great brushes. I wish there was maybe 1 additional angle brush for eyeshadow but truly I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I do wish that the powder and blush brush were bigger, but for the price, these are awesome. The carrying case is adorable as well and has held up to a few months of use fine.</li>
            <li> These are not rock star fabulously made, but they are okay.  I didn&#x27;t need all of them by any means, and probably wouldn&#x27;t order the whole set again.  The red holder is clearly made of vinyl, and not nice enough that I want to bring it with me.  They do smell very strongly of some chemical when they first arrive, but I just set the pouch out, open, for a few days and the scent went away.  In the end, I have only ended up using two of the brushes from the set.  They work fine for the price, but again, I&#x27;d probably buy just one or two brushes and not the set in the future.</li>
            <li> Best set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I&#x27;ve purchased some very expensive brushes. These do a great job are just as advertised and I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> i am in love with these brushes. they are soft. they don&#x27;t shed. the pouch is super handy. a very good investment</li>
            <li> These brushes are so easy to clean. They apply makeup very well and it is a great price. Love the red!</li>
            <li> These are very nice, the only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars is because they smell very chemical like, I couldn&#x27;t use them right away. I had to air them out for a few days before I used them. But overall, they a nice brushes. They could be a little softer, but they are made out of goat and badger hair... Choose wisely..</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for.  They are not HIGH quality, but we didn&#x27;t pay for high quality.  They are good for your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> for my niece and she said they work great and feel soft against skin</li>
            <li> The heads keep moving from the brush handle. Cheap material and quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes were nice initially, however I bought them earlier this year, more than six months ago but not up to a year. The brush for the eyebrow comb broke. One of the powder brushes literally fell apart. I was cleaning it and all the bristles came out! Just like that! Okay but, but not for long time usage. Good for practice only then upgrade. It you looking for affordable yet effective, elf brushes are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price. Brushes are nice - comparable to MAC brushes and come it a cute and convenient carrying case. Would recommend,</li>
            <li> First off, it was neatly and well-packaged. The pouch came in a beautiful red color and the brushes were individually wraped. I think I liked the pouch more than the brushes themselves lol..But the brushes were exactly the ones from the picture. They seem pretty durable and sturdy. I did kind of expect the brushes to be bigger, just because of how they looked in the pictures but all in all I was not disappointed. They did not have any type of powder like said in the other reviews and did not have a foul smell, just a kind of new scent (only a tad bit overwhelming) although of course I&#x27;ll wash them before using them. It&#x27;s a great buy, and certainly great quality for 25 bucks..And the pouch is beautiful! Five stars.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes well made and great price for the buy.  I would definately recommend anyone to buy these brushes</li>
            <li> great set of brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Theres 383 reviews on here, so I&#x27;m not going to go into details (read the others).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to add my support for what is a really nice product, &amp; I&#x27;m glad I have it.</li>
            <li> love them!  they are very soft, and don&#x27;t shed. mine didn&#x27;t have an odor that ive seen o several reviews. great product!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  While these are cheap, you will pay what you would have for a good set of brushes replacing these constantly.  The hairs constantly fall out, they are rough not soft at all, the top of the brush falls off the handle.  These are just horrible don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This product got one star because the only brush in my set that was any good was the angled brush n I use that for liner n lipstick... the rest of them smelled like something toxic, were frayed and the acual brushes came off of the stick... I regret buyin this.</li>
            <li> to be honest I thought it was going to be a bad product, but its good, I don&#x27;t give 5 stars because it came with a smell I didn&#x27;t like, maybe chemical, so I had to soak them for a bit in soap, .but the smell went away and the brushes did not shed which is good! &#x3D;) I put make up with them and I so far so good..</li>
            <li> So they are worth it for the price. The bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as I thiught they would be, thats why I gave three stars. When you first open it there will be a very strong scent, please wash before use. I would recommend this to someone who is just starting out.</li>
            <li> This is a handy brush set for all your needs. The bristles on the brush are high quality and feel great on your skin. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was really unsure about these brushes at first because they were really cheap and now I am really happy I went ahead and bought them! They work great and help me achieve \\&quot;the look\\&quot; I want when I&#x27;m doing my make-up!</li>
            <li> These are amazing brushes for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re MAC quality, but they&#x27;re much better than anything you&#x27;d find in the drugstore. The only thing I&#x27;d say is to take a look at the different kind of brushes included in the set before you buy. I have no use for probably half of them, but that&#x27;s totally my fault for not checking!</li>
            <li> All the small brushed works beautifully but the big ones are a mess. They leave bits of the brush hair on your face.</li>
            <li> I would love to return it, as I have not used it due to my disappointment. The quality is substandard, and not up to par.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for my 15 year old daughter and she has never complained about them so that makes them a winner.  Considering that at her age, EVERYTHING seems to warrant a complaint these days.  :)</li>
            <li> the brushes are so soft and easy to use. They come with brushes that would usually cost $24 for one. I love the fan brush and the eye brushes. You can actually change what kind of brushes they are by using them a different way, and they still work amazingly. I love the case and how it is real quality and you can roll it up and put it in your bag. One of my favorite hobbies is to collect make up and make up brushes and with SHANEY COSMETICS, I can collect real quality brushes cheaper than  MAC and SEPHORA.</li>
            <li> Totally impressed with the packaging of the product. The brushes are nice but the larger face brushes leave bristles after use. Apart from that it is fantastic based on the price.</li>
            <li> i LOVED it only thing i wished it had was a foundation brush, i was looking foward to it !!!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. Maybe not professional quality but great for a mom like me who doesn&#x27;t want to spent too much but still get good quality.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be cheap brushes, but they are actually really good quality! Some of the reviews stated that they smelled bad, Hello they smell like the plastic case they arrive in!! I just put them in my brush holder and voila by the end of the day the smell was gone!</li>
            <li> Im not a make up specialist but I do like the small slant brush to put on my eye shadow and the large brush for my foundation. I would buy again</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes! I only use them to apply my own makeup but I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Truly perfect</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes and certainly affordable.  The bag they came in is perfect if you travel and want to take them with you.  The bag was in nice condition.  I did was the brushes right away, as you should, and they didn&#x27;t smell bad at all when received as indicated in some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> The best I ever had so far.</li>
            <li> Well they&#x27;re brushes if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. Otherwise if you want something more than the basics, look elsewhere. Maybe your price will be even cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Brushes broke to easily</li>
            <li> This set is a great value.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT........</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes!  I&#x27;m in Aruba right now and I don&#x27;t apply makeup except for when the sun goes down cuz it&#x27;s hot here but, these brushes are great because they don&#x27;t shed their bristles, just enough choices in the bundle which comes in a nice leather wrap that rolls up and ties up nicely especially for traveling.  I&#x27;ll be buying another set to keep on hand because I like to use new brushes every 6 to 12 months so they don&#x27;t accumulate bacteria.  I do wash them with brush cleanser which is good for long time use.  Great color selection as well.  Packaged in bubble wrap and shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!  They are a great set, easy to care for and use.  Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> These were exactly as I expected.  They were what was advertised for sell. They appear to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Waste of even a cent. Only recommend if you plan on not touching it especially not for make-up use. Smells of pure chemicals and falls apart immediately. Cheap ugly crap. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Just received my set. I was skeptical because of the price but, decided to purchase after reading the reviews! I&#x27;m thrilled with what I received! These are quality brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I will definitely be trying more of their products. I plan on buying an eyeshadow set asap!</li>
            <li> I like how soft these brushes are. I feel like the powder brushes are a bit too soft sometimes for getting all of the product around my face but for what they are, this is an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Wow I really wasn&#x27;t expecting such great quality since they were so cheap, but these brushes are great!!! There soft but catches and applies product really well. They come in a really cute pouch that makes the easy to travel, and carry around in your purse or book bag. Ladies purchase these brushes and I promise you&#x27;ll be glad you did!!!</li>
            <li> recomiendo sinceramente ESTE PRODUCTO LOS PINCELES ME HAN SIDO DE MUY BUENA UTILIDAD Y HAN RESULTADO RESISTENTES. EL VENDEDOR ENVIÓ A TIEMPO</li>
            <li> Great product..Came quick and brand new. Love the brushes and makes a great gift. Can&#x27;t do your makeup without them</li>
            <li> QUality not upto the mark!. Its a cheap brush set don&#x27;t waste your money unless you are on some budget as I was.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because their products are inexpensive but the product is great and well worth the price. Would reccomend and buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these last Christmas for my daughters and this year they asked for some again because they don&#x27;t last. I have make up brushes that I have had for 30 years. I paid more but they last. These brushes are beautiful at first but they will not last. You will get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good but no professional quality. Def worth the money but most likely will only last a year maybe two at most</li>
            <li> Very pretty pink.There is a huge range of sizes.They come in so handy for multiple things.I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> جدا ممتازه ورخيصه ونوعيتها جيده وفرشتها ناعمه وتستحق التجربه والاقتناء فلابأس بها............وشكرا&lt;br /&gt;هذا ماوددت قوله&lt;br /&gt;عن هذه البضاعه&lt;br /&gt;ولكم التحية ولاحترام</li>
            <li> it is quite convenient to have makeup brushes that are easy to carry around..So, I guess its worth buying if you love applying makeup!!</li>
            <li> Both my daughters love all the brushes and use them daily. Now I get to keep my own! great product.</li>
            <li> purchased as a christmas present for daughter shipped very fast great product, she loved them also bought the eye make-up very satisfied</li>
            <li> its nice and i like it. i will recomend it to my friends. i hope the will like it too.</li>
            <li> I dont know why there is alot of bad reviews on this product i ordered this a few months ago and they work wonderful. And even after me having these for a few months they still work just as good as when i got them. The people who say they suck must not know how to do makeup because i can do every single style of make up with these brushes. Dont listen to the bad reviews these are good brushes (:</li>
            <li> These are decent and a good option for back up brushes but I don&#x27;t think the they are stiff enough and they shed,</li>
            <li> It was a good choice for my teenagers.  She  loved it. Easy to ship arrived on time no problems w order</li>
            <li> I love this brushed bet affordable and they are so nice ! Use them everyday ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL THE BRUSHES SMELL. IT&#x27;S CHEAP. GO TO WALMART OR WALGREENS YOU WILL DO BETTER THAN THIS MESS. tHE SMELL THAT CAME OUT OF THAT BOX WOLUD KNOCK YOU OUT LITERALLY&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUY. SHANY YOU SHOULD BE SAME OF YOURSELF. I&#x27;VE GOTTEN THINGS FROM THEM BEFORE AND LOVED IT, BUT THIS OH NO!!!!</li>
            <li> I knew the price was too good to be true! and it is. Bristles are hard synthetic fibers.  Not enough bristles on the brushes. Not thick.</li>
            <li> its a great brush set i used them almost everyday they are easy to clean and are stredy so far</li>
            <li> This set is okay for the price. I expected a little more of a professional set. They look fuller in the photo.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I have used in a long time. Will buy more once I need to replace my old ones. I am dedicated to this company.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter is very involved in theatre - ordered these for her stage make-up and was very happy with the quality!</li>
            <li> This was my first set of makeup brushes and I was pretty disappointed. Every single time I use them (and I&#x27;ve had them for about six months now), some of the bristles end up on my face. They don&#x27;t blend terribly well either, but the bristle thing really chaps my hide. I&#x27;ll have to do more/better research next time.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister, she loved it!! The pouch is nice, the brushes are a good quality and the price is great!!! My only con is that i wish all the brushes were labeled</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes for all ages.  Large variety.  Application of products goes on smoothly and professionally.  Would recommend for self and a great gift!</li>
            <li> Great product, packaged well and shipped very fast. People have been asking me about SHANY Cosmetics and I would HIGHLY recommend their products. Everything from their brushes to their lipstick.. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I just received my brushes and I&#x27;m so pleased with this item. I will recommend this to others. I gave it four stars</li>
            <li> These brushes are of really high quality and didn&#x27;t lose hairs when you use them. This brand is really great. They also came with a booklet to tell you what each brush is to be used for. I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> I expected so much more from these brushes. They don&#x27;t pick up product, and when they do they leave my make up all blotchy/streaky which I hate. I regret buying this product, I would have rather invested the money spent on this brush set on a single but professional brush. The packaging looks tacky and cheap. The brushes aren&#x27;t even fluffy and they lose brush hairs constantly even when not in use. The only thing I like about this brush set is the handles, they&#x27;re very easy to hold and move around.</li>
            <li> This was a little gift I added to a sack of household gifts I had for her....she was thrilled to get them as they were on her wish list and didn&#x27;t realize that there was anything personal in the sack of gifts.</li>
            <li> muy bueno, entrega rapida y sin problemas. El producto es uno de los mejores que existen! no hay comparación con ninguno</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider these brushes &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; by any means. I purchased to use at a vacation home. Lots of brushes for the money.</li>
            <li> the brushes are very nice and the quality is good, the wide variety of brushes and instructions were very useful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  had these brushes for about a week. I&#x27;m disappointed that there isn&#x27;t a bigger powder brush, but I am very happy with the eye shadow brushes. I have a feeling these aren&#x27;t going to last long though, as I&#x27;ve already seen a couple of hairs break off of the brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. There are so many in this cosmetic brush set. They are really great to use for anything.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much out of these because of the price. They worked for me for a while, but I had problems with the face brushes losing bristles all over the place. I also would have preferred a \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; face brush or two that would be more suitable for liquid foundation and contouring. I also found the eye brushes to be very \\&quot;scratchy\\&quot; and irritating.</li>
            <li> excellent product easy to handle recommend as it is very good and the person is also very responsible and kind thank you very much</li>
            <li> I purchase them just to have them display in one of my glasses that I needed my fav. color in and seen these.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love how they have the pouch with it!  I totally recommend it to anyone that needs brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good and soft. I have had them for a few years now and some of the glue is coming undone so the handles are falling off.</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes got so many or a really good price and the worked great and there was no damage</li>
            <li> Well, you get exactly what you paid for. Some cheap brushes that stick to your face. Am not a fan.</li>
            <li> I chose this cosmetic brus set that is comfortable and have good price.&lt;br /&gt;I like it so cheap and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;recommend anyone to buy an equal, not regret</li>
            <li> This product was ok though the bristles where too long for some of the designs. The pouch was nice but would have been nicer without the straps but mayb with something else</li>
            <li> Our 11 yr ould daughter loves it. Very nice set. I would even use it. Thanks for putting out nice stuff at good prices.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good quality and ther is a brush for just about anything you would need for applying makeup. It also comes in a cute little pouch. Try them and you will not regret it. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of brushes as an \\&quot;extra\\&quot; for traveling, etc.  I think it&#x27;s a good set, especially for the purchase price.  The brushes are very soft and seem to be made well.  There is a slight odor to the carry case, but I am assuming it will wear off.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and feel that the brushes were appropriately described in the product description.  I am happy with the purchase and received exactly what I was expecting.  I would recommend these brushes to others.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly, beautifully packaged with a wonderful assortment of brushes in a handy vinyl storage /travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for more products from this company.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush set...as are all of SHANY brush sets. These contain natural fibers which make application so much smoother!! There is absolutely no shedding which is a must in a good brush!</li>
            <li> These brushes are not as soft as I expected (considering previous reviews). But I know good brushes so maybe what&#x27;s acceptable to others is not for me.  You will find far softer brushes in your drugstore.. which because of this experience, I did check out Walgreen&#x27;s selection and was very pleased for less $$.  I usually use department store type brushes (sable).  My package said goat hair.  I am not pleased and when using the blush brush, I was left with shedding strands on my face.  This can certainly happen with brushes but this was more than usual.  The plastic case that holds these brushes is attractive but has a terrible plastic chemical smell  that won&#x27;t air out.</li>
            <li> I just received my brush set and i love them! they&#x27;re super soft and apply my eyeshadow really well! the little red pouch is cute too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with purchase, great value, brushes feel soft and do the job. I have not washed them yet so I do not know how they hold up long term. I had them about three months and I&#x27;m very satisfied. They do not feel cheap and do not shed</li>
            <li> These brushes suck! DO NOT BUY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs fall out so much and are extremely course and irritating to use on the face. the only brushes I use are a couple of the eye shadow brushes. Dont buy</li>
            <li> Very happy with it used most of the brushes. Has everything you need. Bushes seem a little hard at first but they soften up.</li>
            <li> Today I used them for the first time after I bought them, they are really soft, each brush is easy to access. I really Liked them and I recommend them !</li>
            <li> well, they&#x27;re soft but they are kind of laking in volume? if that makes any sense. they were all bent and stuff when i got them. i more that likely won&#x27;t use them. also, when i was looking at them and moved the hair, dust came off? idk if they were used but that even more makes me not want to use them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I lost some of my old brushes in our move recently.  When I saw this deal on Amazon it had pretty good reviews and the price was right so I went for them.  The brushes themseleves are attractive to look at and do a decent job at applying my makeup.  I prefer a brush that is a little firmer and these also seem to shed a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would not recommend getting these brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. I am a beginner with makeup, but I have found that all the necessary essentials as far as brushes are concerned are included. I love the case and the price was awesome.</li>
            <li> The hair keeps falling out and when used it doesnt give the required effect. Its ok for gifting to children but not worth for women who use make up everyday</li>
            <li> Well packaged and the brushes were all covered in plastic and very soft. Only took a week to receive it.</li>
            <li> These are probably okay but they are made out of pony hair; I have animal allergies and they totally broke out my face. I washed them, too, the red paint peeled off a couple just sitting in water (no soap). The brushes felt nice but not for me.</li>
            <li> I did get my brushes, but I did not get my other package, which was a purse, and it has been paid for</li>
            <li> Terrible quality, threw them in the garbage right after I bought them. Much better to spend a lot and buy from sephora.</li>
            <li> Love this set brought over a year ago and now writing a review. held up well. Price is great for the set.</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations for these Shany brushes. I read many reviews and decided to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes shed like no other. The textures of the brushes are in the middle of soft and hard like a rock.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t really help me achieve a flawless makeup look. I find myself constantly trying to re-do my makeup, because these brushes just do not have a smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a great price, but also remember, you get what you pay for. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> Brushes smell really bad!</li>
            <li> I use it everytime I put on my makeup. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind picking the hairs off your face each time you use any of these brushes then these are the brushes for you. Don&#x27;t waist your money!  I have brushes from Mac that have lasted me 5+ years and I will go and purchase them again</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes holding up really well</li>
            <li> The hair falls off quickly.</li>
            <li> Not well made. The brushes seem to fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes I&#x27;ve had them for a while and they are really good, they keep up really neat</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it.</li>
            <li> absolutely loved this set</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  I just wish it came with Fondation brush</li>
            <li> Super soft, LOVE these brushes. These are my new favorite, go-to brushes. I highly recommend these, but suggest you get something to help preserve and clean the brushes to help them to stay looking and feeling like new.</li>
            <li> Great product would buy again!</li>
            <li> The hairs on the brush started falling off. And wasnt as great as i thought it would have been..bad purchase</li>
            <li> They are really rough on your face. They don&#x27;t blend the makeup well. The cover is a cheap plastic and it did smell like glue when I first got it. I have also gotten a lot of fall out in the bristles as well. I do like the variety though. Some of the brushes are ok.</li>
            <li> Wow so many different brushes they work really well! Also it comes in a nice case that folds over like a professional case. You get many brushes. To wash them if need be. But it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> They were cheaper online, the color is great and all of the sizes will be used. I will be purchasing more in the future for gifts.</li>
            <li> good product but it  arrived a bit later than expected. good quality, they come with a red bag for brushes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality, can&#x27;t live without it anymore ! I really love it !!&lt;br /&gt;Got the instruction of each brush in the package, wich is nice for people like me who starts using make up ! :)</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes were very thin and didn&#x27;t have a lot of fibers in the head.  Didn&#x27;t seem to hold much shadow.</li>
            <li> Not very soft at all you get what you pay for I suppose love the eye shadow brushes though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for a single brush and this whole set is as high quality as the expensive brushes I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I&#x27;m really impressed with this set. The red leather-like pouch is beautiful. The box it all came in was really nice too. This would be a great gift! I didn&#x27;t even need brushes when I bought it, but they&#x27;re so high quality and there&#x27;s such a variety that now I use them every day and rely on them. I am going to check out the other products SHANY sells because I am so impressed with these brushes and how affordable the company has made them. This company also doesn&#x27;t test on animals! Cruelty free! PETA approved.</li>
            <li> Great set of different brushed and such.  It seems sturdy to me, not the fraying type.  Top notch quaility.  Great product.</li>
            <li> They are Cheaply made brushes and smelled of nail polish remover. If I had the time to take them back and return them I would... Gave them to my four year old to play with... Terrible product</li>
            <li> they r cheap and alot of different brushes but they arent very soft so i guess i got what i pd for i still think they are OK just not as soft as i would like. They do not shed alot as others have said. i had a few hairs shed off but nothing major, ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what my experience has been with the brushes:&lt;br /&gt;They look professional- love the colors. The bristles in mine were actually black which I prefer- makes it easier to see what&#x27;s on them since I use a lot of light or saturated colors. They&#x27;re soft and the application is very smooth and well-covered compared to many other brushes. I love the variety of sizes. What I dislike is the smell- I soaked mine in a body mist and rinsed before I used them- very potent scent when you open them. Also the pouch..don&#x27;t plan on using that in any sort of regularity. It&#x27;s not well constructed and it doesn&#x27;t look nearly as neat or clean as the brushes themselves. If you&#x27;re using the brushes either personally or professionally, highly recommend getting a good make up remover- these brushes cover so well that you&#x27;ll really want to clean up or your foundation will wind up on your pillows/clothes at night. What works best for me is a toner- [[ASIN:B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream]]. Smells wonderful and cleans/moisturizes while removing the make up. Works on eyes too if you&#x27;re not dosing your pads in it.</li>
            <li> With these 13 tools, any makeup style is possible! The blush brush is very easy to use when applying light blush on and the tiny brush 2nd to last on the right in the given picture is just so handy! If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect, professional brush kit that&#x27;s priced at a reasonable price, you better place an order right now! If you&#x27;re a starter looking for a brush kit, start with this to be ahead of the game in techniques and looks! You just &#x27;outta have it!</li>
            <li> me gusto mucho, tiene todo tipo de brochas, y en comparacion a otras tiendas virtuales es mucho mas economico. y me llego a tiempo :)</li>
            <li> stupid, they fall apart and feel like plastic on your face. stick to a nicer brand</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Very good selection/amount of brushes. Better than decent quality bristles. I love the case they come in- perfect for travel. And it&#x27;s RED! Makes me feel a little extra sexy when I put it on. ;)</li>
            <li> They were delivered very quickly... actually sooner than they were supposed to be. They were packaged very well and came with a cute red pouch and each brush was wrapped in a plastic protector. They applied my makeup great. The bristles are soft and sturdy. I will definitely be purchasing more from this company.</li>
            <li> Only one star but deserves NONE, the brushes are cheesy and poorly made, also harsh on the skin. Requesting a return</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of getting all these brushes with a little leather wrap up thing, but the quality is definitely on the low end. At least 2 of the heads detached within the first 2 weeks or month! So it&#x27;s OK, I guess. Be good for a &amp;#34;starter set&amp;#34; for someone young and just fooling around..</li>
            <li> I do enjoy these brushes and the way they are arranged on the brush bag. This is a great purchase!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not the best but they shed a lot</li>
            <li> Great item, but since I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or anything, I really didn&#x27;t need like, 8 different types of eyeshadow brushes. I mean, I only have 2 eyes, lol~! In person, several almost look the same size, so it&#x27;s not like it will make a huuuuuge difference when I&#x27;m doing my makeup. I wish there were more variety in a 12-pack, because I don&#x27;t want to buy like, a 72-piece to have the selection of brushes I need. The pro is the cost though!! Good pricing and the makeup bag isn&#x27;t too bad either. It&#x27;s compact and rolls up so it fits conveniently. The quality of the brushes is decent...it&#x27;s not MAC or something sold at Sephora, but then again, for the price of these 12, I probably couldn&#x27;t even get 1 brush from Smashbox or one of the other brand names.</li>
            <li> They are soft and appear to be very well made.  I am giving these for a gift and I am sure they will be loved.</li>
            <li> These brushes are poor in quality and shed as well. I wish I would have done my research. I&#x27;ll give them away.</li>
            <li> The brushes have really long handles, but that is just a weird personal preference. Overall, great value and high quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great product</li>
            <li> Wanted these for Christmas and my parents got them for me. I will return them because the brushes I received are nothing like the picture. The eye shadow brushes have about 25 bristles in them making it impossible to hold any eye shadow on the brush. Two brushes are made on curved pieces of wood making the brush lopsided. The two tone brushes pictured are not two-toned and very cheaply made. I must have received knock-offs or a rejected set becuase this product does not deserve the reviews it has received.</li>
            <li> I was pleased after purchasing this set. More than I anticipated. I think it&#x27;s a good set and nice quality of brushes for beginners. I have no complaints besides the case being garbage.</li>
            <li> Nice set. Works well.</li>
            <li> I think quality brushes make the make-up experience go to the next level. These are very good quality and the price is awesome.</li>
            <li> price was great for all these brushes, and they hold up good haven&#x27;t had any issues yet. would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Now, I am not a make-up artist or anything like that. I don&#x27;t do anyone&#x27;s make-up except mine and when I do it&#x27;s never much more than everyday simple make-up (unless there is a special occassion such as a wedding or something). So for me, this is the nicest set of make-up brushes I have ever had. It comes in a really nice red, pleather case that rolls and ties. The brushes are nice and organized and it&#x27;s easy to keep them that way with the pouch they came in. My husband went onto my Amazon wishlist, saw this on there and ordered it for me as a Christmas gift. It was a great gift to get because it would not be something I think I would order for myself. All in all, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have a few luxury brand makeup brushes but wanted something inexpensive - but still good - for experimenting with more daring, bold colors. I wanted to keep my $$$ brushes for my HG products, which are all gentle, neutral colors. I just didn&#x27;t want to risk ruining the &amp;#34;investment&amp;#34; brushes, and didn&#x27;t want to deal with using a quick-change wash, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for a pretty long time. I found some pretty awful brushes that discouraged me. So I half-heatedly put this SHANY set on my wish list, not getting my hopes up too too high, though the reviews were certainly encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Santa came through, slipping the bright red case into my stocking, and SHANY has absolutely blown me away with these unexpectedly high-quality brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a set!  I haven&#x27;t even begun to use them all. I use the large all-over shadow brush to blend powder shadow onto the rest of my eye after applying a cream shadow to just the lids, below the crease. The effect is perfect, and it&#x27;s so easy. I didn&#x27;t own such a large shadow brush like that before, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use some of the other shadow brushes to practice with really bold, heavily pigmented, unusual shades of purple, blue, green, black, and so on. They work beautifully, making the challenge much more manageable. And more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft and really hold shadow well, picking it right up and not dropping a bit as I move it to my eye. Then they release powder with easy, even distribution and blend beautifully. I&#x27;m just so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they all come in a handy organizer case, too. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this brand before! I&#x27;m definitely going to check out what else SHANY has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering investing in a really expensive, luxury-brand brush set, I highly recommend you try this one first. You may find that you don&#x27;t need to invest in another full set, and only want certain brush upgrades. It could save you lots of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of getting another set to keep at my in-laws house, where we visit often. I like to keep some basic toiletries in the guest bath, making trips so much easier. This is the right price for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also plan to get these for my nieces. It&#x27;s a great set for anyone just starting to experiment with makeup. Of any age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I give it 5 stars because it does exactly what I wanted at a great value. I&#x27;ve had no problems, all pleasures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; for this amazing brush set! It fits my needs PERFECTLY and often performs just as well as my &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; brushes!</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just lucky to get a good set, but I am quite satisfied with what I got. Delivery was fast. The pouch came in a separate box with two informational leaflets - one with a description of every brush and one with general information about Shany Cosmetics. The pouch looks awesome and the color is very stylish - bloody red. Brushes came exactly as described here. No strange smells.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about these brushes is that they are really easy to clean. What I do not quite like is that angled and &#x27;pencil&#x27; brushes are really not firm enough. It does not play much role to me, because I do not use these brushes for my makeup a lot anyway. But it is something that you should keep in mind before making a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are softer than other brushes of the same price, but not as soft as higher-quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is very good investment for beginners or those who do not use make up brushes a lot, but would anyway like to have this handy set for special occasions.</li>
            <li> buenas noches la compra todo fue muy rapido y sin ningun problama y en excelentes condiciones y llego a tiempo gracias</li>
            <li> Ii guess you get what you pay for..  i gave these brushes as a gife.  The brushes continue to shed</li>
            <li> My wife loves these brushes. She had brushes listed on her Christmas list so I went to Amazon and looked for top-rated.  Boy did I score. She threw all her old ones out and said 3 times now how much see loves them.  I think she is happier than if I had gotten her the $500 Bose system. Sorry I cant provide any details about the product but at this price its not a gamble.</li>
            <li> I bought this to accompany a make-up kit SHANY products for a young girl. I looks nice on top of the gorgeous vanity that her mother gave her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The brushes are only good for beginners. Other than that then it&#x27;s useless. After two wash the glue doesn&#x27;t stay on together anymore. :-/</li>
            <li> It comes with everything it say it comes with which is good for me. I saw the same items in the store which was 10x more so i was very impress by the price. It is worth buying.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is cruility free as it did not say anything on package and i think it comes from china one again china requires products to be tested on animals how can i be sure of this ?</li>
            <li> I mainly bought these to have a new foundation brush. In the description it said it included one,,,and telling by the picture i thought it was one  of the larger bruses. However, the foundation brush was a tiny concealer brush</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but the product seem to be well made. It has arrived on time too</li>
            <li> these brushes work very well to apply makeup it doesnt clump the makeup it applys very smoothly i highly recommend</li>
            <li> For the price, I was not even expecting half of the quality I received.  They are remarkably good quality with perfect &amp;#34;pull.&amp;#34;  The brushes were purchased for my mother (who was in dire need of new brushes), and after seeing the quality of this product both my daughter and myself will now be ordering a set.  I would highly recommend these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> The photo given by this product is not what you receive, you get two less large brushes and a few less eyeshadow brushes. The brushes shed a little.I didn&#x27;t find the eye shadow brushes very firm which was a let down , ALL of the brushes are very soft.The only brushes I really like are the blush and powder brush. Over all I&#x27;d not recommend this package , buy individuals.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for beginners!!! The only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; I had was is that they bleed when they&#x27;re washed.. but that&#x27;s normal for most brushes!!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, the variety of brushes and the brush quality. Because of the case it is easy to transport. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WASTE of money!! I would not recommend buying these, they&#x27;re cheap in price &amp; they&#x27;re even cheaper in quality! I guess I should have expected that....don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail today and I don&#x27;t know why this product is getting so many great reviews, they&#x27;re really misleading! I&#x27;m so frustrated that I even bought this set. It&#x27;s NOT worth your money at all! The picture is very different from the actual product. The brushes look big and all fluffy..but they&#x27;re not. They are the actual brush length,..but there not fluffy they look like they were cheap with the hair. And the fan brush is honest to God puny! Actually they all are I&#x27;ve seen $1 brushes that are better than them.  Ugh..i really am disappointed I wish I had saved up my money and invested in a brand that is worth the hype. OMG I almost forgot! It has an UNBEARABLE smell!..As soon as you open your Amazon box your gonna smell chemicals! It&#x27;s awful and I&#x27;ve washed them and the smell still won&#x27;t go away. Anyways I really advise you guys to invest in a brand that your familiar with and can go to a store and see, touch, and test BEFORE you buy. I really hoped that i would&#x27;ve liked this product and I&#x27;m very disappointed that It didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is really great, especially for the price. They are soft and apply makeup well. It has quite a variety...I love that it offers 3 different sizes of eye shadow brushes plus a sponge brush, which I use just for blending, but can also be used for applying. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use out of both the angled eyeliner and fan brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of brushes is a little excessive though. If you&#x27;re just looking for just the essentials, maybe look for a set with fewer brushes. If one of your main reasons for buying this set is the fact that it comes with a pouch, MOVE ON. It isn&#x27;t functional at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But besides these two little cons, the set is great. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are cheaply made and the bristles do not feel good on the delicate skin on your eye. They are rough and poke you occasionally.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re the best, but they&#x27;re not the worst either. They get the job done. They are very soft, which is a pro. But they do occasionally shed. But only on the powder brush. I havn&#x27;t had a problem with the others. When they came out of the box, they did indeed have a smell, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. And on one of the eye brushes the metal part that&#x27;s attached to the handle came completely off, and I had to glue it back on. But other than those few things, I would say they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and easy to use! They are good quality brushes and do well with my sensitive skin:)</li>
            <li> putting makeup on was such a hassle before i got this set! its a breeze now. i seriously put my makeup on in less than 3 minutes. i havent opened some of the brushes yet but im sure i will.. i dont wear much makeup. im glad i got it</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than others I&#x27;ve paid a LOT more for. I am very satisfied with this purchase. There are so many to choose from too!</li>
            <li> Gave this as a Christmas to my teen daughter, who loved it and wants to give as gifts to her friends...</li>
            <li> Brush hairs fall out often. ...not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Let me just say I love these brushes they soft and firm..I love the blush brush the color is awesome I love the pouch it comes in aswell and the box and they dnt smell as bad as sme reviewers had said..I use the brushes everyday sme I have not use yet but great brushes for the price...</li>
            <li> I have really not had a chance to use this yet cos I don&#x27;t use make up that often. At first look though, it looks like it will serve it&#x27;s purpose we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> I think some of the eyeshadow brushes are basically duplicates of each other just to make it seem like you get lots of brushes, but the bag is nice, stylish and durable. I do wish there was a foundation brush so that I could use this whole set on other people and not have to use my hands to apply foundation. But, I really like this set, for the money, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Not exactly as seen in the photos, are more simple and the quality is not as high, but for the price are great, no brushes to blend and you have are simple</li>
            <li> I dont like these brushs because they are cheap and they shed too much. Now i know why these things were so cheap... because they ARE CHEAP. Im so angry with you. Im NOT buying anything else from YOU people EVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> only a few brushes are good do not waste your money the brushes are too soft and cant help much</li>
            <li> Low quality makeup brushes that fall apart. The red color also runs a bit.</li>
            <li> It meets all needs when making up and has a clear instruction about how to use each brush. But the hair is not so soft.</li>
            <li> This is the first complete brush collection that I have ever purchased.  I have not used them yet, but the packaging and feel of the product is great.  Will update once I try the brushes.</li>
            <li> brushes shed after a few uses</li>
            <li> This kit was a great deal - at $13 for 13 brushes, these brushes are cheaper than most drugstore comparables. The bristles are pretty soft and they truly are not as bad as some of the reviews make them out to be, especially given the price. I&#x27;ve used them and cleaned them many times in the past few months and they are still in great shape.</li>
            <li> Loved it! For that many brushes the price is just right. If only the brush was a bit thicker, but it&#x27;s good the way it is. Would definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate for these brushes. Overall they are not bad, I really enjoy having access to brushes while doing my make-up and others&#x27; make-up as well. The brushes are somewhat hard which makes it difficult to apply blushes and foundation and some of the bristles come off on your face if you apply it too hard which is a real turn off and frustrating. The smaller brushes and the eyeshadow brushes are very ideal for small areas that you want touch up and the eyebrow brush/comb combo are very ideal, although I wished they would have thrown in a mascara brush.</li>
            <li> they were exactly what i thought they were gonna be but softer and they really hold the powder eyeshadows and make up and i love the leather pouch!</li>
            <li> excelent product met all my expectations . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Brushes are good quality and you get a good selection for the price you pay, plus a nice travel pouch. The only thing that would make these better is if the handles on the brushes were shorter to make them even more compact, and so when I&#x27;m leaning into the mirroe to see what I&#x27;m doing I don&#x27;t bump into it with the brush handle.</li>
            <li> I love shany cosmetics... I trust them... Ill buy my make up with them instead of Mac or other make up..</li>
            <li> I received this brush set as a gift from my son for Christmas, and I just love it.  The eyeshadow brushes hold so much shadow and applies so smoothly with almost no powder particles falling on your face!  Each brush has a different purpose and they all work true to the descriptions in the pamphlet.  The blush brush is great, too.  They all are. I can&#x27;t believe how much better my makeup looks after using these brushes!  They are worth much more than the price charged.  Buy them, you will love them!  I gave four stars only because I received 2 duplicate brushes, so was missing one of the set.  Other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li> I got my brushes a couple of days ago and I love them. Since red is my favorite color even better.  I would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes with nice diversity in soft to firm.</li>
            <li> excelente todo me llego en tiempo y condiciones esperadas extraordinario servicio sigan asi honestidad, responsabilidad y buen servicio lo mejor de lo mejor</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are very soft, ive had them for almost a month and they still work really good, none of the little hairs have fallen off either. Good quality</li>
            <li> Este set completo de Brush permite obtener un acabado casi perfecto de los maquillajes, si eres o no profesional aprendes igual a usarlos</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister and she loved it. She loves the options that this set gives and she uses it with other Shany products of the same top notch quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these a little over a yr ago. They&#x27;ve held up pretty nicely. The brush itself is a little bit rough. Like, I thought the brushes were going to have soft bristles, but it was the other kind. Other than that, they get the job done and last. (:</li>
            <li> I got the 24 piece goat and badger brush sets.The brushes are so soft and of great quality.Best brushes Ive ever have in awhile.</li>
            <li> I love it, I use it almost every day the tools are really handy and super stylish. The pouch it comes in is wicked cute too</li>
            <li> This is my first cosmetic brush set and I have to say, it is more than I expected and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. I was looking for something inexpensive and good enough to get the job done but I couldn&#x27;t find anything in stores that even came close to this deal. When I ordered this product, I was a little worried since I mainly read the bad feedback more than the good ones and there were stories about it smelling, or falling apart, or having a weird powder on the brushes. I didn&#x27;t get any of that. Everything came in one piece and with no smell...except the plastic of the red bag but its nothing extreme. So yeah, I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a good set of brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li> The set is pretty and I have not used all of the brushes yet, but from what I have used, I have found to be very nice.  I would recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money that I paid for these brushes I was expecting far more quality than what I actually received. The brissles were frayed and shedding. They make a total mess when trying to apply powered makeup. I totally wasted almost $75 on this product. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Ok I am not sure why so many people think these are great brushes.  Comparing them to brushes you buy in a drug store yes they are better but comparing them to anything you buy at Sephora they are horrible.  I like make up brands like urban decay, tarte, benefit, these brushes are very thin and do not work well for me.  From the other reviews it seemed they were great quality brushes but any brush I have gotten with a product is much much better.  I will have to suck it up and pay for what I want. Better quality.</li>
            <li> Decent set of beginners brushes or brushes for traveling. The case they come in is nice and the brushes are sturdy.</li>
            <li> this product is working very well, I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;m just still in the process using it, so I&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Very soft and attractive. They glide everything on perfectly. Definitely purchasing another set with more brushes. Love all of shany products</li>
            <li> It is priced right with high quality, best deal on the market. I use the big brush mostly, maybe it can be repackaged with 6-Pieces.</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I did not have the money or was not willing to spend the money to invest in expensive makeup brushes. I used the sponge-tip applicators that came with eye shadow to apply it and owned a VERY cheap, small set of blush/eye/lip brushes that I used for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last few years, I got back into makeup as a hobby and decided to get some new brushes. I thought the price of this collection of SHANY Professional brushes was super reasonable for all you get. Not only do you get 12 brushes, but you get a pouch that can store/carry them in. The pouch has individual pockets for each brush and each brush comes with a protective sleeve. The smaller ones have a long flimsy cellophane-type sleeve but the bigger brushes have have a heavier plastic protector for the brush tip that could be used to reshape the brush after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Detail shadow brush&lt;br /&gt;2.  Lip gloss brush&lt;br /&gt;3.  Angled eye liner brush&lt;br /&gt;4.  Small shadow brush&lt;br /&gt;5.  Extra-large shadow brush&lt;br /&gt;6.  Face powder brush&lt;br /&gt;7.  Fan brush&lt;br /&gt;8.  Blush brush&lt;br /&gt;9  Large shadow brush&lt;br /&gt;10. Smudging sponge (sponge-tip shadow applicator/blender)&lt;br /&gt;11. Lash/Brow brush&lt;br /&gt;12. Eye liner brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit surprised at the exclusion of a contour brush and a lip liner brush. Both the #3 and #12 liner brushes specify (in the description) that they are intended for eyes and nothing in the description addressed contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite and most-used of this set are 4, 5, 9 an 10. I use the 5 or 9 to blend all my eye shadow together to soften down the darker crease color for daytime and blend the colors together. I use 10 as a shadow applicator not as a smudging tool. I stopped using 6 and 8 due to the hair dropping (see more on this below). I now use RealTechniques brushes (the Expert Face Brush and the Stippling Brush) for powder and blush and have yet to see either drop a single hair. There are some brushes, like 3, 11 and 12, that I have never used because I don&#x27;t use liquid eye liner, already had a brow brush I liked better, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the pamphlet in the box, these brushes are made of goat and badger hair. They are quite soft. Most of the brush tips are medium to chestnut brown. The handles are a pretty Chinese lacquer-type red and the ferrules are glossy black. The brushes are not labelled with their name (i.e., \\&quot;Blush brush\\&quot;) but are labelled with a number, so as long as you keep the enclosed pamphlet, you&#x27;ll be able to keep straight which brush is for what use. Note that there are multiple sets of these SHANY brushes. This set has brown hair brushes and comes in a red pouch. There is another set that comes in a purple pouch and has, I believe, black hair brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality-wise, it is a mixed bag. I have yet to see the ferrule of one of these brushes come apart from the handle, which is something I saw happen with my older cheap brush set. On the other hand, while I have not noticed the eye brushes dropping hairs much, I have seen a LOT of dropped hairs from the larger (blush and powder) brushes. I was regularly finding hairs on my face. As noted above, I stopped using the blush and powder brushes of this set because of the frequency of dropped hairs and now use RealTechniques brushes for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch these brushes come in is red and the material used (some sort of plastic) feels very cheap. It is bulky enough (even without the brushes in it) that I can&#x27;t imagine ever using it to travel with because I have no need to carry that many brushes with me, but some may find it very useful for travel/storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a fine starter kit (and a nice present) for a young lady just starting out wearing makeup or newly out on her own. It would also be a nice kit for someone of any age who did not have the money (or want to spend the money) on the more expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, if I had known about RealTechniques brushes BEFORE ordering this SHANY Professional set, I probably would not have purchased this set. I find the RealTechniques brushes to be of higher quality (but still reasonably priced) and, unlike these SHANY brushes which are made of animal hair, RT brushes are cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.0 stars for the bargain price given the size of the collection.&lt;br /&gt;3.25 stars for the quality of the brushes (hair dropping, animal hair).&lt;br /&gt;2.5 stars for the quality of the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Average: 3 1/4 starsechniques brushes BEFORE ordering this SHANY Professional set, I probably would not have purchased this set.

            <li> My daughter is very happy with this set of brushes.  They are very nice and work beautifully.</li>
            <li> The brushes work wonderfully, the hair brush hair started to fall out when I cleaned them, so be careful. Other than that good. loved the bag it came in.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are a good value and decent brushes. Mine have no smell to them at all. They are very soft but I feel like they are a little to soft. I would prefer a firmer brush just for more precision when applying makeup. Also, on the blush and foundation brushes the bristles fall out quite easily. The eyeshadow brushes are pretty good, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. So if you want a decent set of starter brushes I would go for these.</li>
            <li> They are a nice set of brushes.  I only used two so far, the blush brush and they eye shadow brush...one of them, anyway.  I will have to read up on what to use with what....I am not that good at knowing what to use each brush for but, I like having them.  I love shopping on Amazon, too, so it was worth it and the price was right.  Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes. I ordered the red colored set. I have used them for months now. I was concerned that they would come with a weird smell like some people had reported having. There was no bad smell from my brushes and I ran my finger through the bristles and did not see any powder or dust. Also the bristles have stayed pretty well intact after being used. I took off a star from my review because I received two of the same brushes (#12) and did not receive the highlighter brush. I am still new to using make-up brushes and bought this set to try them out. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes! All labeled and came with a description sheet as well. Exactly what I was expecting. :) Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually returned this Shany set because there are so many brushes and I only use two (one for cream/liquid foundation and one for powder). I use cream blusher and gel eyeshadow, neither of which requires a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do need additional brushes, I would recommend this set. Shany has a great reputation and this is real value for the money.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest when I say that I don&#x27;t use them all, however the ones I do use are well made, and very functional. Also the case that it came with is wonderful for helping keep them organized. They showed up on time and I feel like the price is extreamly fair.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes were made a little cheap, but i got a few good ones out of it. for the money it was an ok purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush set if you are in a bind or if purchasing makeup brushes for first time.  Very soft and easy to use as well as wasy to clean!</li>
            <li> There was a strong (not necessarily bad) smell when I opened it. The case is pretty cute, and the brushes are very soft, but during washing them and just after 1 use it&#x27;s shedding :(. I also WISH that it came with a foundation brush. I think the 3 most important brushes in this set are the blush brush, the powder brush and the fan brush. The only thing missing is a foundation brush and I&#x27;d be set. I tried to use the power brush for my foundation but it is wayyyy too flimsy for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not that bad. Not that great either. 10/10 on presentation, 7/10 on product</li>
            <li> Great for the price... I&#x27;ve havent used all the brushes yet but the eye brushes work well. The case is nice for keeping the brushes neat and the color is cute.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes when I first became interested in Make up, when they came they smell awful like melted chemical plastic. the brushes do shed as well, but not too badly. For the price you cannot beat it and it is a great starter set, I have moved up to more high end brushes but I have no children or other strong responsibilities, I know not everyone wants to spend 30$ on a face brush, so for the price I would say they are very nice brushes and will do the trick. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets, this set had so much more.  Brushes with angles, great sizes, you will be pleased how these brushes can create a beauty.  IMHO.</li>
            <li> Really really good brushes don&#x27;t Shed at all l love it I use everyone of the brushes everyday and they seem brand new everyday I use them perfect for any makeup artist</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price! They do have a funny smell when first opened, but I always wash my brushes before I use them anyway. Great value!</li>
            <li> My first brush set: no major brand name or exorbitant price but I still own it today. Its my primary set. The bristles havent started shedding. They&#x27;re soft enough to blend and stiff enough to shade. I&#x27;m not initmidated by any expensive brush company with my Shany brush set.</li>
            <li> This is great product. I research and compare pricing before I make a purchase. Since I purchased this item I have enjoyed the use and the price was exceptional.</li>
            <li> Great!  Every size you&#x27;d want plus  the case!! Great for traveling!</li>
            <li> For the price it isn&#x27;t bad. I was expecting better quality and to say what to use each brush for on the brush. But it&#x27;s not bad for 13 brushes $ price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are decent quality, you get a large variety in this set and it&#x27;s incredibly priced for what you receive.  I did notice a faint plastic smell, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  I took the brushes from the pouch and stacked them brush side up in a pencil holder cup and there is no lingering smell.  Considering the distance they were shipped, they arrived incredibly fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want truly professional quality brushes, you&#x27;ll need to pay for them.  If you want good, everyday make-up brushes that won&#x27;t break the bank, then I recommend this set.</li>
            <li> The best brushes ever at a great price. I can buy one brush at Sephora for the same quality and price for this whole set. I love it. Recommend it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. The bristles are hard and don&#x27;t pick up powder. And the bristles also fall out. After a few uses some of my brushes broke. Very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes.No lose fibers.</li>
            <li> I got it as a &amp;#34;Today&#x27;s Deals&amp;#34; deal a few weeks ago. I love these brushes and the little holder they come with. It saves a lot of space to store them like that and the bag is stylish . (I have the red) Be warned though, the red is a fairly obnoxious shade of red that definitely is not for everyone. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;stripper red&amp;#34; I guess... thats the best way to describe it. But the brushes are good quality (so far) and I would purchase this set again overall. Saves a lot of money</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush set for people setting their stride in cosmetics. The brushes start to fall apart pretty soon, having this kit for less than a year I lost half of my brushes because the glue would dissipate and then I would just be left with a wooden handle and the bristles separate. But my eyeshadow brushes are still at it over three years later. So I would say it is worth the investment if you don&#x27;t have any make up brushes of your own and a budget.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Shany professional 13 piece cosmetic brushes. The product is as described. I am extremely thrilled at the quality of the product and at a great price. Shipment was lightning fast. I will purchase Shany products and recommend you do too.</li>
            <li> i like this product it is  a good one .[[ASIN:B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch, Set of 12 Brushes and 1 Pouch, Red]]</li>
            <li> Shany deliverd big time with this set of brushes ,specially designed for the make up artist ,the soft feel is amazing , the bag is sleek and great for girls ,and the quality is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen for the price !</li>
            <li> Perfect set of professional brushes for all your application needs!  Superb quality and I love the pouch they come in!  Shany is the best!</li>
            <li> This is a great little starter for a person that needs brushes for personal use.  It does not tell you how to use each brush, but there are youtube tutorials for that.  The foundation brush is a little on the smaller side than what I&#x27;m used to. The package is cute, however it smelled very strongly when I opened it....sort of like new paint or nail polish, I had to wait a few days before I could stand to use them.  Overall a good value.</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice and soft, and the travel case came in very handy for my recent business trip. the cost was unbeatable and the service was quick and efficient. No complaints what so ever!</li>
            <li> I gave them away for a gift - so, have not comment.</li>
            <li> I definitely highly recommend this product to have a great makeup job. These brushes make your makeup make you look beautiful and are of very good quality. I invite you to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time applying my make-up...should I use make up sponges, q-tips, my fingertips??? But this brush set has helped me immensely with that problem! There is a brush for my every possible make up need! These are very professional, well made brushes. These come in an adorable red pouch and they do what they are supposed to do exceptionally well. For the price, they are quite a steal! My 15 year old daughter spotted my set and demanded I order her one too. Of course, I did. Anyway, I would highly recommend this brush set to anyone who needs one! :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I wanted! They are inexpensive but have all the different brushes I wanted. I will be buying from this company again!</li>
            <li> This set looks amazing and for 25 bucks you can&#x27;t beat that. I&#x27;m very new into the \\&quot;makeup brush\\&quot; scene so I still don&#x27;t exactly know which brush is used for what but this looks like a great starter set for a wonderful price. Would definitely use every day!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes! They are soft and not corse like some brushes sold at stores. I love the variety and the price amazon sells it for. I received this as a gift purchased from my Wish List and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> very soft brushes! love them! highly recommend them and the bristles don&#x27;t fall off</li>
            <li> These Brushes were ok, noting to jump up and down about. Very Basic amd i wich i could have just found some here locally to buy. They were OK, not Great!</li>
            <li> When searching for a brush set on Amazon, I came across this product. The first thing I would like to say is that it came in the time it said it would with no damage at all.(: Now however after buying this product (before it came) I went searching on youtube for reviews about it. I must say all the reviews are directed in a negative way. I agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When it came the case that holds it smells horrible like plastic&lt;br /&gt;2. IT DOES NOT COME WITH 13 BRUSHES. the 13th piece is the case. (I found that inconvenient)&lt;br /&gt;3. They do not give you a choice when choosing what color you want your case.&lt;br /&gt;4. The brushes stink a little. You would want to wash them right? NO. They WILL loose their shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think you got what you payed for.&lt;br /&gt;I would not reccomend this to anybody though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> These are the softest, best, most amazing brushes I have ever owned! I bought them on Amazon while they were on sale for $12.99 which was an incredible steal! I would compare these brushes to much much much more expensive sets! They quality is stunning and it came very quickly in a red leather case! The difference it makes with my makeup is huge. I apply less makeup than before but it makes it look like just as much coverage to hide all the imperfections. Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> 털의 부드러움이 좀 없어 보인다고 해야하나요? 생각보다 좀 허접해 보여요.&lt;br /&gt;사람들이 보고도 구매하고 싶다고 못느끼는 것 보니까 문제가 있죠?&lt;br /&gt;그래서 안쓰는 중;</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when I saw this set of brushes at the price they were sold at - for a natural/synthetic hair brush product I expect to be paying a bit more. Instead, my order came as expected, with the pouch color I wanted (even though there isn&#x27;t an opportunity available to choose the pouch color), faster than the expected delivery date, with a high quality product at a reasonable price. The hairs don&#x27;t separate and allow for an even application of makeup, depending on the brush used.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice about this is the price, all these tools that make any amateur seem like their own makeup professional.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for quite a while now, and i can&#x27;t find one negative thing to say about them. There is no shedding and the ferrels have held up for about 6 months now. And i love the red color of the handels and the case. It says that you recieve a random color, but it is most likely red. The brushes are very soft, and they pick up any product really well. I find that the fan brush works well with mineral blush. Over all, this is an amazing brush set that lasts, and has a great price. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> these were given as a gift to a friend she absolutely loved them.  i willl purchase again a set for me</li>
            <li> I am brand new to the brush experience, however these seem to be pretty good.  Makeup application goes on smooth.  I will leave off a star because some bristles have come out after the first use.  Other than that, they clean well and are a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Bought them over a year ago, and til&#x27; this day I continue to use these brushes, I&#x27;ve added to my collection of course, they&#x27;re not MAC brushes, but they hold up pretty well and do their job for their price!</li>
            <li> Me encantó. Era exactamente lo que estaba buscando. Tienen una textura suave, aunque apenas se abre la caja hay un olor a químicos un poco fuerte.</li>
            <li> My daughter used them and stated that she liked them but didn&#x27;t notice much difference in them and other brushes she has used in the past.</li>
            <li> Loved it...same as shown on the site..Thanks</li>
            <li> Great brushes, would recommend them to anyone, fast delivery, a brush for everything, real hair brushes so they&#x27;re washable, great pouch to keep them all in one place</li>
            <li> I got my order before the stated due date. It is new as expected and worth the price. I love the red pouch it comes in. Great service!</li>
            <li> great product! great bag that comes with... my only issue... im not a pro and there are a variety of them..... i dont know which brush is what because there not in same order as really small packet thing that i could hardly read... would be nice to know what bruah is what</li>
            <li> For the price, this was a good set.  Overall I am happy.  For the price that I paid, I should have bought two but still cheaper that going to the local beauty and makeup store</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. Comes in nice red bag. Great price for what you get. Quality seems great as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE!!  Brushes are made very well and easy to use and comes with a pouch too.  Will be purchasing more as gifts.</li>
            <li> It is a good set for beginners. the brushes work well, but it smells weird even after washing the brushes..</li>
            <li> Theses brushes look great and appear to be above-average quality.  They are a cheery red color with contrasting black bristles.  The bristles are effective in applying makeup evenly and clean easily with soap and water or brush cleanser.  The case/pouch for storage is another story.  It is made of thin, black plastic held together by very poor stitching.  I have had products arrive in disposable packing of better quality.  Instead of storing the brushes in the provided case, I filled a small glass container with black aquarium stones and pushed the handles of the brushes in the stone.  Not only does this look awesome on my makeup table, my brushes stay clean and dry.  No need for that plastic case!  Without the case, I would rate the brushes five stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes over a year ago and they are still in fantastic condition. They do the job very well. Will definitely continue to buy from this company.</li>
            <li> make sure to condition them before prior use because they do have an odd smell. work great and shed very little</li>
            <li> I love my Shany Professional 13 piece cosmetic brush set. They are great to apply make-up and cost keeps less than make-up brushes in stores. However I did get 2 of the one brush so I did not get all 12 different brushes, however If I knew this I would still perchance this product because of the quality of these brushes and It also comes with a red make-up brush bag.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by this brush set. I love my Shany Neutral Eye Palette and I thought the brushes would be a perfect companion, and I received this set as a gift when I requested Shany brushes. They appeared to work well at first, but I started to wonder if the eye palette just wasn&#x27;t good quality. I checked reviews on the palette that gushed about the pigmentation and began to get confused as to why I wasn&#x27;t getting the same results when I did my makeup. On a hunch, I grabbed one of my ultra-cheap synthetic brushes and used that instead. Wow--the palette was great! The issue was these brushes! I have to use a LOT of eyeshadow to get ANY pigment on my eyes whatsoever because the fibers soak up all of the color. On top of that, the brushes shed all over my face, even though I have barely cleaned them. The shedding is getting worse, instead of better, and I have stopped using most. The eyeshadow brushes have lost their shape, even though I take extremely good care of my products, and at least one face brush has come loose in the handle and knocks about when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just so disappointing--I had such high hopes for this brush set, and it not only doesn&#x27;t work well, the quality appears to be less than stellar. I feel bad saying it, since I absolutely love the palette, but the brushes aren&#x27;t good at all. I have waited several months to post this review, hoping that my first impressions of the set being nice would eventually come true, but the set just keeps degrading, and I have to advise against getting this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I am knew with applying makeup.  The ordered came very quickly and the brush bristles are soft.  I have no complaints. Good purchase for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leather case will lose the rubber scent in a matter of a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> is perfect for the amateurs</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves the softness of the brushes and uses them daily. She was surprised when she received them, but love them.</li>
            <li> Great quality, I use them every day! I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for makeup brushes !!</li>
            <li> These are nice and came in the right amount of time and in condition promised.  I don&#x27;t use all the brushes but the one I use the mose is the big brush for blush.  The reason for four stars instead of five is that some of the bristles shed which is why I wanted a different set in the first place.  For the price they work but if you want non-shedders you should probably spend more money on a nicer set.</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes but they don&#x27;t look professional. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I am not saying that is a bad product but I would prefer to buy something with more quality.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes a lot... Theyre so soft!! But the red case it comes in sucks! Its such poor quality! I dont know howbut a part of the red case got stuck/melted in one of my cabinets. Weird.</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup brushes Ive ever use! I love the long handles. Makes them easy to use and easy to find&gt; Now I want more.</li>
            <li> A large selection at a great price. The brushes are nice and have all sizes you might need for different makeup applications.</li>
            <li> This is a weird assortment of brushes.  I bought them because I was just getting into make up and didn&#x27;t know what I needed.  Turns out I don&#x27;t need ANY of these.  They shed terribly and don&#x27;t hold or apply product well.  I recommend buying 5 better quality brushes rather than wasting your money on this set.</li>
            <li> Great brushed especially for the price</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get a set of make up brushes. I am so glad I waited to get these! They are excellent and I love the case that they came with!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, soft brush tips. I don&#x27;t like the red color, make them look cheap, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> very soft, and bright colors, purchased them for my mom and am going to buy some for myself now, for sure.</li>
            <li> I have used these brushes once and immediately the hairs starting falling out! They get everywhere! In my eyes and it is really annoying! I would like a refund for these below basic brushes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right number of brushes for my purposes. I appreciate the variety, the handy pouch, and I love the colour. They arrived in good time, and are exactly as advertised. I would definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality item. I would buy more items from the brand. The storage pack it comes in is cute and the brushes are labeled so you know what to use them for.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great buy! They are exactly as described and affordable. I love the case they came in and even a guide as to what brush is used for what part of the face. Would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I chose this set of brushes because it has a lot of sizes and love the red color. Comes in a nice case looks professional . If you want a nice set of brushes I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> definitely a well deserved investment. the smaller brushed are better than the two blush/powder brushes. the lack of texture in the bristles is more obvious in the two big ones than the smaller ones. for what you pay it is a good set but if you are looking for an above average set of brushes this wouldn&#x27;t be it.</li>
            <li> ive had  this item for several weeks now. i first loved this, however now the bristles are coming out. which is disapointing</li>
