    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They work wonderfully to comb out mascara clumps and lengthen your lashes.  </li>
            <li>Good thing I ordered 6!</li>
            <li>I was delighted!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with prompt shipping and love the product!</li>
            <li>This is a great eyelash brush.  </li>
            <li>But, I must say Amazon was great about taking care of any problems</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this item.  </li>
            <li>So happy ti be able to get these.  </li>
            <li>The tines are fairly pointy, unlike the somewhat rounded tines on most plastic eyebrow/eyelash comb combos, so it does a good job of separating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li>YAY i am so glad to find them again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After losing one, I could not find it in stores and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i have used these for 20 years and was thrilled to find them online again after running out of them over a year ago.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love this when I&#x27;m not wearing lashesI use this to separate my lasshes before and after mascara.</li>
            <li>these are so much better than the combs you find at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than the brush for eyelash extensions</li>
            <li>I needed a new one and could not find them in stores and was so happy to find them here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The teeth are very flexible plastic, so not as good for getting through the mascara and lashes as a sturdier tooth is.  </li>
            <li>They are fine toothed and do the job, which the fatter tined ones and metal ones cannot do.</li>
            <li>It is like a fine comb for your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Then it works fine, but it may take a day or so before you can stop messing with it.</li>
            <li>The teeth are flexible and clean easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used a similar comb for years and couldn&#x27;t find that brand again, so I was so happy to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>, I AM SO EXCITED TO HAVE FOUND THESE AND IN BULK PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>Works much better than a metal comb and does not hurt so much when you accidentally stick it in your eye!</li>
            <li>and I am now using them to clean</li>
            <li>The only lash comb I&#x27;ve ever seen that is safe and effective without removing mascara as you use it if you use just the outer edge prong.</li>
            <li>Great for anyone that wants a natural lash look</li>
            <li>They are also pointy enough to do a really good job getting clumps out.  </li>
            <li>Gotta be some manufacturing glitch--maybe they package them before they are cool or something.</li>
            <li>I have used this plastic eyelash comb for many years and prefer the comfort and relative safety of its plastic tines verses the many metal ones</li>
            <li>I had a very similar comb for many many years.  </li>
            <li>Some of the teeth will break eventually, but they last a good amount of time, so just toss it and start with a fresh one.</li>
            <li>The comb is great though--much better than the comb/brush combinations that are easy to find, and probably safer than the metal ones, although these combs are sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li>The six pack is well worth th price.</li>
            <li>It would have been a good deal if it really was six, but instead it was a total rip off!</li>
            <li>And worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is much safer!  </li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t need six of them as my original one had lasted so long, but I ordered these anyway figuring I would have enough for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THEY DELIVERED REALLY FAST AND WILL ORDER FROM THIS SUPPLIER AGAIN.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the cover is not made properly to fit over the brush.  </li>
            <li>I did keep the second box because I have my original brush that I purchased years ago and that cover fits over the new bristles.</li>
            <li>I have not found them in stores in years and was in dire need of new ones, so now I have SIX!  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without this comb!</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was happy to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To make it easier to find, since it is small and dark, put a bright sticker or colored duct/electricians tape on both sides or tape a piece of colored paper to both sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>comb itself seemed just like my old one.  </li>
            <li>For a small delicate area like that they work great.</li>
            <li>The only issue is with the cover; it&#x27;s way too tight to fit over the comb.</li>
            <li>I sent my first order back but the second box had the same problem.  </li>
            <li>These are very small and will fit in any handbag no matter the size.  </li>
            <li>I love them and have a hard time finding them from other places.</li>

            <li> I really didn&#x27;t need 6, but I had a hard time finding this item in stores, so it was convenient to just get the set.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are no longer available in stores here.  </li>
            <li> When you try to force the comb into the partially closed slot, it make several tines of the comb push out of line.  </li>
            <li> did as someone suggested and put an object into the partially closed slot overnight trying to keep it open and stop it from closing all the time.  </li>
            <li> The cover/holder for the comb is so tight, some of the teeth do not align with the opening and get bent and/or left outside the holder.  </li>
            <li> I only know one other person that has heard of these, so when I found them on Amazon</li>
            <li> To fix, put a toothpick (the round, pointy tip ones, or something of a similar girth) in one end of the cap and slide it to the other end then slide it to the middle and leave it in over night.</li>
            <li> FIX FOR CLOSED COVERS:</li>
            <li> I am extremely unsatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have mentioned, the lid is fused shut.</li>
            <li> I previously used safety pins to separate my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product previously.  </li>
            <li> The tines are thin enough to comb through the lashes.</li>
            <li> The incredibly small size and the dark color makes them difficult to find in your bag unless you always put it in the same pocket or tuck it in a makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> All 6 of the covers I received were closed in the middle making it impossible to place the cover over the tines.</li>
            <li> However, as mentioned by others, the cover is so poorly made it literally ruins the teeth of the comb.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick eyelashes</li>
            <li> Other lash combs are metal and too thick, some have pointed tips and when your as blind as I am without glasses on {certinly you can&#x27;t comb your lashes with glasses on}, it hurts alot when you stick yourself in the eye with those metal tines.</li>
            <li> It is then totally impossible to put the comb back into the holder as the tines are all catty whampus and sticking out in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was not successful in doing so.  </li>
            <li> Not a happy customer with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The teeth do a lousy job of separating the lashes.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to close and some of the teeth are bent.</li>
            <li> When you take the comb out of the cover/holder, the two side of the plastic immediately pushed together making it impossible to return the comb to the slot in the holder.  </li>
            <li> and I received one! :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> These are very small and will fit in any handbag no matter the size.  The incredibly small size and the dark color makes them difficult to find in your bag unless you always put it in the same pocket or tuck it in a makeup bag.  You don&#x27;t want to have to be fishing for this in a big purse, you&#x27;ll never find it!  The teeth are very flexible plastic, so not as good for getting through the mascara and lashes as a sturdier tooth is.  Final decision was that I am not going to use these for myself.  A different use came to mind and I am now using them to clean/comb the fur under my Persian kitties eye.  For a small delicate area like that they work great.</li>
            <li> I have used this plastic eyelash comb for many years and prefer the comfort and relative safety of its plastic tines verses the many metal ones available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capped, it is 1.25\\&quot; x 1.25\\&quot; and about the thickness of a stick of gum. The tines are fairly pointy, unlike the somewhat rounded tines on most plastic eyebrow/eyelash comb combos, so it does a good job of separating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASY FIX FOR CLOSED COVERS: All 6 of the covers I received were closed in the middle making it impossible to place the cover over the tines. To fix, put a toothpick (the round, pointy tip ones, or something of a similar girth) in one end of the cap and slide it to the other end then slide it to the middle and leave it in over night. This fixes the problem permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it easier to find, since it is small and dark, put a bright sticker or colored duct/electricians tape on both sides or tape a piece of colored paper to both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing one, I could not find it in stores and was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I don&#x27;t need 6 but I don&#x27;t care - that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li> OMG I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR MONTHS, I AM SO EXCITED TO HAVE FOUND THESE AND IN BULK PURCHASE. THEY DELIVERED REALLY FAST AND WILL ORDER FROM THIS SUPPLIER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set of 6 of these. I really didn&#x27;t need 6, but I had a hard time finding this item in stores, so it was convenient to just get the set. The comb works well, no complaints. The only issue is with the cover; it&#x27;s way too tight to fit over the comb. I actually ruined one of the combs trying to squeeze the cover over the teeth. Good thing I ordered 6! One of the reviewers here made a suggestion to use a toothpick to correct that problem--I&#x27;ll definitely give that a try!</li>
            <li> This is a great eyelash brush.  The only problem is that the cover is not made properly to fit over the brush.  When you try to insert the bristles the cover damages them.  I sent my first order back but the second box had the same problem.  I did keep the second box because I have my original brush that I purchased years ago and that cover fits over the new bristles. I would have given it 5 stars but I didn&#x27;t because of the defective cover.</li>
            <li> I used to find these lash combs at Ulta, but they stopped carrying them.  Needless to say, I was happy to find them on Amazon.  They work wonderfully to comb out mascara clumps and lengthen your lashes.  And they last a LONG time.  Love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to separate my eyelashes.  I cannot find these in Oklahoma.  I previously used safety pins to separate my eyelashes.  This is much safer!  Love them.</li>
            <li> So happy ti be able to get these.  They are fine toothed and do the job, which the fatter tined ones and metal ones cannot do.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 9 years ago.  Unfortunately they are no longer available in stores here.  I tried all kinds of different things to keep my lashes from being stuck together.The tines are thin enough to comb through the lashes. Other lash combs are metal and too thick, some have pointed tips and when your as blind as I am without glasses on {certinly you can&#x27;t comb your lashes with glasses on}, it hurts alot when you stick yourself in the eye with those metal tines. I would recommend these lash combs to everyone! I never thought I&#x27;d find them again. The six pack is well worth th price.</li>
            <li> I had a very similar comb for many many years.  I needed a new one and could not find them in stores and was so happy to find them here on Amazon.  I sure didn&#x27;t need six of them as my original one had lasted so long, but I ordered these anyway figuring I would have enough for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb itself seemed just like my old one.  However, as mentioned by others, the cover is so poorly made it literally ruins the teeth of the comb.  When you take the comb out of the cover/holder, the two side of the plastic immediately pushed together making it impossible to return the comb to the slot in the holder.  When you try to force the comb into the partially closed slot, it make several tines of the comb push out of line.  It is then totally impossible to put the comb back into the holder as the tines are all catty whampus and sticking out in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did as someone suggested and put an object into the partially closed slot overnight trying to keep it open and stop it from closing all the time.  I was not successful in doing so.  I have ruined three of the six combs trying to figure out how to put them back into the holders.  I finally gave up and ordered a more expensive eyelash comb that is made of metal and folds to store to avoid the problems with this item.</li>
            <li> Not recommended.  This product does not work well.  The comb is quite flimsy which means it does not do the job advertised.</li>
            <li> I received a pack of six. Enough to last about 10-15 years for me. I love them and have a hard time finding them from other places. I haven&#x27;t seen one in a store in forever.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Very difficult to close and some of the teeth are bent. Also it was advertised as a package of 6 in realty it was only one. But, I must say Amazon was great about taking care of any problems</li>
            <li> The ad says you get a pack of six and I received one! :( Not a happy customer with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The only lash comb I&#x27;ve ever seen that is safe and effective without removing mascara as you use it if you use just the outer edge prong. I&#x27;ve used these for about 17 years, and now our teenage daughters use them, too, and my sisters.</li>
            <li> I only know one other person that has heard of these, so when I found them on Amazon I was delighted!  I have not found them in stores in years and was in dire need of new ones, so now I have SIX!  Great for anyone that wants a natural lash look--gets the clumps out and keeps lashes looking &amp;#34;tidy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this when I&#x27;m not wearing lashesI use this to separate my lasshes before and after mascara.</li>
            <li> If you have thick eyelashes these are so much better than the combs you find at the drug store.  The teeth are flexible and clean easily.  They are also pointy enough to do a really good job getting clumps out.  I thought I was buying one pack, I ended up buying a box.  So I have a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this item.  I have been looking every where to replace a similar one that I had. It is like a fine comb for your eyelashes.  It separates any clumps of mascara leaving your eyelashes looking longer and fuller.  Works much better than a metal comb and does not hurt so much when you accidentally stick it in your eye!</li>
            <li> i have used these for 20 years and was thrilled to find them online again after running out of them over a year ago. YAY i am so glad to find them again!</li>
            <li> It says that this is a pack of six, but I only received one. It would have been a good deal if it really was six, but instead it was a total rip off! I am extremely unsatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this comb! I can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore. Very happy with prompt shipping and love the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used a similar comb for years and couldn&#x27;t find that brand again, so I was so happy to find these on Amazon. Like other reviews have mentioned, the lid is fused shut. Gotta be some manufacturing glitch--maybe they package them before they are cool or something. But if you pry it open (someone mentioned a toothpick) it will stretch out. Then it works fine, but it may take a day or so before you can stop messing with it. The comb is great though--much better than the comb/brush combinations that are easy to find, and probably safer than the metal ones, although these combs are sharp so be careful. Some of the teeth will break eventually, but they last a good amount of time, so just toss it and start with a fresh one. A package of 6 will last me a couple of years!</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously.  They are much better than the brush for eyelash extensions</li>
            <li> The cover/holder for the comb is so tight, some of the teeth do not align with the opening and get bent and/or left outside the holder.  The teeth do a lousy job of separating the lashes.  I&#x27;m going to try to find the metallic Sepralash somewhere online.  IT IS THE BOMB!  And worth the money.  Don&#x27;t bother with the Ardell product.</li>
