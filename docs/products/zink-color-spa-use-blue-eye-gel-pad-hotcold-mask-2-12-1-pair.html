            <li>These hot pads work great.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li>so I can utilize these better.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you do not allow them to touch while they are being heated in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Shipping costs more then the item.</li>
            <li>Be sure and read the size of these before you buy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product so when my kids get hurt its easy to ice them.</li>
            <li>they are easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>anyways-seems fine.</li>
            <li>The item is too light weight to support eye stress or pain relief.</li>
            <li>These were cheap</li>
            <li>They work great and can be used for other aches and pains.</li>
            <li>WONDERFULLY* but not for very long as they get warm after a few (5&#x27;ish) minutes.  </li>
            <li>This item was not cold.  </li>
            <li>I slip it right into a glove to ice the area-works</li>

            <li>They do not have enough flexibility to conform to the orbital bone around the eye so they simply aren&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li>these are smaller and thinner than the picture and they came with no instructions (can they go in the freezer, how hot can the water be to heat them)  </li>
            <li>Okay, let&#x27;s wait for the past of time.</li>
            <li>defiantly something you need if you&#x27;re eyes are sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting them directly into my eye cube bowl to get them just a bit colder, but I am considering buying another pair</li>
            <li>Completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Came in a cute little package to keep them together in the freezer because they are quite little.</li>
            <li>The idea is great, but there is not enough gel inside each container and it comes out freezing, as opposed to cold like other similar quality products.  </li>

            <li> The larger gel packs can also be wrapped in a wash cloth either wet or dry and you can do both eyes or one.</li>
            <li> They will cover the eye socket but very little gel to hold any heat or cold for any period of time.&lt;br /&gt;For hot packs to be put on the eye we found that the larger 10 by 6 inch gel packs work better and hold the heat or cold much longer.</li>

            <li> If you do, they will get stuck to each other, and will tear.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> When you keep them in the freezer the plastic edges get really hard and sharp.</li>
            <li> The edges of the gel pads are extremely stiff and brittle.</li>

            <li> Way too small.  </li>
            <li> Vary small and Vary</li>
            <li> They are very thin and fragile.</li>
            <li> They are very, very small and have very little gel in them.  </li>
            <li> and I put them on my eyes in a dark room!!!</li>
            <li> Soothing when I&#x27;m in the middle of a really bad migraine.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, these are thin.  </li>
            <li> Vary thin.</li>

            <li> My allergy&#x27;s always make my eyes all puffy,They get horribly dry &amp; itchy, and after using these whenever my eyes get terrible, I use the, for at least 30 minutes. I set them on ice for a while, them wear them. It&#x27;s great. defiantly something you need if you&#x27;re eyes are sensitive.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product so when my kids get hurt its easy to ice them. I am thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li> The edges of the gel pads are extremely stiff and brittle. Not very conducive to spa-like comfort. They do not have enough flexibility to conform to the orbital bone around the eye so they simply aren&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li> My wife had face surgery. The cold reduced both swelling and pain. May be used over and over. Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, these are thin.  I&#x27;m seconding that - These are VERY thin.  They work *WONDERFULLY* but not for very long as they get warm after a few (5&#x27;ish) minutes.  I&#x27;ve been putting them directly into my eye cube bowl to get them just a bit colder, but I am considering buying another pair so I can utilize these better.</li>
            <li> These hot pads work great. They are very thin and fragile. Make sure that you do not allow them to touch while they are being heated in the microwave. If you do, they will get stuck to each other, and will tear. They work great and hold the heat nicely.</li>
            <li> This product does not have enough gel or method to use on eyes.  Shipping costs more then the item. The item is too light weight to support eye stress or pain relief.</li>
            <li> The idea is great, but there is not enough gel inside each container and it comes out freezing, as opposed to cold like other similar quality products.  I guess you get what pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> Love these!  they are easily cleaned.  I love them especially when I have a headache and they are cold and I put them on my eyes in a dark room!!!</li>
            <li> These were cheap so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but they are not comfortable on the eyes. When you keep them in the freezer the plastic edges get really hard and sharp. They won&#x27;t cut you, but they aren&#x27;t comfy to use. :(</li>
            <li> these are smaller and thinner than the picture and they came with no instructions (can they go in the freezer, how hot can the water be to heat them)  A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are great. Came in a cute little package to keep them together in the freezer because they are quite little. I actually bought this for a thumb injury since ice packs are lacking in that department. I slip it right into a glove to ice the area-works well. I vaguely remember reading these weren&#x27;t meant to be put in the freezer but I did it anyways-seems fine. They are also very relieving/refreshing on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Way too small.  Not worth the money.  Completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t work for me when I sleep.  Still in my refrigerator. My sleep mask is really all I need.  When I put the pads in they always fell out.</li>
            <li> Be sure and read the size of these before you buy.  They are very, very small and have very little gel in them.  They might work for cold packs on puffy eyes but not for heat pack on the eyes.  I should have read the size and compared it to a ruler. They will cover the eye socket but very little gel to hold any heat or cold for any period of time.&lt;br /&gt;For hot packs to be put on the eye we found that the larger 10 by 6 inch gel packs work better and hold the heat or cold much longer. The larger gel packs can also be wrapped in a wash cloth either wet or dry and you can do both eyes or one. They work great and can be used for other aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This item failed  to meet my needs.  I had eye surgery and I needed cold compresses.  This item was not cold.  I kept it in the  freezer hoping it would become cold. It never happened</li>
            <li> Vary small and Vary Vary thin.</li>
            <li> Soothing when I&#x27;m in the middle of a really bad migraine. I take meds, but when I have back-up products, it really helps.</li>
            <li> They dont stay cold long enough</li>
            <li> Awesome when frozen...</li>
            <li> It work right, is Okay, let&#x27;s wait for the past of time.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and I bought these for my clients to wear during a facial treatment since the cotton eye pads I typically put over the eyes fall off.  And these fell off too.</li>
