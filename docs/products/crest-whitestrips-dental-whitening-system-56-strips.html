    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For these reasons, I do not consider them to be the best alternative.  </li>
            <li>They are GREAT!!</li>
            <li>:D &lt;br</li>
            <li>they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>They are great!!</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips is a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>The best thing to do is read a book.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t taste very good   *</li>
            <li>Otherwise, very good.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Everyone compliments me on how beautiful my teeth look.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a week my teeth were so beautiful.</li>
            <li>i was still in great pain.</li>
            <li>and I was extremely happy with their results.</li>
            <li>But the results should make you happy.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>

            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Crest Night Effects whitening kit with great results before</li>
            <li>Very effective product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste good at all,</li>
            <li>My father never had braces and his teeth aren&#x27;t even so he can&#x27;t use them to get good results.</li>
            <li>Superior to Crest in every way.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good results.</li>
            <li>And I did get good results with these strips.</li>
            <li>They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy.</li>

            <li>They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy.</li>
            <li>I think these work good</li>
            <li>and I have nothing but good to say about them.  </li>
            <li>My concern was if they were good for my teeth</li>
            <li>Certainly a wise investment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, I am happy with this product and think that most people would be, too.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I am happy with this product and think that most people would be, too.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with my results.</li>
            <li>I love this product - I just brush my teeth put on the strips and go!</li>
            <li>and my teeth look amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a truly amazing product.</li>
            <li>After thirty minutes your saliva has probably diluted the peroxide to the extent that it is no longer effective.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste like chocolate ice cream and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a nice gum massage.</li>
            <li>but they do have a return policy which is nice.</li>
            <li>The Crest Whitestrips are your safest and best bet when searching for a better, whiter smile.</li>
            <li>and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth.</li>
            <li>and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll do 2 or 3 in one sitting (the manual says that&#x27;s as effective).  </li>
            <li>I tried using toothpastes every morning and night that promised whitening effects, but they honestly didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with the whole experience.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice they looked.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t cause tooth pain like the whitening strips seem to do.</li>
            <li>As for the application process, they where very easy to apply</li>
            <li>1- No pain, was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was worried about the pain that many people experienced while using this product.</li>
            <li>He has perfectly aligned teeth (naturally) and has never had a cavity.  </li>
            <li>At the top of the page, there is an image that displays just how effective the strips are, however,</li>
            <li>Maybe she had a great smile to begin with).</li>
            <li>It has been the best thing on the market as far as a bleaching system.</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used whitening packages/trays purchased from my dentist twice, but I am honestly just as pleased with the results from the Crest Whitestrips for whitening my teeth when they begin to look a bit stained.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a dentist or anything like it, but I guarantee that you&#x27;ll be completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I wish crest would make some sort of tray that would hold the strips against your teeth better.</li>
            <li>am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>the reason I gave it 4 stars because I like Crest premium whitennig system better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much better in an affordable whitening strip.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>A much better alternative is the dissolving whitening strips manufactured and distributed by CVS Pharmacy,</li>
            <li>I was done with the product, I still wasn&#x27;t satisfied until I started getting compliments from all sorts of people.  </li>
            <li>It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  </li>
            <li>Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a concern.  </li>
            <li>The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains.  </li>

            <li>The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains.  </li>
            <li>but you have to make sure to brush your teeth though.</li>
            <li>So I had told them about the product and now they are satisfied.</li>
            <li>So make sure have a towel on standy if you intend to use them</li>
            <li>Now when i buy this product, i only use them for 4-6 days at a time instead of the 2 weeks and its perfect!</li>
            <li>It does what it states it does best, and thats make teeth incredibly white!</li>
            <li>I guess its all a personal experience, I wish that I would have used them sooner and not let all of the reviews keep me from trying a great product!!</li>
            <li>Just save a bit, to get better results else where.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to shell out the price for these strips;</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I like these way better.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to feel self-conscious about them anymore.</li>
            <li>EVERYONE commented on how good my smile was.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, like I said, my teeth look quite a bit better, although this isn&#x27;t a substitute for brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to read all the instructions before using.     </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I also use a toothpaste (like Sensodyne) when I am whitening and this eliminates most discomfort.</li>
            <li>so I continued using it as directed for a couple more days.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it for the price of being able to smile in pics and just for the heck of it, lol.</li>
            <li>The strips were not hard to use and I received great results.  </li>
            <li>Even at work, customers tell me I have a nice smile.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use, no muss</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips are so easy to use</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips are easy and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>I experienced some tooth sensitivity a couple of times, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, unless you&#x27;re in a hurry, I think you&#x27;d be fine with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, unless you&#x27;re in a hurry, I think you&#x27;d be fine with these.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been fine since then.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use, and actually works.</li>
            <li>The strips are very easy to use and not uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li>I could tell my teeth were whiter from the very first use!  </li>
            <li>But now, I do it with no hesitation, and have a lot more ladies complimenting me on my smile.  </li>
            <li>So far so good -</li>
            <li>Overall, I am now one happy consumer with a brighter smile!</li>
            <li>The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first day, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more money, but it works much faster!</li>
            <li>These made my smile blinding!</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price--invest in yourself and your self-esteem!</li>
            <li>Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed.</li>
            <li>This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed.</li>
            <li>finally met someone (with a great smile) that used them</li>
            <li>I have always loved white strips.</li>
            <li>like most of us are i&#x27;d recommend something much stronger.</li>
            <li>This product is kinda magic and really works for me.</li>
            <li>The strips do have an acid in them which I&#x27;ve heard can eat away the teeth, but I have never heard of the whitestrips causing this, and I&#x27;m sure there would be more notice from the public if it did.</li>
            <li>And it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I quit using them and it took almost a week for me to be able to eat and drink normally again.  </li>
            <li>After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my first week of using the strips and already I&#x27;m noticing a significant difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Then my neighbor made a comment about how pretty my teeth were!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great what these little whitestrips can do for your self esteem, I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>Honestly within two days I could already see a big difference...</li>
            <li>Even my friends are asking me did I use something on my teeth, but I just smile and say, no.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive gum you better have the stamina to finish.</li>
            <li>I would definately not recommend the strips, even if this was a rare occurance.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Hardly worth it to save</li>
            <li>have used the whitening strips for 5 days worth now.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is truly worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money to whiten your teeth.     </li>
            <li>It was well worth my money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think you will get a brighter smile, but not a brighter laugh.  </li>
            <li>That alone makes it worth the price.     </li>
            <li>the first day was not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A year after my first use (teeth still looking good), I am currently using a generic brand--Equate, available from Wal-Mart for about $15, about $5 less than these--and have to say that I like Crest Whitestrips better because the strips are more flexible and easier to apply, and they stay in place better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist&#x27;s use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed.</li>

            <li>However, you&#x27;d have to stay away from coffee or get more of this stuff as you will develop yellow teeth quite quickly with coffee.  </li>
            <li>They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes.</li>
            <li>I found them easy to apply, I am totally able to speak while they are on (with a slight lisp!), and for me they were not painful at all.  </li>
            <li>Maintain a big smile so that your teeth are showing, you want to make sure that your lips don&#x27;t touch them yet.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally like my teeth to be too white, so I&#x27;m happy with the results that the strips provide.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>They do cause some  sensitivity within the first two days of use</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used my first pack</li>
            <li>I have found that by drying your teeth well, the strips won&#x27;t move the slightest bit, compared to when I first tried them and they slid around a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after a bit of reading about all of them I decided I&#x27;d give this a try first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on how white my teeth look.</li>
            <li>and they really do whiten!</li>
            <li>and they really work!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend them to everyone looking for a brighter smile</li>
            <li>at first it was tingly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don&#x27;t use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  </li>
            <li>I first used the CREST WHITESTRIPS when one of my friends had them.</li>
            <li>The first day I used them I could see that my teeth looked a couple of shades whiter.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I really knew that it was working!  </li>
            <li>They do make your teeth whiter (for me i noticed a difference after the first application).</li>
            <li>The top ones are easier, but the lower ones are very tiny and often slip off.</li>
            <li>I have found Crest Whitestrips of any version to work really well for me!</li>
            <li>I bought the Crest Whitestrips when they first came out</li>
            <li>They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since.</li>
            <li>funny-</li>
            <li>At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself.</li>
            <li>They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.</li>
            <li>They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.</li>
            <li>Immediately I start drooling so much, that I keep a bath towel under my face to collect everything!  </li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>First and foremost, these things deliver on their promise to make your teeth \\&quot;noticeably whiter\\&quot; in two weeks.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (I am sure he could tell because the back molars would be darker), I told him I used WhiteStrips</li>
            <li>and it holds them in place so they won&#x27;t slide and talk funny.</li>
            <li>guess I should have taken some pictures to be sure, but personally I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>for some people is that your teeth need to be or should be pretty straight before using these.</li>
            <li>First, this product really *</li>
            <li>One helpful hint is to have a tissue ready when you first put them on and \\&quot;dab\\</li>
            <li>I have been using these strips for the last two weeks, the first week was fine</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price (certainly cheaper than a professional whitening),</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price (certainly cheaper than a professional whitening),</li>
            <li>When beginning, they can make your teeth super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using this product if your looking for an easy, inexpensive product that offers long lasting and great results.</li>
            <li>Again, while I have had slight discomfort, it is definitely not enough to stop me from completing the process and expecting great results.</li>
            <li>I can talk perfectly fine and my family doesn&#x27;t know when I have them in or not, even on the upper teeth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The item works very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient, I can just throw one on while I&#x27;m cleaning</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to get another one and probably another one after that.</li>
            <li>I guess he drinks too much espresso.      </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until around the 5th day that we could say, \\&quot;wow\\&quot; - this stuff is really working.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>After my braces were removed i noticed that my teeth were really disclolored.  </li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>to use and really works.</li>
            <li>I put them on before going out for the evening, or in the morning before getting ready.</li>
            <li>If you REALLY want to whiten your teeth, do the whitening five days in a row.   </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t inspect them so much every day, because since the difference is gradual, you won&#x27;t notice much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;and didnt hurt much, i didnt even classify it as pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this product is for someone with already semi-white teeth who wants them to be even whiter.</li>
            <li>Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>Fast  </li>
            <li>The drooling causes the bottom strip to move around too much.  </li>
            <li>i did see results within like 3 days, but theyre too much of a hassel.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use the whole pack at once.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;-You can&#x27;t really talk, drink, eat or do anything with your mouth while they&#x27;re on your teeth-</li>
            <li>However, it is definitely not allow you to talk freely when you have the strips in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>For an over&#x3D;the-counter, inexpensive product, they really do work.</li>
            <li>Of course, it only whitens natural teeth, not dental work, but for most people, they should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a hint, do either top or bottom first (less yucky feeling)</li>
            <li>Also keep in mind that eating, drinking, and probably talking (unless you have better luck than I) are pretty much out of the question while you&#x27;re wearing these, but I simply did one application on my drive home from work and another later in the night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced only a small bit of tingling in regards to the sensitivity factor</li>
            <li>Someone told me they made their teeth sensitive for a long time, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about them.</li>
            <li>I love it, and if you&#x27;re really looking for a whiter smile use this instead of the cheaper not very good products out now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective.</li>

            <li>He didn&#x27;t even need the full 2 weeks - his teeth are quite white now.  </li>
            <li>It made due for a protective coating and significantly reduced the pain while the Creststrips were on!</li>
            <li>the Crest Whitestrips Premium are 2X stronger than the Crest Whitestrips Classic, so if your gums/teeth are sensitive I recommend getting the Classic because they really do work for me!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth/gums, so I rarely use the strips more than once a day and usually have to skip a day between applications.</li>
            <li>Both contain a more concentrated peroxide that works in less time (7 and 10 days,</li>
            <li>I went with this (14day classic) set over the premium (7-10day) set because of the milder peroxide strength and boy</li>
            <li>My only concern was that the strips, especially the top ones, are a bit short and only cover your front eight or so teeth, but for most people that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of using them only once a day until I luckily saw the note on the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think both the strips for upper teeth and lower teeth only design to cover the front 8 teeth both on the top and on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Crest White Strips are a good place to start with bleaching, and if you are not satisfied with the results, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching or other cosmetic</li>

            <li>Gave really high reviews about them.  </li>
            <li>(that I&#x27;ve specially designated for this) to gently scrub my teeth, then carefully put them on.  </li>
            <li>leave your gums and teeth a bit sensitive if you apply to strips too much on the gums.</li>
            <li>If you complete a whole box you will see a difference.  </li>
            <li>, I can talk almost normally</li>
            <li>However, after a few more days i couldn&#x27;t stand the pain in my teeth, i couldnt eat or drink</li>
            <li>You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  </li>
            <li>You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  </li>
            <li>and i could carry on with my day as normal with them on.</li>
            <li>I should have saved up my money and got my moneys worth, I&#x27;d advise you do the same.</li>
            <li>Every few minutes I check with my fingernail to make sure the bottom strip is still against my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Good product but have to use with caution as this could be a problem for people with broken tooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many different degrees of staining/yellowness, but for mild discoloration from tea/coffee, I would definitely give these a try before an expensive trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>They just caught the sun better with those little bits of clear plastic stuck in between them.</li>
            <li>You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  </li>
            <li>I went to a new dentist and he said \\&quot;Have your whitened your teetH?\\</li>
            <li>Anyhow, we bought the classic strips because of the lower level of peroxide - he is sensitive to stronger amounts (it makes his gums hurt).  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much of a difference, but I noticed it after the 2nd time.</li>
            <li>Inc.  These strips are less flimsy/ more firm and therefore don&#x27;t stick onto themselves, they adhere to your teeth far better; AND they dissolve completely in about 5-7 minutes, leaving no messy residue or plastic film to have to discard.  </li>
            <li>This has the same effect that leading teeth whiteners do...except all the fuss - no dentist visit, no brutally expensive costs.</li>
            <li>I first used this item about 7 months ago, and my teeth are still white!  </li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;m using Crest Whitestrips (i have about 4 days left), and I love how white they&#x27;ve left my teeth.</li>
            <li>so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first.</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first.</li>
            <li>2 years after I used them the first time I was still getting compliments on my white teeth.</li>
            <li>and they really do whiten!for extra whitening], as opposed to the 14 of this Classic version) but are more expensive and--based on their reviews--seem to cause more problems with sensitivity and such.</li>
            <li>The Crest Whitestrips Classic work very well, Whithin 5 days of regular usage (2 30-minute sessions/day)</li>
            <li>I really recommend the CLASSIC Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li>Every time I go out complete strangers will tell me &amp;quot;You have such pretty teeth&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth at all but within the first use of this product I was starting to have pain in my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place.</li>
            <li>It is true what other say about the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I have been using the whitening strips for six days now and have shown clear signs of whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These whitening strips clearly work and are inexpensive compared to others.</li>
            <li>But if you can&#x27;t I suggest steering clear of these.</li>
            <li>The strips are coated with a clear gel that is whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li>however I didn&#x27;t use completely as directed.</li>
            <li>I now have white teeth that really shows.</li>
            <li>They were polite and apologetic giving me a complete monetary refund.  </li>
            <li>If this is you, using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth may help.</li>
            <li>When I saw they had them for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>not obvious from 3 feet away but looking really close</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they really work, they have a satisfactory guarantee, or your money back.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see results after just one use.</li>
            <li>It probably has to do with the direct contact of your saliva with the whitening gel.</li>
            <li>They made my teeth sensitive     </li>
            <li>, it can make your teeth sensitive and irritate your gums.  </li>
            <li>The Crest White Strips have worked really well for me</li>
            <li>(I didnt want to accidentally do irreperable damage to my enamel) but a conversation with my dentist solved that completely.   </li>
            <li>I was alway self conscious about it before.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to keep your teeth staying white.    </li>
            <li>However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist</li>
            <li>However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist</li>
            <li>When you smile wide, you can see a color variation between where the strips reach and do not.</li>
            <li>Even with the classic set, I was getting sensitive teeth (especially the tops of the bits of the molars that get covered by the strips).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also worth noting there are two other versions of Whitestrips: Premium and Premium</li>
            <li>, I have only used the top strips, and I am glad as I can&#x27;t imagine how bad it would be to have both my upper and lower teeth aching so much.</li>
            <li>When I got my braces off my teeth were discolored and i used Crest Whitestrips Classic to make them really white!!</li>
            <li>I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days.</li>
            <li>I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed</li>
            <li>I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days.</li>
            <li>I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed</li>
            <li>After the first week, my teeth weren&#x27;t only white, but they were also shinier.  </li>
            <li>Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DDSe they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work.</li>
            <li>respectively [the 10-day version is the same as the 7-day version but includes three extra days of strips for extra whitening], as opposed to the 14 of this Classic version) but are more expensive and--based on their reviews--seem to cause more problems with sensitivity and such.</li>
            <li>But for the following days, it really hurt my upper gum</li>
            <li>I know many people have complained of tooth and gum pain, but this is my second set (I used them 2 years ago)</li>
            <li>Nothing major then, but there was a change already.      </li>
            <li>major con</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll experience a little sensitivity but nothing worth even mentioning.</li>
            <li>The strip for the bottom set of teeth is very small and only covers about 5-6 teeth, but the upper strip offers better coverage.</li>
            <li>I decided to use them and they weren&#x27;t as bad for me and everyone else has experienced.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was looking at old pictures and couldn&#x27;t believe how yellow my teeth used to be!</li>
            <li>I read somewhere that to appear natural, your teeth should be no whiter than the white in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just had to dig up an old picture to compare and it was a big difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old with fairly white teeth naturally, but I am a daily coffee/tea drinker.</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 days we saw his teeth starting to look brighter, but not really whiter.  </li>
            <li>I guess I just have to control my smile so that it&#x27;s not too wide, because now I notice how yellow my back teeth are.  </li>
            <li>If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, they really do work.</li>
            <li>and wow I am definitely noticing some constant tooth pain.</li>
            <li>i feel like crying from how much my teeth and gums hurt!</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s a little gross, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before placing the whitestrips in place, gently pad a square of toilet paper or tissue to the front and back of your teeth, try to get those teeth as dry as possible.  </li>
            <li>I admit, they were a little expensive at first (10 bucks more than they cost now),</li>
            <li>Overall, a product worthy of my hard earned 20 dollars.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that some tooth sensitivity is normal; personally, mine was only mild at worst and really only noticeable right after I applied a strip, but I know some people who aren&#x27;t as lucky.</li>
            <li>And if you put the strips on your wet teeth, they indeed don&#x27;t stick well at all, but if you dry your teeth beforehand, the strips stay on very well</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that is makes me drool and the strips are no long enough.</li>
            <li>like someone who has had a little too much to drink.</li>
            <li>I have a bar behind my lower teeth since I had braces last year, and the whitestrips work fine over them...</li>
            <li>I used over half the box, and only one time did they stay secured the full half hour they are supposed.  </li>

            <li> It has been the best thing on the market as far as a bleaching system.</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening packages/trays purchased from my dentist twice, but I am honestly just as pleased with the results from the Crest Whitestrips for whitening my teeth when they begin to look a bit stained.</li>

            <li> the reason I gave it 4 stars because I like Crest premium whitennig system better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much better in an affordable whitening strip.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> A much better alternative is the dissolving whitening strips manufactured and distributed by CVS Pharmacy,</li>
            <li> I was done with the product, I still wasn&#x27;t satisfied until I started getting compliments from all sorts of people.  </li>
            <li> It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  </li>
            <li> Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a concern.  </li>

            <li> So make sure have a towel on standy if you intend to use them</li>
            <li> Now when i buy this product, i only use them for 4-6 days at a time instead of the 2 weeks and its perfect!</li>
            <li> It does what it states it does best, and thats make teeth incredibly white!</li>
            <li> I guess its all a personal experience, I wish that I would have used them sooner and not let all of the reviews keep me from trying a great product!!</li>
            <li> Just save a bit, to get better results else where.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place.</li>

            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I also use a toothpaste (like Sensodyne) when I am whitening and this eliminates most discomfort.</li>
            <li> so I continued using it as directed for a couple more days.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it for the price of being able to smile in pics and just for the heck of it, lol.</li>
            <li> The strips were not hard to use and I received great results.  </li>
            <li> Even at work, customers tell me I have a nice smile.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use, no muss</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips are so easy to use</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips are easy and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> I experienced some tooth sensitivity a couple of times, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, unless you&#x27;re in a hurry, I think you&#x27;d be fine with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, unless you&#x27;re in a hurry, I think you&#x27;d be fine with these.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been fine since then.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, and actually works.</li>
            <li> The strips are very easy to use and not uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I could tell my teeth were whiter from the very first use!  </li>
            <li> But now, I do it with no hesitation, and have a lot more ladies complimenting me on my smile.  </li>
            <li> So far so good -</li>
            <li> Overall, I am now one happy consumer with a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first day, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more money, but it works much faster!</li>
            <li> These made my smile blinding!</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price--invest in yourself and your self-esteem!</li>
            <li> Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed.</li>

            <li> finally met someone (with a great smile) that used them</li>
            <li> I have always loved white strips.</li>
            <li> like most of us are i&#x27;d recommend something much stronger.</li>
            <li> This product is kinda magic and really works for me.</li>
            <li> The strips do have an acid in them which I&#x27;ve heard can eat away the teeth, but I have never heard of the whitestrips causing this, and I&#x27;m sure there would be more notice from the public if it did.</li>
            <li> And it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I quit using them and it took almost a week for me to be able to eat and drink normally again.  </li>
            <li> After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my first week of using the strips and already I&#x27;m noticing a significant difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Then my neighbor made a comment about how pretty my teeth were!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great what these little whitestrips can do for your self esteem, I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Honestly within two days I could already see a big difference...</li>
            <li> Even my friends are asking me did I use something on my teeth, but I just smile and say, no.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive gum you better have the stamina to finish.</li>
            <li> I would definately not recommend the strips, even if this was a rare occurance.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Hardly worth it to save</li>
            <li> have used the whitening strips for 5 days worth now.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is truly worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money to whiten your teeth.     </li>
            <li> It was well worth my money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think you will get a brighter smile, but not a brighter laugh.  </li>
            <li> That alone makes it worth the price.     </li>
            <li> the first day was not bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A year after my first use (teeth still looking good), I am currently using a generic brand--Equate, available from Wal-Mart for about $15, about $5 less than these--and have to say that I like Crest Whitestrips better because the strips are more flexible and easier to apply, and they stay in place better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist&#x27;s use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed.</li>

            <li> However, you&#x27;d have to stay away from coffee or get more of this stuff as you will develop yellow teeth quite quickly with coffee.  </li>
            <li> They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes.</li>
            <li> I found them easy to apply, I am totally able to speak while they are on (with a slight lisp!), and for me they were not painful at all.  </li>
            <li> Maintain a big smile so that your teeth are showing, you want to make sure that your lips don&#x27;t touch them yet.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally like my teeth to be too white, so I&#x27;m happy with the results that the strips provide.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> They do cause some  sensitivity within the first two days of use</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used my first pack</li>
            <li> I have found that by drying your teeth well, the strips won&#x27;t move the slightest bit, compared to when I first tried them and they slid around a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after a bit of reading about all of them I decided I&#x27;d give this a try first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on how white my teeth look.</li>
            <li> and they really do whiten!</li>
            <li> and they really work!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend them to everyone looking for a brighter smile</li>
            <li> at first it was tingly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don&#x27;t use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  </li>
            <li> I first used the CREST WHITESTRIPS when one of my friends had them.</li>
            <li> The first day I used them I could see that my teeth looked a couple of shades whiter.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I really knew that it was working!  </li>
            <li> They do make your teeth whiter (for me i noticed a difference after the first application).</li>
            <li> The top ones are easier, but the lower ones are very tiny and often slip off.</li>
            <li> I have found Crest Whitestrips of any version to work really well for me!</li>
            <li> I bought the Crest Whitestrips when they first came out</li>
            <li> They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since.</li>
            <li> funny-</li>
            <li> At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself.</li>
            <li> They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.</li>
            <li> They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.</li>
            <li> Immediately I start drooling so much, that I keep a bath towel under my face to collect everything!  </li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> First and foremost, these things deliver on their promise to make your teeth \\&quot;noticeably whiter\\&quot; in two weeks.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (I am sure he could tell because the back molars would be darker), I told him I used WhiteStrips</li>
            <li> and it holds them in place so they won&#x27;t slide and talk funny.</li>
            <li> guess I should have taken some pictures to be sure, but personally I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> for some people is that your teeth need to be or should be pretty straight before using these.</li>
            <li> First, this product really *</li>
            <li> One helpful hint is to have a tissue ready when you first put them on and \\&quot;dab\\</li>
            <li> I have been using these strips for the last two weeks, the first week was fine</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price (certainly cheaper than a professional whitening),</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price (certainly cheaper than a professional whitening),</li>
            <li> When beginning, they can make your teeth super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using this product if your looking for an easy, inexpensive product that offers long lasting and great results.</li>
            <li> Again, while I have had slight discomfort, it is definitely not enough to stop me from completing the process and expecting great results.</li>
            <li> I can talk perfectly fine and my family doesn&#x27;t know when I have them in or not, even on the upper teeth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The item works very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient, I can just throw one on while I&#x27;m cleaning</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to get another one and probably another one after that.</li>
            <li> I guess he drinks too much espresso.      </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until around the 5th day that we could say, \\&quot;wow\\&quot; - this stuff is really working.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> After my braces were removed i noticed that my teeth were really disclolored.  </li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> to use and really works.</li>
            <li> I put them on before going out for the evening, or in the morning before getting ready.</li>
            <li> If you REALLY want to whiten your teeth, do the whitening five days in a row.   </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t inspect them so much every day, because since the difference is gradual, you won&#x27;t notice much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;and didnt hurt much, i didnt even classify it as pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product is for someone with already semi-white teeth who wants them to be even whiter.</li>
            <li> Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast  </li>
            <li> The drooling causes the bottom strip to move around too much.  </li>
            <li> i did see results within like 3 days, but theyre too much of a hassel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use the whole pack at once.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;-You can&#x27;t really talk, drink, eat or do anything with your mouth while they&#x27;re on your teeth-</li>
            <li> However, it is definitely not allow you to talk freely when you have the strips in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> For an over&#x3D;the-counter, inexpensive product, they really do work.</li>
            <li> Of course, it only whitens natural teeth, not dental work, but for most people, they should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a hint, do either top or bottom first (less yucky feeling)</li>
            <li> Also keep in mind that eating, drinking, and probably talking (unless you have better luck than I) are pretty much out of the question while you&#x27;re wearing these, but I simply did one application on my drive home from work and another later in the night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced only a small bit of tingling in regards to the sensitivity factor</li>
            <li> Someone told me they made their teeth sensitive for a long time, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about them.</li>
            <li> I love it, and if you&#x27;re really looking for a whiter smile use this instead of the cheaper not very good products out now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective.</li>

            <li> He didn&#x27;t even need the full 2 weeks - his teeth are quite white now.  </li>
            <li> It made due for a protective coating and significantly reduced the pain while the Creststrips were on!</li>
            <li> the Crest Whitestrips Premium are 2X stronger than the Crest Whitestrips Classic, so if your gums/teeth are sensitive I recommend getting the Classic because they really do work for me!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth/gums, so I rarely use the strips more than once a day and usually have to skip a day between applications.</li>
            <li> Both contain a more concentrated peroxide that works in less time (7 and 10 days,</li>
            <li> I went with this (14day classic) set over the premium (7-10day) set because of the milder peroxide strength and boy</li>
            <li> My only concern was that the strips, especially the top ones, are a bit short and only cover your front eight or so teeth, but for most people that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using them only once a day until I luckily saw the note on the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think both the strips for upper teeth and lower teeth only design to cover the front 8 teeth both on the top and on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Crest White Strips are a good place to start with bleaching, and if you are not satisfied with the results, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching or other cosmetic</li>

            <li> Gave really high reviews about them.  </li>
            <li> (that I&#x27;ve specially designated for this) to gently scrub my teeth, then carefully put them on.  </li>
            <li> leave your gums and teeth a bit sensitive if you apply to strips too much on the gums.</li>
            <li> If you complete a whole box you will see a difference.  </li>
            <li> , I can talk almost normally</li>
            <li> However, after a few more days i couldn&#x27;t stand the pain in my teeth, i couldnt eat or drink</li>
            <li> You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  </li>
            <li> You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  </li>
            <li> and i could carry on with my day as normal with them on.</li>
            <li> I should have saved up my money and got my moneys worth, I&#x27;d advise you do the same.</li>
            <li> Every few minutes I check with my fingernail to make sure the bottom strip is still against my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Good product but have to use with caution as this could be a problem for people with broken tooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are many different degrees of staining/yellowness, but for mild discoloration from tea/coffee, I would definitely give these a try before an expensive trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> They just caught the sun better with those little bits of clear plastic stuck in between them.</li>
            <li> You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  </li>
            <li> I went to a new dentist and he said \\&quot;Have your whitened your teetH?\\</li>
            <li> Anyhow, we bought the classic strips because of the lower level of peroxide - he is sensitive to stronger amounts (it makes his gums hurt).  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much of a difference, but I noticed it after the 2nd time.</li>
            <li> Inc.  These strips are less flimsy/ more firm and therefore don&#x27;t stick onto themselves, they adhere to your teeth far better; AND they dissolve completely in about 5-7 minutes, leaving no messy residue or plastic film to have to discard.  </li>
            <li> This has the same effect that leading teeth whiteners do...except all the fuss - no dentist visit, no brutally expensive costs.</li>
            <li> I first used this item about 7 months ago, and my teeth are still white!  </li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m using Crest Whitestrips (i have about 4 days left), and I love how white they&#x27;ve left my teeth.</li>
            <li> so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first.</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first.</li>
            <li> 2 years after I used them the first time I was still getting compliments on my white teeth.</li>
            <li> and they really do whiten!for extra whitening], as opposed to the 14 of this Classic version) but are more expensive and--based on their reviews--seem to cause more problems with sensitivity and such.</li>
            <li> The Crest Whitestrips Classic work very well, Whithin 5 days of regular usage (2 30-minute sessions/day)</li>
            <li> I really recommend the CLASSIC Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li> Every time I go out complete strangers will tell me &amp;quot;You have such pretty teeth&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth at all but within the first use of this product I was starting to have pain in my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place.</li>
            <li> It is true what other say about the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have been using the whitening strips for six days now and have shown clear signs of whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These whitening strips clearly work and are inexpensive compared to others.</li>
            <li> But if you can&#x27;t I suggest steering clear of these.</li>
            <li> The strips are coated with a clear gel that is whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li> however I didn&#x27;t use completely as directed.</li>
            <li> I now have white teeth that really shows.</li>
            <li> They were polite and apologetic giving me a complete monetary refund.  </li>
            <li> If this is you, using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth may help.</li>
            <li> When I saw they had them for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> not obvious from 3 feet away but looking really close</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they really work, they have a satisfactory guarantee, or your money back.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see results after just one use.</li>
            <li> It probably has to do with the direct contact of your saliva with the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> They made my teeth sensitive     </li>
            <li> , it can make your teeth sensitive and irritate your gums.  </li>
            <li> The Crest White Strips have worked really well for me</li>
            <li> (I didnt want to accidentally do irreperable damage to my enamel) but a conversation with my dentist solved that completely.   </li>
            <li> I was alway self conscious about it before.  </li>
            <li> It really helps to keep your teeth staying white.    </li>
            <li> However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist</li>
            <li> However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist</li>
            <li> When you smile wide, you can see a color variation between where the strips reach and do not.</li>
            <li> Even with the classic set, I was getting sensitive teeth (especially the tops of the bits of the molars that get covered by the strips).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also worth noting there are two other versions of Whitestrips: Premium and Premium</li>
            <li> , I have only used the top strips, and I am glad as I can&#x27;t imagine how bad it would be to have both my upper and lower teeth aching so much.</li>
            <li> When I got my braces off my teeth were discolored and i used Crest Whitestrips Classic to make them really white!!</li>
            <li> I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days.</li>

            <li> I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed</li>
            <li> After the first week, my teeth weren&#x27;t only white, but they were also shinier.  </li>
            <li> Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DDSe they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work.</li>
            <li> respectively [the 10-day version is the same as the 7-day version but includes three extra days of strips for extra whitening], as opposed to the 14 of this Classic version) but are more expensive and--based on their reviews--seem to cause more problems with sensitivity and such.</li>
            <li> But for the following days, it really hurt my upper gum</li>
            <li> I know many people have complained of tooth and gum pain, but this is my second set (I used them 2 years ago)</li>
            <li> Nothing major then, but there was a change already.      </li>
            <li> major con</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll experience a little sensitivity but nothing worth even mentioning.</li>
            <li> The strip for the bottom set of teeth is very small and only covers about 5-6 teeth, but the upper strip offers better coverage.</li>
            <li> I decided to use them and they weren&#x27;t as bad for me and everyone else has experienced.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was looking at old pictures and couldn&#x27;t believe how yellow my teeth used to be!</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that to appear natural, your teeth should be no whiter than the white in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just had to dig up an old picture to compare and it was a big difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old with fairly white teeth naturally, but I am a daily coffee/tea drinker.</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 days we saw his teeth starting to look brighter, but not really whiter.  </li>
            <li> I guess I just have to control my smile so that it&#x27;s not too wide, because now I notice how yellow my back teeth are.  </li>
            <li> If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Other than that, they really do work.</li>
            <li> and wow I am definitely noticing some constant tooth pain.</li>
            <li> i feel like crying from how much my teeth and gums hurt!</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a little gross, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before placing the whitestrips in place, gently pad a square of toilet paper or tissue to the front and back of your teeth, try to get those teeth as dry as possible.  </li>
            <li> I admit, they were a little expensive at first (10 bucks more than they cost now),</li>
            <li> Overall, a product worthy of my hard earned 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that some tooth sensitivity is normal; personally, mine was only mild at worst and really only noticeable right after I applied a strip, but I know some people who aren&#x27;t as lucky.</li>
            <li> And if you put the strips on your wet teeth, they indeed don&#x27;t stick well at all, but if you dry your teeth beforehand, the strips stay on very well</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that is makes me drool and the strips are no long enough.</li>
            <li> like someone who has had a little too much to drink.</li>
            <li> I have a bar behind my lower teeth since I had braces last year, and the whitestrips work fine over them...</li>
            <li> I used over half the box, and only one time did they stay secured the full half hour they are supposed.  </li>
            <li> but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Long lasting effects.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place.</li>
            <li> The Equate ones have a bit harder plastic and tend to slide off my teeth if I open my mouth.</li>
            <li> How long?</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a strange sensation on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> I would recommend these as I think they are working well in terms of whitening, just as long as you can deal with the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who thinks that ALL producers simply come up with some new gimik to steal my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> If your starting with less than white teeth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fold a strip or mess up anything major.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time too!</li>
            <li> my teeth really are not significantly whiter, i think it was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other products like Simply White or the Crest Night Strips because they were cheaper, and they cannot even compare.</li>
            <li> I am wondering what happens to my other back teeth.   </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t focus on anything all day due to the constant aching in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I admit that I have had discomfort during this process and have also seen my gums tearing in between my teeth (as though your lips crack when they are dry).</li>
            <li> I had been looking into many teeth whitening products and was very skeptical of all of them.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained about them being difficult to apply, but after the first couple strips I didn&#x27;t have any problems, and even the first time I applied it</li>
            <li> /&gt;-These things are insanely hard to get into your mouth the first few times.  </li>
            <li> I understand that other people have complained that they are tricky to put on and that they were painful, but I experienced neither.  </li>
            <li> The cons:   *can make teeth sensitive to hot and cold for a couple of days   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting any &#x27;spots&#x27; which I was nervous about obtaining, but an all-over whitening causing only a slight sensitivity if I put the strip too over my gums, but otherwise no need for a specialized toothpaste for sensitivity.</li>
            <li> After the initial period of sensitivity, they seem to hurt less--</li>
            <li> I have used the Premium in the past (which are more expensive), and there was no noticeable difference (in whitening, or speed of effectiveness).</li>
            <li> but said i should use this product LESS because they were TOO white!</li>
            <li> I hope Crest will give some extra strips in case one mess up or break the strip unintentionally.</li>
            <li> Although my teeth weren&#x27;t that stained before, I was always a little self-conscious about smiling with my mouth open when talking to people.  </li>
            <li> My teeth got a little sensitive about the 8th day, so I stopped for a few days and started again, using them once a day, (which is what the package suggests).</li>
            <li> The active ingredients are the same as Crest, but the cost is about half the cost of Crest.  </li>
            <li> These things make me drool like crazy and for 30 minutes I maintain the biggest smile possible with a folded over bottom lip - to keep the lower strip in place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several comments by people who said they had trouble keeping the strips in place, I came up with a suggestion that should help anyone who happens to have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Later I tried myself for a few days.</li>
            <li> and i put Vasaline carefully on JUST my gums.</li>
            <li> I bought this and carefully read the packet and reviews/suggestions from everyone.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no \\&quot;spare\\&quot; strips included, because you&#x27;re likely to waste a couple.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable whitening after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> to others&#x27; reviews, I try to be careful to put the strips into my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I use them approximately once a week, and they help to keep my teeth a natural white color.  </li>
            <li> Try to push yourself through the sensitivity if it is mild, but if it bothersome to cold water or air, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left</li>

            <li> The only drawback of this product is that it makes my teeth felt a little sour during the the usage.</li>
            <li> After a bad year of smoking a pack a day and my love of frappaccinos and tea, my teeth turned a dull shade of yellow.</li>
            <li> As some other people have suggested, I will probably finish this package and then continue to do it maybe once a week.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other customers&#x27; reviews.  </li>
            <li> I think the sensitivity will fade, but this past week I have been using only 1 strip per day</li>
            <li> We both used a few days, nonetheless we noticed a little whiter upper teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a typical thing for all teeth strips, because I&#x27;ve only use this product and plan to stick to it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times over the past few years</li>
            <li> I had sensitive teeth before I used these and was worried that it would make it worse</li>
            <li> $25 down the drain.</li>
            <li> a spent my money &amp; time on this whitening system!!</li>
            <li> product gets 4 stars because of all the gross drooling, I can&#x27;t imagine using this product anywhere other than behind a closed and locked and mirror-less room.  </li>
            <li> As to the pain complaints, there is indeed a small discomfort in the beginning, but it&#x27;s no big deal for me, and after the 5th day, there is absolutely no more pain, nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> each just under a half inch diameter each, on the inside of my lower lip.  </li>
            <li> (It uses a peroxide, which is probably how your dentist would do it, although this is a less concentrated form and takes two weeks.)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter if I was eating or drinking anything hot or cold...</li>
            <li> I was a little scared about these strips after I read all the reviews.</li>
            <li> I read up a little bit</li>
            <li> There was a little gum sensitivity</li>
            <li> The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort.</li>
            <li> Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t want to swallow any of that nasty taste or lose a precious whitening strip!  </li>
            <li> I thought I would have no problem with sensitivity as I have never experienced such a problem eating cold and hot foods,</li>
            <li> At this point, Whitestrips are used for \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; and I have been working on the same box for at least a year!</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have, is that if the gel that they use oozes out, and u happen to taste it, its not a very good taste, almost threw up.</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;m not very impressed</li>
            <li> After a few days, and some problems with the strips, i noticed my teeth started to look a little whiter.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little messy</li>
            <li> The only thing that I have heard bad about them was how sensitive</li>
            <li> I gave a few strips to my mom who has coffee stained teeth</li>
            <li> i forgot the name a few months ago and that did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll stop for a few days.  </li>
            <li> i just stopped after a few days.</li>
            <li> I whiten a few time every few months and this works for me.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to waste my money</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they taste bad, but if you have Invisalign or clear retainers that form to your teeth you can put those on over the strips and you cant taste them at all</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes you usually dont taste it anymore.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it was a painful week before the sores healed especially the first two days when eating was difficult.  </li>
            <li> It was a little hard to find 30 minutes twice a day for the treatment.  </li>
            <li> When I used these strips, I found that they were too flimsy, and therefore tended to bend back over themselves, making them difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Still skeptical, I ignored the first 4 people, but over 10 people can&#x27;t be wrong.  </li>
            <li> Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique</li>
            <li> but it usually goes away with in the hour or so.</li>
            <li> My sister, who had used this before said she was forced to stop after a few days because the pain was too severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a box on sale at Bartells, and immediately tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im lazy</li>
            <li> Especially because they are a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have small teeth</li>
            <li> but the strips are not able to cover them all.  </li>
            <li> However, now I am using Crest Whitestrips Premium and WOW by the second day it hurt my gums SO BADLY!</li>
            <li> major problem discussed in previous reviews is how badly the gums are burned while using these strips.</li>
            <li> can be hard to keep on teeth sometimes   </li>
            <li> People had said the lower strip was hard to put on, but it went on without a hassle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to stay on  </li>
            <li> Hard to put on    </li>
            <li> guessing for people with sensitive teeth who are worried about pain, it&#x27;s just how badly you want your teeth to become whitened.</li>
            <li> I read the instruction which said that sensitivity was common and that it would go away, so i kept using the strips.  </li>
            <li> One moth, at least.</li>
            <li> i never really thought of &#x27;no pain no glory&#x27; until i tried this expensive thingy.</li>
            <li> also find that the strips are very small.  </li>
            <li> If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I had NASTY yellow teeth through highschool, which only worsened when I drank coffee.</li>
            <li> and you either have to use kleenex to remove it or brush your teeth quickly because it does taste nasty.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about whether it would work, but after reading the reviews I tried it.  </li>
            <li> and i would wake up in the middle of the night in tears because my teeth hurt so bad.  </li>
            <li> today when i put on my second round of strips, i felt REALLY BAD pain in my lower gum like almost a burning sensation, and very irritating...</li>

            <li> I try not to move my mouth and tongue much, but you have to have some movement, and when I do, the strips move around and that nasty gel gets in my mouth</li>
            <li> &quot; the excess from behind your teeth onto the tissue so it doesn&#x27;t go in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is a poorly designed product.  </li>
            <li> I do not believe the results are that dramatic as of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in the other products, even Crest Night Effects.</li>
            <li> No problems except excessive drool and unpleasant removal of remaining strip at end of thirty minutes.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to apply, it might work but it will take time.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to give them a try (still skeptical though.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they stayed that way for 6years.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of Listerine White Strips before these, and they were disgusting and didn&#x27;t dissolve well at all.</li>
            <li> an hour a day.. uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong-</li>
            <li> sorry)     </li>
            <li> even swallowing is difficult at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I give them a negative 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY - VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
            <li> Also, it is inconvenient to have to remove the strips, when they have done their work.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems with tooth sensitivity (but I don&#x27;t eat a lot of cold foods), burns, or anything else.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s December and the cold weather is killing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even drink without a straw because any amount of cold on my teeth is excrutiatingly painful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very skeptical about products that claim to whiten your teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth hurt so bad that I want to cry.</li>
            <li> I took 2 days off because of the pain and used 1 strip this evening and now my teeth are hurting so badly.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t TOO bad.</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t really bad, but they had a bit a yellow-ish coloring and weren&#x27;t the brightest.  </li>
            <li> Pain is not that bad    </li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend using while commuting, too annoying      </li>
            <li> Of course it will sting some people, and some will find the strips annoying, but you get used to that stuff.  </li>
            <li> Now I am disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> its horrible.</li>
            <li> now im experiencing the worst pain EVER!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Crest Whitestrips Classic work very well, Whithin 5 days of regular usage (2 30-minute sessions/day) I had noticeably whiter teeth, and my teeth weren&#x27;t yellow before, but after you use this you&#x27;ll notice the difference ;)  As to the pain complaints, there is indeed a small discomfort in the beginning, but it&#x27;s no big deal for me, and after the 5th day, there is absolutely no more pain, nothing at all.  And if you put the strips on your wet teeth, they indeed don&#x27;t stick well at all, but if you dry your teeth beforehand, the strips stay on very well, I can talk almost normally and they don&#x27;t come off.    Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this product - I just brush my teeth put on the strips and go! Honestly within two days I could already see a big difference...This has the same effect that leading teeth whiteners do...except all the fuss - no dentist visit, no brutally expensive costs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FANTASTIC - I&#x27;m hooked!! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The item works very well however I didn&#x27;t use completely as directed. I can not imagine using these strips twice a day. They do cause some  sensitivity within the first two days of use but it goes away.</li>
            <li> This really works! After using this product, my dentist commented on how white my teeth were. It&#x27;s very convenient, I can just throw one on while I&#x27;m cleaning and I can still talk on the phone.    The cons:   *can make teeth sensitive to hot and cold for a couple of days   *it doesn&#x27;t taste very good   *can be hard to keep on teeth sometimes   Overall, I love it! It lasts for a long time too!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not into paying hundreds of dollar on a teeth whitening system then this is the way to go. I&#x27;ve already used my first pack and I&#x27;m ready to get another one and probably another one after that. Every time I go out complete strangers will tell me &amp;quot;You have such pretty teeth&amp;quot;. Even my friends are asking me did I use something on my teeth, but I just smile and say, no. I&#x27;m not a dentist or anything like it, but I guarantee that you&#x27;ll be completely satisfied with this product.It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The crest white strips do work but the problem I have is I cannot get the strips to stay on!!! I try not to move my mouth and tongue much, but you have to have some movement, and when I do, the strips move around and that nasty gel gets in my mouth yuck!!! I wish crest would make some sort of tray that would hold the strips against your teeth better. Other than that, they really do work.</li>
            <li> Got these for my husband.  He has perfectly aligned teeth (naturally) and has never had a cavity.  However, we were starting to call his teeth his \\&quot;pearly yellows.\\&quot;  I guess he drinks too much espresso.      Anyhow, we bought the classic strips because of the lower level of peroxide - he is sensitive to stronger amounts (it makes his gums hurt).  Within the first 2 days we saw his teeth starting to look brighter, but not really whiter.  It wasn&#x27;t until around the 5th day that we could say, \\&quot;wow\\&quot; - this stuff is really working.  He didn&#x27;t even need the full 2 weeks - his teeth are quite white now.  He uses the remaining strips once per week to maintain the whiteness.</li>
            <li> I went with this (14day classic) set over the premium (7-10day) set because of the milder peroxide strength and boy am I glad I did.  Even with the classic set, I was getting sensitive teeth (especially the tops of the bits of the molars that get covered by the strips).  As a result, instead of using the strips twice a day like you are supposed to, I only use one set of strips a day (so it will take 28days for me).  So far so good - my teeth appreciate the once-a-day regimen and my teeth have been noticeably whiter even after the 3rd day.  I do wish the strips for the lower teeth were wider.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several comments by people who said they had trouble keeping the strips in place, I came up with a suggestion that should help anyone who happens to have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before placing the whitestrips in place, gently pad a square of toilet paper or tissue to the front and back of your teeth, try to get those teeth as dry as possible.  Maintain a big smile so that your teeth are showing, you want to make sure that your lips don&#x27;t touch them yet.  Place the whitestrips in place, one at a time, try allowing for an equal amount of strip for the front AND back of the tooth.  Push it firmly in place, and use your fingernail to gently push the front of the strip into the spaces between each tooth (to ensure that the gel makes its between each tooth, and not just the front surface).  I have found that by drying your teeth well, the strips won&#x27;t move the slightest bit, compared to when I first tried them and they slid around a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whitestrips work well, I noticed a big difference after only five days.  Although my teeth weren&#x27;t that stained before, I was always a little self-conscious about smiling with my mouth open when talking to people.  But now, I do it with no hesitation, and have a lot more ladies complimenting me on my smile.  It&#x27;s great what these little whitestrips can do for your self esteem, I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle when I bought this product, I just had extra money to do whatever with and teeth that looked \\&quot;like corn\\&quot; according to my sister. Well, it was like a miracle! I now have white teeth that really shows. All my friends noticed how white my teeth had gotten without me even telling them I was using a whitening product. Even at work, customers tell me I have a nice smile. Of course my teeth aren&#x27;t barbie doll white, but they definitely do look like it in pictures. In fact, I was looking at old pictures and couldn&#x27;t believe how yellow my teeth used to be!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my first week of using the strips and already I&#x27;m noticing a significant difference in the color of my teeth. I&#x27;m not getting any &#x27;spots&#x27; which I was nervous about obtaining, but an all-over whitening causing only a slight sensitivity if I put the strip too over my gums, but otherwise no need for a specialized toothpaste for sensitivity. The strips are very easy to use and not uncomfortable at all. I can talk perfectly fine and my family doesn&#x27;t know when I have them in or not, even on the upper teeth. The only not-so-fun part is taking off the strip...when you take it off the gel is still on your teeth and you either have to use kleenex to remove it or brush your teeth quickly because it does taste nasty. The strips do have an acid in them which I&#x27;ve heard can eat away the teeth, but I have never heard of the whitestrips causing this, and I&#x27;m sure there would be more notice from the public if it did. I have a bar behind my lower teeth since I had braces last year, and the whitestrips work fine over them...although it is suggested not to use the strips while there is any dental work such as braces in your mouth. Overall, this product is awesome...works like a charm!</li>
            <li> After my braces were removed i noticed that my teeth were really disclolored.  I decided to try the strips to see if they worked.  After a few days, and some problems with the strips, i noticed my teeth started to look a little whiter.  Then i noticed that my teeth started to ache, just like when i had braces on.  I read the instruction which said that sensitivity was common and that it would go away, so i kept using the strips.  However, after a few more days i couldn&#x27;t stand the pain in my teeth, i couldnt eat or drink and i would wake up in the middle of the night in tears because my teeth hurt so bad.  I quit using them and it took almost a week for me to be able to eat and drink normally again.  After all the problems with the strips and the pain my teeth really are not significantly whiter, i think it was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband but he only used for one week and refused to continue because the innerside gel make his gum hurt. Later I tried myself for a few days. For the first day, it&#x27;s okay. But for the following days, it really hurt my upper gum so I stopped. We both used a few days, nonetheless we noticed a little whiter upper teeth. I guess it will whiten your teeth but if you have sensitive gum you better have the stamina to finish.</li>
            <li> This product definitely whitens teeth. The only problem I have is that is makes me drool and the strips are no long enough.</li>
            <li> Good product but have to use with caution as this could be a problem for people with broken tooth</li>
            <li> I used the strips as directed for five days and the teeth were whitening.  No problems except excessive drool and unpleasant removal of remaining strip at end of thirty minutes.  Then at the end of the fifth day&#x27;s use there were two chemical burns, each just under a half inch diameter each, on the inside of my lower lip.  I stopped use and called the company.  They were polite and apologetic giving me a complete monetary refund.  HOWEVER, it was a painful week before the sores healed especially the first two days when eating was difficult.  I would definately not recommend the strips, even if this was a rare occurance.[[ASIN:B000067E30 Crest Whitestrips Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips]]</li>
            <li> When beginning, they can make your teeth super sensitive. I recommend starting at night an hour before going to bed, that way any sensitivity has time to go away by the time you wake up the next morning. After the initial period of sensitivity, they seem to hurt less-- so I do it twice before going to bed (for 1h+), and then I don&#x27;t have to deal with any discomfort while at work.</li>
            <li> I had been looking into many teeth whitening products and was very skeptical of all of them. But after a bit of reading about all of them I decided I&#x27;d give this a try first. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much of a difference, but I noticed it after the 2nd time. Nothing major then, but there was a change already.      It doesn&#x27;t taste good at all, but after a few minutes you usually dont taste it anymore. They&#x27;re sometimes hare to get on and keep on, but it&#x27;s only for 30 minutes and it works very well. I&#x27;d definetly recommend this.      -Drawback for some people is that your teeth need to be or should be pretty straight before using these. My father never had braces and his teeth aren&#x27;t even so he can&#x27;t use them to get good results.</li>
            <li> the reason I gave it 4 stars because I like Crest premium whitennig system better. It&#x27;s more money, but it works much faster! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on and off for a long-time now. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on how white my teeth look. I really recommend the CLASSIC Crest White Strips. I have used the Premium in the past (which are more expensive), and there was no noticeable difference (in whitening, or speed of effectiveness). They are so easy to use, no muss no fuss-  leave on 30 minutes, you&#x27;re done. I put them on before going out for the evening, or in the morning before getting ready. There&#x27;s 56 strips too, so they seem like they last forever!     Great product, easy to use, and actually works. Can&#x27;t ask for much better in an affordable whitening strip.</li>
            <li> I have been using the whitening strips for six days now and have shown clear signs of whiter teeth. At the top of the page, there is an image that displays just how effective the strips are, however, I do not believe the results are that dramatic as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major problem discussed in previous reviews is how badly the gums are burned while using these strips. I admit that I have had discomfort during this process and have also seen my gums tearing in between my teeth (as though your lips crack when they are dry). Thankfully, it is not crucial enough for me to discontinue using the strips and I fully intend on completing the 12 day program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These whitening strips clearly work and are inexpensive compared to others. Again, while I have had slight discomfort, it is definitely not enough to stop me from completing the process and expecting great results. I am already smiling (with teeth) in photos-so be assured that results will be obvious in a short amount of time. Good luck!</li>
            <li> First, this product really *does* whiten teeth--it&#x27;s not a gimmick as some people think. (It uses a peroxide, which is probably how your dentist would do it, although this is a less concentrated form and takes two weeks.) Of course, it only whitens natural teeth, not dental work, but for most people, they should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the product itself. Some people have complained about them being difficult to apply, but after the first couple strips I didn&#x27;t have any problems, and even the first time I applied it I didn&#x27;t fold a strip or mess up anything major. Keep in mind that some tooth sensitivity is normal; personally, mine was only mild at worst and really only noticeable right after I applied a strip, but I know some people who aren&#x27;t as lucky. If this is you, using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth may help. Also keep in mind that eating, drinking, and probably talking (unless you have better luck than I) are pretty much out of the question while you&#x27;re wearing these, but I simply did one application on my drive home from work and another later in the night. My only concern was that the strips, especially the top ones, are a bit short and only cover your front eight or so teeth, but for most people that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year after my first use (teeth still looking good), I am currently using a generic brand--Equate, available from Wal-Mart for about $15, about $5 less than these--and have to say that I like Crest Whitestrips better because the strips are more flexible and easier to apply, and they stay in place better. The Equate ones have a bit harder plastic and tend to slide off my teeth if I open my mouth. Hardly worth it to save $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also worth noting there are two other versions of Whitestrips: Premium and Premium Plus. Both contain a more concentrated peroxide that works in less time (7 and 10 days, respectively [the 10-day version is the same as the 7-day version but includes three extra days of strips for extra whitening], as opposed to the 14 of this Classic version) but are more expensive and--based on their reviews--seem to cause more problems with sensitivity and such. Therefore, unless you&#x27;re in a hurry, I think you&#x27;d be fine with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I am happy with this product and think that most people would be, too. Not bad for the price (certainly cheaper than a professional whitening), and they really do whiten!for extra whitening], as opposed to the 14 of this Classic version) but are more expensive and--based on their reviews--seem to cause more problems with sensitivity and such.

            <li> I am a coffee drinker so my teeth can often use whitening.  Crest Whitestrips are so easy to use and they really work!  One helpful hint is to have a tissue ready when you first put them on and \\&quot;dab\\&quot; the excess from behind your teeth onto the tissue so it doesn&#x27;t go in your mouth.  If you REALLY want to whiten your teeth, do the whitening five days in a row.   &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply, it might work but it will take time. How long? One moth, at least. But I am not there yet.</li>
            <li> I first used this item about 7 months ago, and my teeth are still white!  The strips were not hard to use and I received great results.  Everyone compliments me on how beautiful my teeth look.  I would definitely recommend using this product if your looking for an easy, inexpensive product that offers long lasting and great results.</li>
            <li> These made my smile blinding! I absolutely recommend them to everyone looking for a brighter smile</li>
            <li> When I used these strips, I found that they were too flimsy, and therefore tended to bend back over themselves, making them difficult to apply.  After they were applied to the teeth, they did not always stay in place and tended to slide around.  Also, it is inconvenient to have to remove the strips, when they have done their work.  For these reasons, I do not consider them to be the best alternative.  A much better alternative is the dissolving whitening strips manufactured and distributed by CVS Pharmacy, Inc.  These strips are less flimsy/ more firm and therefore don&#x27;t stick onto themselves, they adhere to your teeth far better; AND they dissolve completely in about 5-7 minutes, leaving no messy residue or plastic film to have to discard.  On size strip (larger than Crest&#x27;s) fits both upper and lower teeth.  The active ingredients are the same as Crest, but the cost is about half the cost of Crest.  Superior to Crest in every way. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips are easy and convenient to use.  I use them approximately once a week, and they help to keep my teeth a natural white color.  I don&#x27;t personally like my teeth to be too white, so I&#x27;m happy with the results that the strips provide.</li>
            <li> I have always loved white strips. When I saw they had them for sensitive teeth I was excited. Now I am disappointed!!!! They did not work at all &amp; I feel like I just threw my money away. I guess I&#x27;ll have to stick with regular &amp; deal with the pain. But it will be a while before I can afford them. Work on it crest. I give them a negative 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I just got these today, i have already used one day of them. They are GREAT!! JUST BY ONE STRIP i could already see some improvement. the only complaint i have, is that if the gel that they use oozes out, and u happen to taste it, its not a very good taste, almost threw up. but otherwise, thats not gonna make me not use this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about them on television and on the internet, but I never gave them a try.  I&#x27;m one of those people who thinks that ALL producers simply come up with some new gimik to steal my hard earned money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I finally met someone (with a great smile) that used them and she recommended them to me.  Gave really high reviews about them.  So, I decided to give them a try (still skeptical though.  Maybe she had a great smile to begin with). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have taken some pictures to be sure, but personally I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  They were a bit whiter I think, but that could have been the lighting, or my imagination. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I was done with the product, I still wasn&#x27;t satisfied until I started getting compliments from all sorts of people.  People were asking me what I did, because my teeth looked really white.  Still skeptical, I ignored the first 4 people, but over 10 people can&#x27;t be wrong.  Bottom line, the product does work, the \\&quot;constant shade\\&quot; of my teeth was all in my head and came from inspecting them every day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROS: &lt;br /&gt;Product works.  Even though I skipped a couple days, still seemed to work.  Just don&#x27;t inspect them so much every day, because since the difference is gradual, you won&#x27;t notice much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS: &lt;br /&gt;The stupid strips are TOO SHORT.  What was crest thinking? I guess I just have to control my smile so that it&#x27;s not too wide, because now I notice how yellow my back teeth are.  Hey, I may buy 2 boxes next time and try overlapping strips. :D &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does leave your gums and teeth a bit sensitive if you apply to strips too much on the gums. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Takes a bit of getting used to, no doubt.</li>
            <li> as directed, i used the whitestrips twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i started on a saturday. at first it was tingly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and didnt hurt much, i didnt even classify it as pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway on the third day, tuesday night, i noticed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i couldnt brush my upper gums anymore coz they hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looking closer...they kinda darkened, or somehow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my gums sort of were swollen and a bit red, i cant describe it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its not obvious from 3 feet away but looking really close&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you will notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it depends on your pain threshold. i never really thought of &#x27;no pain no glory&#x27; until i tried this expensive thingy.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist who recommends Crest White Strips because they do work to whiten teeth.  Follow the directions in the box, and here are some further tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  (Optional step)  I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don&#x27;t use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  Your enamel has pores and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate. If you use a fluoridated toothpaste, the flouride may block the enamel pores.  (Crest&#x27;s instructions indicate you do not need to brush. I talked to a Crest representative on this point, and she indicated that the hydrogen peroxide will penetrate plaque, therefore this step is optional.  The instructions indicate no brushing because they do not want fluoridated toothpaste on the teeth before whitening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Use the strips twice per day for maximum efectiveness.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called carbamide peroxide (a 6% form of hydrogen peroxide; in-office dental whitening uses a 15-30% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white.  Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Leave the strips on for 30 minutes at a time.  After thirty minutes your saliva has probably diluted the peroxide to the extent that it is no longer effective.  You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  It does not matter if you do this in one continuous 60-minute period or two 30-minute periods.  Do this for two weeks and your teeth should get whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The chemical may \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your gums.  If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the peroxide oxidizing (or burning) your gums.  Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to stop the treatment.  It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Your teeth may become senstiive during the two-week treatment time.  Try to push yourself through the sensitivity if it is mild, but if it bothersome to cold water or air, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach.  You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a concern.  However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains.  If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people.  Over time, you will get a result that should be whiter than when you started.  Crest White Strips are a good place to start with bleaching, and if you are not satisfied with the results, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching or other cosmetic options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;konedog DDSe they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.     2.

            <li> I used it for a week my teeth were so beautiful. but you have to make sure to brush your teeth though. you cant use these just alone. they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> I first used the CREST WHITESTRIPS when one of my friends had them. The first day I used them I could see that my teeth looked a couple of shades whiter. It has been the best thing on the market as far as a bleaching system. I loved it. I not only noticed the results myself but I also had people complementing me on how white my teeth were. So I had told them about the product and now they are satisfied. The only thing that I have heard bad about them was how sensitive you teeth get after you get done using them but it usually goes away with in the hour or so. They are great!!</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips is a wonderful product!  I recommend them to anyone and everyone.  I saw my teeth getting whiter after just two days.  Then my neighbor made a comment about how pretty my teeth were! Out of nowhere! That&#x27;s when I really knew that it was working!  I experienced some tooth sensitivity a couple of times, but nothing major.  And it goes away quickly.  Definitely worth the price--invest in yourself and your self-esteem!</li>
            <li> I concur with the rest of the reviews. They do make your teeth whiter (for me i noticed a difference after the first application). Also people stopped me and complemented me on my teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However the things are very hard to put on your teeth. The top ones are easier, but the lower ones are very tiny and often slip off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It also takes one or two applications for your mouth to get used to them. So make sure have a towel on standy if you intend to use them (they make you salivate)</li>
            <li> My teeth hurt so bad that I want to cry. I can just feel the throbbing pain at the edge of each tooth. I can&#x27;t even drink without a straw because any amount of cold on my teeth is excrutiatingly painful.  &lt;br /&gt;I have used the whitening strips for 5 days worth now. I took 2 days off because of the pain and used 1 strip this evening and now my teeth are hurting so badly. &lt;br /&gt;If you can tolerate pain then go for it because they work. But if you can&#x27;t I suggest steering clear of these. I am going to discontinue use of them and get my money back. I just can&#x27;t take the pain anymore. It feels like my never endings are exposed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed yellow stains beginning on my teeth (and im only 19!), so i decided to use the product. WOW does this work. In only 2 weeks all of my friends said my teeth looked not only incredibly white..but said i should use this product LESS because they were TOO white! Now when i buy this product, i only use them for 4-6 days at a time instead of the 2 weeks and its perfect! i go through a 1 week treatment every 6 months or so and my teeth look amazing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If your actually gonna complain, \\&quot;eww this taste bad\\&quot; or, \\&quot;ooh my teeth are sensitive\\&quot;...time to grow a pair u wimps, this is teeth whitening, not waterboarding torture, Jesus... It doesn&#x27;t taste like chocolate ice cream and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a nice gum massage. It does what it states it does best, and thats make teeth incredibly white!</li>
            <li> If your expecting barbie white teeth with this product forget it. I&#x27;d say this product is for someone with already semi-white teeth who wants them to be even whiter. If your starting with less than white teeth like most of us are i&#x27;d recommend something much stronger. As for the application process, they where very easy to apply and i could carry on with my day as normal with them on. You&#x27;ll experience a little sensitivity but nothing worth even mentioning. Overall, i&#x27;m not very impressed but they do have a return policy which is nice.</li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B000067E30 Crest Whitestrips Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips]]  I was a little scared about these strips after I read all the reviews. My husband bought them as a birthday present as a referral from my sister who uses them. I read up a little bit so they sat in my bathroom cupboard, for about two months. I decided to use them and they weren&#x27;t as bad for me and everyone else has experienced. They did make my teeth whiter and people do ask what I used in order to get them that white. I had sensitive teeth before I used these and was worried that it would make it worse but it stayed the same. I guess its all a personal experience, I wish that I would have used them sooner and not let all of the reviews keep me from trying a great product!!</li>
            <li> today was my third day using them...the first day was not bad. the second day i started feeling pain, and today OH GOD!!! its horrible. i feel like crying from how much my teeth and gums hurt! today when i put on my second round of strips, i felt REALLY BAD pain in my lower gum like almost a burning sensation, and very irritating...so i moved the strips around and moved them off that spot...i was still in great pain. when my 30 minutes were over i noticed that the spot on my gums where i felt a burning sensation, the whitening gel indeed did burn off that spot on my gum and i was bleeding. now im experiencing the worst pain EVER!! :[ im going to the dentist tomorrow because im scared of what it did to my gums and teeth after only 3 days!</li>
            <li> I have found Crest Whitestrips of any version to work really well for me! When I got my braces off my teeth were discolored and i used Crest Whitestrips Classic to make them really white!! There was a little gum sensitivity but it wasn&#x27;t TOO bad. However, now I am using Crest Whitestrips Premium and WOW by the second day it hurt my gums SO BADLY! I toughed it out and tried it the third day again, but this time i took a Q-tip and i put Vasaline carefully on JUST my gums. It made due for a protective coating and significantly reduced the pain while the Creststrips were on! However my gums are still so sore that i can&#x27;t even brush my teeth...basically...my Vasaline trick works wonders BUT the Crest Whitestrips Premium are 2X stronger than the Crest Whitestrips Classic, so if your gums/teeth are sensitive I recommend getting the Classic because they really do work for me!</li>
            <li> I bought these a while back ago, I didn&#x27;t like the results. I don&#x27;t think they really work, they have a satisfactory guarantee, or your money back. I wasn&#x27;t motivated to get my money back, only once I felt a stinging sensation, that was after I brushed my teeth \\&quot;not recommended\\&quot; yeah it says not to brush your teeth before you use this product. I did anyways and that&#x27;s the only time I ever felt any stinging sensation. The product didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anything from crest again related to whiting. I should have saved up my money and got my moneys worth, I&#x27;d advise you do the same. Just save a bit, to get better results else where.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see results after just one use. You have to use the 56 pack 2x a day and can do the upper/lower set of teeth together or at different times. The strips are coated with a clear gel that is whitening the teeth. The strip for the bottom set of teeth is very small and only covers about 5-6 teeth, but the upper strip offers better coverage. My teeth were white already, so now they are really white. I gave a few strips to my mom who has coffee stained teeth and they worked for her after only 3-4 uses. Good results. Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a poorly designed product.  Once the strips are in your mouth, not only can you not eat, drink, or speak--you cannot even move your tongue!  If it bumps the strip, the strip crinkles, and soon you only have a balled-up piece of plastic stuck to one tooth.  I used over half the box, and only one time did they stay secured the full half hour they are supposed.  Were my teeth whiter?  No.  They just caught the sun better with those little bits of clear plastic stuck in between them.</li>
            <li> I bought the Crest Whitestrips when they first came out and I was extremely happy with their results. I admit, they were a little expensive at first (10 bucks more than they cost now), but well worth it. I&#x27;ve tried the other products like Simply White or the Crest Night Strips because they were cheaper, and they cannot even compare. It probably has to do with the direct contact of your saliva with the whitening gel. I&#x27;m really disappointed in the other products, even Crest Night Effects. The Crest Whitestrips are your safest and best bet when searching for a better, whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I used a toothpaste whitening kit by some brand i forgot the name a few months ago and that did not work for me at all. But now I&#x27;m using Crest Whitestrips (i have about 4 days left), and I love how white they&#x27;ve left my teeth. I used to just wear chapstick to not bring attention to my mouth, but now i wear red lipsticks without fear! I love it, and if you&#x27;re really looking for a whiter smile use this instead of the cheaper not very good products out now.</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I&#x27;m one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one&#x27;s teeth. I didn&#x27;t like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist&#x27;s use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy. They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first.

            <li> I just finished my two weeks using Crest Whitestrips.  I was a little skeptical about whether it would work, but after reading the reviews I tried it.  My teeth weren&#x27;t really bad, but they had a bit a yellow-ish coloring and weren&#x27;t the brightest.  I swear I noticed a difference after 24 hours!  After the first week, my teeth weren&#x27;t only white, but they were also shinier.  I&#x27;m so glad a spent my money &amp; time on this whitening system!!</li>
            <li> if you can&#x27;t stand the heat get out of the kitchen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;if you can&#x27;t stand the pain your teeth are destined to an eternity of yellowness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;if you can&#x27;t stand the heat get out of the kitchen.</li>
            <li> This is a truly amazing product. My sister and husband have both commented on the white shade of my teeth after only 2days of uses. Thats something seeing as how the system is to be used a total of 14days! After a bad year of smoking a pack a day and my love of frappaccinos and tea, my teeth turned a dull shade of yellow. Unfortunately, they stayed that way for 6years. I&#x27;m glad I decided to shell out the price for these strips; well worth it. I&#x27;ve experienced only a small bit of tingling in regards to the sensitivity factor but it&#x27;s well worth it for the price of being able to smile in pics and just for the heck of it, lol. My self esteem is back! Now if I could only lose this extra 15pounds....</li>
            <li> Originally, I was worried about the pain that many people experienced while using this product. My sister, who had used this before said she was forced to stop after a few days because the pain was too severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a box on sale at Bartells, and immediately tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1- No pain, was very easy to apply. People had said the lower strip was hard to put on, but it went on without a hassle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2- No pain, but there&#x27;s a strange sensation on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3- Still no pain, teeth starting to improve already, but the gums were starting to wear down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one day off from wearing them then continued onwards, using them once in the morning then at night. No pain, and my gums weren&#x27;t bothered ever since. This product is truly worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only major con I can think of is that when it&#x27;s time to take off the strips, you have to deal with all the gel on your teeth. At first it&#x27;s a little gross, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing for people with sensitive teeth who are worried about pain, it&#x27;s just how badly you want your teeth to become whitened. I personally lucked out.</li>
            <li> After using this product continously for 14 days, I did not see any difference in color of my teeth. $25 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money to whiten your teeth.     Pros:  Fast  Semi Convenient  Pain is not that bad    Cons:  Make you drool (Use cotton balls in your mouth to soak up all that saliva...)  Hard to stay on  I DO NOT recommend using while commuting, too annoying      Overall, a product worthy of my hard earned 20 dollars. Just a hint, do either top or bottom first (less yucky feeling)</li>
            <li> I love these. I&#x27;ve always been self-conscious of my yellow teeth, and I&#x27;ve wanted to try these for a while. Someone told me they made their teeth sensitive for a long time, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about them. My teeth got a little sensitive about the 8th day, so I stopped for a few days and started again, using them once a day, (which is what the package suggests). They&#x27;ve been fine since then. I tried a sample of Listerine White Strips before these, and they were disgusting and didn&#x27;t dissolve well at all. I like these way better. My teeth are so white. I love that I don&#x27;t have to feel self-conscious about them anymore. My husband noticed the difference, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this and carefully read the packet and reviews/suggestions from everyone.  Before I put them on I use a toothbrush (that I&#x27;ve specially designated for this) to gently scrub my teeth, then carefully put them on.  Immediately I start drooling so much, that I keep a bath towel under my face to collect everything!  Yes, it sounds gross and it is gross.  But I don&#x27;t want to swallow any of that nasty taste or lose a precious whitening strip!  These things make me drool like crazy and for 30 minutes I maintain the biggest smile possible with a folded over bottom lip - to keep the lower strip in place.  Every few minutes I check with my fingernail to make sure the bottom strip is still against my teeth.  I have had no problems with tooth sensitivity (but I don&#x27;t eat a lot of cold foods), burns, or anything else.  They do seem to be working.  I&#x27;ve been doing them at night, I&#x27;ll do 2 or 3 in one sitting (the manual says that&#x27;s as effective).  Then I&#x27;ll stop for a few days.  As some other people have suggested, I will probably finish this package and then continue to do it maybe once a week.  I read somewhere that to appear natural, your teeth should be no whiter than the white in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 4 stars because of all the gross drooling, I can&#x27;t imagine using this product anywhere other than behind a closed and locked and mirror-less room.  The drooling causes the bottom strip to move around too much.  Maybe this should come with a tray to cover the strips to keep them dryer.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job.  However, you&#x27;d have to stay away from coffee or get more of this stuff as you will develop yellow teeth quite quickly with coffee.  Otherwise, very good.</li>
            <li> Very effective product. I&#x27;ve used this product in 2007 and 2008 summers. Although now is summer 2009 and I haven&#x27;t use another pack, people still compliment on my teeth and ask me what&#x27;s the trick. This product is kinda magic and really works for me. Actually, I haven&#x27;t finish my pack last summer, since my teeth are already white enough.     The only drawback of this product is that it makes my teeth felt a little sour during the the usage. I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a typical thing for all teeth strips, because I&#x27;ve only use this product and plan to stick to it.</li>
            <li> I think these work good but my eyesight is weak so I think my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li> i did see results within like 3 days, but theyre too much of a hassel. an hour a day.. uncomfortable. i just stopped after a few days. im lazy</li>
            <li> I had NASTY yellow teeth through highschool, which only worsened when I drank coffee. Don&#x27;t get me wrong- I tried using toothpastes every morning and night that promised whitening effects, but they honestly didn&#x27;t work. So I tried Crest WhiteStrips.  Pros:     They worked SO well. EVERYONE commented on how good my smile was.     I didn&#x27;t even use the whole pack at once. I was so inconsistent with it, but it worked so well anyway.     Long lasting effects. I&#x27;ve not used them for 2 years, and now I&#x27;m considering getting another pack.    Reasonably priced.     Whitened my teeth without making it obnoxiously white      Cons:  They made my teeth sensitive     Hard to put on    I didn&#x27;t know what to do with the goo that was left over...so i spate it out. (tmi? sorry)     But overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> First and foremost, these things deliver on their promise to make your teeth \\&quot;noticeably whiter\\&quot; in two weeks.  I&#x27;m not going to complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have noticed the following things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-These things are insanely hard to get into your mouth the first few times.  It&#x27;s a shame there&#x27;s no \\&quot;spare\\&quot; strips included, because you&#x27;re likely to waste a couple.  The lower strips especially are prone to getting crumpled up and ruined while trying to stick the damn thing to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The gel tastes terrible.  I recommend brushing your teeth shortly after you remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You can&#x27;t really talk, drink, eat or do anything with your mouth while they&#x27;re on your teeth- even swallowing is difficult at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging does not stress that you need to use them TWICE A DAY.  I made the mistake of using them only once a day until I luckily saw the note on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, like I said, my teeth look quite a bit better, although this isn&#x27;t a substitute for brushing.</li>
            <li> bottom line it works, use it like directed and your teeth will be a couple of shades whiter</li>
            <li> Works great.  Noticeable whitening after only a few days.  Simple to use. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very skeptical about products that claim to whiten your teeth.  Especially because they are a bit expensive.  However, after reading the reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m sure glad I tried it.  I could tell my teeth were whiter from the very first use!  It was a little hard to find 30 minutes twice a day for the treatment.  But once I saw it was working, I MADE the time to do it.  It was well worth my money.  Two things to keep in mind, it can make your teeth sensitive and irritate your gums.  But it goes away after treatment.  Overall, I am now one happy consumer with a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other customers&#x27; reviews.  This system does what it claims to whiter your teeth. &lt;br /&gt;Listening to others&#x27; reviews, I try to be careful to put the strips into my mouth.  So, I have no problem to put them in.  However, it is definitely not allow you to talk freely when you have the strips in your mouth.  I also don&#x27;t think you can eat and drink while the strips in your mouth.  I hope Crest will give some extra strips in case one mess up or break the strip unintentionally. &lt;br /&gt;I also find that the strips are very small.  I have small teeth but the strips are not able to cover them all.  I think both the strips for upper teeth and lower teeth only design to cover the front 8 teeth both on the top and on the bottom.  I am wondering what happens to my other back teeth.   &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think you will get a brighter smile, but not a brighter laugh.  It is because people will notice your back teeth are still look yellow.</li>
            <li> The Crest White Strips have worked really well for me and I have nothing but good to say about them.  I understand that other people have complained that they are tricky to put on and that they were painful, but I experienced neither.  I found them easy to apply, I am totally able to speak while they are on (with a slight lisp!), and for me they were not painful at all.  My teeth are noticeably whiter and I am very happy with the whole experience.  My concern was if they were good for my teeth (I didnt want to accidentally do irreperable damage to my enamel) but a conversation with my dentist solved that completely.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use them again if required and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend them to others.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using these strips for the last two weeks, the first week was fine and I did see results within that time. I am in a bit of pain, though. It&#x27;s December and the cold weather is killing my teeth. I thought I would have no problem with sensitivity as I have never experienced such a problem eating cold and hot foods, etc. I think the sensitivity will fade, but this past week I have been using only 1 strip per day and wow I am definitely noticing some constant tooth pain. I would recommend these as I think they are working well in terms of whitening, just as long as you can deal with the pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I have only used the top strips, and I am glad as I can&#x27;t imagine how bad it would be to have both my upper and lower teeth aching so much.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is true what other say about the sensitivity. I would recommend using sensitivity toothpaste while you are using the strips, it helped for me. It made my teeth noticeably whiter. I would suggest you take a picture of yourself smiling before and after. I noticed the whiteness of my teeth when I saw a picture taken recently and I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice they looked. I just had to dig up an old picture to compare and it was a big difference. After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth. I was alway self conscious about it before.  That alone makes it worth the price.     I was very satisfied with my results. Make sure to read all the instructions before using.     It just became a part of my bedtime routine, not a bother at all. I just put one on while I was watching my evening TV programs and just kept an eye on the clock.     Also, I recommend that after you have finished your pack that you use the Crest whitening toothpaste.  It really helps to keep your teeth staying white.    Great product and it was recommended to me by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times over the past few years and I love it.  For an over&#x3D;the-counter, inexpensive product, they really do work. Of course it will sting some people, and some will find the strips annoying, but you get used to that stuff.  If you complete a whole box you will see a difference.  I went to a new dentist and he said \\&quot;Have your whitened your teetH?\\&quot; (I am sure he could tell because the back molars would be darker), I told him I used WhiteStrips and he said, \\&quot;Yes, they are great!\\&quot;.  Use them, they work!  However, if you have veneers, or anything like that they do not work.  I do wish, however, that Crest had an actual tray made that would reach farther back teeth.  When you smile wide, you can see a color variation between where the strips reach and do not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old with fairly white teeth naturally, but I am a daily coffee/tea drinker. I&#x27;ve used whitening packages/trays purchased from my dentist twice, but I am honestly just as pleased with the results from the Crest Whitestrips for whitening my teeth when they begin to look a bit stained. I have very sensitive teeth/gums, so I rarely use the strips more than once a day and usually have to skip a day between applications. I also use a toothpaste (like Sensodyne) when I am whitening and this eliminates most discomfort. At this point, Whitestrips are used for \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; and I have been working on the same box for at least a year! I whiten a few time every few months and this works for me. I&#x27;m sure there are many different degrees of staining/yellowness, but for mild discoloration from tea/coffee, I would definitely give these a try before an expensive trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I know many people have complained of tooth and gum pain, but this is my second set (I used them 2 years ago) and I have never felt even the ugh test tingling and I follow the directions. My only complaint is that they taste bad, but if you have Invisalign or clear retainers that form to your teeth you can put those on over the strips and you cant taste them at all and it holds them in place so they won&#x27;t slide and talk funny. Great results. Certainly a wise investment. 2 years after I used them the first time I was still getting compliments on my white teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Crest Night Effects whitening kit with great results before but since I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon anymore I tried the whitening strips. OUCH!!!! I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth at all but within the first use of this product I was starting to have pain in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money so I continued using it as directed for a couple more days. The pain and discomfort was unbearable...I couldn&#x27;t focus on anything all day due to the constant aching in my teeth. It didn&#x27;t matter if I was eating or drinking anything hot or cold...my teeth just hurt constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discontinued using the product after that and threw it away. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY - VERY DISAPPOINTING! I would not advise trying this product. Stick to using the Night Effects whitening kit if you can find it anywhere...it&#x27;s a little messy but it&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t cause tooth pain like the whitening strips seem to do.</li>
