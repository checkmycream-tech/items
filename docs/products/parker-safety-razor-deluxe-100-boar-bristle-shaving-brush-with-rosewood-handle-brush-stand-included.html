            <li>Great brush, super comfy!</li>
            <li>After working it through some Col. Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum (smells amazing) soap and some water...</li>
            <li>It has a nice rosewood finish and the gloss is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice size, hold its shape well.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have in my rotation of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, I like it</li>
            <li>, The weight feels nice.</li>
            <li>It seems incapable of generating any kind of lather.</li>
            <li>Nice that it comes with a stand also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good brush with cake soap that lathers up well and provides a light scrub for your face.</li>
            <li>for the specifics of this brush, the handle is nice; better than what it looks like in the pictures.</li>
            <li>This is the best brush I have had so far.  </li>
            <li>It is still going strong!</li>
            <li>Odds are you will like this just fine but try a badger brush too because it feels nice as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having the pleasure of using the boar brush for about six weeks and have been enjoying the use of a quality brush.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try a boar brush, seeing as how much I liked my badgers, but after reading around on forums like Badger and Blade about how good boar brushes were at lathering soaps, I decided to give this one</li>
            <li>This would be great for a beginner, or someone who wants to branch out from badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li>I will get a badger hair brush this winter and see if I like it better.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Fits much better that</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the brush, it makes shaving a more enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I know that everyone says &amp;#34;get a beaver brush&amp;#34; but I like this brush better than my beaver one.</li>
            <li>This product is a good value for the money and a great addition to any wet shaver&#x27;s product line.</li>
            <li>My Parker brush has a lovely &amp;#34;bloom&amp;#34; to it and holds up remarkably fine.</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t readily whip up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>The stiffness of the brush makes for easy lathering of a soap bar as well.</li>
            <li>for badgers in general, I think they are great for lathering soap.</li>
            <li>I also own a pure badger brush from the Art of Shaving store that cost almost 5 times as much but to be honest</li>
            <li>Overall, this brush is a great value.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Rated 4 stars because the Parker lettering/trim was cheaply printed on</li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The rose wood handle is very classy.</li>
            <li>It feels great, looks nice, and is firm enough to create a nice lather on the face.</li>
            <li>It makes an outstanding lather off of a puck of shaving soap; so much that my badgers might be relegated to back-up status.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend as a good starter boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>This was my first shave brush and it works fine.</li>
            <li>This brush is a lot stiffer than your badger hair brush and for me it works up a quick lather.</li>
            <li>(OK a clear plastic stand</li>
            <li>Nice looking, reasonably priced natural bristle shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The clear plastic stand is nice to use when pre-soaking the brush, so it&#x27;s ready after the shower.</li>
            <li>I read that a boar brush was an option worth considering and so bought this</li>
            <li>it loosened right up...</li>
            <li>This is a good economical brush, but even though I took care to keep the handle out of the water when I was soaking the brush, the finish on the handle started to crack and peel on me after just a few shaves.</li>
            <li>I first used the Parker Safety Razor Deluxe 100% Boar Bristle Shaving Brush with Rosewood Handle &amp; Free Shaving Brush Stand (and yes, this is how I describe it to everyone that asks), it was stiff as....</li>
            <li>so far it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been surprised at the lather it stirs up and how smoothly and consistently the lather goes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a nice firm backbone, but the brush tips are soft, and will soften even more in time.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I used it this morning for the first time and I like the way</li>
            <li>Its my first shaving brush ever but</li>
            <li>Feels much better than my previous, cheap brush.  </li>
            <li>Brush easily makes nice thick</li>
            <li>Bristols are good and stiff.</li>
            <li>However, bristles are stiff, and do not generate suffient lather for a good shave.</li>
            <li>This is important for all shaving brushes, but especially important with boars, as they tend to take a little longer to dry out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stupidly, I attempted putting the curve of the handle in the stand (of which it didn&#x27;t fit very well, and scratched the finish a bit), before realizing you just kinda sit it on top with the bristles hanging down.  </li>
            <li>For newcomers to wet shaving boar is a good, traditional choice, because it retains less water and is great for face lathering, but it does require a breaking-in period to soften the bristles and produce a decent lather.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the traditional badger brush which feels much better on the face.  </li>
            <li>this brush does a really good job creating  foam out of very little soap.</li>
            <li>Pretty much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>This one ought to last a good long while.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the job at 1/4 the price , made of the same hair as the more costly brushes , the only reason to purchase a more expensive one is to try to impress someone , or your just a metro male</li>
            <li>This was a nice little combo to include the stand.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I like this one almost as much.</li>
            <li>I think it helps me get a closer shave without having to brush up as much if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>It really helps reduce wasteing unnessecary soap or cream.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>One great plus with this particular brush is that it comes with a free drying stand so you can hang your brush upside down to let it dry properly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great brush, it isn&#x27;t sharp like I hear many badger brushes can be.  </li>
            <li>My first three were various kinds and types of badger; this Parker was my first boar.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff and allows them to lift the facial hair for a good scrub underneath.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are high quality.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat this brush at this price; highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stiff at first, but becomes very forgiving and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with its performance, but I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>New to DE shaving, after forgetting what I learned thirty years ago.</li>
            <li>so I just wiped it all off, so now its plain wood and is nice enough.</li>
            <li>Considering that one of those plastic stands usually goes for 3-4 dollars, this brush is an even better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and the only complain I have is that it does lose a bristle here and there while lathering, other that it works great.</li>
            <li>It lost a few bristles at the beginning, but fine now.</li>
            <li>it was the old drugstore purchase.</li>
            <li>I can get a lot of the soap off of the puck and really create a dense later.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t WOW you</li>
            <li>Then, rinse and load as completely as you can vigorously with shaving soap.</li>
            <li>So far so good and for the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li>I have found that while pure badger hair retains moisture a little better than Boar, the Boar is certainly a little stiffer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t lost any so far and don&#x27;t expect to as long as I treat it right (soaking the bristles before use, letting them dry properly, etc.).</li>
            <li>Only been a few shaves, but I&#x27;m already starting to enjoy the boar bristle.</li>
            <li>My previous non-Parker brush lost too many bristles after a few shaves.</li>
            <li>Also, there were no loose hairs in the sink when I was done shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stiffer than a badger hair brush, so is much easier to get a lather, and I did not find it shedding bristles like my previous badger hair brush</li>
            <li>Let the brush dry completely.</li>
            <li>Only  few bristles came off when I first used it, after that, no problem.</li>
            <li>It produces a quick and thick lather as well.</li>
            <li>Very soft when wet.</li>
            <li>Well, as you may have seen from some of my other reviews, I&#x27;m new to the world of &amp;#</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and the only complain I have is that it does lose a bristle here and there while lathering, other that it works great.</li>
            <li> It lost a few bristles at the beginning, but fine now.</li>
            <li> it was the old drugstore purchase.</li>
            <li> I can get a lot of the soap off of the puck and really create a dense later.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t WOW you</li>
            <li> Then, rinse and load as completely as you can vigorously with shaving soap.</li>

            <li> I have found that while pure badger hair retains moisture a little better than Boar, the Boar is certainly a little stiffer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost any so far and don&#x27;t expect to as long as I treat it right (soaking the bristles before use, letting them dry properly, etc.).</li>

            <li> My previous non-Parker brush lost too many bristles after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Also, there were no loose hairs in the sink when I was done shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiffer than a badger hair brush, so is much easier to get a lather, and I did not find it shedding bristles like my previous badger hair brush</li>
            <li> Let the brush dry completely.</li>
            <li> Only  few bristles came off when I first used it, after that, no problem.</li>

            <li> Could be the quality of my beaver brush, but I like this one because the brush is firm and I rub my face firmly.  </li>

            <li> Bought this Tim for my S-I-L for Christmas. He wanted a boar bristle shaving brush and the stand was a bonus.</li>
            <li> This is a good economical brush, but even though I took care to keep the handle out of the water when I was soaking the brush, the finish on the handle started to crack and peel on me after just a few shaves. I&#x27;m still using it and I&#x27;m satisfied with its performance, but I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband. He loves it!</li>
            <li> excellent quality. Every bit of what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it. Last time I had a brush it was the old drugstore purchase. This time I decided to get s good brush. Only  few bristles came off when I first used it, after that, no problem. I like the texture of the brush. The word appears to be holding up well. I like the fact you get a stand included. (OK a clear plastic stand but still it is a stand. Curious how it compares to a Bagger hair brush. Overall, this brush is a great value. I enjoy using it. In years to come I may move up to a nicer stand (hint hint to my children). I recommend it.</li>
            <li> a gift for someone else, they love it, service and delivery were great.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This one ought to last a good long while. Good sturdy brush. The stand will help it stay that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having the pleasure of using the boar brush for about six weeks and have been enjoying the use of a quality brush. I&#x27;ve used others, but not nearly as nice as this Parker Boar Shaving Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been surprised at the lather it stirs up and how smoothly and consistently the lather goes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take care of it, as suggested, and have lost very few bristles. My previous non-Parker brush lost too many bristles after a few shaves. My Parker brush has a lovely &amp;#34;bloom&amp;#34; to it and holds up remarkably fine. If, and when, this brush sees its last day, which I think won&#x27;t be for a long time, I will replace it with another Parker Shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This product is a good value for the money and a great addition to any wet shaver&#x27;s product line. I also own a pure badger brush from the Art of Shaving store that cost almost 5 times as much but to be honest I like this one almost as much. I have found that while pure badger hair retains moisture a little better than Boar, the Boar is certainly a little stiffer. This can be an advantage for someone like me who has a thick, rough, beard.  I think it helps me get a closer shave without having to brush up as much if that makes sense. I like to pair this with Colonel Conk almond shave soap. Odds are you will like this just fine but try a badger brush too because it feels nice as well. The stiffness of the brush makes for easy lathering of a soap bar as well. Rated 4 stars because the Parker lettering/trim was cheaply printed on but this doesn&#x27;t affect functionality so I just wiped it all off, so now its plain wood and is nice enough.</li>
            <li> A good brush with cake soap that lathers up well and provides a light scrub for your face.</li>
            <li> Item as described and of good quality. Bristols are good and stiff. Brush is Attractive and stand helpful to allow drying.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the job at 1/4 the price , made of the same hair as the more costly brushes , the only reason to purchase a more expensive one is to try to impress someone , or your just a metro male</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for several years now and this is my fourth brush. My first three were various kinds and types of badger; this Parker was my first boar. I was very hesitant to try a boar brush, seeing as how much I liked my badgers, but after reading around on forums like Badger and Blade about how good boar brushes were at lathering soaps, I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for badgers in general, I think they are great for lathering soap. They have a nice firm backbone, but the brush tips are soft, and will soften even more in time. I like that I can get a lot of the soap off of the puck and really create a dense later. My plan is to use this boar for soaps and my badgers for creams going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the specifics of this brush, the handle is nice; better than what it looks like in the pictures. It has a nice rosewood finish and the gloss is nice. The handle is also well balanced and feels quality in your hand. The bristles are high quality. I haven&#x27;t lost any so far and don&#x27;t expect to as long as I treat it right (soaking the bristles before use, letting them dry properly, etc.). One great plus with this particular brush is that it comes with a free drying stand so you can hang your brush upside down to let it dry properly. This is important for all shaving brushes, but especially important with boars, as they tend to take a little longer to dry out. Considering that one of those plastic stands usually goes for 3-4 dollars, this brush is an even better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, this is a great brush and I am certainly happy with its performance. It makes an outstanding lather off of a puck of shaving soap; so much that my badgers might be relegated to back-up status. This would be great for a beginner, or someone who wants to branch out from badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertized</li>
            <li> I enjoy it. I start out with it dry and use some gel. I shave then it has enough gel on it to use a second time. I always wash it off and have it sit on the holder. I did a lot of research and chose this one. Good price also.</li>
            <li> Works great. This was my first shave brush and it works fine. I bought the boar hair thinking that the stiffer bristles would eventually soften up. I have had it for at least a year and this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. I will get a badger hair brush this winter and see if I like it better.</li>
            <li> Great brush, super comfy!</li>
            <li> This is a well constructed and dense brush, but the bristles are too stiff for my preference.  The brush doesn&#x27;t readily whip up a good lather.  I much prefer the traditional badger brush which feels much better on the face.  Of course...all a matter of personal preference.</li>
            <li> Only been a few shaves, but I&#x27;m already starting to enjoy the boar bristle. This was a nice little combo to include the stand. Definitely would recommend as a good starter boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Nice size, hold its shape well. Good value. The only comment is that the paint that has the parker name wears off almost immediately. The rose wood handle is very classy. Recommended.</li>
            <li> If you have any shaving soaps that are a bit hard to lather up then try a boar bristle brush. This brush is a lot stiffer than your badger hair brush and for me it works up a quick lather. Even though it is a stiffer brush it still feels good on my face. Its nice to have in my rotation of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish seems good and no bristles have fallen out. So far so good and for the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong. I give it four stars for now because I have not had it long enough to see if it will stand the test of time. It&#x27;s nice, I like it and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, especially for the price. In the past I bought some cheaper products and the brush would fall apart and when you look down at the sink all the hairs from the brush are their, but not this brush. Also it feels great against your face. Awesome !!!, I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well, as you may have seen from some of my other reviews, I&#x27;m new to the world of &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used the Parker Safety Razor Deluxe 100% Boar Bristle Shaving Brush with Rosewood Handle &amp; Free Shaving Brush Stand (and yes, this is how I describe it to everyone that asks), it was stiff as....well...ya know.  It was stiff.  After working it through some Col. Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum (smells amazing) soap and some water...it loosened right up...just like a businessman&#x27;s collar after a day of staff meetings *shudder*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stupidly, I attempted putting the curve of the handle in the stand (of which it didn&#x27;t fit very well, and scratched the finish a bit), before realizing you just kinda sit it on top with the bristles hanging down.  Fits much better that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great brush, it isn&#x27;t sharp like I hear many badger brushes can be.  It&#x27;s stiff at first, but becomes very forgiving and comfortable to use.  I use every other day when shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice looking, reasonably priced natural bristle shaving brush. Won&#x27;t WOW you but it won&#x27; t disappoint you either.(Unless you&#x27;re expecting a silver-tip badger)</li>
            <li> New to DE shaving, after forgetting what I learned thirty years ago. Have used the brush for two months. Very few strands have fallen out, it just works; and is showing slight signs of age, The weight feels nice. The clear plastic stand is nice to use when pre-soaking the brush, so it&#x27;s ready after the shower. Brush easily makes nice thick foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, I have no point of reference.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as I&#x27;d hoped. It lost a few bristles at the beginning, but fine now. Other reviews said it smelled, but I didn&#x27;t notice.</li>
            <li> Works great! Good quality brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is awful and not worth it if it was free. I bought this brush as a sometimes change up from daily brush.  However, bristles are stiff, and do not generate suffient lather for a good shave.</li>
            <li> It feels great, looks nice, and is firm enough to create a nice lather on the face. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have had so far.  The bristles are stiff and allows them to lift the facial hair for a good scrub underneath.  It produces a quick and thick lather as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a badger brush for a while and was looking for an option with stiffer bristles. I read that a boar brush was an option worth considering and so bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do the job. It seems incapable of generating any kind of lather. All it seems to do is fling water and soap all over my bathroom as I try to make it work. The lather was very thin and resulted in a poor shave, particularly on my neck. I used it once then threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: stick with a badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just to clarify...this review is not based on the quality of the brush itself but how bad the boar bristles are at generating useful lather.)</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the brush, it makes shaving a more enjoyable experience. Seems to be good quality hasn&#x27;t shed  or lost it&#x27;s shape which is partly because of the brush stand. I would and will recommend this to others.    Update Dec 2014  The brush is still as good as when I got it over two years ago.  If I ever wear this thing out I will buy another and I recommend them to everyone</li>
            <li> this brush does a really good job creating  foam out of very little soap. It really helps reduce wasteing unnessecary soap or cream. It works really well. I would recomend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive brush that still works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiffer than a badger hair brush, so is much easier to get a lather, and I did not find it shedding bristles like my previous badger hair brush was doing. It&#x27;s not so stiff that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use. Overall, I am pleased with it. Nice that it comes with a stand also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has now been two years since I bought this brush. It is still going strong! I have only lost a few bristles. I use it, shake it off and hang it up. I shave 2x per week, so that&#x27;s over 200 shaves...That&#x27;s a great value, for sure.</li>
            <li> This well-made boar brush is a great bargain.  For newcomers to wet shaving boar is a good, traditional choice, because it retains less water and is great for face lathering, but it does require a breaking-in period to soften the bristles and produce a decent lather. You can get advice on this from the shaving forums, but a simple break-in method is to soak the bush in dish detergent and water for several hours. Then, rinse and load as completely as you can vigorously with shaving soap. Let the brush dry completely. Repeat this cycle several times to soften the stiff boar bristles.</li>
            <li> Feels much better than my previous, cheap brush.  Very soft when wet.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I know that everyone says &amp;#34;get a beaver brush&amp;#34; but I like this brush better than my beaver one. Could be the quality of my beaver brush, but I like this one because the brush is firm and I rub my face firmly.  My beaver is so soft I can&#x27;t push firmly without the handle hitting my face(best I can describe it.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a softer shave brush for the last year and decided to give a firmer brush a try. I used it this morning for the first time and I like the way it &amp;#34;wakes up my beard&amp;#34; while lathering the shave cream. Also, there were no loose hairs in the sink when I was done shaving.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this brush at this price; highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Its my first shaving brush ever but so far it seems to work fine. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and the only complain I have is that it does lose a bristle here and there while lathering, other that it works great.</li>
            <li> Have fancy silver tip and this one...I use this one.</li>
            <li> good quality and a good price.  no shedding at all.  works as a boar brush should.  handle looks great and feels nice in your hand.</li>
