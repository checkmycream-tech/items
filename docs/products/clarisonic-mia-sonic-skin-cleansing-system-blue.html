    <ol>
            <li>I got my package on time was very happy about that</li>
            <li>This is one of the best things- if not</li>
            <li>THE best- you can do for your skin.</li>
            <li>If I have eye makeup on I&#x27;ll wash my eye area after I use the Mia, and my skin is feeling awesome.  </li>
            <li>best price ive seen online for this thing.</li>
            <li>Cleans my face perfectly.</li>
            <li>How great is that?!</li>
            <li>Really great product.  </li>
            <li>The size is great too since it is so portable for travelling.</li>
            <li>am really happy I bought this.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m perfectly happy with it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product in December and the shipment time and packaging seemed to be great.  </li>
            <li>this is great for removing makeup though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that people have experienced dryness and irritation, and severe breakouts, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any of that.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s particularly happy that she can take it into the shower with her, thank&#x27;s to its \\&quot;plugless\\&quot; recharging system.</li>
            <li>:-P</li>
            <li>but since then she has flawless skin and receives compliments all the time from complete strangers about how perfect her skin is.</li>
            <li>I use this at night and use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Good luck, Clarisonic and the Skin Store.</li>
            <li>the timer works beautifully to make sure face skin is not getting irritated by shutting off after 1 min of operation.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this item!</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while without needing a charge too which is nice.</li>
            <li>Plus, I like having nice skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my own Mia for a couple of years and use it twice a day</li>
            <li>It was nice while it worked.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Clarisonic Mia as a gift for my wife (It was recommended by a dermatologist.), and she is absolutely thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It gives a Nice glowy look to my skin.</li>
            <li>The brush did a great job, but all it could do is to clean your face.</li>
            <li>I think it is one of those things that over time will prove to be a great investment as it will keep my skin acne free and better looking.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packed away neatly in my drawer for another time when I am more apt to trying it again.</li>
            <li>She has had it a month and so far it has been wonderful!</li>
            <li>Seems awesome so far</li>
            <li>Considering how happy she is right now, I&#x27;d have to agree.</li>
            <li>Face feels good and clean.  </li>
            <li>My Clarisonic has been working great this whole time!</li>
            <li>Easy to care for and handy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much more pleased with its over all appearance now.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better for travel.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>However, mine is authentic.</li>
            <li>interesting thing about this product is that, when I pick till I get the mosquito bites, I can wash my face with this and after one minute the \\&quot;bites\\&quot; will be noticeably diminished.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush and on a whim bought this brush, not expecting it to be much more than a spinning face brush.  </li>
            <li>really love this.  </li>
            <li>and my face feels and looks better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>:)   </li>
            <li>While many reviewers said they use it in the shower, the instructions explicitly say not to.</li>
            <li>This thing was great for taking off makeup on the days I wore it, but I really used it for every day maintaince.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>Better than the cheaper ones out their.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>There are many things you CANNOT solve by cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE MY CLARISONIC.</li>
            <li>Make sure you charge it for the 24 hrs before you use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time to be doing something more for my face than pray.  </li>
            <li>-completely pleased,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I did, and nothing ever got better.</li>
            <li>Everything has been a lot better since I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to invest the money into this cleaning brush, but I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the idea of dropping $100 or more about a product if I don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;ll work, but I got an Amazon gift card for Christmas</li>
            <li>have to say that I can already see a difference in the size of my pores, and the break out on my forehead is looking better too.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any more spots than what I had before I started using the Mia.  </li>
            <li>more thing, the Mia come with a magnetic charger...</li>
            <li>Send me a message if you have any questions about my experience.  :)</li>
            <li>Send me a message if you have any questions about my experience.  :)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to take any more chances.</li>
            <li>Over time, I noticed that my skin also got more toned, more plump and a most of all my complexion and skin texture dramatically</li>
            <li>I love about using the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>No matter how soft &amp; mild it claims to be, it works best on oily, healthy</li>
            <li>No matter how soft &amp; mild it claims to be, it works best on oily, healthy</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re super Type-A and love feeling like you can check something off your to-do list every day, the timed face scrubbing the Clarisonic provides is nice.</li>
            <li>Even just after a couple days of using it, I noticed that my skin was clearer in regards to acne and my overall skin tone was better and more radiant, my Mum even asked whether I was wearing makeup because my skin just looked so good!  </li>
            <li>My creams and serums absorb a lot better and it also made a huge difference for when I apply foundation, as it goes on a lot more</li>
            <li>Not only is this item wonderful; it made my skin smooth and poreless,  but when I dropped it in the shower and it broke, I called Clairisonic</li>
            <li>Clean skincare isn&#x27;t just for the ladies, guys!</li>
            <li>My skin always feels wonderfully clean after using it, and I even keep it in the shower!</li>
            <li>however, amazon can be really amazing with their return policies so that&#x27;s always worth a try.</li>
            <li>My friends had been talking about how much they loved their clarisonic, I had never even heard of it.</li>
            <li>I used that a few times (and was impressed with how clean my face felt) and then ordered the version for dry/normal skin which is more appropriate for</li>
            <li>others have said, the Mia is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth!  </li>
            <li>but if you know that, its easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trial-sized face wash that came with the unit was pretty nice, and I would consider buying a full-sized version of the product.  </li>
            <li>I suppose my main point is this: The Mia on its own is not a miracle-worker, but if you find some good products that work for your skin type, it can certainly help improve the state of your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still working perfectly after two and a half years.</li>
            <li>When my daughter began using the Mia after Christmas it worked fine</li>
            <li>At this point, I felt that I should be offered more than a return shipping label and \\&quot;quick shipping\\&quot; of yet another Mia.</li>
            <li>I dont use the cleanser it comes with I use my own, but I really see a difference in my complexion after using it.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a smooth face in the morning.</li>
            <li>everyone else has said, it gives you a really fresh face for creams and treatments and I feel my skin is already looking better</li>
            <li>Gives your face a refined smooth look.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic confirmed that the lot number on this device was invalid because it was not manufactured by Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>--- this size is perfect, and you won&#x27;t need a heavy recharger like Pro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>--- this size is perfect, and you won&#x27;t need a heavy recharger like Pro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only a month, I am happy to say that this is THE addition to my beauty routine I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be as good as the original, but it definitely is.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Clarisonic Mia is worth the investment for cleaning your skin!  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t know what do to because I no longer have the original packing slip</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, worth the price!  </li>
            <li>My face feels so refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic leaves my skin feeling clean and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>I am picky about my face feeling clean -</li>
            <li>after feeling like I just couldn&#x27;t get the bristles clean.</li>
            <li>love my Mia - my skin is visibly clear and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to bust out the CLR or something and try to get them clean.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Mia, though.</li>
            <li>and Im a lot more gentle.</li>
            <li>also, sonic stuff is cool.</li>
            <li>And the charger itself is designed really cool</li>
            <li>Use mostly with my gentle Cetaphil wash - and</li>
            <li>I have been happily using a BufPuf for many years and really didn&#x27;t think I needed any other exfoliating system.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be able to use something without acne control in it and not see consequences for it, but it turned out that a lot of my problem was not being able to exfoliate properly.</li>
            <li>I called The Skin Store, a distributor that carries Clarisonic products, and they sent me a return label and quickly shipped another Mia.....</li>
            <li>either (another awesome side effect from quitting the pill), and I haven&#x27;t really found it necessary to exfoliate as frequently during the week as I was before just because my skill actually looks good and feels awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>came quick and was what is says it was.</li>
            <li>It gets your skin so much cleaner!!</li>
            <li>I think this will also make a great gift to a few people</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the cleanser sample that came with it, but it is too drying for my 50 year old skin, so I just use a gentler cleanser.</li>
            <li>I finally bought one of my own but went with the Mia since it was cheaper</li>
            <li>However, I do not expect that the products alone are what is causing my success, because I have tried a LOT of products.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is how it makes my skin feel, and that is terrific.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing system is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was concerned it was not going to be worth the money, but Clarasonic is.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This system cleans my skin so well and makes my face feel fresh and like it can breathe.</li>
            <li>Need to get more pads, but so far my wife likes it.</li>
            <li>use every night with rare exception.  </li>
            <li>I also love how there are different brushes available to buy depending on your skin needs.  </li>
            <li>This has been, by far, my favorite Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li>It was à purchase that worth every penny.</li>
            <li>On good skin days, I can go out without even putting a sheer foundation on, that&#x27;s how much it improved</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I couldn&#x27;t live without a new one.</li>
            <li>Even though this is for cleaning - i give my makeup a quick wash off first - then use the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to try the Clarisonic and see whether it really was worth all the money and hype, and I tell you, it is!  </li>
            <li>It keeps pulsing and making a beeping noise---this can&#x27;t be right.  </li>
            <li>Immediately called the customer service phone # and have been on hold now for 12 minutes and counting---this can&#x27;t be right either.  </li>
            <li>Following reviewers advice, I made sure to just gliding the brush over my face for the full minute.</li>
            <li>After researching and reading many, many comments from other buyers, I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>--there&#x27;s no plugging-the-charger-into-a-port (because the unit is waterproof) but rather, the charger is magnetic so it just magnetizes right onto the unit.  Very clever!</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the Clarisonic is a worthy investment which provides fantastic results!</li>
            <li>(can&#x27;t do anything about those hormones), but it clears up more quickly when I use this regularly.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t return it now, but certainly will not pay to replace!  </li>
            <li>i have mild acne, and i would not say this helps all that much.</li>
            <li>I would get the occasional breakout like the next person, but I just wanted to brighten my skin and find a good way to clean it.</li>
            <li>but my face was definitely smoother and absorbed moisturizer better after the first use.</li>
            <li>my face is very smooth after using it, pores are smaller than before.</li>
            <li>New gadgets are SUPER fun.</li>
            <li>At first youll break out, because its bringing up that gunk.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t a big skincare junkie, then maybe this isn&#x27;t something you want to spend that much money on, but if you really care for your skin, it&#x27;s an amazing investment.</li>
            <li>He suffered through at least 40, lol.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li>For $100 it should last more than 5 months</li>
            <li>After my first use I could see the difference.</li>
            <li>The power is consistent.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge pretty well too.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after even the first use-</li>
            <li>glad I finally bit the bullet.  </li>
            <li>just be aware that Amazon IS NOT an authorized seller of the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I got this item for $97 through one of the sellers on here, and I was aware of the risks associated with buying from an unauthorized seller before I purchased it.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mia pulsates for one minute exactly, and that&#x27;s all you need from what I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li>They worked exactly 1 month.  </li>
            <li>I got more than 20, actually - and that&#x27;s how I know my Mia can charge fully.  </li>
            <li>Glad that I finally purchased one.</li>
            <li>I also get more out of my beauty products and can actually see and feel that they are working now.</li>
            <li>However, for now I&#x27;m using a Kate Somerville daily gentle face wash (it&#x27;s pricy but smells soooo good and leaves my skin feeling really soft).    </li>
            <li>This hand held gadget smooths away dry flaky patches, great for people with big sand paper pores.</li>
            <li>You find other cheaper cleansing brushes working effectively.</li>
            <li>You find other cheaper cleansing brushes working effectively.</li>
            <li>I really love how this takes the dry flakiness off my face in a very gentle way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on her skin, but she believes it&#x27;s doing a very thorough job.</li>
            <li>I tried drinking more water and watching my diet, exercising more when my back healed, switching to organic face cleaners,  deep purifying masks, homemade face masks/treatments, switching back to my original face regime, using all sorts of spot treatments, basically EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what I wanted, easily and simply.  </li>
            <li>honestly, I think this is majorly overpriced for what you&#x27;re getting, and using a washcloth provides similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes after the minute is up and the unit turns off, I turn it back on (easy, with the press of a button) and use it for another 10-20 seconds if I think I&#x27;ve missed any spots.  </li>
            <li>She is very particular about what she uses on her face.</li>
            <li>But for something that I used (and occasionally dropped) every single day for two years, I&#x27;m impressed it held up so long!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need the large one either, -this will do you fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser it came with yet only because my skin is very sensitive to most products.</li>
            <li>The actual brushing mechanism works fine.  </li>
            <li>My complexion looks so even without makeup and with a little makeup my face honestly looks airbrushed.</li>
            <li>Who references thanks to its sonic technology.</li>
            <li>I also really like that the brush head vibrates as opposed to spinning,</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it gently exfoliates, leaving my skin super-smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice a day from the very beginning and never had any skin reactons or anything.      </li>
            <li>I bought this much to the chagrin of every woman I spoke to about it.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t help much with my acnes...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper with deals, so if you&#x27;re planning to get one, wait for sales.</li>
            <li>My skin was much cleaner and lighter.</li>
            <li>Before using the Clarisonic, I didn&#x27;t really suffer from acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used a gentile Olay cleanser (the one in the light blue pump bottle) and that seems to work just as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any improvements from this thing.</li>
            <li>Since it was a gift from a friend I can&#x27;t very well tell her to return it and get me a real one.  </li>
            <li>Just get some nice face wash and save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re only looking for the facial cleansing part, Mia is effective and handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So as you can see, there are multiple wins for me right out of the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is so easy and the stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li>This gives my skin a deep clean and gently exfoliates without drying.</li>
            <li>I know they have brush heads for sensitive skin, but when my skin becomes sensitive, I won&#x27;t even use a sponge to clean it.</li>
            <li>I know they have brush heads for sensitive skin, but when my skin becomes sensitive, I won&#x27;t even use a sponge to clean it.</li>
            <li>another one of the issues is that the led light doesn&#x27;t always show on the color Mia and it will be suggested you order a white one if you have this particular problem....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quickly becoming addicted, and I really do feel 10% better looking every time I go out</li>
            <li>Definitely a purchase worth every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a week, I started to use it twice a day, every other day to test out if my skin was able to handle it.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t have the beep when you are supposed to change positions on your face (which it neglects to tell you in the product details) and I never felt like my face got clean enough.</li>
            <li>It vibrates slightly (not a noticeable spin like my toothbrush), but somehow manages to make my face feel incredibly clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Until I purchased this, I never felt like my skin was getting clean enough, even when I exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I broke our more when I used it than when I used my regular facial scrub.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE PURCHASE DATE OLDER THAN 90 DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, even at the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helping to clear up my daughter&#x27;s acne when used with an over-the-counter acne scrub such as Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I use it with my normal face wash (either Basis or Neutrogena)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, if only just to see if it&#x27;ll work for you!</li>
            <li>but my wife says it&#x27;s worth paying extra.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I was able to use it twice a day, almost every day.</li>
            <li>In the end, I gave the darn thing to my very type-A boyfriend and he loved it for scrubbing down his beard until the whole thing decided to stop charging no matter how long we left it attached to the power cable.</li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s a long one, but this review is basically my story of how the right products can make this tool a very valuable asset to your face</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most exfoliaters, so my skin trends to be oily and to have a buildup of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I think the Mia model is good and personally don&#x27;t think anything more expensive is actually needed.</li>
            <li>This thing took a little bit of getting used to, but it was because my face had never been so clean!</li>
            <li>It is true that it purges your skin which means you have a breakout the first few times you use it</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to learn that this does not spin.  </li>
            <li>I used a very gentle, simple face soap-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly normal (some combination - oily around T-zone and jawline, dry around nostrils), but most \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleansers either make me dry or oily.</li>
            <li>The ice blue is a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>My face will have increased natural beauty!</li>
            <li>However, after using this for 12 months I found my skin absorbs other external products (like serums) better than before.</li>
            <li>Pro is much more expensive and Mia is enough for most people.</li>
            <li>Everything from the cool magnetic charging system, which allows the device to be used in the shower without worrying about getting water in a charge plug, to the way it fits into my hand makes me appreciate the time spent in its design.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is great, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with only having one speed setting, but it can be a little rough on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>skin is acne prone, and very sensitive, so I did order a set of acne brushes to use instead of the sensitive one it came</li>
            <li>have oily, acne-prone skin with large pores and occasionally break-outs.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to save a little bit of money get it on Amazon, but if you want that warranty make sure to buy it from an authorized seller such as ULTA or from the Clarisonic site.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to save a little bit of money get it on Amazon, but if you want that warranty make sure to buy it from an authorized seller such as ULTA or from the Clarisonic site.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While there are other models, such as the Pro (that I got for my mother) and Plus, I still prefer having this one because its a no fuss (one setting), compact and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;worse\\&quot; stage is by far the easiest one I&#x27;ve ever gone through - and I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I fell for the hype and used this nightly for about 6 months with either the sensitive skin brush or the exfoliating one, and saw no improvement in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It really does minimize pores, although I still break out during my regular intervals on my t-zone.</li>
            <li>skin DID NOT change completely, and I&#x27;m not expecting that.</li>
            <li>You wear make-up frequently.</li>
            <li>You wear make-up frequently.</li>
            <li>only a week my skin has improved SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, yes.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 17 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I used the sensitive brush head</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that it would provide gentle daily exfoliation, but I found that I still had to use a scrub once a week.</li>
            <li>I used the original Clarisonic at my sister&#x27;s house a few times in Denver where my skin gets very dry and dull and I always loved how soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that the charge doesn&#x27;t hold super long, so make sure when you hear the beeps to get it on the charger.</li>
            <li>I use a acne wash with it and my skin does not feel tight it feels clean.</li>
            <li>She uses it everyday and says that it makes her skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I will never order from RobRobie Robin again and I will definitely be uneasy about all other name brand item purchases not coming directly from the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li>This product recently went caput on me after over two years of faithful service, and I can&#x27;t wait to order a new one!</li>
            <li>I wet my face and the brush with warm water, put a small amount of gel</li>
            <li>This means that the warranty on the item is no good, and if you want the warranty you&#x27;ll have to purchase it from the Clarisonic site, or some kind of store such as ULTA.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do any heavy research or anything, just saw it at Macy&#x27;s and thought it looked cool and so ordered it on Amazon to save some money.  </li>
            <li>Just received my new Clarisonic and, following directions, plugged it in to charge for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>also, I&#x27;m just generally unimpressed by this.</li>
            <li>Mine broke after 2 years and Clarisonic only offers a 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li>So, if you have sensitive skin and acne, I definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li>After only 3 days of use my skin turned baby soft.</li>
            <li>(I had already switched from the sensitive to the acne brush once a day only).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not recommending you do the same, but that&#x27;s just what seems to work for me so far.  </li>
            <li>I am a 27-year-old female, with very light complexion, and I usually have normal skin with few breakouts during the year.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, my breakouts are minimal, and the pre-existing problems are almost clear.</li>
            <li>The recharger works in USA, China, Hong Kong, UK and several Continental European countries (Germany, France, Italy and Belgium) without a transformer (you&#x27;ll need an adapter, of course), so far I&#x27;ve been tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would get occasional breakouts but nothing major.</li>
            <li>I definitely have no regrets about this product.</li>
            <li>Cleaners for dry skin make me VERY oily, and cleansers for oily faces make me so dry that I peel.</li>
            <li>I will say, you really do need to follow the instructions as they relate to not pressing down as it can lead to irritation.</li>
            <li>I also finally went to a dermatologist and they actually recommend against it pretty firmly.</li>
            <li>After a month or regular use, dry patches on my cheeks are soft, while my T-zone doesn&#x27;t get as oily as it used to.</li>
            <li>I think it really depends on the cleanser that you use with the clarisonic because I found that some facial cleansers I was using with it broke me out a little bit</li>
            <li>but when I started using the clarsonic to clean my skin that tight feeling isn&#x27;t as tight.</li>
            <li>I could see how your face could become dried out and irritated if you did push the Mia hard against your skin...just don&#x27;t do it. :)&lt;</li>

            <li> I purchased this product in December and the shipment time and packaging seemed to be great.  </li>
            <li> this is great for removing makeup though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that people have experienced dryness and irritation, and severe breakouts, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any of that.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s particularly happy that she can take it into the shower with her, thank&#x27;s to its \\&quot;plugless\\&quot; recharging system.</li>
            <li> :-P</li>
            <li> but since then she has flawless skin and receives compliments all the time from complete strangers about how perfect her skin is.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Good luck, Clarisonic and the Skin Store.</li>
            <li> the timer works beautifully to make sure face skin is not getting irritated by shutting off after 1 min of operation.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this item!</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while without needing a charge too which is nice.</li>
            <li> Plus, I like having nice skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my own Mia for a couple of years and use it twice a day</li>
            <li> It was nice while it worked.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia as a gift for my wife (It was recommended by a dermatologist.), and she is absolutely thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It gives a Nice glowy look to my skin.</li>
            <li> The brush did a great job, but all it could do is to clean your face.</li>
            <li> I think it is one of those things that over time will prove to be a great investment as it will keep my skin acne free and better looking.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packed away neatly in my drawer for another time when I am more apt to trying it again.</li>
            <li> She has had it a month and so far it has been wonderful!</li>
            <li> Seems awesome so far</li>
            <li> Considering how happy she is right now, I&#x27;d have to agree.</li>
            <li> Face feels good and clean.  </li>
            <li> My Clarisonic has been working great this whole time!</li>
            <li> Easy to care for and handy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much more pleased with its over all appearance now.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better for travel.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> However, mine is authentic.</li>
            <li> interesting thing about this product is that, when I pick till I get the mosquito bites, I can wash my face with this and after one minute the \\&quot;bites\\&quot; will be noticeably diminished.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and on a whim bought this brush, not expecting it to be much more than a spinning face brush.  </li>
            <li> really love this.  </li>
            <li> and my face feels and looks better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> :)   </li>
            <li> While many reviewers said they use it in the shower, the instructions explicitly say not to.</li>
            <li> This thing was great for taking off makeup on the days I wore it, but I really used it for every day maintaince.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> Better than the cheaper ones out their.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> There are many things you CANNOT solve by cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY CLARISONIC.</li>
            <li> Make sure you charge it for the 24 hrs before you use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to be doing something more for my face than pray.  </li>
            <li> -completely pleased,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I did, and nothing ever got better.</li>
            <li> Everything has been a lot better since I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to invest the money into this cleaning brush, but I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of dropping $100 or more about a product if I don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;ll work, but I got an Amazon gift card for Christmas</li>
            <li> have to say that I can already see a difference in the size of my pores, and the break out on my forehead is looking better too.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any more spots than what I had before I started using the Mia.  </li>
            <li> more thing, the Mia come with a magnetic charger...</li>
            <li> Send me a message if you have any questions about my experience.  :)</li>
            <li> Send me a message if you have any questions about my experience.  :)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to take any more chances.</li>
            <li> Over time, I noticed that my skin also got more toned, more plump and a most of all my complexion and skin texture dramatically</li>
            <li> I love about using the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> No matter how soft &amp; mild it claims to be, it works best on oily, healthy</li>
            <li> No matter how soft &amp; mild it claims to be, it works best on oily, healthy</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re super Type-A and love feeling like you can check something off your to-do list every day, the timed face scrubbing the Clarisonic provides is nice.</li>
            <li> Even just after a couple days of using it, I noticed that my skin was clearer in regards to acne and my overall skin tone was better and more radiant, my Mum even asked whether I was wearing makeup because my skin just looked so good!  </li>
            <li> My creams and serums absorb a lot better and it also made a huge difference for when I apply foundation, as it goes on a lot more</li>
            <li> Not only is this item wonderful; it made my skin smooth and poreless,  but when I dropped it in the shower and it broke, I called Clairisonic</li>
            <li> Clean skincare isn&#x27;t just for the ladies, guys!</li>
            <li> My skin always feels wonderfully clean after using it, and I even keep it in the shower!</li>
            <li> however, amazon can be really amazing with their return policies so that&#x27;s always worth a try.</li>
            <li> My friends had been talking about how much they loved their clarisonic, I had never even heard of it.</li>
            <li> I used that a few times (and was impressed with how clean my face felt) and then ordered the version for dry/normal skin which is more appropriate for</li>
            <li> others have said, the Mia is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth!  </li>
            <li> but if you know that, its easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trial-sized face wash that came with the unit was pretty nice, and I would consider buying a full-sized version of the product.  </li>
            <li> I suppose my main point is this: The Mia on its own is not a miracle-worker, but if you find some good products that work for your skin type, it can certainly help improve the state of your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still working perfectly after two and a half years.</li>
            <li> When my daughter began using the Mia after Christmas it worked fine</li>
            <li> At this point, I felt that I should be offered more than a return shipping label and \\&quot;quick shipping\\&quot; of yet another Mia.</li>
            <li> I dont use the cleanser it comes with I use my own, but I really see a difference in my complexion after using it.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a smooth face in the morning.</li>
            <li> everyone else has said, it gives you a really fresh face for creams and treatments and I feel my skin is already looking better</li>
            <li> Gives your face a refined smooth look.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic confirmed that the lot number on this device was invalid because it was not manufactured by Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> --- this size is perfect, and you won&#x27;t need a heavy recharger like Pro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> --- this size is perfect, and you won&#x27;t need a heavy recharger like Pro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only a month, I am happy to say that this is THE addition to my beauty routine I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be as good as the original, but it definitely is.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Clarisonic Mia is worth the investment for cleaning your skin!  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know what do to because I no longer have the original packing slip</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, worth the price!  </li>
            <li> My face feels so refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic leaves my skin feeling clean and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I am picky about my face feeling clean -</li>
            <li> after feeling like I just couldn&#x27;t get the bristles clean.</li>
            <li> love my Mia - my skin is visibly clear and smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to bust out the CLR or something and try to get them clean.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Mia, though.</li>
            <li> and Im a lot more gentle.</li>
            <li> also, sonic stuff is cool.</li>
            <li> And the charger itself is designed really cool</li>
            <li> Use mostly with my gentle Cetaphil wash - and</li>
            <li> I have been happily using a BufPuf for many years and really didn&#x27;t think I needed any other exfoliating system.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to use something without acne control in it and not see consequences for it, but it turned out that a lot of my problem was not being able to exfoliate properly.</li>
            <li> I called The Skin Store, a distributor that carries Clarisonic products, and they sent me a return label and quickly shipped another Mia.....</li>
            <li> either (another awesome side effect from quitting the pill), and I haven&#x27;t really found it necessary to exfoliate as frequently during the week as I was before just because my skill actually looks good and feels awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> came quick and was what is says it was.</li>
            <li> It gets your skin so much cleaner!!</li>
            <li> I think this will also make a great gift to a few people</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cleanser sample that came with it, but it is too drying for my 50 year old skin, so I just use a gentler cleanser.</li>
            <li> I finally bought one of my own but went with the Mia since it was cheaper</li>
            <li> However, I do not expect that the products alone are what is causing my success, because I have tried a LOT of products.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is how it makes my skin feel, and that is terrific.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing system is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it was not going to be worth the money, but Clarasonic is.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This system cleans my skin so well and makes my face feel fresh and like it can breathe.</li>
            <li> Need to get more pads, but so far my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> use every night with rare exception.  </li>
            <li> I also love how there are different brushes available to buy depending on your skin needs.  </li>
            <li> This has been, by far, my favorite Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> It was à purchase that worth every penny.</li>
            <li> On good skin days, I can go out without even putting a sheer foundation on, that&#x27;s how much it improved</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much that I couldn&#x27;t live without a new one.</li>
            <li> Even though this is for cleaning - i give my makeup a quick wash off first - then use the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to try the Clarisonic and see whether it really was worth all the money and hype, and I tell you, it is!  </li>
            <li> It keeps pulsing and making a beeping noise---this can&#x27;t be right.  </li>
            <li> Immediately called the customer service phone # and have been on hold now for 12 minutes and counting---this can&#x27;t be right either.  </li>
            <li> Following reviewers advice, I made sure to just gliding the brush over my face for the full minute.</li>
            <li> After researching and reading many, many comments from other buyers, I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> --there&#x27;s no plugging-the-charger-into-a-port (because the unit is waterproof) but rather, the charger is magnetic so it just magnetizes right onto the unit.  Very clever!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think the Clarisonic is a worthy investment which provides fantastic results!</li>
            <li> (can&#x27;t do anything about those hormones), but it clears up more quickly when I use this regularly.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t return it now, but certainly will not pay to replace!  </li>
            <li> i have mild acne, and i would not say this helps all that much.</li>
            <li> I would get the occasional breakout like the next person, but I just wanted to brighten my skin and find a good way to clean it.</li>
            <li> but my face was definitely smoother and absorbed moisturizer better after the first use.</li>
            <li> my face is very smooth after using it, pores are smaller than before.</li>
            <li> New gadgets are SUPER fun.</li>
            <li> At first youll break out, because its bringing up that gunk.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t a big skincare junkie, then maybe this isn&#x27;t something you want to spend that much money on, but if you really care for your skin, it&#x27;s an amazing investment.</li>
            <li> He suffered through at least 40, lol.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li> For $100 it should last more than 5 months</li>
            <li> After my first use I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> The power is consistent.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge pretty well too.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after even the first use-</li>
            <li> glad I finally bit the bullet.  </li>
            <li> just be aware that Amazon IS NOT an authorized seller of the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I got this item for $97 through one of the sellers on here, and I was aware of the risks associated with buying from an unauthorized seller before I purchased it.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mia pulsates for one minute exactly, and that&#x27;s all you need from what I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li> They worked exactly 1 month.  </li>
            <li> I got more than 20, actually - and that&#x27;s how I know my Mia can charge fully.  </li>
            <li> Glad that I finally purchased one.</li>
            <li> I also get more out of my beauty products and can actually see and feel that they are working now.</li>
            <li> However, for now I&#x27;m using a Kate Somerville daily gentle face wash (it&#x27;s pricy but smells soooo good and leaves my skin feeling really soft).    </li>
            <li> This hand held gadget smooths away dry flaky patches, great for people with big sand paper pores.</li>
            <li> You find other cheaper cleansing brushes working effectively.</li>
            <li> You find other cheaper cleansing brushes working effectively.</li>
            <li> I really love how this takes the dry flakiness off my face in a very gentle way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on her skin, but she believes it&#x27;s doing a very thorough job.</li>
            <li> I tried drinking more water and watching my diet, exercising more when my back healed, switching to organic face cleaners,  deep purifying masks, homemade face masks/treatments, switching back to my original face regime, using all sorts of spot treatments, basically EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I wanted, easily and simply.  </li>
            <li> honestly, I think this is majorly overpriced for what you&#x27;re getting, and using a washcloth provides similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes after the minute is up and the unit turns off, I turn it back on (easy, with the press of a button) and use it for another 10-20 seconds if I think I&#x27;ve missed any spots.  </li>
            <li> She is very particular about what she uses on her face.</li>
            <li> But for something that I used (and occasionally dropped) every single day for two years, I&#x27;m impressed it held up so long!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need the large one either, -this will do you fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser it came with yet only because my skin is very sensitive to most products.</li>
            <li> The actual brushing mechanism works fine.  </li>
            <li> My complexion looks so even without makeup and with a little makeup my face honestly looks airbrushed.</li>
            <li> Who references thanks to its sonic technology.</li>
            <li> I also really like that the brush head vibrates as opposed to spinning,</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it gently exfoliates, leaving my skin super-smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice a day from the very beginning and never had any skin reactons or anything.      </li>
            <li> I bought this much to the chagrin of every woman I spoke to about it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t help much with my acnes...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper with deals, so if you&#x27;re planning to get one, wait for sales.</li>
            <li> My skin was much cleaner and lighter.</li>
            <li> Before using the Clarisonic, I didn&#x27;t really suffer from acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used a gentile Olay cleanser (the one in the light blue pump bottle) and that seems to work just as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any improvements from this thing.</li>
            <li> Since it was a gift from a friend I can&#x27;t very well tell her to return it and get me a real one.  </li>
            <li> Just get some nice face wash and save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re only looking for the facial cleansing part, Mia is effective and handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So as you can see, there are multiple wins for me right out of the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is so easy and the stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> This gives my skin a deep clean and gently exfoliates without drying.</li>
            <li> I know they have brush heads for sensitive skin, but when my skin becomes sensitive, I won&#x27;t even use a sponge to clean it.</li>
            <li> I know they have brush heads for sensitive skin, but when my skin becomes sensitive, I won&#x27;t even use a sponge to clean it.</li>
            <li> another one of the issues is that the led light doesn&#x27;t always show on the color Mia and it will be suggested you order a white one if you have this particular problem....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quickly becoming addicted, and I really do feel 10% better looking every time I go out</li>
            <li> Definitely a purchase worth every penny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week, I started to use it twice a day, every other day to test out if my skin was able to handle it.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t have the beep when you are supposed to change positions on your face (which it neglects to tell you in the product details) and I never felt like my face got clean enough.</li>
            <li> It vibrates slightly (not a noticeable spin like my toothbrush), but somehow manages to make my face feel incredibly clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Until I purchased this, I never felt like my skin was getting clean enough, even when I exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I broke our more when I used it than when I used my regular facial scrub.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE PURCHASE DATE OLDER THAN 90 DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, even at the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping to clear up my daughter&#x27;s acne when used with an over-the-counter acne scrub such as Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use it with my normal face wash (either Basis or Neutrogena)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, if only just to see if it&#x27;ll work for you!</li>
            <li> but my wife says it&#x27;s worth paying extra.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I was able to use it twice a day, almost every day.</li>
            <li> In the end, I gave the darn thing to my very type-A boyfriend and he loved it for scrubbing down his beard until the whole thing decided to stop charging no matter how long we left it attached to the power cable.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s a long one, but this review is basically my story of how the right products can make this tool a very valuable asset to your face</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most exfoliaters, so my skin trends to be oily and to have a buildup of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I think the Mia model is good and personally don&#x27;t think anything more expensive is actually needed.</li>
            <li> This thing took a little bit of getting used to, but it was because my face had never been so clean!</li>
            <li> It is true that it purges your skin which means you have a breakout the first few times you use it</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to learn that this does not spin.  </li>
            <li> I used a very gentle, simple face soap-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly normal (some combination - oily around T-zone and jawline, dry around nostrils), but most \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleansers either make me dry or oily.</li>
            <li> The ice blue is a really pretty color.</li>
            <li> My face will have increased natural beauty!</li>
            <li> However, after using this for 12 months I found my skin absorbs other external products (like serums) better than before.</li>
            <li> Pro is much more expensive and Mia is enough for most people.</li>
            <li> Everything from the cool magnetic charging system, which allows the device to be used in the shower without worrying about getting water in a charge plug, to the way it fits into my hand makes me appreciate the time spent in its design.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is great, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with only having one speed setting, but it can be a little rough on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> skin is acne prone, and very sensitive, so I did order a set of acne brushes to use instead of the sensitive one it came</li>
            <li> have oily, acne-prone skin with large pores and occasionally break-outs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to save a little bit of money get it on Amazon, but if you want that warranty make sure to buy it from an authorized seller such as ULTA or from the Clarisonic site.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to save a little bit of money get it on Amazon, but if you want that warranty make sure to buy it from an authorized seller such as ULTA or from the Clarisonic site.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While there are other models, such as the Pro (that I got for my mother) and Plus, I still prefer having this one because its a no fuss (one setting), compact and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;worse\\&quot; stage is by far the easiest one I&#x27;ve ever gone through - and I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I fell for the hype and used this nightly for about 6 months with either the sensitive skin brush or the exfoliating one, and saw no improvement in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It really does minimize pores, although I still break out during my regular intervals on my t-zone.</li>
            <li> skin DID NOT change completely, and I&#x27;m not expecting that.</li>
            <li> You wear make-up frequently.</li>
            <li> You wear make-up frequently.</li>
            <li> only a week my skin has improved SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, yes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I used the sensitive brush head</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that it would provide gentle daily exfoliation, but I found that I still had to use a scrub once a week.</li>
            <li> I used the original Clarisonic at my sister&#x27;s house a few times in Denver where my skin gets very dry and dull and I always loved how soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the charge doesn&#x27;t hold super long, so make sure when you hear the beeps to get it on the charger.</li>
            <li> I use a acne wash with it and my skin does not feel tight it feels clean.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday and says that it makes her skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I will never order from RobRobie Robin again and I will definitely be uneasy about all other name brand item purchases not coming directly from the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This product recently went caput on me after over two years of faithful service, and I can&#x27;t wait to order a new one!</li>
            <li> I wet my face and the brush with warm water, put a small amount of gel</li>
            <li> This means that the warranty on the item is no good, and if you want the warranty you&#x27;ll have to purchase it from the Clarisonic site, or some kind of store such as ULTA.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do any heavy research or anything, just saw it at Macy&#x27;s and thought it looked cool and so ordered it on Amazon to save some money.  </li>
            <li> Just received my new Clarisonic and, following directions, plugged it in to charge for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> also, I&#x27;m just generally unimpressed by this.</li>
            <li> Mine broke after 2 years and Clarisonic only offers a 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li> So, if you have sensitive skin and acne, I definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> After only 3 days of use my skin turned baby soft.</li>
            <li> (I had already switched from the sensitive to the acne brush once a day only).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not recommending you do the same, but that&#x27;s just what seems to work for me so far.  </li>
            <li> I am a 27-year-old female, with very light complexion, and I usually have normal skin with few breakouts during the year.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, my breakouts are minimal, and the pre-existing problems are almost clear.</li>
            <li> The recharger works in USA, China, Hong Kong, UK and several Continental European countries (Germany, France, Italy and Belgium) without a transformer (you&#x27;ll need an adapter, of course), so far I&#x27;ve been tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would get occasional breakouts but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I definitely have no regrets about this product.</li>
            <li> Cleaners for dry skin make me VERY oily, and cleansers for oily faces make me so dry that I peel.</li>
            <li> I will say, you really do need to follow the instructions as they relate to not pressing down as it can lead to irritation.</li>
            <li> I also finally went to a dermatologist and they actually recommend against it pretty firmly.</li>
            <li> After a month or regular use, dry patches on my cheeks are soft, while my T-zone doesn&#x27;t get as oily as it used to.</li>
            <li> I think it really depends on the cleanser that you use with the clarisonic because I found that some facial cleansers I was using with it broke me out a little bit</li>
            <li> but when I started using the clarsonic to clean my skin that tight feeling isn&#x27;t as tight.</li>
            <li> I could see how your face could become dried out and irritated if you did push the Mia hard against your skin...just don&#x27;t do it. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> She loved it, then JUST after the refund end date it became possessed and turned on randomly and is now dead.</li>
            <li> I called customer service and they offered to cut the price of a new one down to $60.00 plus $25.00 for a brush head totalling $75.00 plus shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li> being said, I&#x27;m also using new face cleansing products in conjunction with the Mia, which I had not used previously.</li>
            <li> Reasons for large pores is complicated, and the daily cleansing process only works on the surface to prevent acne and blackheads (and both of these problems cannot be completely solved by cleansing!).</li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft and my forehead lines are much less noticible.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful on areas that are not flat (nose, chin), as if you curve too much it can cause small micro-tears...</li>
            <li> Note that charger holds on to handle magnetically, charging makes a funny annoying noise, and handle can easily be accidentally knocked from the charger.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product as a Christmas present for 12/13 along with two others from different companies and have had no problems with the other two</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily in summer and once daily in other time.</li>
            <li> and lately I&#x27;ve been very self-conscious of my forehead lines.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for something to clear skin and leave it smoother and brighter, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Follow the guidelines in the instruction booklet for how long to linger in each area of your face.</li>
            <li> I was worried it might be too harsh, since I have sensitive skin, but I have not found that to be the case.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower sometimes) and that it holds a charge for so long.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and a few short months later, it just stopped working all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this is just hype, but if you have sensitive skin, just walk away from it before you waste your money, time, and the health of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I keep mine in the shower and the battery keeps a long life as well.  </li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The zits are few in number (less than 10) but large in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These should have been removed from the website a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product very long</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> Before, if I were to do the pore clean out-routine before bed (ie, scouring my face closely in a mirror for anything resembling a clogged pore), I&#x27;d probably still have some angry bumps on my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> If I see that my skin becomes dry or irritated, I&#x27;ll go to one minute.  </li>
            <li> Finally I broke down and bought the Clarisonic Mia, although I have to say I had waited a long time because of the price</li>
            <li> This product is not worth it if only lasts for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking at various spin brushes, which sell for much less than this Clarisonic, but didn&#x27;t think I needed one.  </li>
            <li> another one that did not charge, but only made odd pulsing sounds.</li>
            <li> and also this particular distributor does not offer any serious customer service.</li>
            <li> I commented on how the five little pore-cleaning pricks bothered me and he was astounded at the fact that I&#x27;d had only five.  </li>
            <li> They told me that it was typical to break out initially but to stick with it once every other day.</li>
            <li> I threw away $100 on a fake when I could have bought the REAL thing for the same $$ and</li>
            <li> Mia is totally enough for common, facial use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always not recommended to over-do your face that it loses its natural protections.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always not recommended to over-do your face that it loses its natural protections.</li>
            <li> If I have something that even looks remotely like a clogged pore, I will pinch and pick at it until it looks like I&#x27;ve been bitten by a mosquito.</li>
            <li> I spent close to $100 for this product, had to return a malfunctioning unit once, and now was being asked to return yet another malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> I contacted Clarisonic with my problem a few days after I decided that this was definitely a problem</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll wet my face and the brush head</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t supposed to have this headache of calling customer service, or the hassle of testing it; it was just supposed to do what it said in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, getting the brush head off the handle for cleaning is an ordeal, and after only two weeks, the three little connector thingies that hold the brush head to the handle are CAKED with rust and other stuff that I can&#x27;t even identify.  </li>
            <li> So, in the end, I requested a refund of my money, and I will certainly not be ordering any Mia for gifts.</li>
            <li> I got a few new broken capillaries when using this, and they are quite big.</li>
            <li> Amazon states that since it is past the 30 day refund window they will only do a partial refund.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and have not had any problems with breakouts or any other</li>
            <li> as I see other customers of this company have stated, rusted on the three prongs holding the scrubbing disk and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like having a mini facial everyday!</li>
            <li> you are also considering other series of the Clarisonic brushes and can&#x27;t decide...</li>
            <li> Put this off due to price, -but</li>
            <li> &quot; DUE TO CLARISONIC</li>
            <li> I have bought other models by other makers and none of them even come close to this.</li>
            <li> note: that did NOT influence my ratings for this product, but I wanted to include this in this review so other people could be informed.</li>
            <li> I should have known when I when I received the product that I was not getting what I had believed I was purchasing The original packaging it came in was badly dented which gave me the impression that it was not new as stated.</li>
            <li> #34;no problem, we&#x27;ll send you a new one and a return envelope to return the broken one&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I felt extremely guilty making this purchase, but some amazon bucks from my credit card gave me enough of an excuse, so I finally went ahead and did it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (just a little, not to where the brush is dripping wet)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t press the Mia hard against my skin, that&#x27;s not necessary to get the dirt and makeup off of your face, just be gentile.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I will be buying my next one at Nordstrom, where I know they will at least allow returns of defective items.</li>
            <li> the only negative thing I can say about this tool, unless I just got a crappy magnet in my charger.  </li>
            <li> my skin, I started slowly by using it only once a day for my night routine.</li>
            <li> so basically it&#x27;s $100 down the drain.</li>
            <li> This product broke down after eight months of use.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets cleaned with less maniupulation than a wash rag</li>
            <li> I suggest ordering the brush heads for sensitive skin if you are afraid of having the same situation.</li>
            <li> While it was working, it did seem to help my skin but not enough to consider such an expensive item a disposable skin care tool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I started using the Mia the appearance and feel of my skin was slightly improved...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I order a new item</li>
            <li> My skin is more oily, peels like mad, and I too have gotten the weird breakouts that other reviewers in this category (one star) were talking about.</li>
            <li> *Just a little background:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this about a week, and I&#x27;m firmly in the \\&quot;it&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> which is what the Sigma one does because then the product and water goes everywhere, also the Clarisonic isn&#x27;t as harsh as the Sigma is on your skin.</li>
            <li> and they tell me that the machine I have is not genuine</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for a few weeks and it lost charge.  </li>
            <li> and my complexion cleared up drastically within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> WE tested the hookup etc., got a few beeps and</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need deep-cleansing products, this brush could be too harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need deep-cleansing products, this brush could be too harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> After three month&#x27;s use, every seam on the unit has rust stains and it has completely malfunctioned rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> When I contacted Clarisonic regarding trouble shooting and warranty, I was told the the lot number on the unit is not theirs.  </li>
            <li> I bought my Mia a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t take care of my acne, it does help to keep it under control and heel within a few days.</li>
            <li> I am slowly weening myself from foundation everyday and with Clarisonic in about a month in conjunction with a dark spot cream</li>
            <li> Buy this from the Clairsonic website to avoid this mess!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Current routine:&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Mia with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for All Skin Types&lt;br /&gt;Night: Picking routine (definitely don&#x27;t recommend this part, of course - what a bad habit!)</li>
            <li> no regrets for this expensive bursh~</li>
            <li> I wear very little make-up, if any, and usually don&#x27;t moisturizer because all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried make me feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, fits well in my hand too.</li>
            <li> I get relatively small breakouts every now and then, usually resulting from me obsessively picking at my face, but not always.</li>
            <li> This is obviously not a magic solution</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the cleaner that comes with the tool,</li>
            <li> Just posting this to save someone else the trouble from this product!</li>
            <li> This is an expensive little machine, so I expected it to operate according to the instructions.  </li>
            <li> saw a difference within a few days, but it was subtle.</li>
            <li> (not that it was terrible to begin with) and it hasn&#x27;t even been two full weeks!  </li>
            <li> So why, in this delicate position, am I giving it 5 stars?</li>
            <li> (at least that&#x27;s what happened to her),</li>
            <li> I now see that this is a common them with this vendor and there is no way to contact them.</li>
            <li> And now a few days after its broken</li>
            <li> - when they say one minute, they mean one minute.</li>
            <li> I mean any hard-to-remove products, including water-proof sunscreens, long-lasting foundations, pore-filling primers, etc.&lt;br</li>

            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something to completely change your skin, you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am shocked because everything looks the same!!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that Amazon would link me to a seller that is not authorized and is apparently selling counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out like CRAZY, due to the meds and stress</li>
            <li> the magnet seems a bit weak when you attach it to the Mia, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> By the time I tried to register it, it was too late (out of return period)!</li>
            <li> Those then usually turn into very angry pimples that usually leave scars.</li>
            <li> saw where lots of folks got fake Mias a couple years or so after I bought mine, which totally sucks.</li>
            <li> get worse before it gets</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was too late for a return by then</li>
            <li> and I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t work, or worse, that it would make my face freak out more.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> My issues are these: Clarisonic has poor quality control (</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s annoying to know that if this breaks I have no warranty to back it up.  </li>
            <li> It dried out horribly from a product that doesn&#x27;t usually dry me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it came with, and I&#x27;m too afraid to switch to the delicate one -</li>

            <li> What&#x27;s wrong with a washcloth?</li>
            <li> While looking in to fixing it I found out it was fake, because the code on the bottom of the device would not register on Clarisonic&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I feel it get worse!</li>
            <li> and I thought it was merely cosmetic.</li>
            <li> I bought a Clarisonic Mia from Amazon, guaranteed by Amazon, and it turned out to be fake.</li>
            <li> Do not buy any Clarisonic branded items on Amazon because this appears to be a problem en masse that they are turning a blind eye to.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Clarisonic ended up causing all sorts of skin problems.</li>
            <li> THAT THEY FAIL.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a fake, Clarisonic won&#x27;t let you register.</li>
            <li> a fake - the serial number was not a valid one.</li>

            <li> Fake!</li>
            <li> According to them based on the ID number on the bottom of the handset, this is a FAKE!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hubby gave this to me as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift and I adore it! My face feels so refreshed and clean after using it. It lasts quite a while without needing a charge too which is nice. It&#x27;s small, fits well in my hand too. I love the smell of the cleanser sample that came with it, but it is too drying for my 50 year old skin, so I just use a gentler cleanser. I have noticed that some under-the-skin bumps (likely blackheads or something) have disappeared since I began using this. I use it about 3-4 times a week. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard rave reviews of the Clarisonic, but I was left underwhelmed. This one didn&#x27;t have the beep when you are supposed to change positions on your face (which it neglects to tell you in the product details) and I never felt like my face got clean enough. I broke our more when I used it than when I used my regular facial scrub. It&#x27;s packed away neatly in my drawer for another time when I am more apt to trying it again.</li>
            <li> I love it so much! I definitely have no regrets about this product. It works wonders on my skin and I&#x27;m much more pleased with its over all appearance now.</li>
            <li> At first youll break out, because its bringing up that gunk. I dont use the cleanser it comes with I use my own, but I really see a difference in my complexion after using it.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic was recommended by my dermatologist. I&#x27;m a big fan of Sonicair toothbrush, so decided to give it a try. Love it! The Clarisonic leaves my skin feeling clean and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I used the original Clarisonic at my sister&#x27;s house a few times in Denver where my skin gets very dry and dull and I always loved how soft it made my skin feel. I finally bought one of my own but went with the Mia since it was cheaper and it&#x27;s better for travel. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be as good as the original, but it definitely is. I love this item! I have always had horrible acne problems and very dry skin and lately I&#x27;ve been very self-conscious of my forehead lines. I&#x27;ve only used this twice and my skin is already glowing! My skin is baby soft and my forehead lines are much less noticible. I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser it came with yet only because my skin is very sensitive to most products. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Mia, though.</li>
            <li> This gives my skin a deep clean and gently exfoliates without drying. I love it...I have really dry skin but when I started using the clarsonic to clean my skin that tight feeling isn&#x27;t as tight. My skin gets cleaned with less maniupulation than a wash rag and Im a lot more gentle.</li>
            <li> --EDIT 2/20/2014--&lt;br /&gt;I saw where lots of folks got fake Mias a couple years or so after I bought mine, which totally sucks. However, mine is authentic. Just in case it helps anyone, I bought from America&#x27;s Beauty Supply (though unfortunately I don&#x27;t think they sell these anymore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--[ORIGINAL REVIEW]--&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s a long one, but this review is basically my story of how the right products can make this tool a very valuable asset to your face routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard a lot about this product and have always been intrigued. I&#x27;m an engineer and a total tech geek. New gadgets are SUPER fun. Plus, I like having nice skin. This product also allows me to make Doctor Who references thanks to its sonic technology. So as you can see, there are multiple wins for me right out of the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I dive in, let me put in a disclaimer that this is ONLY for the Clarisonic Mia handheld device. The included cleanser was terrible for me. I am picky about my face feeling clean - I wear very little make-up, if any, and usually don&#x27;t moisturizer because all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried make me feel greasy. The included cleanser made my face feel \\&quot;heavy,\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t want to knock any stars off my review just because the cleanser sample wasn&#x27;t great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so now it&#x27;s time for a review of what the Mia device has helped do for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a picker. If I have something that even looks remotely like a clogged pore, I will pinch and pick at it until it looks like I&#x27;ve been bitten by a mosquito. Those then usually turn into very angry pimples that usually leave scars. And the zits that crop up on my face? Well, we all know how those often turn out. Pick till it bleeds, then keep picking the ugly scab off till there&#x27;s a scar. Yes, I&#x27;m gross, but let&#x27;s face it - lots of us are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this about a week, and I&#x27;m firmly in the \\&quot;it&#x27;ll get worse before it gets better\\&quot; stage. So why, in this delicate position, am I giving it 5 stars? This \\&quot;worse\\&quot; stage is by far the easiest one I&#x27;ve ever gone through - and I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting thing about this product is that, when I pick till I get the mosquito bites, I can wash my face with this and after one minute the \\&quot;bites\\&quot; will be noticeably diminished. Before, if I were to do the pore clean out-routine before bed (ie, scouring my face closely in a mirror for anything resembling a clogged pore), I&#x27;d probably still have some angry bumps on my face in the morning. Now, I have a smooth face in the morning. Bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m also using new face cleansing products in conjunction with the Mia, which I had not used previously. However, I do not expect that the products alone are what is causing my success, because I have tried a LOT of products. I have skin that is all over the map. It&#x27;s mostly normal (some combination - oily around T-zone and jawline, dry around nostrils), but most \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleansers either make me dry or oily. Cleaners for dry skin make me VERY oily, and cleansers for oily faces make me so dry that I peel. I get relatively small breakouts every now and then, usually resulting from me obsessively picking at my face, but not always. The zits are few in number (less than 10) but large in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current routine:&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Mia with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for All Skin Types&lt;br /&gt;Night: Picking routine (definitely don&#x27;t recommend this part, of course - what a bad habit!), Mia with Yes To Carrots Nourishing Exfoliating Cleanser, Neutrogena On the Go Acne Treatment Pen (for spot treatment of any picking locations that the Mia/cleanser didn&#x27;t reduce)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, the Mia is easy to hold and use. I won&#x27;t go into detail reiterating those points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - when they say one minute, they mean one minute. Follow the guidelines in the instruction booklet for how long to linger in each area of your face. I tried using the Mia for longer than one minute by turning it back on after the auto shut-off, and my face did not approve. It dried out horribly from a product that doesn&#x27;t usually dry me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I suppose my main point is this: The Mia on its own is not a miracle-worker, but if you find some good products that work for your skin type, it can certainly help improve the state of your skin. It&#x27;s all about finding a way to work it into your routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And also, sonic stuff is cool.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite hesitant to try this as I already have the cheaper Sigma Cleansing &amp; Polishing tool which is a similar concept, but I felt that that tool wasn&#x27;t doing it for me so I wanted to try the Clarisonic and see whether it really was worth all the money and hype, and I tell you, it is!  If you aren&#x27;t a big skincare junkie, then maybe this isn&#x27;t something you want to spend that much money on, but if you really care for your skin, it&#x27;s an amazing investment. Even just after a couple days of using it, I noticed that my skin was clearer in regards to acne and my overall skin tone was better and more radiant, my Mum even asked whether I was wearing makeup because my skin just looked so good!  I also really like that the brush head vibrates as opposed to spinning, which is what the Sigma one does because then the product and water goes everywhere, also the Clarisonic isn&#x27;t as harsh as the Sigma is on your skin. I also like that the Clarisonic has a timer which stops after 1 minute and I like that it is a magnetic charger, because the Sigma was battery powered, and sometimes water would seep into the battery compartment and I would be left with residue there.  Overall, I think the Clarisonic is a worthy investment which provides fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Really great product.  I didn&#x27;t do any heavy research or anything, just saw it at Macy&#x27;s and thought it looked cool and so ordered it on Amazon to save some money.  I could not be more pleased!  Highly recommend this product.  Mine came with a sample of Clairsonic&#x27;s face wash for oily/normal skin.  I used that a few times (and was impressed with how clean my face felt) and then ordered the version for dry/normal skin which is more appropriate for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As everyone else has said, it gives you a really fresh face for creams and treatments and I feel my skin is already looking better (not that it was terrible to begin with) and it hasn&#x27;t even been two full weeks!  This product is a keeper for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve charged it only once and have kept it in the shower with no issues since then.  The ice blue is a really pretty color.</li>
            <li> I have been happily using a BufPuf for many years and really didn&#x27;t think I needed any other exfoliating system.  I had been looking at various spin brushes, which sell for much less than this Clarisonic, but didn&#x27;t think I needed one.  I love my Sonicare toothbrush and on a whim bought this brush, not expecting it to be much more than a spinning face brush.  I was very surprised to learn that this does not spin.  It vibrates slightly (not a noticeable spin like my toothbrush), but somehow manages to make my face feel incredibly clean and soft. I have been using it for a month and have not had any problems with breakouts or any other issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this.  Everything from the cool magnetic charging system, which allows the device to be used in the shower without worrying about getting water in a charge plug, to the way it fits into my hand makes me appreciate the time spent in its design.  The most important thing is how it makes my skin feel, and that is terrific.  I use it with my normal face wash (either Basis or Neutrogena) and my face feels and looks better than it has in years.  I think this will also make a great gift to a few people I know I won&#x27;t insult by giving a facial brush.  Highly recommended, even at the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mia for 2 or 3 weeks and I really like it.  I follow the instructions--I wet my face and the brush with warm water, put a small amount of gel face wash on my skin, then use for the 1-minute timing cycle that the Mia automatically goes for.  Sometimes after the minute is up and the unit turns off, I turn it back on (easy, with the press of a button) and use it for another 10-20 seconds if I think I&#x27;ve missed any spots.  I really like the way it gently exfoliates, leaving my skin super-smooth and glowing.  I was worried it might be too harsh, since I have sensitive skin, but I have not found that to be the case.  I used it twice a day from the very beginning and never had any skin reactons or anything.      The trial-sized face wash that came with the unit was pretty nice, and I would consider buying a full-sized version of the product.  However, for now I&#x27;m using a Kate Somerville daily gentle face wash (it&#x27;s pricy but smells soooo good and leaves my skin feeling really soft).    The unit is well-designed: I like that it&#x27;s waterproof (I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower sometimes) and that it holds a charge for so long.  And the charger itself is designed really cool--there&#x27;s no plugging-the-charger-into-a-port (because the unit is waterproof) but rather, the charger is magnetic so it just magnetizes right onto the unit.  Very clever!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re super Type-A and love feeling like you can check something off your to-do list every day, the timed face scrubbing the Clarisonic provides is nice. However, if you&#x27;re looking for something to clear skin and leave it smoother and brighter, don&#x27;t waste your money. I fell for the hype and used this nightly for about 6 months with either the sensitive skin brush or the exfoliating one, and saw no improvement in my skin at all. If anything, the brush has a tendency to hold on to germs and I found myself buying replacement brushes (EXPENSIVE!) after feeling like I just couldn&#x27;t get the bristles clean. In the end, I gave the darn thing to my very type-A boyfriend and he loved it for scrubbing down his beard until the whole thing decided to stop charging no matter how long we left it attached to the power cable. At that point, I&#x27;d had it for about a year. Just get some nice face wash and save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my own Mia for a couple of years and use it twice a day and it&#x27;s done wonders for my complexion.  After my boyfriend and I went for a spa facial on vacation I commented on how the five little pore-cleaning pricks bothered me and he was astounded at the fact that I&#x27;d had only five.  He suffered through at least 40, lol.  I told him it was because of my Clarisonic...  Even before our trip was over we ordered a Mia for him.  The pic on Amazon is blue, so that&#x27;s what we thought he was getting.  Turned out to be white.  Oh well, as long as it&#x27;s not pink. :)   Clean skincare isn&#x27;t just for the ladies, guys!</li>
            <li> Clarisonic Mia is worth the investment for cleaning your skin!  Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth!  The size is great too since it is so portable for travelling.</li>
            <li> I am hooked. I think it has made a difference in my acne and made my pores smaller. This is obviously not a magic solution but I am still an advocate. The only complaint is that the charge doesn&#x27;t hold super long, so make sure when you hear the beeps to get it on the charger.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product as a Christmas present for 12/13 along with two others from different companies and have had no problems with the other two but this one, as I see other customers of this company have stated, rusted on the three prongs holding the scrubbing disk and no longer works.</li>
            <li> I bought this much to the chagrin of every woman I spoke to about it. What&#x27;s wrong with a washcloth? they asked. I felt extremely guilty making this purchase, but some amazon bucks from my credit card gave me enough of an excuse, so I finally went ahead and did it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the cleaner that comes with the tool, but my face was definitely smoother and absorbed moisturizer better after the first use. I purchased the product in hopes of smoother skin, smaller pores, and because of stubborn acne. Within three days of use, my acne has faded immensely. My face looks clearer and fresher, and my skin is smoother than its ever been. I use the Mia once a day to remove makeup, then moisturize. I&#x27;m quickly becoming addicted, and I really do feel 10% better looking every time I go out the door.&lt;br /&gt;My only question is about using this in the shower. While many reviewers said they use it in the shower, the instructions explicitly say not to. I used in the shower before reading directions, and panicked when I looked over the directions later and saw the instructions. However, it is still working just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy I bought this. I think it is one of those things that over time will prove to be a great investment as it will keep my skin acne free and better looking.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is well worth the money. it&#x27;s like having a mini facial everyday! It gets your skin so much cleaner!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and a few short months later, it just stopped working all of a sudden. While looking in to fixing it I found out it was fake, because the code on the bottom of the device would not register on Clarisonic&#x27;s website. Just posting this to save someone else the trouble from this product!</li>
            <li> I got my package on time was very happy about that but.... Unfortunately I order a new item and I got a used one the brush was dirty and the inside were u open the device up I ended up sending back</li>
            <li> I ordered this Clarisonic for my daughter and it stopped working. SO, I called Clarisonic to have it replaced. Clarisonic informed me that my product was a FAKE!!! They could tell based off of the serial number on handle. I am SICK I threw away $100 on a fake when I could have bought the REAL thing for the same $$ and had it actually work. Wonder if I will get a refund????&lt;br /&gt; Item being reviewed</li>
            <li> My Clarisonic has been working great this whole time! I bought it in spring and it&#x27;s helped my skin so much! BUT it just stopped working this week! I called Clarisonic and I read them the number at the bottom. The representative told me I owned a FAKE! I am shocked because everything looks the same!! Now I don&#x27;t know what do to because I no longer have the original packing slip so I don&#x27;t think I can return it. I am entirely heartbroken.</li>
            <li> It was nice while it worked.  Now it won&#x27;t accept a charge.  I can&#x27;t return it bcs it&#x27;s out of the return window.  For $100 it should last more than 5 months</li>
            <li> It suddenly stopped working a year in- would no longer charge. Unfortunately it was too late for a return by then</li>
            <li> This hand held gadget smooths away dry flaky patches, great for people with big sand paper pores. Gives your face a refined smooth look. After my first use I could see the difference. I was concerned it was not going to be worth the money, but Clarasonic is. I am slowly weening myself from foundation everyday and with Clarisonic in about a month in conjunction with a dark spot cream My face will have increased natural beauty!</li>
            <li> I bought this in Dec 2012. It stopped working a week back. It is supposed to have a yr&#x27;s warranty. So I called Clarisonic and they tell me that the machine I have is not genuine so I should contact Amazon to see if they can give me a refund. I call Amazon and get told that because it&#x27;s been over 30 days I am not eligible to receive a refund for the product so basically it&#x27;s $100 down the drain. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, worth the price!  It really does minimize pores, although I still break out during my regular intervals on my t-zone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product very long but I would say that my skin has improved since using it.  I think it really depends on the cleanser that you use with the clarisonic because I found that some facial cleansers I was using with it broke me out a little bit so I had to switch and I found a cleanser that works well with it. Even though it has only been a month that I&#x27;ve used it, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Didn&#x27;t do anything different for my face. Overhyped and overpriced. Mine broke after 2 years and Clarisonic only offers a 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li> These are counterfeit and not manufactured by clarisonic! The product ID and warranty are not compatible with clarisonic as well. These should have been removed from the website a long time ago!</li>
            <li> love my Mia - my skin is visibly clear and smooth! the timer works beautifully to make sure face skin is not getting irritated by shutting off after 1 min of operation. only thing - brushes need to be replaced every 3mos and cost $25 a pop (for clarisonic brand)</li>
            <li> The Mia works and made my skin feel cleaner after using it as compared to just using face wash, however, after 2 years it broke.  I didn&#x27;t use it for a few weeks and it lost charge.  When I plugged it back in, the device just pulsed non-stop instead of pulsing initially and then charging.  I called Clarisonic and they said it&#x27;s defective but only offer a 1 year warranty.  This product is not worth it if only lasts for 2 years.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product recently went caput on me after over two years of faithful service, and I can&#x27;t wait to order a new one! It was just a month outside of the warranty when it stopped charging. But for something that I used (and occasionally dropped) every single day for two years, I&#x27;m impressed it held up so long! After just a couple of days of use, I felt my skin improving. And now a few days after its broken I feel it get worse! This thing was great for taking off makeup on the days I wore it, but I really used it for every day maintaince. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most exfoliaters, so my skin trends to be oily and to have a buildup of dead skin cells. This thing took a little bit of getting used to, but it was because my face had never been so clean! I used a very gentle, simple face soap- no acne control or acids or anything- and my complexion cleared up drastically within a few weeks. I never thought I&#x27;d be able to use something without acne control in it and not see consequences for it, but it turned out that a lot of my problem was not being able to exfoliate properly. So, if you have sensitive skin and acne, I definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> my face is very smooth after using it, pores are smaller than before. but it doesn&#x27;t help much with my acnes...no regrets for this expensive bursh~</li>
            <li> Love this item. Works great. Better than the cheaper ones out their. The power is consistent. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> I really love how this takes the dry flakiness off my face in a very gentle way.  I use this at night and use a good moisturizer.  My face still breaks out (can&#x27;t do anything about those hormones), but it clears up more quickly when I use this regularly.  Holds a charge pretty well too.</li>
            <li> This product broke down after eight months of use.  Contacted Clarisonic customer service to register the product and seek a replacement since it&#x27;s still within the 1-year warranty period.  Clarisonic confirmed that the lot number on this device was invalid because it was not manufactured by Clarisonic.  It also stated that the seller on Amazon is not an authorized dealer and therefore this product is not covered by warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can Amazon allow this to happen?</li>
            <li> I loved this product until it stopped working.  The MIA has a 1yr warranty and quit working shortly after the 1 year mark.  I called customer service and they offered to cut the price of a new one down to $60.00 plus $25.00 for a brush head totalling $75.00 plus shipping and handling.  I feel betrayed.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I wanted, easily and simply.  Face feels good and clean.  Easy to care for and handy.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. After only 3 days of use my skin turned baby soft. It takes off all my face make up so I don&#x27;t have to spend money on makeup wipes anymore! It&#x27;s so easy to clean and use. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> The unit I received looked like it was opened and did not charge.  WE tested the hookup etc., got a few beeps and 2 days later didn&#x27;t get any beeps.  Requested refund, then replacement, sent it back over 1 week ago and still have not heard anything.  Via email they say they need to &amp;#34;check with inventory&amp;#34; each time I ask when I&#x27;ll get my replacement.  We&#x27;ll see if and when I get it?</li>
            <li> After researching and reading many, many comments from other buyers, I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She uses it everyday and says that it makes her skin feel so clean and soft. She has had it a month and so far it has been wonderful!</li>
            <li> Just received my new Clarisonic and, following directions, plugged it in to charge for 24 hours.  It keeps pulsing and making a beeping noise---this can&#x27;t be right.  Immediately called the customer service phone # and have been on hold now for 12 minutes and counting---this can&#x27;t be right either.  Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2.5 years. I didn&#x27;t purchase it from Amazon. It&#x27;s much cheaper with deals, so if you&#x27;re planning to get one, wait for sales. You could save about $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, acne-prone skin with large pores and occasionally break-outs. It took me several weeks to decide if I needed it. (it&#x27;s so expensive for a college student!) And I&#x27;m perfectly happy with it. It&#x27;s still working perfectly after two and a half years. The recharger works in USA, China, Hong Kong, UK and several Continental European countries (Germany, France, Italy and Belgium) without a transformer (you&#x27;ll need an adapter, of course), so far I&#x27;ve been tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin DID NOT change completely, and I&#x27;m not expecting that. Reasons for large pores is complicated, and the daily cleansing process only works on the surface to prevent acne and blackheads (and both of these problems cannot be completely solved by cleansing!). The roots of your blackheads are deep in the skin, and even if you tried to get rid of blackheads your pores will not automatically vanish. So if you&#x27;re looking for something to completely change your skin, you may be disappointed. However, after using this for 12 months I found my skin absorbs other external products (like serums) better than before. It also helped to remove make-ups and prevent further problems. My skin was much cleaner and lighter. The brush did a great job, but all it could do is to clean your face. There are many things you CANNOT solve by cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are also considering other series of the Clarisonic brushes and can&#x27;t decide... Mia is totally enough for common, facial use. Pro is much more expensive and Mia is enough for most people. I use it twice daily in summer and once daily in other time. The fully-charged Mia can last for 2~3 weeks. If you&#x27;re only looking for the facial cleansing part, Mia is effective and handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth trying if...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You&#x27;ve got oily, acne-prone skin. --- which means, you NEED deep-cleansing products.

            <li> I should have known when I when I received the product that I was not getting what I had believed I was purchasing The original packaging it came in was badly dented which gave me the impression that it was not new as stated. When my daughter began using the Mia after Christmas it worked fine but I was concerned when I saw that the connection points where the brush fits into the unit were rusted. I dismissed my concerns because returning items are a pain and I thought it was merely cosmetic. What a mistake. After three month&#x27;s use, every seam on the unit has rust stains and it has completely malfunctioned rendering it useless. Because my purchase is beyond the date of return, I&#x27;m out the purchase price. I will be buying my next one at Nordstrom, where I know they will at least allow returns of defective items.</li>
            <li> I had lost my last clarisonic mia and I loved it so much that I couldn&#x27;t live without a new one. This system cleans my skin so well and makes my face feel fresh and like it can breathe. I LOVE MY CLARISONIC. Definitely a purchase worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in December and the shipment time and packaging seemed to be great.  It recently stopped working.  When I contacted Clarisonic regarding trouble shooting and warranty, I was told the the lot number on the unit is not theirs.  It was not made by Clarisonic and therefore they can not do anything about it.  I was also told that RobRobie Robin is not an authorized Clarisonic seller.  I am shocked.  I am so disappointed that Amazon would link me to a seller that is not authorized and is apparently selling counterfeit products. I will never order from RobRobie Robin again and I will definitely be uneasy about all other name brand item purchases not coming directly from the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I bought a Clarisonic Mia from Amazon, guaranteed by Amazon, and it turned out to be fake. Do not buy any Clarisonic branded items on Amazon because this appears to be a problem en masse that they are turning a blind eye to.</li>
            <li> Until I purchased this, I never felt like my skin was getting clean enough, even when I exfoliated. After reading the reviews, I was convinced to try it. I noticed a difference after even the first use- my skin felt cleaner, but also, smoother! I&#x27;ve had issues with redness and unevenness, and I can already notice improvements there. I will say, you really do need to follow the instructions as they relate to not pressing down as it can lead to irritation. Also, be careful on areas that are not flat (nose, chin), as if you curve too much it can cause small micro-tears...but if you know that, its easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re debating buying this because of the price, all I can say is that this will pay for itself. This is one of the best things- if not THE best- you can do for your skin. I will be trying the deep pore ones next!</li>
            <li> Need to get more pads, but so far my wife likes it. Make sure you charge it for the 24 hrs before you use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to be doing something more for my face than pray.  Put this off due to price, -but glad I finally bit the bullet.  Don&#x27;t need the large one either, -this will do you fine.&lt;br /&gt;I use every night with rare exception.  Use mostly with my gentle Cetaphil wash - and once or twice a week I use an exfoliate with it.  Even though this is for cleaning - i give my makeup a quick wash off first - then use the Clarisonic.  &#x27;Cause I want it to get into my skin, you know?  Besides, this isn&#x27;t going to reach eyeshadow, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, -completely pleased,</li>
            <li> 6 months ago I was in a horseback riding accident and on a lot of medications. My skin broke out like CRAZY, due to the meds and stress I&#x27;m sure. I tried drinking more water and watching my diet, exercising more when my back healed, switching to organic face cleaners,  deep purifying masks, homemade face masks/treatments, switching back to my original face regime, using all sorts of spot treatments, basically EVERYTHING. Nothing worked. Finally I broke down and bought the Clarisonic Mia, although I have to say I had waited a long time because of the price and I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t work, or worse, that it would make my face freak out more.&lt;br /&gt;In only a week my skin has improved SO MUCH. It is soft, my breakouts are minimal, and the pre-existing problems are almost clear. I just bought the deep cleaning brush head and I can&#x27;t wait to see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, if only just to see if it&#x27;ll work for you!</li>
            <li> i have mild acne, and i would not say this helps all that much. ONLY USE ONCE A DAY. i used it twice which drug out the purging phase. this is great for removing makeup though</li>
            <li> This cleansing system was shipped as promised. I have noticed a signifcant difference since using this cleaning system. it is so easy and the stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> On the advice and experience of my daughter, I read reviews of the Mia and decided to order one. It arrived and, much to my disappointment, it would not charge. I plugged it in and nothing happened. I called The Skin Store, a distributor that carries Clarisonic products, and they sent me a return label and quickly shipped another Mia.....another one that did not charge, but only made odd pulsing sounds. I called The Skin Store again. At this point, I felt that I should be offered more than a return shipping label and \\&quot;quick shipping\\&quot; of yet another Mia. The person I talked with wouldn&#x27;t even hear of it. I reminded her that while I was on hold, the message said that this company had \\&quot;award-winning service.\\&quot; I told her that the service I was receiving was no where close to award-winning. I spent close to $100 for this product, had to return a malfunctioning unit once, and now was being asked to return yet another malfunctioning. My issues are these: Clarisonic has poor quality control (another one of the issues is that the led light doesn&#x27;t always show on the color Mia and it will be suggested you order a white one if you have this particular problem....so why do they offer color models????) and also this particular distributor does not offer any serious customer service. After hearing my daughter rave about the Mia, I was thinking of eventually ordering one for both my daughters-in-law. So, in the end, I requested a refund of my money, and I will certainly not be ordering any Mia for gifts. Good luck, Clarisonic and the Skin Store. Your arrogant attitude and lack of customer service and concern will be your downfall in this competitive market.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mia after a visit to the dermatologist.  The battery life is great, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with only having one speed setting, but it can be a little rough on my sensitive skin.  I suggest ordering the brush heads for sensitive skin if you are afraid of having the same situation. My skin always feels wonderfully clean after using it, and I even keep it in the shower!</li>
            <li> This Clarisonic Mia broke after 4 months of use. I called Clarisonic about the 1 year warranty and they said that since Amazon was not an authorized dealer they could not do anything. Amazon states that since it is past the 30 day refund window they will only do a partial refund. When I asked to speak to a manager they hung up on me. Buy this from the Clairsonic website to avoid this mess!</li>
            <li> Clairisonic Mia stopped working after 5 months.  Can&#x27;t return it now, but certainly will not pay to replace!  While it was working, it did seem to help my skin but not enough to consider such an expensive item a disposable skin care tool.  Note that charger holds on to handle magnetically, charging makes a funny annoying noise, and handle can easily be accidentally knocked from the charger.</li>
            <li> My Clarisonic Mia stopped charging the second time I plugged it in.  It vibrates and pulses using all the power up instead of charging the battery.  I have not had a chance to return it, but I intend to.</li>
            <li> Before using the Clarisonic, I didn&#x27;t really suffer from acne. I would get the occasional breakout like the next person, but I just wanted to brighten my skin and find a good way to clean it. Unfortunately the Clarisonic ended up causing all sorts of skin problems. My skin is more oily, peels like mad, and I too have gotten the weird breakouts that other reviewers in this category (one star) were talking about. Non-stop break outs. My skin is sensitive, yes. But it has never been that bad before. I contacted Clarisonic with my problem a few days after I decided that this was definitely a problem (I had already switched from the sensitive to the acne brush once a day only). They told me that it was typical to break out initially but to stick with it once every other day. I did, and nothing ever got better. I&#x27;m now worried that they won&#x27;t be accepting it back since I bought it from Amazon. Terrible terrible trap. I also finally went to a dermatologist and they actually recommend against it pretty firmly. Everything has been a lot better since I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work for some people. I can&#x27;t believe that this is just hype, but if you have sensitive skin, just walk away from it before you waste your money, time, and the health of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish me luck in getting my money back!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to invest the money into this cleaning brush, but I am really glad I did.  My face literally glows after I use it.  I can really tell a difference in my skin since I started using it which was only a few weeks ago.  I use it on my neck and chest as well.  I keep mine in the shower and the battery keeps a long life as well.  I also love how there are different brushes available to buy depending on your skin needs.  I ordered some of the Acne Brushes as well but won&#x27;t need to change the head on it until January.  I think the Mia model is good and personally don&#x27;t think anything more expensive is actually needed.</li>
            <li> **Just a little background:  I am a 27-year-old female, with very light complexion, and I usually have normal skin with few breakouts during the year.  I have been on birth control pills for 10 years and I decided I don&#x27;t want to us them anymore, I stopped taking them in August 2012 and a month later my skin went to hell and back.  I have been dealing with painful, hormonal cystic acne for five months (it&#x27;s now January 2013).**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been told it takes about 6 to 12 months for your hormones to balance out after you get off of the pills, so I&#x27;ve been looking for solutions and tools to help my skin along the way.  I&#x27;ve heard both wonderful and horrible things about the Clarisonic, so I figured the only way to find out how well it works is to get one and see for myself.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of dropping $100 or more about a product if I don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;ll work, but I got an Amazon gift card for Christmas so I figured I should go on an get one because it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS THING...just be aware that Amazon IS NOT an authorized seller of the Clarisonic.  This means that the warranty on the item is no good, and if you want the warranty you&#x27;ll have to purchase it from the Clarisonic site, or some kind of store such as ULTA.  I got this item for $97 through one of the sellers on here, and I was aware of the risks associated with buying from an unauthorized seller before I purchased it.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using the Mia the appearance and feel of my skin was slightly improved...I think my hormones are starting to balance out, but I am still having breakouts on my forehead.  Anyway, I got the Mia on the 27th and I&#x27;ve used it every night since then and I can already see a difference in my skin after 7 days of use.  I&#x27;ve read that people have experienced dryness and irritation, and severe breakouts, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any of that.  I&#x27;m using a moisturizer and cleanser by Dermalogica, but I don&#x27;t think you need to use this specific brand to work.  I&#x27;ve also used a gentile Olay cleanser (the one in the light blue pump bottle) and that seems to work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll wet my face and the brush head (just a little, not to where the brush is dripping wet), then I put a dime-size amount of my cleanser on the brush and start cleaning my face.  I don&#x27;t press the Mia hard against my skin, that&#x27;s not necessary to get the dirt and makeup off of your face, just be gentile.  I could see how your face could become dried out and irritated if you did push the Mia hard against your skin...just don&#x27;t do it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mia pulsates for one minute exactly, and that&#x27;s all you need from what I&#x27;ve read.  However, since I&#x27;m so gentile when using the thing I go for two minutes.  I&#x27;m not recommending you do the same, but that&#x27;s just what seems to work for me so far.  If I see that my skin becomes dry or irritated, I&#x27;ll go to one minute.  If I have eye makeup on I&#x27;ll wash my eye area after I use the Mia, and my skin is feeling awesome.  I&#x27;ll follow this by moisturizing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I can already see a difference in the size of my pores, and the break out on my forehead is looking better too.  I haven&#x27;t had any more spots than what I had before I started using the Mia.  My skin isn&#x27;t getting as oily either (another awesome side effect from quitting the pill), and I haven&#x27;t really found it necessary to exfoliate as frequently during the week as I was before just because my skill actually looks good and feels awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, the Mia come with a magnetic charger...the magnet seems a bit weak when you attach it to the Mia, but it gets the job done.  That&#x27;t the only negative thing I can say about this tool, unless I just got a crappy magnet in my charger.  I think if you need the nudge to get one of these, I would suggest you to do so if you have the money.  Seems awesome so far and I think I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time.  Butdon&#x27;t forget about the warranty!!  If you&#x27;re looking to save a little bit of money get it on Amazon, but if you want that warranty make sure to buy it from an authorized seller such as ULTA or from the Clarisonic site.  I hope this helps!!  Send me a message if you have any questions about my experience.  :)don&#x27;t forget about the warranty!!

            <li> came quick and was what is says it was. best price ive seen online for this thing. that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 of these for my daughter&#x27;s for Christmas.  They worked exactly 1 month.  Now they can&#x27;t be charged and can&#x27;t be used.  Also, do not buy anything from VikiStore - sent them an e-mail through Amazon and have never heard from them.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED NOV. 2012 FROM \\&quot;VIKISTORE\\&quot; VIA AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;CONTACTED CLARISONIC ABOUT RUSTING PINS THAT HOLD BRUSH HEAD TO BODY. I SUPPLIED SERIAL NUMBERS FOR SCRUBBER HANDLE AND CHARGING UNIT. CLARISONIC SAYS LOT NUMBER IS NOT VALID.&lt;br /&gt;CLARISONIC STATED PINS SHOULD NOT RUST, BUT THEY ARE.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;VICKISTORE\\&quot; CONTACT PAGE FOR QUESTIONS WON&#x27;T ACCEPT CONVERSATION BECAUSE PURCHASE DATE OLDER THAN 90 DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;I NOW SUSPECT UNIT MAY BE A \\&quot;KNOCK OFF\\&quot; DUE TO CLARISONIC SAYING SERIAL NUMBER NOT VALID, BUT MY RESISTRATION WAS ACCEPTED WITH THAT NUMBER.&lt;br /&gt;UNIT HAS PERFORMED WELL, BUT I&#x27;LL HAVE TO KEEP APPLYING PROTECTIVE GREASE TO THE PINS TO KEEP THEM FROM RUSTING TO THE POINT THAT THEY FAIL.</li>
            <li> The battery refuses to get charged and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  I have tried charging it several times and it doesn&#x27;t hold charge</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old daughter. She is very particular about what she uses on her face. I have bought other models by other makers and none of them even come close to this. It is true that it purges your skin which means you have a breakout the first few times you use it (at least that&#x27;s what happened to her), but since then she has flawless skin and receives compliments all the time from complete strangers about how perfect her skin is. She is beaming with self esteem now that she doesn&#x27;t have the skin issues she used to have. This has been, by far, my favorite Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought my Mia a few weeks ago.  This is an expensive little machine, so I expected it to operate according to the instructions.  The actual brushing mechanism works fine.  But the instructions say you&#x27;re supposed to get two pulses when the Mia is fully charged.  Mine refuses to do that.  Customer service - after getting through via a backdoor method because no one was actually picking up the customer service line! - advised me to run it 20 times and see if I could get 20 minutes out of the machine without charging.  It worked - I got more than 20, actually - and that&#x27;s how I know my Mia can charge fully.  But that&#x27;s not what was supposed to happen.  I wasn&#x27;t supposed to have this headache of calling customer service, or the hassle of testing it; it was just supposed to do what it said in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, getting the brush head off the handle for cleaning is an ordeal, and after only two weeks, the three little connector thingies that hold the brush head to the handle are CAKED with rust and other stuff that I can&#x27;t even identify.  Gross.  I&#x27;m going to have to bust out the CLR or something and try to get them clean.  :-P</li>
            <li> My friends had been talking about how much they loved their clarisonic, I had never even heard of it. I went home and did some research and decided to order the Mia vs the pro. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase! Family and friends have been commenting on my skin saying \\&quot;what are you doing, your skin looks SO good!\\&quot; I will say I did not have bad skin to start. I would get occasional breakouts but nothing major. I did have a lot of blocked pores and blackheads though and they are GONE. My complexion looks so even without makeup and with a little makeup my face honestly looks airbrushed. And I only use the Mia at night.</li>
            <li> I have only used it about four times and my face feels softer and cleaner. Glad that I finally purchased one.</li>
            <li> Fake! Fake!! Fake!!! Don&#x27;t buy from &amp;#34;RobRobie Robin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopped working in a month...rusty head...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please please please register your product as soon as you receive it. If it&#x27;s a fake, Clarisonic won&#x27;t let you register. Don&#x27;t be like me. By the time I tried to register it, it was too late (out of return period)!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for xmas. She loved it, then JUST after the refund end date it became possessed and turned on randomly and is now dead. When I called Clarisonic to use the 1 year warranty they told me Amazon is an &amp;#34;unauthorized dealer&amp;#34; and therefor no warranty is given to the product. They said it was the equivalent to buying it off eBay. Grumble grumble. now I have a 95.00 paper weight.</li>
            <li> Bought in December and stopped working in February. Took the brush head off and it is severely rusted. Contacted Clarisonic and they told me it was a fake - the serial number was not a valid one. Very disappointed that Amazon would allow fake products to be sold on their sight.</li>
            <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia as a gift for my wife (It was recommended by a dermatologist.), and she is absolutely thrilled with it. It&#x27;s very gentle on her skin, but she believes it&#x27;s doing a very thorough job. She&#x27;s particularly happy that she can take it into the shower with her, thank&#x27;s to its \\&quot;plugless\\&quot; recharging system. The Mia is more expensive than competing products... but my wife says it&#x27;s worth paying extra. Considering how happy she is right now, I&#x27;d have to agree.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping to clear up my daughter&#x27;s acne when used with an over-the-counter acne scrub such as Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser.</li>
            <li> The unit stopped working a week ago so I called Clarisonic customer service.  According to them based on the ID number on the bottom of the handset, this is a FAKE!  I now see that this is a common them with this vendor and there is no way to contact them.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face perfectly. It gives a Nice glowy look to my skin. It was à purchase that worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not only is this item wonderful; it made my skin smooth and poreless,  but when I dropped it in the shower and it broke, I called Clairisonic and they said &amp;#34;no problem, we&#x27;ll send you a new one and a return envelope to return the broken one&#x27;. How great is that?!</li>
            <li> I got a few new broken capillaries when using this, and they are quite big. I used the sensitive brush head it came with, and I&#x27;m too afraid to switch to the delicate one - I don&#x27;t want to take any more chances. also, I&#x27;m just generally unimpressed by this. I was under the impression that it would provide gentle daily exfoliation, but I found that I still had to use a scrub once a week. I didn&#x27;t really see any improvements from this thing. honestly, I think this is majorly overpriced for what you&#x27;re getting, and using a washcloth provides similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return it to the manufacturer per the 90 day guarantee, but they told me that any units purchased from amazon are not eligible. note: that did NOT influence my ratings for this product, but I wanted to include this in this review so other people could be informed. however, amazon can be really amazing with their return policies so that&#x27;s always worth a try.</li>
            <li> This Mia does a grate job of cleaning my skin. I use a acne wash with it and my skin does not feel tight it feels clean.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday and have not even had a chance to use it yet.  But when I tried to register it with Clarisonic I was told that the Lot number is invalid and therefore not manufactured by them.  So you are paying around a hundred dollars for a Clarisonic knock off.  I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of it but it&#x27;s annoying to know that if this breaks I have no warranty to back it up.  Since it was a gift from a friend I can&#x27;t very well tell her to return it and get me a real one.  Just know what you&#x27;re ordering!</li>
            <li> I tried to register my Clarisonic Mia and the manufacturer informed me that I had received a counterfeit product from Lusci Beautystore.  The Lot (serial) number was not valid and therefore they could not register the product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to exfoliate and cleanse my skin without irritating.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is acne prone, and very sensitive, so I did order a set of acne brushes to use instead of the sensitive one it came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST WEEKS OF USE:&lt;br /&gt;Knowing my skin, I started slowly by using it only once a day for my night routine. Following reviewers advice, I made sure to just gliding the brush over my face for the full minute. After a few days, I made the mistake to cleanse for longer, almost 2 minutes, and it was a big mistake, because my face was very irritated, especially my cheeks. Therefore, please be patient, be gentile and take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, I started to use it twice a day, every other day to test out if my skin was able to handle it. After a few weeks, I was able to use it twice a day, almost every day. Always for only 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DIFFERENCE:&lt;br /&gt;I saw a difference within a few days, but it was subtle. My skin was a lot softer and glowing, like after a facial. Over time, I noticed that my skin also got more toned, more plump and a most of all my complexion and skin texture dramatically improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about using the Clarisonic, it&#x27;s that it help balance out my complexion. After a month or regular use, dry patches on my cheeks are soft, while my T-zone doesn&#x27;t get as oily as it used to. My creams and serums absorb a lot better and it also made a huge difference for when I apply foundation, as it goes on a lot more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;After only a month, I am happy to say that this is THE addition to my beauty routine I was looking for. While it doesn&#x27;t take care of my acne, it does help to keep it under control and heel within a few days. I also get more out of my beauty products and can actually see and feel that they are working now. Having a truly well cleansed skin before a applying any type of product makes a big difference. On good skin days, I can go out without even putting a sheer foundation on, that&#x27;s how much it improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are other models, such as the Pro (that I got for my mother) and Plus, I still prefer having this one because its a no fuss (one setting), compact and easy to travel with. Furthermore, until I feel the need to change my body exfoliation routine, I don&#x27;t see the point to upgrade.</li>
