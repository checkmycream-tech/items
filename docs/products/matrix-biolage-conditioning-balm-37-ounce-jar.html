            <li>I was getting the ingredients with the golden seal in</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best conditioner for curly, thick hair that likes to frizz if left on its own.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use either a flat iron or curling iron on my hair and it really keeps it in good shape.</li>

            <li>First time I ever got something from amazon that was busted in the package.</li>
            <li>and I love using this product for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair tangle free, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Been using Matrix products for several decades and find the Biologe to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This was my favorite deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky!!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased the large tub as it was a better deal than continuing buying the smaller tubs.</li>
            <li>It works for long, thick, curly hair and is the best conditioner we have ever used!</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li>It really saturates the hair with moisture.</li>
            <li>very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I also had flyaways, heavyness and when you run your hand through your&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have course hair that can be very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Expensive in many stores so glad to see it available in a large economical size since others in my family are starting to use my new discovery.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, color treated hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine hair and Matrix Biolage</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been pretty managable.</li>
            <li>formula mainly because I can&#x27;t find an ingredient comparison.</li>
            <li>and it is heavy enough to weigh my hair down perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li>It gently conditions her hair and leaves a fresh smell behind, it also seems quite safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure the lower humidity &amp; colder winters had a harsh effect as well</li>
            <li>I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it in, it is as if my hair says &amp;#34;Ah, I can relax!&amp;#34; from its normally stressed state of coarseness stemming from dryness.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>and I use this product regularly to keep it from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair soft and touchable again!</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay extra for the balm.</li>
            <li>kind of hard to manage in the shower!  </li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Just lucky that my other items were in plastic.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel so soft and seems to condition and repair split ends.</li>
            <li>Make sure you leave it on at least five minutes.</li>
            <li>is not the old biolage.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturely curly and not a lot of conditioners leave my hair feeling soft except this product.</li>
            <li>I looked completely frizzy.</li>
            <li>I use this product all of the time, it leaves my hair silky soft and has no tangles at all...</li>
            <li>I do not have to use too much for my very long hair as opposed to thinner preparations.</li>
            <li>( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li>No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products.</li>
            <li>I have super thick curly hair</li>
            <li>I sometimes switch to other conditioners to try something new</li>

            <li> I use this product all of the time, it leaves my hair silky soft and has no tangles at all...</li>
            <li> I do not have to use too much for my very long hair as opposed to thinner preparations.</li>
            <li> ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li> No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products.</li>
            <li> I have super thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I sometimes switch to other conditioners to try something new</li>
            <li> I like the large size container as well since it is less money in the long run.</li>
            <li> and this is the only conditioner thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t soak right in.</li>
            <li> , it is thick and doesn&#x27;t take very much to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I only put this balm on my lower half of my hair because it will make your hair near your scalp oily.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This tub is FAT and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other expensive brands and always came back to Matrix</li>
            <li> The 37 oz Jar will last for a VERY LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> That is the only down side, especially with this big tub...</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because unlike other hair moisturizers that leave your hair soft, silky and managable, once you wash it out, it left my hair stringy, heavy, and flat.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;blow dry and curl.  </li>
            <li> my hair felt dry....</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair and it helps with flyaways and dry ends even after straightening.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago my dry hair responded so well to this balm, but this purchase I noticed that balm does not adhere to the strands of my hair- while product washes down the drain, not leaving my hair soft or tangle-free.  </li>
            <li> I have rough, dry hair that always looks like I need a trim.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair last night and got up and wet it down to</li>
            <li> We have a woodburner in our house and my hair gets VERY VERY dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> So now I am experimenting with it and applying it to dry hair after it has been flat ironed for a few days.</li>
            <li> This is real thick and really works for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I moved from SC, where the water was not hard, to MI, where the water is incredibly hard.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair and have been using this product as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wasting my money or my hair on this imitation stuff.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair that I blow dry and straighten every other day.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this will last me for at least a year or two.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to work on my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing this out, I still use a frizz-control product along with slight spritzes of leave-in conditioner before I detangle my hair but this product allows me to use less of these other ones.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or build up.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it looking or feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair never looks limp or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> You can use a little as a leave in conditioner too.  </li>
            <li> Now I use this balm twice a week, or if the winter is particularly harsh, I use it 3-4 times a week.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed a few salons I have visited, one in LA &amp; one in Atlanta, offer &amp;#34;conditioning packages&amp;#34; for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Might be too heavy for finer hair.</li>
            <li> and it gets dried out, so</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it really dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li> Not really a strong noticeable smell</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair I used to balance out the price and the benefits by mixing it with Hair Mayonnaise from the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I had damaged my hair with excessive bleaching and this has made all the difference in the world.  </li>
            <li> Goes back to the old adage, don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broken!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is not too thick and there is never a build up in my hair or on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> The picture was wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> just exactly what I have bought at salons so it&#x60;s good.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair that I blow dry and straighten every other day.  This conditioner makes my hair soft and manageable.  My whole family uses it.  It is very thick so you need to scoop it out with your fingers.  That is the only down side, especially with this big tub...kind of hard to manage in the shower!  This is such a good price compared to what you can get it for in the drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for maybe around 8 years now.  I pair it with the ultra hydrating shampoo, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> To the point : I had tried the smaller version after bleaching my hair and it did wonders I had to have it again when I ran out of it. Ended up Re-ordering on here, even though the price was lower when I got it I would repurchase at the current price.  This conditioning balm provides good moisture, and recommend using it along with a protein treatment of your choice. The 37 oz Jar will last for a VERY LONG TIME. Worth every penny IMO.</li>
            <li> great product, great price!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel so soft and seems to condition and repair split ends. Great for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner. I have long, thick hair and this is the only conditioner thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t soak right in. I glob it on and leave it for a while and my hair is beautifully moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and this is just one of the conditioning products that I use for it. It really saturates the hair with moisture. Make sure you leave it on at least five minutes. I shampoo it in and leave for 15-20 minutes for best results.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Very satisfied with the product and I have recommended it to many of my friends and co-workers. It leaves you hair feeling silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the product itself but when I received it the top was in pieces and it was all over everything else in the box. Just lucky that my other items were in plastic. First time I ever got something from amazon that was busted in the package.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my dry hair responded so well to this balm, but this purchase I noticed that balm does not adhere to the strands of my hair- while product washes down the drain, not leaving my hair soft or tangle-free.  They must have changed the formula.  Time to find a better product!!</li>
            <li> This works very well for my fine hair. It does not leave a build up of any kind. It is very think but works easily through hair. I do not have to use too much for my very long hair as opposed to thinner preparations.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair and have been using this product as long as I can remember.  I have tried many other expensive brands and always came back to Matrix so I quit trying. I purchased the large tub as it was a better deal than continuing buying the smaller tubs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thought I was getting the ingredients with the golden seal in it.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Hydrasource with a totally different ingredient list.  This stuff is awful.&lt;br /&gt;This is not the old biolage.  I washed my hair last night and got up and wet it down to&lt;br /&gt;blow dry and curl.  I had to put more in just to get the slip.&lt;br /&gt;Before I applied it again my hair felt dry....very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I also had flyaways, heavyness and when you run your hand through your&lt;br /&gt;hair, you can hear it pop and snap.  In no way or how is this Biolage.  Not even&lt;br /&gt;close.  I&#x27;m not wasting my money or my hair on this imitation stuff.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has been discontinued by Biolage and I am thrilled to be able to get it on Amazon, and the price is great!  It&#x27;s a great product!  It&#x27;s a big tub but the most cost-efficient way to buy it.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I used this balm every time I wash my hair and it works better than any conditioner. Without this I could have never grown my hair log again. It keeps it manageable.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I have dry, fine hair and Matrix Biolage makes my hair shine.  Expensive in many stores so glad to see it available in a large economical size since others in my family are starting to use my new discovery.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair that has a tendency to go frizzy if I don&#x27;t use a fantastic conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products but I always seem to come back to Biolage.  I leave the conditioning balm on my hair for 5-10 minutes before rinsing when my hair is damaged from heat or coloring for an extra conditioning treatment boost and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is the best for my hair, it makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioning balm.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or build up.  You can use a little as a leave in conditioner too.  I use either a flat iron or curling iron on my hair and it really keeps it in good shape.</li>
            <li> Finally a conditioner that is also gets the tangles out!!!  I am so happy with this conditioner.  It is smooth, smell good and glides through my hair in the shower with very little effort to get the tangles out!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite everyday conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it looking or feeling greasy. Great.</li>
            <li> I have rough, dry hair that always looks like I need a trim.  I use this every time I wash my hair and it helps with flyaways and dry ends even after straightening.  It&#x27;s the best mid-range deep conditioner I&#x27;ve found that works with my hair type.</li>
            <li> My girl won&#x27;t use anything else so I purchase this by the jumbo size to refill her shower dispenser. It gently conditions her hair and leaves a fresh smell behind, it also seems quite safe for color treated hair. Good value overall!</li>
            <li> A few years ago I moved from SC, where the water was not hard, to MI, where the water is incredibly hard.  My hair did a 180 - it went from being beautiful &amp; silky to dried out &amp; frizzy.  While I&#x27;m sure the lower humidity &amp; colder winters had a harsh effect as well, I knew I had to do something.  I went to my hairstylist &amp; to the people at Ulta, &amp; both places recommended Matrix Biolage Conditioning Balm.  Now I use this balm twice a week, or if the winter is particularly harsh, I use it 3-4 times a week.  I only put this balm on my lower half of my hair because it will make your hair near your scalp oily.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve noticed a few salons I have visited, one in LA &amp; one in Atlanta, offer &amp;#34;conditioning packages&amp;#34; for your hair.  I tried one of these packages, &amp; both salons used this Matrix balm!  I highly recommend this if you need a good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;One last point, if you need to get knots out of your hair or if you went to the lake/ocean &amp; have wind-tossed hair, this conditioner works great to get those knots &amp; snags out.  I would recommend putting a quarter-sized amount throughout your entire head, then shampoo, &amp; then condition again if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy - this is a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it works great in my hair. I have been using Biolage for about 5 years since my hair stylist inturduced it to me and it works great. My hair is naturely curly and not a lot of conditioners leave my hair feeling soft except this product.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> I Love It!! We have a woodburner in our house and my hair gets VERY VERY dry in the winter. This makes my hair soft and touchable again! Smells WONDERFULL!!</li>
            <li> just as described, promptly sent</li>
            <li> This is real thick and really works for dry damaged hair. I use this all the time and love it.</li>
            <li> This tub is FAT and will last a long time. Leaves my hair shiny and soft plus it smells good. Not really a strong noticeable smell but it&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I thought I notice a change in the shampoo, seemed a bit runny. Then this last conditioner was a very obvious change in the feel. No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products. I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different. This WAS the only product I had ever found that worked on my hair. Guess it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily. Goes back to the old adage, don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broken!!!!!! ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It is the best price for the value. I have super thick curly hair and I love using this product for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> i have been using Matrix Biolage Conditioning Balm for years; it make permed hair smoother and keeps it healthier longer.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after the exercise of washing and conditioning with both the shampoo and conditioner. It has a wonderful smell and leaves my hair in moist condition.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best conditioner for curly, thick hair that likes to frizz if left on its own. I use it in the shower whenever I shampoo plus every couple of weeks I leave it in for like 20 minutes of deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! It works for long, thick, curly hair and is the best conditioner we have ever used! It works for all types and textures of hair.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner.  I love all of the biolage brand.  Would like to order the hydrating balm next time though.  It works better for my needs.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to work on my daughter&#x27;s thick, curly hair.  Imagine it. Might be too heavy for finer hair.</li>
            <li> I have course hair that can be very frizzy. WIth Biolage, I never have an issue with tangles and it is heavy enough to weigh my hair down perfectly. I like the large size container as well since it is less money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping  Great product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for many years, and it is still the best on the market.  Leaves my hair tangle free, soft and shiny.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair the extra moisture that it needs. I color my hair a lot and it gets dried out, so this helps to keep it in balance.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years. I sometimes switch to other conditioners to try something new and I always regret it. I have color-treated hair and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The product received was hydrasource, not conditioning balm. Such a bummer. The picture was wrong. Hydra source is not at all like conditioning balm. I was willing to pay extra for the balm.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner.  I have color-treated hair and I use this product regularly to keep it from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li> This container lasted me just over one year, what a deal!!  This is the best conditioner I have found - I use it every day, and it makes my hair feel just right.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be of great help in caring for my fine hair. As soon as I put it in, it is as if my hair says &amp;#34;Ah, I can relax!&amp;#34; from its normally stressed state of coarseness stemming from dryness. Even though it is recommended to change hair products every once in a while, I felt I will always come back to using this thus making this size a value. I feel it helps to protect the hair from further stress from exposure to the demands in daily life. After rinsing this out, I still use a frizz-control product along with slight spritzes of leave-in conditioner before I detangle my hair but this product allows me to use less of these other ones.</li>
            <li> I can not believe this has lasted a year! It smells good and works well.  It is not too thick and there is never a build up in my hair or on my scalp.  I have long, fine, color treated hair and this conditioner leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  My hair never looks limp or weighed down.  Over all, I&#x27;m buying it again. :)</li>
            <li> Easy way to order hair products - they appear on the door and no need to fight the crowds at the store - I love this product it provides great texture to my dry colored hair.</li>
            <li> Been using Matrix products for several decades and find the Biologe to be my favorite.  This conditioner is great for chemically treated hair, or anyone with a lot of natural curl.  You can leave some in the hair, which helps with frizzes and picking out the curls.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for dry damaged hair.  I had damaged my hair with excessive bleaching and this has made all the difference in the world.  I also like the consistancy, it is thick and doesn&#x27;t take very much to get the job done.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I leave this conditioner on my hair for about an hour with a bag over my head.  It leaves my hair soft and silky!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner.  It&#x27;s the only stuff that works on my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!!! As you read the product info, you always wonder if products like this are what they describe them as.  This one is.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite hair care product.  Unfortunately it really dried my hair out.  I looked completely frizzy.</li>
            <li> Hair stylist recommended product to me 2 years ago and still using it!!! Had a bad hair dye done and it fried my hair his brought it back to life!</li>
            <li> SO this is a lot more huge than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s ok. I feel like this will last me for at least a year or two.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is indeed moisturizing. I gave it 3 stars because unlike other hair moisturizers that leave your hair soft, silky and managable, once you wash it out, it left my hair stringy, heavy, and flat. And now I&#x27;m stuck with 37-oz of it. So now I am experimenting with it and applying it to dry hair after it has been flat ironed for a few days. So far it&#x27;s been pretty managable.</li>
            <li> Works great save money buying here. Repeat buyer</li>
            <li> This was my favorite deep conditioner. Hands down. I have very thick long hair I used to balance out the price and the benefits by mixing it with Hair Mayonnaise from the beauty supply. Pour both into a bowl and mix together then put back into tubs. Its a magical combo. I was set for a year mimimum! Honestly I havent tried the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula mainly because I can&#x27;t find an ingredient comparison. But, I hear that one change is wheat germ/wheat germ oil. This is an excellent ingredient it is &amp;#34;proven&amp;#34; to thicken your hair. Not just the look of your hair &amp;#34;your hair&amp;#34;. That said you can always buy wheat germ oil add it in and voila. Hope this helps! I miss my wonder combo :-(</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is the price. Unfortunately, it is a bit costly in my opinion, but it&#x27;s not loaded with silicones like MOST conditioners on the market, especially those found in Salon lineups. Silicones make your hair feel nice, but repel moisture. It&#x27;s(using silicone filled conditioners/products) sort of like putting a band-aid on a broken leg.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Decyl Oleate, Rosemary Extract (Rosemarinus Officinalis), Goldenseal (Hydrastis Canadensis), Algae Extract, Chitosan PCA, Quaternium 79 Hydrolyzed Keratin, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is curly girl friendly also, which is great for moisture loving locks and those who avoid daily shampoos as your hair will not become lifeless &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this product all of the time, it leaves my hair silky soft and has no tangles at all...I would recommend  this for everyone that wants to have healthy hair.</li>
