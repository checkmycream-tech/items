            <li>best for what it is</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It came in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly to keep it from breaking.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>Best cooking oil and for your skin</li>
            <li>and I find it to be very good.</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>My hair dresser always comments on the great condition of my hair and</li>
            <li>Great for Pre-poo under the dryer</li>
            <li>great price!!On time delivery.</li>
            <li>Really great stuff for massage, moisturizer, conditioner, After shave,  animal coat moisturizer, sun burns and so much more kre!</li>
            <li>I prefer the taste of olive oil in most things though, but for a light dish it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>the grapeseed oil did a nice job of thinning it out</li>
            <li>and it also makes your hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Very smooth oil indeed.</li>
            <li>We love grape seed oil.</li>
            <li>I also mix it with castor oil (w/ more of the grapeseed) when I&#x27;m doing an oil cleansing method on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine was wrapped in bubble wrap with more packing around it to keep it from breaking.</li>
            <li>I do love when things come in glass because it allows me to reuse it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one of my favorite since it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li>Great stuff fast shipping will order again and again and again... and again fast so if you&#x27;re doinng it right you&#x27;ll buy this oil.</li>
            <li>I wish this item came in larger, more econical sizes.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that tends to dry out very easily and grapeseed oil really helps condition.</li>
            <li>Castor oil is very viscous, ​and</li>
            <li>It does also taste much lighter then, say, olive oil</li>
            <li>so that might be something to consider, it has a much finer/fainter taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much lighter oil compared to olive oil, and it&#x27;s also a healthy oil compared to other oils.</li>
            <li>The dark glass bottle also helps it maintain freshness so you have more bang for your buck over time.</li>
            <li>It has a great light texture and scent, so those who feel icky or repulsed by the natural texture and scent of other natural oils will prefer this one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and is light enough to use as a regular body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Deciding on grapeseed oil was pretty much a no brainier for me based on the benefits of it and the price (compared to other oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, i wasn unable to actually use this particular brand due to it never making hsipment to my house, however i did purchase another brand and the grape seed oils work great for moisturing your skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a very dark brown glass which I plan on using for some of my other oil blends (dark glass being good for storing oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Coverage bottle smashed all oil fell ,I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I wish this item came in larger, more econical sizes. This is a beneficial oil for cooking as well as for the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of grape seed oil to remove my mascara and other makeup for years.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and is light enough to use as a regular body moisturizer.  I especially like the dark glass bottle that it comes in.</li>
            <li> Any grape seed oil works wonders, i wasn unable to actually use this particular brand due to it never making hsipment to my house, however i did purchase another brand and the grape seed oils work great for moisturing your skin.</li>
            <li> We love grape seed oil. We use it in the bedroom as lubrication and it works well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff fast shipping will order again and again and again... and again fast so if you&#x27;re doinng it right you&#x27;ll buy this oil. best for what it is</li>
            <li> Really great stuff for massage, moisturizer, conditioner, After shave,  animal coat moisturizer, sun burns and so much more kre!</li>
            <li> I read about the benefits of grapeseed oil on a hair forum and ordered this.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my ends and as-need for moisture.  It is lite without the &amp;#34;african american hair product smell&amp;#34; that drives me insane.  My hair dresser always comments on the great condition of my hair and I give this grapeseed oil some of the credit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as a base oil for my body balms and butters, and occasional massage oil. It has a great light texture and scent, so those who feel icky or repulsed by the natural texture and scent of other natural oils will prefer this one. The dark glass bottle also helps it maintain freshness so you have more bang for your buck over time.</li>
            <li> Good product! Meets every expectation.</li>
            <li> When I bought my bottle it was intended for cosmetic use. I was going to make a salve and decided to use castor oil and grapeseed oil. Castor oil is very viscous, ​and the grapeseed oil did a nice job of thinning it out so it wasn&#x27;t so thick. Deciding on grapeseed oil was pretty much a no brainier for me based on the benefits of it and the price (compared to other oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some of the other reviews, I do also use grapeseed oil for my hair. I have curly hair that tends to dry out very easily and grapeseed oil really helps condition. Out of all the oils I use it&#x27;s one of my favorite since it&#x27;s so light. I also mix it with castor oil (w/ more of the grapeseed) when I&#x27;m doing an oil cleansing method on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought mine it was just for the salve but I&#x27;m very happy with the product. It came in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly to keep it from breaking. If anyone is worried about that, the bottle is glass so that might be something to consider. Mine was wrapped in bubble wrap with more packing around it to keep it from breaking. I do love when things come in glass because it allows me to reuse it. The bottle is a very dark brown glass which I plan on using for some of my other oil blends (dark glass being good for storing oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is curious about cooking w/ grapeseed (I didn&#x27;t use this one this time though) it has a very high smoking point so you usually don&#x27;t have to worry about smoke. I&#x27;ve fried with it and used it in salads. It&#x27;s a much lighter oil compared to olive oil, and it&#x27;s also a healthy oil compared to other oils. It does also taste much lighter then, say, olive oil so that might be something to consider, it has a much finer/fainter taste. I prefer the taste of olive oil in most things though, but for a light dish it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Great for Pre-poo under the dryer and it also makes your hair nice and shiny. I use it to seal my mouistrizer on occasion</li>
            <li> Came on time and what was described!</li>
            <li> This is a primary ingredient in expensive pre-shave oils.  So I just bought it and use it pre shave.  As essential oils go, this one is on the &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; side, so it moisturizes and lubes, but doesn&#x27;t gunk up your shaving razor.</li>
            <li> great price!!On time delivery.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Very smooth oil indeed.</li>
            <li> Best cooking oil and for your skin</li>
            <li> i always base my natural oil prices based on pricing. This is the cheapest. Well-trusted band. Recommend to anyone interested.</li>
