            <li>and once it hardens again you&#x27;ll be good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought that this was going to hold my hair really good</li>
            <li>it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff! ,...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottle shape doesn&#x27;t allow it to be stood up, which would be nice</li>
            <li>Great, got right on time</li>
            <li>It has good holding power and a pretty nice smell...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Most hair gels will sweat and flake off but not this one buddy.</li>
            <li>I love it and buy it by the case.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff &amp; haven&#x27;t tried anything else.  </li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need more than a nickel size amount.</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for what it is.</li>
            <li>,...then will give five stars: )</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found out the its mostly used for shorter hair styles because of the way it hardens.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, you&#x27;d probably be better off using this if you have shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since moved onto a pomade which works much better for me.</li>
            <li>it was ok.</li>
            <li>I just threw my tube of it away in disgust after many attempts to like it.</li>
            <li>This product it&#x27;s great, don&#x27;t need to use much to keep your hair in hold.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using hair gels and have heard good reviews about the Sebastian Liquid Steel.  </li>
            <li>This works pretty well and smells good, I needed something to replace Kis Ultra hold gel.  </li>
            <li>Also, and  even more importantly, it does not have a flip-open cap.</li>
            <li>Easily washes out.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll freeze that style very quickly.</li>
            <li>It make it so easy to spike.</li>
            <li>Strong hold.</li>
            <li>My salon used to charge me $18 per bottle, so this is a great price as long as you get free shipping!</li>
            <li>manly, but light, for people who don&#x27;t like strongly scented hair products.</li>
            <li>Great for short hair with a part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for short funky haircuts!</li>
            <li>It gives me fantastic body and style power.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He does have a short hairstyle but it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Works best right out of the shower when your hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li>definitely speechless, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic gel for fine, straight, no body hair.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the best.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and met my expectations.</li>
            <li>You have to take the top completely off the bottle to use the gel...not as convenient/user friendly.</li>
            <li>What I love about this gel is that it is strong without clumping or showing any flakes or white stuff in my hair, and it is renewable ...</li>
            <li>Great, firm styling gel.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I primarily use this product when I put my long hair up in a &#x27;twist&#x27;.....this makes the tips of the &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; really separate and look striking....</li>
            <li>Good gel for &amp;#34;Hold,&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t really possess anymore &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; than other gels.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to it by a hairstylist and after that I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>I work in Iraq and as you may have guessed it&#x27;s hot here.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sebastian Liquid Steel!</li>
            <li>Good product for limp hair.</li>
            <li>expected to be amazing hold up hair for hours or whole day and did not happen</li>
            <li>Nice because I have really thin hair on the top of my head and it provide the volume I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>That changed once I started using Liquid Steel, I was steered to this because of all of the positive reviews on Amazon, and I&#x27;m here to say I just placed an order for another bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Need very little to be effective so you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Long lasting hold, with a good smell to go along with it.</li>
            <li>but instead it&#x27;s not as strong as advertised and won&#x27;t hold down hair with even mild curls</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>i was very disapointed in this product</li>
            <li>This gel keeps my hair insanely straight edge killer style.</li>
            <li>Last, the packaging is genius -- it will fly past the 100ml limit security screening.</li>
            <li>Has to be applied quickly as it dries fast in your hand, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair wet-looking and flexible  enough.</li>
            <li>Liquid Steel is the best substitute I&#x27;ve used so far, and I have tried at least 10 other fibers, gels and hair products.</li>
            <li>2 b gel holds better than this and at half the price</li>
            <li>highly recommend this gel to anyone on here</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product is you are looking for a high quality hair gel.</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled a little stronger, as I do like a bit more scent than this has.</li>
            <li>Holds thick hair well in all kind of climates.</li>
            <li>This product can go onto damp and dry hair, sets quickly (any business travelers out there who don&#x27;t have time for the blow dryer ?)</li>
            <li>Even after changing shirts, sweater, pull-overs, and the like, my hair only needs a little bit of water to give it stylish look again.  </li>
            <li>Holds my hair very well, I have short hair, so not a lot to hold.</li>
            <li>Professional smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 10-year old son, who uses it to spike his hair.</li>
            <li>I have short, thick wiry hair that has a mind of its own and liquid steel has no problem keeping it in place;  3.</li>
            <li>the down side, wish it  was made available in larger size.</li>
            <li>If you like a stiff hairspray hold, this product may be right for you, but if you want the hair to look a little mussed and textured while remaining soft and able to be tossed or brushed, stay away from it.  </li>
            <li>Hair gets pretty stiff but really holds a curl.</li>
            <li>It has the right amount of strength without his hair looking matted down.</li>
            <li>Usually, the cheaper strong hold gels normally last only half the day.  </li>

            <li> Usually, the cheaper strong hold gels normally last only half the day.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick/coarse hair that not many gels can hold all day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff, smelly, or greasy.</li>
            <li> Basically every time that I took my helmet off, my hair would be matted down or be completely out of place.</li>
            <li> and after the hair is dry, it will not flake out like lesser products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It has since been discontinued for some strange reason.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes like other hair gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking high and low for something to replace Sebastian&#x27;s Twisted Taffy, which for me was, the ultimate hair fiber.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> when you wet your hair, giving it a wet look again when desired.</li>
            <li> If for whatever reason you need to restyle it, just wet your hair</li>
            <li> (I then put a tiny bit of wax over the dried gel--keep the matte finish look).  </li>
            <li> I can confirm what the other reviews have written:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Got2B and the other mainstream brands but nothing gives me the confidence that my hair isn&#x27;t going to move.</li>
            <li> With in a few seconds its back to rock hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a U.S. Quarter size amount or less</li>
            <li> Moreover, the product doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and can be reactivated after a long-haul flight in an airport bathroom with a little water/dampness in seconds.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;horrible, often crusty texture in my hair after it dried (could be my longer hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He used to use Crew Firm Hold Gel</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t quite as stiff but works</li>
            <li> I am not sure what made the seller to ship me a what-I-think to be an expired product, but again, I am not sure if there is a definitive expiration date on hair gels.  </li>
            <li> Little expensive</li>
            <li> At least, not until now!</li>
            <li> The main complaint I have about the product is that the bottle it comes in is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> It has this weird, rubberized, dull, black cap that everything sticks to, and it just makes the bottle look ugly.</li>
            <li> Once it is in the hair it makes the hair stiff and impossible to comb.  </li>
            <li> I failed to mention I&#x27;m a firefighter and let me tell you even after a fire I just remove my mask and helmet and reshape it.</li>
            <li> Am still looking for a replacement for Sebastion Twisted Taffy, now discontinued.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing like Twisted Taffy, which I was hoping it would replace.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s being phased out.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I was first introduced to it by a hairstylist and after that I was hooked.  It doesn&#x27;t flake and it lasts a long time.  It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair a helmet.  The only thing that bothers me about Sebastian&#x27;s Liquid Steel is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a larger bottle!  Seriously, the best.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product. It gives my hair body and lift without being sticky or pasty. Lasts all day and can be refreshed with a bit of water on the hands, worked into the style.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time.  Just what my wife wanted.  Happy wife/happy home.</li>
            <li> I use this along with American crew fiber. The liquid steel gets the look I want, and the fiber maintains the hold all day.</li>
            <li> My son loves this and keeps his hair in place all day!!</li>
            <li> I work in Iraq and as you may have guessed it&#x27;s hot here. Most hair gels will sweat and flake off but not this one buddy. I failed to mention I&#x27;m a firefighter and let me tell you even after a fire I just remove my mask and helmet and reshape it. With in a few seconds its back to rock hard. I love it and buy it by the case. If you have ever seen \\&quot;Something about Mary\\&quot; you might remember the \\&quot;hair gel\\&quot; scene, well thats this gel.</li>
            <li> Good gel for &amp;#34;Hold,&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t really possess anymore &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; than other gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking high and low for something to replace Sebastian&#x27;s Twisted Taffy, which for me was, the ultimate hair fiber. It has since been discontinued for some strange reason.  Liquid Steel is the best substitute I&#x27;ve used so far, and I have tried at least 10 other fibers, gels and hair products. I can confirm what the other reviews have written:  1. It does not flake;  2. It holds your hair in place with surprising strength. I have short, thick wiry hair that has a mind of its own and liquid steel has no problem keeping it in place;  3. Liquid Steel \\&quot;reactivates\\&quot; when you wet your hair, giving it a wet look again when desired.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair very well, I have short hair, so not a lot to hold. But it holds like steel!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at a local upscale hair salon ... then they stopped carrying it.  Natch!  What I love about this gel is that it is strong without clumping or showing any flakes or white stuff in my hair, and it is renewable ... that is, I can splash a bit of water on my hands and tussle my hair a bit and I&#x27;m good to go - without restyling from scratch. My salon used to charge me $18 per bottle, so this is a great price as long as you get free shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff &amp; haven&#x27;t tried anything else.  I have med/short hair &amp; like it spiky and this does that for me.  It is almost weather proof and the ony thing that will distroy it is water.  Easily washes out.</li>
            <li> As a career firefighter, I was always used to &amp;#34;helmet hair&amp;#34;. Basically every time that I took my helmet off, my hair would be matted down or be completely out of place. That changed once I started using Liquid Steel, I was steered to this because of all of the positive reviews on Amazon, and I&#x27;m here to say I just placed an order for another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Got2B and the other mainstream brands but nothing gives me the confidence that my hair isn&#x27;t going to move. It doesn&#x27;t give an oily looking shine and it also doesn&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a U.S. Quarter size amount or less and you&#x27;re good to go. Style it the way you want and it&#x27;ll freeze that style very quickly. If for whatever reason you need to restyle it, just wet your hair and once it hardens again you&#x27;ll be good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this gel to anyone on here that&#x27;s unsure of whether it&#x27;s for them or not. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the best styling gel to keep your hair in place. Great for short hair with a part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap but you don&#x27;t need more than a nickel size amount. No flaking. Professional smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use American Crew Grooming Paste to style and Liquid Steel to hold. Awesome combo.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using hair gels and have heard good reviews about the Sebastian Liquid Steel.  But when I peeled off the label sticker on the back of the bottle, I saw this product was from year 2007 (today is June 2014).  I am not sure what made the seller to ship me a what-I-think to be an expired product, but again, I am not sure if there is a definitive expiration date on hair gels.  But this does make me believe that there is a backlog of the product in whoever sold this product to me.  I felt using a barcode label to cover up the product year was also deceiving to the customers.</li>
            <li> Great for short funky haircuts!</li>
            <li> This product can go onto damp and dry hair, sets quickly (any business travelers out there who don&#x27;t have time for the blow dryer ?) and after the hair is dry, it will not flake out like lesser products.  Moreover, the product doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and can be reactivated after a long-haul flight in an airport bathroom with a little water/dampness in seconds.  Last, the packaging is genius -- it will fly past the 100ml limit security screening.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes like other hair gels.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Holds thick hair well in all kind of climates. I love this gel. I wished they sold it in larger containers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for what it is. Has to be applied quickly as it dries fast in your hand, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair wet-looking and flexible  enough. Am still looking for a replacement for Sebastion Twisted Taffy, now discontinued. This product is close, but not it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! ,... the down side, wish it  was made available in larger size. ,...then will give five stars: )</li>
            <li> Strongest gel for the money.  I have a short faux hawk and used to use waxes and pastes for years.  I went back to gel because nothing beats it for hold.  I brush it out when it dries so that it doesn&#x27;t shine (I then put a tiny bit of wax over the dried gel--keep the matte finish look).  Strong hold.</li>
            <li> Great, firm styling gel.</li>
            <li> Great, got right on time</li>
            <li> I primarily use this product when I put my long hair up in a &#x27;twist&#x27;.....this makes the tips of the &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; really separate and look striking....I highly recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff, smelly, or greasy.</li>
            <li> Honestly a very great hair product I use it all the time but I&#x27;ve found out the its mostly used for shorter hair styles because of the way it hardens.</li>
            <li> Good product for limp hair. Hair gets pretty stiff but really holds a curl.</li>
            <li> Used Liquid Steel previously,love it but couldn&#x27;t locate it anywhere else. Can&#x27;t do without it,it&#x27;s GREAT !! I use it all the time,it makes my hair do what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> The product works miracles on my husbands hair it stays in place all day. I now use it on my grandsons hair. It make it so easy to spike.</li>
            <li> I thought that this was going to hold my hair really good but instead it&#x27;s not as strong as advertised and won&#x27;t hold down hair with even mild curls i was very disapointed in this product my got 2 b gel holds better than this and at half the price</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 10-year old son, who uses it to spike his hair. He likes it well enough. It has good holding power and a pretty nice smell...manly, but light, for people who don&#x27;t like strongly scented hair products. I wish it smelled a little stronger, as I do like a bit more scent than this has. The main complaint I have about the product is that the bottle it comes in is AWFUL. It has this weird, rubberized, dull, black cap that everything sticks to, and it just makes the bottle look ugly. Also, and  even more importantly, it does not have a flip-open cap. You have to take the top completely off the bottle to use the gel...not as convenient/user friendly.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. Shipped quickly and met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Need very little to be effective so you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> No gel has ever managed to hold my stubborn hair. At least, not until now! Thanks Sebastian Liquid Steel! TOTALLY recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic gel for fine, straight, no body hair. It gives me fantastic body and style power.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Holds well&lt;br /&gt;Is reworkable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bottle shape doesn&#x27;t allow it to be stood up, which would be nice&lt;br /&gt;horrible, often crusty texture in my hair after it dried (could be my longer hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you&#x27;d probably be better off using this if you have shorter hair. I&#x27;ve since moved onto a pomade which works much better for me.</li>
            <li> it was ok. expected to be amazing hold up hair for hours or whole day and did not happen</li>
            <li> This works pretty well and smells good, I needed something to replace Kis Ultra hold gel.  This isn&#x27;t quite as stiff but works</li>
            <li> Long lasting hold, with a good smell to go along with it. You do not need to use a lot to make you hair stick all day. Highly recommend this product is you are looking for a high quality hair gel.</li>
            <li> Im definitely speechless, this stuff is amazing! This is the ultimate style. It smells oh man it smells so good.  This gel keeps my hair insanely straight edge killer style. I would definitely recommend it. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing like Twisted Taffy, which I was hoping it would replace.  It is basically gooey hairspray in a tube, and it dries immediately in the hands and turns sticky before you can style with it.  Once it is in the hair it makes the hair stiff and impossible to comb.  If you like a stiff hairspray hold, this product may be right for you, but if you want the hair to look a little mussed and textured while remaining soft and able to be tossed or brushed, stay away from it.  I just threw my tube of it away in disgust after many attempts to like it.</li>
            <li> Great product for men.  Works best right out of the shower when your hair is still wet.  I use a couple drops in my palm and then rub them together before running it through my hair.  Nice because I have really thin hair on the top of my head and it provide the volume I am looking for.  Even found my daughter using it on occasion to style her hair and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s great, don&#x27;t need to use much to keep your hair in hold. Little expensive but it&#x27;s with it.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s being phased out.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair gel my husband will use. It has the right amount of strength without his hair looking matted down. He does have a short hairstyle but it does a great job. He used to use Crew Firm Hold Gel but they must have changed their formula because it stopped holding as well.</li>
            <li> I have very thick/coarse hair that not many gels can hold all day.  Usually, the cheaper strong hold gels normally last only half the day.  It seems that my hair eats away at gel.  Liquid Steel doesn&#x27;t give the appearance of a greasy and shiney look that those goop in a jar products seem to do.  Even after changing shirts, sweater, pull-overs, and the like, my hair only needs a little bit of water to give it stylish look again.  Wish I knew about this gel when I was younger, so I could have kept a longer cut.  Impressed as can be with this product. A+</li>
            <li> Excellent for spiking, this 4.2 oz supply lasts me about 4 months.  Definitely worth the money!  Will buy again soon!</li>
