            <li>love it makes my hair smooth and smell good</li>
            <li>It makes your hair smell super good.</li>
            <li>I love this hair straightening .</li>
            <li>This helped my hair when I straightened it and smooth it out, but I could still use this shampoo and wear my hair wavy which I also liked.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell</li>
            <li>This is my favorite to use now on my hair.</li>
            <li>I saw this one on amazon and figured since I love the color</li>
            <li>And NO conditioner has been able to do that EVER.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner, but I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I share all shampoo and conditioners, and we both love the smell and the feel this one from Herbal Essences leaves us.</li>
            <li>I actually wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>so when you get out of shower its easy to brush hair.</li>
            <li>I do not like this product, it does nothing for my hair and this particular one does not have a good smell to it</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked to make it manageable and smooth without snarls.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Smells great, reminds me of their long term relationship which I been no longer find.</li>
            <li>Then I said ok let me give the product one more chance using it alone with no other product to see how I like it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this product and it works great for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This herbal essence shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny And smelling fabulous!</li>
            <li>Quality is good, as expected from herbal essence.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so smooth and soft ALL day!!!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t test out the flat iron results using this, but I am happy so far in how it keeps my hair from shrinking up so drastically.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I wanted a smoothing conditioner to help make flat ironing easier and this works :)</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out and probably does a better job than the conditioner.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>and my fiance always tell me do something about those wings because pieces are just curling straight out.</li>
            <li>I expected much more from  Herba Essence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both liberally and can tell you, without hesitation, that this is where your hard-earned dollars are better spent.</li>
            <li>next but, as for right now this and Hello Hydration are defiantly going to be a staple in my hair regimen!</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner could do a slightly better job at detangling, but overall I&#x27;d definitely</li>
            <li>and I usually keep my hair up the whole season, but the hair on top of my head was always frizzing out</li>
            <li>Most conditioners don&#x27;t do a thing to help tame the frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the middle of a hot humid summer now</li>
            <li>Fragrance is outstanding without being overpowering and it performs as well as, if not better than, its salon counterpart.</li>
            <li>And leaves my hair soft one of my new favs</li>
            <li>I noticed my bangs became very straight after using this product, but the rest of my hair was a combo of loose curls and normal curls.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than my local store!</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Way to much left behind for fine hair.</li>

            <li> I have curly hair and is hard to straighten with hot iron.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and it truly smooths down the frizzies!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and with other shampoos when I blow dry and straighten my hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair dry, it&#x27;s not enough moisture in it.</li>
            <li> sorry..... but other brands are much better</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Herbal Essences products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the Long Term Relationship</li>
            <li> this may not help enough but it does help a little</li>
            <li> and I no longer need to use other product to help.</li>
            <li> It does help if you&#x27;re trying to blow dry/ straighten your hair afterwards, but don&#x27;t expect it to cut down lots of time.</li>
            <li> I have noticed over time using this that it&#x27;s showing up less</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with a little bit of a sticky coated feelig.</li>
            <li> Not happy with how greasy and flat it made my hair after using.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little small for the price and doesn&#x27;t straighten anything.</li>
            <li> Always have been since the late 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> I have really thick and frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> My hair, since having my 2nd child 15 months ago, has been awful.</li>
            <li> Helps keep your hair from curling like crazy keeps the frizz under control!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>

            <li> I love this hair straightening . I have curly hair and is hard to straighten with hot iron. It makes your hair smell super good. I will buy again</li>
            <li> love it makes my hair smooth and smell good</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought it using subscribe and save and was really happy.</li>
            <li> Great scent! This herbal essence shampoo leaves my hair soft and shiny And smelling fabulous! Works great. Quality is good, as expected from herbal essence. I used a mfg. Coupon on this and got it at a great price. Definitely worth it! Amazon: I purchased this myself, please do not delete my review.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and with other shampoos when I blow dry and straighten my hair it still tends to be fizzy. This helped my hair when I straightened it and smooth it out, but I could still use this shampoo and wear my hair wavy which I also liked. I also love the smell</li>
            <li> Size in the pic can be misleading.  It is a smaller size bottle.</li>
            <li> sorry..... but other brands are much better</li>
            <li> Works well for my daughter&#x27;s knotty hair and smells great</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great and I got it for a great price! thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite to use now on my hair. Takes out the tangles so when you get out of shower its easy to brush hair. Also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Helps keep your hair from curling like crazy keeps the frizz under control!&lt;br /&gt;If you are a giant puff ball of frizz this may not help enough but it does help a little</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not on sale, I will never purchase it. It makes my hair dry, it&#x27;s not enough moisture in it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite conditioner! I have really thick and frizzy hair! Most conditioners don&#x27;t do a thing to help tame the frizz. I saw this one on amazon and figured since I love the color me happy ones that I would give them one a try. You can really see the difference in my hair. It&#x27;s summer time now and I usually keep my hair up the whole season, but the hair on top of my head was always frizzing out and my fiance always tell me do something about those wings because pieces are just curling straight out. I have noticed over time using this that it&#x27;s showing up less and I no longer need to use other product to help. I also love how it leaves my hair smelling!</li>
            <li> My hair, since having my 2nd child 15 months ago, has been awful. Nothing has worked to make it manageable and smooth without snarls. This did!! Very excited!</li>
            <li> I received this at a discounted price to try and give an honest review, it has a nice smell to it, it came in a nice size bottle and it works great</li>
            <li> I use herbal essences pretty often and it seems awesome.  I don&#x27;t see any reason to change brands.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and has a great perfect scent.  I expect it to smell good and it does!</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and feels great</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner. Smells really good. Got this at a great price with the Subscribe and Save program. Much cheaper than my local store!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product and it works great for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and it truly smooths down the frizzies!! I have unruly 4B hair that just shrinks up 75% after washing (4B girls know what I&#x27;m talking about). I wanted a smoothing conditioner to help make flat ironing easier and this works :)&lt;br /&gt;Someone recommended this on YouTube and she says it helps your hair have bounce! So we shall see. But it definitely passed the wash n go test. It&#x27;s the middle of a hot humid summer now so I can&#x27;t test out the flat iron results using this, but I am happy so far in how it keeps my hair from shrinking up so drastically. And NO conditioner has been able to do that EVER.&lt;br /&gt;I am really really happy with Herbal Essences products. Always have been since the late 70&#x27;s they smell so good!Hope my review helps, please thumbs up if it does!</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. And leaves my hair soft one of my new favs</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great &amp; a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner and I like it so far. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out and probably does a better job than the conditioner. Both products will loosen your curls, but nothing drastic. I noticed my bangs became very straight after using this product, but the rest of my hair was a combo of loose curls and normal curls.It does help if you&#x27;re trying to blow dry/ straighten your hair afterwards, but don&#x27;t expect it to cut down lots of time. I would buy the shampoo again since it wash very good at detangling.</li>
            <li> love it...just wish it had bigger sizes for the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, but I will not be buying it again. It doesn&#x27;t get the job done. It sucks.</li>
            <li> Great product. My daughter and I share all shampoo and conditioners, and we both love the smell and the feel this one from Herbal Essences leaves us.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with a little bit of a sticky coated feelig.I expected much more from  Herba Essence. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product, it does nothing for my hair and this particular one does not have a good smell to it</li>
            <li> Way to much left behind for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged.  My daughter loves this product.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing - great conditioner - and another variety of Herbal Essence i will add to my every day products at home - recommended!</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Herbal Essences products. Hello Hydration is usually my go to daily conditioner. But, I saw this and decided to give it a try just to see with it would feel and smell like in my hair. I absolutely love the smell and the first time I used it I actually wasn&#x27;t impressed. I was thinking oh well I&#x27;ll just use this as part of my pre poo to use up the rest of the product. Then I said ok let me give the product one more chance using it alone with no other product to see how I like it. I&#x27;m sooooo glad that I did!! My hair felt so smooth and soft ALL day!!! I love it!!! I&#x27;m going to try the Long Term Relationship next but, as for right now this and Hello Hydration are defiantly going to be a staple in my hair regimen!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing. The bottle is a little small for the price and doesn&#x27;t straighten anything. But it does smell good.</li>
            <li> Not happy with how greasy and flat it made my hair after using.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is outstanding without being overpowering and it performs as well as, if not better than, its salon counterpart. I&#x27;ve used both liberally and can tell you, without hesitation, that this is where your hard-earned dollars are better spent. $3.00 vs. $40.00 AND it rocks?!? Sign me up!</li>
            <li> Smells great, reminds me of their long term relationship which I been no longer find. The conditioner could do a slightly better job at detangling, but overall I&#x27;d definitely but this again</li>
            <li> My hair is not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this hair essences will help for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner and smells amazing</li>
            <li> great smell leaves your hair nice and smooth &amp; clean</li>
