            <li>In great condition!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This mannequin head was perfect for displaying a mask I wore to a Brazilian carnaval.</li>
            <li>This item is the perfect size for hat displays and hat blocking.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t for the dents I would have loved it!..</li>
            <li>Great price .</li>
            <li>So this thing is great</li>
            <li>its great</li>
            <li>Arrived with very good condition: no dents or marks of any kind, but the head has a face instead of the no face head in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li>The product came in good shape and is as advertised.</li>
            <li>This head form is perfect for blocking hats that are made to fit to the head.</li>
            <li>It arrived in good condition, and its what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good size.</li>
            <li>It was a good product.</li>
            <li>Suits my purposes for cosplay wig styling perfectly -- and it shipped with some T-pins to secure the wig.</li>
            <li>I was also hoping to use it for some photos of my knitted good</li>
            <li>It also gives me a good idea of how the hat will look when it is worn.</li>
            <li>its nice Styrofoam wig head very nice</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly and was packaged perfectly :)</li>
            <li>I like having no face because honestly faces on things freak me out.</li>
            <li>I still need a nice featureless form</li>
            <li>They came in handy</li>
            <li>Most of the ones with pretty faces displayed at salons, have necks held at an angle that just aren&#x27;t good for storage and styling of your own wig in your own home.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted, great size and shape.</li>
            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>Might be better if a weight was put into the bottom?</li>
            <li>I knit, crochet and otherwise make a lot of hats, mostly Juliet type close fitting caps.</li>
            <li>There is a formal table clip, but I never found it suited my home use - it was more for professionals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found this source at Amazon</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be a hat/wig stand I KNOW, but most foam heads are able to hold masks and whatnot.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to retire my favorite hats.</li>
            <li>Overall my product is great though!</li>
            <li>and I thought this head would not be able to support it, but it did.</li>
            <li>and I think my mask would have been better if there were features on it, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work</li>
            <li>glad I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>But ok.</li>
            <li>mostly to take pictures of my items for my online shop..</li>
            <li>Just regret not buying more</li>
            <li>so I could make more than one wig at a time</li>
            <li>It is best to be careful with it.</li>
            <li>I had a good time putting my reading glasses on it; really dressed it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you need to make this stand more stable, it is easy to fill the hole in the bottom with a mix of Plaster of Paris available at any hardware store.  </li>
            <li>and I especially liked the fact that this stand provides a better fit for wigs than any other I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>As a knitter I often make hats, as portable projects, and this head makes blocking them easy.</li>
            <li>These stands are perfectly sized for average women&#x27;s wigs, falls, 3/4&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The head holds the mask pretty well, and they look nice with eachother.</li>
            <li>(this was the first one I found on a quick Amazon search with a smooth face and good reviews).</li>
            <li>Product itself  was fine</li>
            <li>The one in the pic is shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Its effecitve, somewhat light weight.</li>
            <li>I ordered this form as it is featureless and appears to be smooth in the photo.</li>
            <li>It stays balanced and upright despite its light weight.  </li>
            <li>quality is cheap Styrofoam, for something cheap</li>
            <li>However, if you were looking for something elegant to display hats, wigs, or virtual reality headgear, then this might not be the right item.  </li>
            <li>Very useful for me.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to recieve this item since I would use it to display my crochet hats and headband..</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d better not bang it up too much!</li>
            <li>I bought this to take proper pictures of my crochet hats I will be selling, and this is a great display head, nice and round, stands nicely.</li>
            <li>It was packed in a box full of styrofoam S&#x27;s, which might have been what hurt it but might have protected it during shipping, who knows.</li>
            <li>The Israeli mask fit on this head like a charm, since it&#x27;s a strap on mask, so you just loosen the mask, put it on the head, and tighten, but my Russian mask is a bit more challenging, since it&#x27;s a \\&quot;Hood type\\&quot; mask.</li>
            <li>not a bad deal for the money.</li>
            <li>The folding stands are adequate for travel, but I just tip my toiletry bag on end and store my wig overnight on that.  </li>
            <li>I needed it quickly for something</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great deal, Quick Ship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for forming my hats after washing them and spraying them down with spray starch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Every one walks and takes a look at the caps on the wigg head and has a laugh.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the kind that has human features...too spooky!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a foam head to hold wigs, hats, or virtual reality headgear, well you came to the right place.  </li>
            <li>The wig head is a good size and would be perfect, except for the fact, that the styrofoam base had a large crack in it.  </li>
            <li>It is better to spend a little more on a higher quality one</li>
            <li>Which means, I have to stretch the mask over the head, put the chin in first, then stretch even more over to the back of the head, then adjust.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy another one from giell when I need it :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Order was prompt and exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect:</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I needed for the project.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>I love that it has no facial features, making it very neutral.  </li>
            <li>The head size is slightly larger than most and holds average sized wigs more snugly, making them much easier to style.</li>
            <li>It holds all of my wigs really well.</li>
            <li>Some of the styrofoam pellets are sticking out, but not so much that it would come off at the slightest brush.</li>
            <li>$10 was a bit much to pay for it, but this was the cheapest option because I had no need to buy this in bulk.</li>
            <li>it was straight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still very usable but just not for photos.</li>
            <li>but I was really diapointed when I recieved it because it had a whole bunch of dents all the way around..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mean really, it&#x27;s about as good as they get.</li>
            <li>One more thing, I know you can get a stand for this foam head which seemed a little excessive, but without one the head falls over very easily.</li>
            <li>It came with some dings and dents in it, and the only other item in the box was a T-shirt, so I am pretty sure they sent it that way.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use it for my pictures, so it was basically a waste of my money..</li>
            <li>I use it to make wigs but it would be fine for other things</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my new wig.</li>
            <li>I live in South Texas and my hats get soaked with sweat from the heat</li>
            <li>It will be useful for a long time.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s pretty hard to do with that mask, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the same size as listed and it is sturdy; exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is that it is very light, so if you have a heavier wig it will topple unless you tape it or hold it down.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a head with no features as pictured, and got a male face head!</li>
            <li>I use standard T-pins to hold wigs or newly knit hats in place.</li>
            <li>only complaint was that I wish it was packaged better.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a gas mask, this is really the best way to go, I mean there are no facial features to mess up, and less rough edges to break as you apply a mask onto it.</li>
            <li>It is the same size and shape of the standard adult head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I needed in being relatively cheap and is roughly the same size as an average human head.</li>
            <li>Well, actually, it would be the right item, but ironically, they don&#x27;t put any packing materials in with it, so by the time it gets to you, it&#x27;s already seen a few dents.  </li>
            <li>, I can use it for another purpose with my crocheted hats as the head circumference is much closer to an average adult head than other foam heads with facial features.</li>

            <li> I bought to dry my Baseball caps on (have 4 that I use regularly) after washing to keep their form.  </li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on other styrofoam heads I decided on this one because of the circumference.  </li>
            <li> , my only gripe is it&#x27;s a bit delicate, even for styrofoam, but still sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> just what I expected it would be.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about this.</li>
            <li> However, it does get the job done and might be cheaper than other foam heads</li>
            <li> so I can order these apart from other hair care supplies.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it to hold a batman mask, but it was entirely too small.  </li>
            <li> No creepy face to weird you out.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Since its male my wig fit horribly on it since male heads are made narrower</li>
            <li> an average styrofoam head.</li>
            <li> I needed to tie it down tho.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the strap sliding down, but even that wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> Covered in little holes and pieces missing from every inch of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It had a few cashes in the foam.</li>
            <li> Instead it was covered with dents and dings and looked a mess!</li>
            <li> The others with faces would have been too small and this seemed closer to my head size.</li>
            <li> The packaging appeared to be too small to hold the head.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they sent me one with the facial features anyway.  </li>
            <li> Very firm styrofoam.</li>
            <li> 2 stars because, well at least they sent it?  </li>
            <li> I paid 6ish dollars in shipping and it had a few dents on it because it was poorly packaged and shipped in an envelope.</li>
            <li> The head is slightly slanted, thus making it difficult to use to cut wigs.</li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit creepy, but it works well</li>
            <li> I think it would be difficult to get a pristine head for display work.</li>
            <li> Wanted something without features - as what is advertised - got some horrible alien looking head.</li>
            <li> Cheap...small...pretty bad.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I pulled it out and was immediately disgusted by the way it looks.</li>

            <li> Product itself  was fine but it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered</li>
            <li> Very firm styrofoam. It holds all of my wigs really well. The only issue is that it is very light, so if you have a heavier wig it will topple unless you tape it or hold it down. Might be better if a weight was put into the bottom? Otherwise, it serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li> Great price . In great condition!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my new wig. When it arrived, I pulled it out and was immediately disgusted by the way it looks. The one in the pic is shiny and smooth. The one I received looks like a kid had been playing with it. Covered in little holes and pieces missing from every inch of it. I could get a styrofoam block and carve a smoother surface than this. However, it does get the job done and might be cheaper than other foam heads (this was the first one I found on a quick Amazon search with a smooth face and good reviews). It was packed in a box full of styrofoam S&#x27;s, which might have been what hurt it but might have protected it during shipping, who knows. If in a bind I would order this again. One more thing, I know you can get a stand for this foam head which seemed a little excessive, but without one the head falls over very easily.</li>
            <li> It showed up in a cardboard box. The head measures about 30 cm tall. It has no face. Some of the styrofoam pellets are sticking out, but not so much that it would come off at the slightest brush. It is best to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price but it picks up a lot of dirt and cannot be cleaned.</li>
            <li> It is being used for making decorative beaded headbands.  It will be useful for a long time.  The product came in good shape and is as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a head... It holds hair, it&#x27;s made of Styrofoam.. It served its purpose.</li>
            <li> I knit, crochet and otherwise make a lot of hats, mostly Juliet type close fitting caps. This head form is perfect for blocking hats that are made to fit to the head. It is exactly what I wanted, great size and shape. I had been looking at a milliner&#x27;s form which was hundreds of dollars....but this is just what I needed for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Is not what is advertised. Wanted something without features - as what is advertised - got some horrible alien looking head.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a head with no features as pictured, and got a male face head! Since its male my wig fit horribly on it since male heads are made narrower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of wig stands over the years.  Most of the ones with pretty faces displayed at salons, have necks held at an angle that just aren&#x27;t good for storage and styling of your own wig in your own home.  The folding stands are adequate for travel, but I just tip my toiletry bag on end and store my wig overnight on that.  These stands are perfectly sized for average women&#x27;s wigs, falls, 3/4&#x27;s.  If your wig is extra length, you can place the stand on the corner of your dresser. They&#x27;d work well at this price to store a hat collection.  If you need to make this stand more stable, it is easy to fill the hole in the bottom with a mix of Plaster of Paris available at any hardware store.  There is a formal table clip, but I never found it suited my home use - it was more for professionals.  I use standard T-pins to hold wigs or newly knit hats in place. [[ASIN:B004NH2Y6Y T-Pins for pinning wigs on foam head]]  I&#x27;m glad to have found this source at Amazon so I can order these apart from other hair care supplies.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a hat/wig stand I KNOW, but most foam heads are able to hold masks and whatnot. Which is why I bought two, one for my Israeli Gas mask, and one for my Russian gas mask. The Israeli mask fit on this head like a charm, since it&#x27;s a strap on mask, so you just loosen the mask, put it on the head, and tighten, but my Russian mask is a bit more challenging, since it&#x27;s a \\&quot;Hood type\\&quot; mask. Which means, I have to stretch the mask over the head, put the chin in first, then stretch even more over to the back of the head, then adjust. needless to say, It&#x27;s pretty hard to do with that mask, but it&#x27;s fine. The head holds the mask pretty well, and they look nice with eachother. The only complaint is that when I take the mask on and off the head, some small styrofoam bits come out and get into the respiratory system of both masks, an easy fix, just blow into the mask and you&#x27;re all set. If your looking for a gas mask, this is really the best way to go, I mean there are no facial features to mess up, and less rough edges to break as you apply a mask onto it. So this thing is great, my only gripe is it&#x27;s a bit delicate, even for styrofoam, but still sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> Its effecitve, somewhat light weight. But it takes the job done. I use it to hold a wig. its great</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the purpose of making wigs.  After reading several reviews on other styrofoam heads I decided on this one because of the circumference.  The others with faces would have been too small and this seemed closer to my head size. Packaged well.  I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I bought this to take proper pictures of my crochet hats I will be selling, and this is a great display head, nice and round, stands nicely. it arrived quickly and was packaged perfectly :) I will definitely buy another one from giell when I need it :)</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping and I especially liked the fact that this stand provides a better fit for wigs than any other I&#x27;ve bought. The head size is slightly larger than most and holds average sized wigs more snugly, making them much easier to style.</li>
            <li> So I deciced my hubby need a stand to put his baseball caps on. It sits in entry way and a beautifu chest with the mannequim wig head. Every one walks and takes a look at the caps on the wigg head and has a laugh.</li>
            <li> yea there is a ding in the back but I&#x27;m using it to take pictures of my knits so who is going to see it? I like having no face because honestly faces on things freak me out. Plus, when I do a knit for a guy I don&#x27;t have to worry about placing it on girl face.</li>
            <li> I bought to dry my Baseball caps on (have 4 that I use regularly) after washing to keep their form.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Great for forming my hats after washing them and spraying them down with spray starch. I live in South Texas and my hats get soaked with sweat from the heat so they get washed all the time. My wife bought me this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to retire my favorite hats.</li>
            <li> I ordered this form as it is featureless and appears to be smooth in the photo. Instead it was covered with dents and dings and looked a mess! I still need a nice featureless form but now I am worried about ordering online. I would never send a customer an item in this condition!</li>
            <li> The wig head is a good size and would be perfect, except for the fact, that the styrofoam base had a large crack in it.  The packaging appeared to be too small to hold the head.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive stand for a wig that I bought. This does it&#x27;s job. I am very satisfied with my product.</li>
            <li> It arrived in good condition, and its what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a hole in the bottom to put it on a dowel for display.</li>
            <li> Good size. Very light weight. I use mine to build costumes with. I needed to tie it down tho.</li>
            <li> Arrived with very good condition: no dents or marks of any kind, but the head has a face instead of the no face head in the picture. It&#x27;s a bit creepy, but it works well and i don&#x27;t need it for exhibition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a display head.  It stays balanced and upright despite its light weight.  $10 was a bit much to pay for it, but this was the cheapest option because I had no need to buy this in bulk.</li>
            <li> The head circumference was listed as being the same size as my head circumference. I am a knitter and this will help me to size the hats I make for myself and to block hats when I make them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the same size as listed and it is sturdy; exactly what I wanted.  I had a good time putting my reading glasses on it; really dressed it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fancy, but it will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it to hold a batman mask, but it was entirely too small.  I think it is just for wigs...</li>
            <li> It was a good product. Very useful for me. only complaint was that I wish it was packaged better.I paid 6ish dollars in shipping and it had a few dents on it because it was poorly packaged and shipped in an envelope. Overall my product is great though!</li>
            <li> Cheap...small...pretty bad. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It is better to spend a little more on a higher quality one</li>
            <li> This mannequin head was perfect for displaying a mask I wore to a Brazilian carnaval. The mask had a lot of feathers and I thought this head would not be able to support it, but it did. It is a life size head and I think my mask would have been better if there were features on it, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work that&#x27;s why I went with a featureless head. It was well packaged and it came with pins (to hold your item in place). They came in handy so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the strap sliding down, but even that wasn&#x27;t an issue. I ordered the stand as well, and it turns out that I didn&#x27;t need it, but glad I bought it anyway. If I buy another mask, I will definitely purchase one of these again.</li>
            <li> I loom knit hats and scarves.  I bought this to display both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s items.  I love that it has no facial features, making it very neutral.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!  I didn&#x27;t want the kind that has human features...too spooky!  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Order was prompt and exactly as ordered. The product is going to be the centerpiece of my collection of Styrofoam Wig Heads.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect: an average styrofoam head. It&#x27;s what I needed in being relatively cheap and is roughly the same size as an average human head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was straight.  The head is slightly slanted, thus making it difficult to use to cut wigs.</li>
            <li> Suits my purposes for cosplay wig styling perfectly -- and it shipped with some T-pins to secure the wig. Score.</li>
            <li> This item is the perfect size for hat displays and hat blocking.  I was also hoping to use it for some photos of my knitted good but the styrofoam was dented and had scuff marks all over it.  It&#x27;s still very usable but just not for photos.</li>
            <li> its nice Styrofoam wig head very nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this item so that I could model some of the hats that I make. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I placed this order for the feature-less head to block knit hats because the heads with the features gives me the heebie jeebies.  Unfortunately, they sent me one with the facial features anyway.  2 stars because, well at least they sent it?  Now I have a head in my closet *shudder*.  Still debating on sucking it up and using it or throwing it out.</li>
            <li> just what I expected it would be.  no complaints.  it&#x27;s exactly what I needed for the project. it&#x27;s so styrophoamey</li>
            <li> It had a few cashes in the foam. But ok.</li>
            <li> definatly does the job i needed it to do. not a bad deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to recieve this item since I would use it to display my crochet hats and headband..mostly to take pictures of my items for my online shop..but I was really diapointed when I recieved it because it had a whole bunch of dents all the way around..I won&#x27;t be able to use it for my pictures, so it was basically a waste of my money..id it wasn&#x27;t for the dents I would have loved it!..</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve not lived until you&#x27;ve put your wig on one of these foam mannequin heads. I&#x27;m mean really, it&#x27;s about as good as they get. No creepy face to weird you out.</li>
            <li> It came with some dings and dents in it, and the only other item in the box was a T-shirt, so I am pretty sure they sent it that way.  I needed it quickly for something so I couldn&#x27;t return it in time for a second one.  Other than that, I can use it for another purpose with my crocheted hats as the head circumference is much closer to an average adult head than other foam heads with facial features.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this. Its sturdy and gets the job done. Does exactly what I needed it to do. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig display specifically because it had no facial features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the one I got has facial features, go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is cheap Styrofoam, for something cheap you&#x27;d better not bang it up too much!</li>
            <li> Came on time and as shown! I use it to make wigs but it would be fine for other things I&#x27;m sure! Just regret not buying more so I could make more than one wig at a time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid styrofoam head. If you&#x27;re in the market for a foam head to hold wigs, hats, or virtual reality headgear, well you came to the right place.  However, if you were looking for something elegant to display hats, wigs, or virtual reality headgear, then this might not be the right item.  Well, actually, it would be the right item, but ironically, they don&#x27;t put any packing materials in with it, so by the time it gets to you, it&#x27;s already seen a few dents.  I think it would be difficult to get a pristine head for display work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this head to block my knitted hats. It is the same size and shape of the standard adult head. As a knitter I often make hats, as portable projects, and this head makes blocking them easy. It also gives me a good idea of how the hat will look when it is worn.</li>
            <li> Used this to help a client display some Theatre Costumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal, Quick Ship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted a child&#x27;s head as this is almost too large.&lt;br /&gt;But, it worked after all.</li>
