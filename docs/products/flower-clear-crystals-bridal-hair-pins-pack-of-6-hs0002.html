            <li> They are pretty, but I have broken several on first use.</li>
            <li> They have a very wide gap in them and the only possible way they might stay and is with an up do</li>
            <li> Unless you are looking for long hairpins, I would keep searching!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> They also do not have a pearl in the center.  </li>
            <li> I may use the, for something other than wedding hair though.</li>
            <li> Not worth trying</li>
            <li> and you put them in facing the ceiling down into your hair and hope that gravity holds them in!</li>
            <li> 3 came in with missing crystals, 1 came with pin unattached, cannot use!</li>
            <li> and they were ALL broken escept for one.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying that I waiting this long for something I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality...</li>
            <li> These are AWFUL and if I could I would give it a negative 5 rating!</li>
            <li> The worst part is because I thought they worked like bobby pins</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> But the worst part was that, the crystals came off from 3 of the 6 pins!!!</li>

            <li> These are super cute. Looks better than the picture. Arrived as expected. Great item.</li>
            <li> Great price. Terrific bling..</li>
            <li> Amazing. Beautiful. Built very well.</li>
            <li> These are AWFUL and if I could I would give it a negative 5 rating! They are beautiful to look at but if you try to use them in your hair they will not stay! They  do not work like regular bobby pins when you try to slide them in your hair! They have a very wide gap in them and the only possible way they might stay and is with an up do and you put them in facing the ceiling down into your hair and hope that gravity holds them in! If you want to hold them in your hand and look at something sparkly then they are great but if you expect them to actually hold in your hair you can forget about it! The worst part is because I thought they worked like bobby pins I ordered two packages so I got double the burn. DO NOT BUY unless you feel like wasting your money! You may as well just throw the money in the trash!</li>
            <li> Teeny tiny, but good enough.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!! These came and i was so excited for them and i opened them and they were ALL broken escept for one. I put that one in my hair and it immediatley broke. If you are even considering buying these, dont!! I want a refund!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughters wedding.  She is going to wear them in her hair on her wedding day.  They are sparkly and attractive and she really liked them.  They are perfect for any type of up-do whether it be a formal affair like a wedding or a prom or just to add a little bit of sparkle to your hairdo.</li>
            <li> Beautiful...can&#x27;t wait to wear them on my wedding day</li>
            <li> These were nice looking but one of them had the gems already fall out and i haven&#x27;t even opened the package yet..</li>
            <li> There are beautiful, nice quality, I love them.</li>
            <li> Not as good of quality as I had hoped. Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I did not end up using these, because I went a different way with my hair. But they are pretty, and I&#x27;m sure would have looked nice. They would make a nice accessory for wedding, pageant, teenager for a dance, decent quality, nice sparkle, good price.</li>
            <li> Have met the expectation .</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SOO CUTE!!!! I LOVE THESE PINS THEY ARE JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!! I LOVE BLING BLING!!!!!  LOL!! IF YOU BUY THEM YOU WILL BE SOO HAPPY!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DARCELLE</li>
            <li> Very poor quality...the pins in the picture looks different from what I received... But the worst part was that, the crystals came off from 3 of the 6 pins!!! Not worth trying</li>
            <li> I received something completey different than pictured. Mine are long fork style pins and they don&#x27;t have that cute little pearl in the center.</li>
            <li> very pretty...great hair pins</li>
            <li> Beautiful addition to hairstyle.</li>
            <li> These pins are just beautiful!  I wear them all the time, even just to run errands!  They look adorable and slide into hair very easily and hold in place.</li>
            <li> The flower Pins are beautiful just what i expected.</li>
            <li> These arrived sooner then expected, and looked great in my bridesmaids hair</li>
            <li> the wires were wider apart and had to be pitched closer</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the seller of this item. they are very beautiful and the photo of the item didn&#x27;t do it justice. I would highly refer this item to all my friend that are looking for an item like these.</li>
            <li> My daughter wrote these for winter formal and they were beautiful. The picture doesn&#x27;t do them justice the are very shiny</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my wedding and they&#x27;re going to work out perfectly.  The metal pins are sturdy and the crystals are securely attached.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> In the picture it doesn&#x27;t really look like the stones are colored but when they arrived they were I wish it was more specified in the details</li>
            <li> Very cute and helps keep fly away hairs from my face. I loved them and ordered more, thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> Best purchase!  Wish I had gotten 2 of these.  they are perfect for holding up my hair and I get tons of compliments on them when I wear them.  Not just for a wedding anymore!</li>

            <li> Very pretty better than the picture...</li>
            <li> They are nice. They look just like the picture</li>
            <li> I received mine today, while they are pretty. they are NOT what I order and NOT what was in the listing.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the spiral pins not the straight pins. I noticed a week ago the listing was updated to straight pins since I was considering ordering more. I thought it changed maybe because they were out after I placed the order, but after receiving these It&#x27;s annoying that I waiting this long for something I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> I ordered the crystal with spiral attachment, not a long pin attachment to begin with. 3 came in with missing crystals, 1 came with pin unattached, cannot use!</li>
            <li> They are pretty, but I have broken several on first use.</li>
            <li> Really cute but some of the petals are bent and the center stone is a different color than the petal colors more of a purple green color. Other than that they are okay. I may use the, for something other than wedding hair though.</li>
            <li> Although the pins I received are pretty, I did not want long hairpins.  I was looking for the spiral pins shown in the picture.  They also do not have a pearl in the center.  Unless you are looking for long hairpins, I would keep searching!</li>
            <li> Put some glam in your hair stay put in hair unlike some pins that will continue to fall out I love these this in my second pack I will be buying more in different color</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it. The top part came off.</li>
