            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I just discovered this hairspray after trying many, many brands over the years.</li>
            <li>In the cooler weather, I love morrocan hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Love the hold, the smell and that you can work with it.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the cans are notoriously prone to clogging.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray BC</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil products have a definitive smell and this hairspray has more of an odor.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MAGIC.</li>
            <li>while I do love the hairspray...</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray was introduced to it through my salon, I love the smell, the feel and the hold, I have not used anything else since</li>

            <li>Amazing fragrance, I get compliments constantly saying I smell good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and leaves hair super shiny!</li>
            <li>This product does not have the usual wonderful smell or the hold of the hair spray I have come to love.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>An ultra fine mist that holds</li>
            <li>This hair spray is not gunky, isn&#x27;t too light or too strong.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricy but this hairspray is awesome.</li>
            <li>Over $20 for a can of hairspray is a huge indulgence, so I am quite grumpy.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this line of hairspray for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I give a light spray of this  each morning to control frizz and help hold shape.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it affords a light hold that isn&#x27;t at all sticky.  </li>
            <li>It is light but holds well.</li>
            <li>It is light yet holds well.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair in place without being stiff and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>This hairspray smells fantastic and it&#x27;s super light.  </li>
            <li>I need hairspray on an almost daily basis and this offers the perfect hold</li>
            <li>product is what expected and did everything that I wanted to do and no problems with shipping and just great with product</li>
            <li>Not realizing this, I gave it an initial good review for timely arrival.</li>
            <li>love the scent and the gentle</li>
            <li>super quick.</li>
            <li>Super hold without stickiness or stiffness.</li>
            <li>Dries fast so is workable &amp; easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>As for me, Way Too Much Money For This Product!!</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair that I blow out straight.</li>
            <li>I suspected that this wasn&#x27;t really a Moroccan oil product and this kinda confirmed it...</li>
            <li>but so far love it.</li>
            <li>People think I have perfume on and laugh when I tell them it is my hairspray.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that if you&#x27;re looking for a very strong hold this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I like this spray better than other light weight sprays that I have used.  </li>
            <li>It only gets better from here.</li>
            <li>When I use the strong hold, it&#x27;s just a little better.</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil sprays have that barely noticeable pleasant aroma characteristic of all its products.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER had a Moroccan Oil hairspray that didn&#x27;t clog pretty much after every use.</li>
            <li>Simply smells good and it gives you the shine you need while giving you a loose hold.</li>
            <li>She checked the codes &amp; numbers, &amp; says it is not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight yet holds very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight yet holds really well.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really hold up on windy days.</li>
            <li>Received item on time but, like another reviewer I am also questioning if this is in fact real Moroccanoil which I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice hold, but not too stiff.</li>
            <li>This hairspray has a great scent, I would prefer a bit of a lighter finish due to this making the texture of my hair a bit harder than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have good hold, and its super expensive, also my can came dented and looked like it might have been tampered with.</li>
            <li>Although I received the order on time, I am pretty confident this is not authentic Moroccan Oil hair spray.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just bought this from High Performance Parts and within one week, the air was gone from the hairspray</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is an authentic Moroccan Oil product.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not sticky and thick like most are.</li>
            <li>I like how light the hold is, without making my hair feel stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>In the humidity/summer, when I use the medium hold, it looks dry and doesn&#x27;t keep it straight.</li>
            <li>When I use freeze and shine by Paul Mitchell, it keeps my style straight without looking dry from hair spray.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle from a salon and the bottle that arrived (which is supposed to be the same) has different label and doesn&#x27;t look the same.</li>
            <li>It also adds a light shine but isn&#x27;t oily in the least.  </li>
            <li>Top was broken.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair clean and shiny and light--great doesn&#x27;t drag your hair down or feel greasy</li>

            <li> it leaves your hair clean and shiny and light--great doesn&#x27;t drag your hair down or feel greasy</li>
            <li> Really like how it holds without being so stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I curl in beachy waves.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> as I guess it had been around for a long time.</li>
            <li> Have not used it very long yet</li>
            <li> It also comes out blasting and does not seem to finish the hair as nicely as my previous product (which was the same Luminous Hairspray in Medium Finish).</li>
            <li> Not really dependable for up</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviews; I bought this for my daughter, since her salon no longer carries it.  </li>
            <li> It smells nothing like any other Morrocanoil Product I have ever had</li>
            <li> I got the impression these cans were kicked off the line due to flaws.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally a product whore- very unloyal and get bored super quick. I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for 4 years. I have long hair that I curl in beachy waves. This hair spray is not gunky, isn&#x27;t too light or too strong. Smells amazing! I often get told i smell like a beach, or asked what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s the best product (although I am not a fan of their oil or the shampoo or conditioner-save your money!)</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviews; I bought this for my daughter, since her salon no longer carries it.  She checked the codes &amp; numbers, &amp; says it is not the real thing.  Not realizing this, I gave it an initial good review for timely arrival. The packing slip got thrown out, so I can&#x27;t even return it.  Over $20 for a can of hairspray is a huge indulgence, so I am quite grumpy. Never again!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this line of hairspray for my curly hair. I give a light spray of this  each morning to control frizz and help hold shape. I like how light the hold is, without making my hair feel stiff or sticky. It smells very nice and leaves a nice shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this hairspray!! It&#x27;s so lightweight yet holds your hair in place. I like it because I can style my hair and spray and the next day I can brush through and have no residue. Will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray!!!  It&#x27;s cheaper to order from Amazon than buying in it in the salon...will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Good product. Lightweight yet holds very well.</li>
            <li> This product is great on my baby fine hair.  It&#x27;s lightweight yet holds really well.  Dries fast so is workable &amp; easy to comb through.  It also adds a light shine but isn&#x27;t oily in the least.  Lasts a long time so it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> love the scent and the gentle hold this hairspray provides</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or stiffness.</li>
            <li> I think I might be the only person that doesn&#x27;t like this hairspray. It doesn&#x27;t have good hold, and its super expensive, also my can came dented and looked like it might have been tampered with. I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Product is great on curly hair - will be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so yummy!  I&#x27;m always being told my hair smells great.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful.  It smells nothing like any other Morrocanoil Product I have ever had</li>
            <li> I was sold 4 rejects or knock -offs! The labels were glued on rather then painted. The valves leaked, clogged and were over all defective. I got the impression these cans were kicked off the line due to flaws. Never again! Total crap....very disappointed with amazon for selling knock-off merchandise</li>
            <li> I love it.  Mrs Leinonen</li>
            <li> I just discovered this hairspray after trying many, many brands over the years. I have very fine hair and need to use hairspray but I don&#x27;t want sticky or stiff &amp;#34;helmet-hair.&amp;#34;  This has a nice hold, but not too stiff. The nozzle does not clog. It has a beautiful fragrance. I hope they never stop making this stuff.</li>
            <li> Purchased from hair salon. I have fine curly hair that I blow out straight. In the humidity/summer, when I use the medium hold, it looks dry and doesn&#x27;t keep it straight. When I use the strong hold, it&#x27;s just a little better. When I use freeze and shine by Paul Mitchell, it keeps my style straight without looking dry from hair spray. In the cooler weather, I love morrocan hairspray. In the summer, Paul mitchell.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. It holds but is touchable. Doesn&#x27;t feel dirty the next day.  I do use a stronger spray on my bangs.</li>
            <li> Great product and super great customer service!</li>
            <li> Love the hold, the smell and that you can work with it. A bit pricey but it does all I want it to do, and makes hair luminate.</li>
            <li> nice light hold and fantastic smell!!</li>
            <li> 2nd purchase  works wee for me</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really hold up on windy days. Not really dependable for up do&#x27;s. Does have a nice scent. Can also style your hair with it because it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky. You can probably accomplish the same thing with something cheaper. I feel this hairspray is unreasonably expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Gift !! The person I got it for Loves It !!  As for me, Way Too Much Money For This Product!! Must be Gold in them their Cans !!  Oh well, It is what it is and to each his own !!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for years!  It is the best!  It&#x27;s not too strong and leaves hair super shiny!</li>
            <li> Love the product but the cans are notoriously prone to clogging. I have NEVER had a Moroccan Oil hairspray that didn&#x27;t clog pretty much after every use.</li>
            <li> I just bought this from High Performance Parts and within one week, the air was gone from the hairspray and I had an entire bottle of unusable hairspray.  I suspected that this wasn&#x27;t really a Moroccan oil product and this kinda confirmed it...as I guess it had been around for a long time.</li>
            <li> product is what expected and did everything that I wanted to do and no problems with shipping and just great with product</li>
            <li> Freat spray.  Keeps hair in place without being stiff and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Super hold without stickiness or stiffness.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the spray, very light.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like a million dollars.</li>
            <li> Great smell and it is perfect if you want a natural look</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. I like it.</li>
            <li> Really like how it holds without being so stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray BC it&#x27;s not sticky or heavy afterwards</li>
            <li> Have not used it very long yet but so far love it. If my review changes after extensive use will update.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this hairspray and the hold is great, not stiff!</li>
            <li> This hairspray has a great scent, I would prefer a bit of a lighter finish due to this making the texture of my hair a bit harder than I&#x27;d like. Cap came damaged.</li>
            <li> Love love this hairspray!! Hold my hair and is not sticky or stiff...</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is an authentic Moroccan Oil product.  The product I received has an off smell and does not have the same luminous quality as the last bottle I purchased from an authorized seller (my hairstylist).  Moroccan Oil products have a definitive smell and this hairspray has more of an odor.  It also comes out blasting and does not seem to finish the hair as nicely as my previous product (which was the same Luminous Hairspray in Medium Finish).</li>
            <li> Top was broken. Otherwise ok.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my friends were raving about how good it worked for them. I need hairspray on an almost daily basis and this offers the perfect hold but it&#x27;s not sticky and thick like most are.</li>
            <li> I like this spray better than other light weight sprays that I have used.  Wish it was unscented.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Moroccan oil. It only gets better from here. Everyone out their with or&lt;br /&gt;without hair, buy this stuff. It&#x27;s MAGIC.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray, it has a nice flexible hold and the scent is wonderful  I was disappointed with this order, because the scent was stale.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray that I have ever tried! It smells wonderful and provides great movement and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and stiff</li>
            <li> Great product.  It had good hold and washed out easily.  Does not build in in your hair.  The best thing is it doesn&#x27;t clog up the the nozzle. It is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> while I do love the hairspray...the sprayer part is not working..even after cleaning the nozzle, nothing comes out.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that if you&#x27;re looking for a very strong hold this isn&#x27;t for you. However, it&#x27;s the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. Best flexible hold, leaves a beautiful natural shine and smells amazing. Will def buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray was introduced to it through my salon, I love the smell, the feel and the hold, I have not used anything else since</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray! It&#x27;s got great hold, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or weighted down, and it smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Received item on time but, like another reviewer I am also questioning if this is in fact real Moroccanoil which I have used for years.  This product does not have the usual wonderful smell or the hold of the hair spray I have come to love.  I do not plan to order from this distributor again for these reasons.</li>
            <li> The best hair spray ever!</li>
            <li> It leaves a pretty hair shine, but the smell is awful. Pretty disappointed and won&#x27;t be buying again unless from a certified retailer.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.  Other products with hold tend to break my hair and this one doesn&#x27;t plus it provides a shine.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this hairspray. There is no chemical odor; just a very light pleasant fragrance. When my hair blows around in the wind, this hairspray lets my hair blow but also holds my hair&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> moroccan--any of their products, truly amazinG--it leaves your hair clean and shiny and light--great doesn&#x27;t drag your hair down or feel greasy</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance, I get compliments constantly saying I smell good.</li>
            <li> Nice light hold and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray. It holds and smells wonderful. People think I have perfume on and laugh when I tell them it is my hairspray.</li>
            <li> Simply smells good and it gives you the shine you need while giving you a loose hold. A bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray if, like me, you generally hate the smelly, nose &amp; lung clogging, aerosol hairsprays on the market.  Moroccanoil sprays have that barely noticeable pleasant aroma characteristic of all its products.  Additionally, it affords a light hold that isn&#x27;t at all sticky.  Love Moroccanoil products!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair smell great! The hold is nice too. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used...Love it!  It is light but holds well.</li>
            <li> Perfect spray! An ultra fine mist that holds but it is extremely flexible. Smells amazing too!!! The only hairspray I will ever use from now on</li>
            <li> Great smell and nice hold. Not super firm and not crispy at all.</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells fantastic and it&#x27;s super light.  Honestly - I don&#x27;t even have to wear perfume anymore because the hairspray is so aromatically glorious.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hairspray!  It is light yet holds well.  Makes my hair shine and I love the fragrance.  Didn&#x27;t give a five star rating because the spray nozzle broke and I couldn&#x27;t finish the end of the product :(</li>
            <li> Although I received the order on time, I am pretty confident this is not authentic Moroccan Oil hair spray. I bought my first bottle from a salon and the bottle that arrived (which is supposed to be the same) has different label and doesn&#x27;t look the same. Disappointed. Will buy from a salon in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  Product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it and the way it holds</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy but this hairspray is awesome. The smell is great too.&lt;br /&gt;I use to finish my hairstyle since kinda expensive</li>
