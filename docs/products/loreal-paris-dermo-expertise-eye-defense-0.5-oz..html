            <li>100% happy</li>
            <li>It is pleasant to use and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but just didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li>Gave it a fair chance and it ruined my face.</li>
            <li>This cream is good, but if you have a good over all face night and day cream you do not need it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-first ingredient is water, making this a good starter moisturizer for beginners&lt;</li>
            <li>Might be good for those who use makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product - helps skin around the eye area</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer &amp; does not interfere with makeup.</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer and does not irritate the eye.</li>
            <li>Also loved Wrinkle defense, which L&#x27;oreal, in their wisdom???</li>
            <li>Very Pleased</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite eye cream!</li>
            <li>and kind of goes on like lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have stumbled upon it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is a very light cream with a gel like consistency.  </li>
            <li>My makeup looks very smooth and not at all cakey.  </li>
            <li>I just Love this product and the results</li>
            <li>I have tried so many $$$$$$$$$$$ nothing works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>Also love the fact there is no scent to this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Loreal product.</li>
            <li>Skin looks and feels smoother and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say it reduces wrinkles but perhaps helps to keep more wrinkles from forming.  </li>
            <li>my favorite eye defense treatment.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and smell of this lotion also.  </li>
            <li>but since I keep buying it it most be doing something</li>
            <li>For many years, I was able to buy it at places like Walgreens, Target, etc., but then they just stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad to have found it here.  </li>
            <li>What do I love the most about it?  </li>
            <li>I love that about it too.  </li>
            <li>Another plus in my book.  :-)  </li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it since I haven&#x27;t found anything better to use at this price point.</li>
            <li>I have allergies and this seemed OK for my eye area.</li>
            <li>But, overall, my makeup looks very good over it.  </li>
            <li>Its too soon to notice any improvement, but I am happy that it does not irritate my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be too strong for the eye area.</li>
            <li>I feel after steady use the results will either get better or stay consistent, so I am happy regardless.</li>
            <li>I bought this to get rid of the crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>rid/fill in fine</li>
            <li>I use it under my concealer, under my eyes and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It was a fabulous eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I want my corrector, concealer and crease eyeshadow to look as smooth as they can.  </li>
            <li>I use it regularly, applying each morning and night, and it works great.</li>
            <li>it is light and creamy and sinks right in---the best ever!!</li>
            <li>I love it because I have very sensitive eyes and most products</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>This is my second purchase - liked it so much, I purchased 2 more!</li>
            <li>This does a good job, but I put it in 2nd place for backup or travel.  </li>
            <li>The area around my eyes feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it available and for keeping me young looking:)</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I tried numerous creams but this simple one is the best of all.</li>
            <li>Do not expect extraordinary results but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so light and creamy, absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of irritation to my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t done much for dark circles, (a good night&#x27;s sleep is WAY more helpful  </li>
            <li>it absolutely has minimized the fine lines around the corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, everything as expected, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>(smile)</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>I liked this when I first received it, but prefer the Genesis Serum that I ordered a day or two later because the price was lowered and I wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, light cream and you use so little that a 0.5 oz.</li>
            <li>the first week was good after that it went down hill</li>
            <li>more of an eye moisturizer than a dark circle and fine line remover.</li>
            <li>All in all, I say it works pretty well</li>
            <li>Too rich for the eyelid area-woke up with filmy eyes that took some time to clear.</li>
            <li>Getting past the burning, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I only bought one to try and to make sure it was the same as the original.  </li>
            <li>24 hours after my first application, and 14 hours since my last one, I still notice a significant reduction of my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Used this for a month and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>products are much too aggressive for the eye area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not sting or bother my eyes much if I accidentally get some in&lt;br /&gt;-affordable&lt;</li>
            <li>It feels gentle around my eyes - does not irritate them.  </li>
            <li>Really works, no burning, itching, see improvement almost immediately.</li>
            <li>This lotion really helps to take the puffy eye away.  </li>
            <li>I think this one is a real keeper.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to tell if the item is working or not,</li>
            <li>This product is not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still pleased to be able to use a moisturizer that is non irritating.</li>
            <li>Since I am not willing to pay hundreds of dollars on facial products to find THE wonder cream (which I rather doubt exits), this eye moisturizer does its job at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>much more liquidy than other jars i have used</li>
            <li>I also feel that having a good amount of sleep helps with the dark circles, along with water intake, reduce stress, and at least a semi healthy diet</li>
            <li>First time used over night and wow!</li>
            <li>considering I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations at all.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this it burned underneath my eyes and also left me with a cyst-like bump right under my eye.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a small dab to the finger that should spread nicely over your skin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it is my genetics or if this product is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but most people guess me for over 10 years younger than my actual age!  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to pull or stretch the delicate under eye skin while applying it because it&#x27;s so silky smooth and light, it will just absorb into your skin by dabbing it on.  </li>
            <li>and I am still using this product, now that I am older</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t have any warning about burnning or sensitivity!!</li>
            <li>product is lightly tinted pink.  </li>
            <li>where the crows feel would normally creep.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t really see much improvement in my sometimes-dark circles/bags or my &amp;#34;laugh&amp;#34; lines, it does definitely moisturize my undereye area.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes (a lot of eye lotions make my eyes burn and tear up) and</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting close to 50 and sport only very fine lines around the eyes and little to no darkness or bags under the eyes you tend to see around this age.  </li>
            <li>It adds much needed moisture around the eye, I really notice how dry my skin feels if I miss a day using it.  </li>
            <li>My eye area is incredibly sensitive to retinol.</li>
            <li>So far I like my results an</li>
            <li>but it really does last longer than you would think.  </li>
            <li>results nor as promised  Followed directions, saw no results so do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>removes the dark circles, feels extremely cool when applying, is not greasy, but moisturizes &amp; keeps those lines in control .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is white shimmer in this gel, which will reflect light making it seem like your dark circles are lighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of that, I moved onto L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other eye cream which I thought they must have replaced this original cream with, but obviously they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Goes on cool, makes tired eyes feel fresh and prevents wrinkles.</li>
            <li>In the future, though, I will lean towards purchasing the Genesis unless the price is too high for my pocketbook.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well for my dark circles as long as I&#x27;m consistent in using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth your $ if your looking for something to take away dark circles.</li>
            <li>Idk about instant results as I used mine for about a week and am really just starting to see a difference.</li>
            <li>Really helps to clear dark circles around the eyes, and take away the puffiness.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this eye cream for about 4 days, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dark circles have lightened considerably, so much so that my husband even pointed it out.</li>
            <li>Can really tell a difference in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Never had any rash or  irritations or my eyes crying out for the whole day with it!</li>
            <li>so I decided to stop using everything besides a plain, trusted moisturizer to see what the problem was exactly.</li>
            <li>But at 21 and suffering from bags, circles, and even some tired looking fine lines</li>

            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a small dab to the finger that should spread nicely over your skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it is my genetics or if this product is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but most people guess me for over 10 years younger than my actual age!  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to pull or stretch the delicate under eye skin while applying it because it&#x27;s so silky smooth and light, it will just absorb into your skin by dabbing it on.  </li>
            <li> and I am still using this product, now that I am older</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t have any warning about burnning or sensitivity!!</li>
            <li> product is lightly tinted pink.  </li>
            <li> where the crows feel would normally creep.  </li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t really see much improvement in my sometimes-dark circles/bags or my &amp;#34;laugh&amp;#34; lines, it does definitely moisturize my undereye area.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes (a lot of eye lotions make my eyes burn and tear up) and</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting close to 50 and sport only very fine lines around the eyes and little to no darkness or bags under the eyes you tend to see around this age.  </li>
            <li> It adds much needed moisture around the eye, I really notice how dry my skin feels if I miss a day using it.  </li>
            <li> My eye area is incredibly sensitive to retinol.</li>
            <li> So far I like my results an</li>
            <li> but it really does last longer than you would think.  </li>
            <li> results nor as promised  Followed directions, saw no results so do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> removes the dark circles, feels extremely cool when applying, is not greasy, but moisturizes &amp; keeps those lines in control .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is white shimmer in this gel, which will reflect light making it seem like your dark circles are lighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of that, I moved onto L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other eye cream which I thought they must have replaced this original cream with, but obviously they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Goes on cool, makes tired eyes feel fresh and prevents wrinkles.</li>
            <li> In the future, though, I will lean towards purchasing the Genesis unless the price is too high for my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well for my dark circles as long as I&#x27;m consistent in using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth your $ if your looking for something to take away dark circles.</li>
            <li> Idk about instant results as I used mine for about a week and am really just starting to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Really helps to clear dark circles around the eyes, and take away the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this eye cream for about 4 days, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dark circles have lightened considerably, so much so that my husband even pointed it out.</li>
            <li> Can really tell a difference in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Never had any rash or  irritations or my eyes crying out for the whole day with it!</li>
            <li> so I decided to stop using everything besides a plain, trusted moisturizer to see what the problem was exactly.</li>
            <li> But at 21 and suffering from bags, circles, and even some tired looking fine lines</li>
            <li> Just thought I&#x27;d pass the info on for those who are looking through the endless sea of eye products because it&#x27;s so hard to choose and such an important thing to have.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have normal, slightly oily lids.</li>
            <li> The only one to be used if you are truly sensitive to any other creams and eye make up.</li>
            <li> it is very moisturizing and helps diminish dark circles and puffiness, as well those unwanted wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> Also, this seems like it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> (Using my husbands amazon) I bought this at my local Walgreens with not much to go on as far as opinions and experience and was iffy.</li>
            <li> It has a faint smell in the jar, but nothing strong or overbearing and goes away once you put it on your eye.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having very sensitive skin/eyes, everything I have ever tried irritates my eyes, or is to heavy &amp; greasy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> No big change in dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Did reduce puffiness somewhat about an hour after application but did not last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> Used for a long time and this product meets my need.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> jar goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have used it as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> had better results from less expensive hand lotions containing Vitamins ACED.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have real problems with dark circles under my eyes - usually even a layer of makeup doesn&#x27;t cover it for long.  </li>
            <li> But it definitely helped my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find it and the prices asked are usually crazy but Amazon had this cheap option (yes it is cheap here believe me)</li>
            <li> , I believe, in the U.S. Don&#x27;t know if this available internationally, but it&#x27;s now impossible to buy it here.</li>
            <li> Within two days of using Eye Defense alone without anything other than my usual moisturizer the cyst was back in the same spot underneath my eye.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, they are still there a little, but it has only been a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny little jar and doesn&#x27;t look like a lot</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for about three months with absolutely no improvement whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> The cyst gradually went down in a few weeks, and 3 months or so later I decided to give it another shot.</li>
            <li> After I wash my face, my eyes feel dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> I was using some other cream on my face at the time</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t buy any other eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I have really dark circles, mostly due to genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have not experienced this with any other eye product I have used.</li>
            <li> Cleared up dark spots within two months.</li>
            <li> not get rid of dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have bought products that claim to reduce wrinkles and dark areas under the eyes but none ever had.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it has in it, but it does diminish bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I buy into the claims that any of the eye creams say about reducing dark circles or lines, but I do notice that the area around my eyes is softer.</li>
            <li> Never have dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> also helps with the lightening of dark circles</li>
            <li> My dark circles weren&#x27;t noticeable.</li>
            <li> I use it for dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> hydrates around the eye area (so less wrinkles), decreases puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a slight shine/glitter look that does not appear on the face after application.</li>
            <li> My intent to buy this eye cream was to get rid of my black circles.</li>
            <li> less wrinkles in a few days.</li>
            <li> When it dries a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months now and this just moisturizes.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> :s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5+ years</li>
            <li> I was in my late 20&#x27;s when a person in a salon turned me on to this-</li>
            <li> skin has not reacted negatively to this product&lt;</li>
            <li> but that having at least some of these can help with the effect.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but thought i&#x27;d see something subtle.</li>
            <li> I have bought expensive products in the past and this seems to work as well if not better.</li>
            <li> Go to the drugstore and the least expensive eye cream will serve you just as well.</li>
            <li> My excitement changed to disappointment when the word &amp;#34;liposomes&amp;#34; did not appear on the packaging.  </li>
            <li> It works well; I won&#x27;t say that it is a disappointment as I have used it before</li>
            <li> I was desperate.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something after my eyes started reacting badly to the Olay Regenerist products, and I came across something about how retinol might irritate skin.  </li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes area really bad</li>
            <li> My eyes burned so bad had to wash it off!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite eye cream!</li>
            <li> Cleared up dark spots within two months.</li>
            <li> much more liquidy than other jars i have used</li>
            <li> Used this for a month and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but thought i&#x27;d see something subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and years.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I&#x27;m getting close to 50 and sport only very fine lines around the eyes and little to no darkness or bags under the eyes you tend to see around this age.  I was in my late 20&#x27;s when a person in a salon turned me on to this- I credit the years of using this product to that.  It moisturizes without pulling- meaning how the wrinkle fighting creams pull.  I apply this under my eye, over the eyelid and to the outsides of my eye over to my hairline- where the crows feel would normally creep.  Just thought I&#x27;d pass the info on for those who are looking through the endless sea of eye products because it&#x27;s so hard to choose and such an important thing to have.</li>
            <li> I just Love this product and the results it produces!!...it is very moisturizing and helps diminish dark circles and puffiness, as well those unwanted wrinkles!!...I have been using it for years both in the a.m and p.m and would be lost without it!...I would recommend this eye cream for all ages!!...Thank you for making it available and for keeping me young looking:)</li>
            <li> When I first tried this it burned underneath my eyes and also left me with a cyst-like bump right under my eye. I was using some other cream on my face at the time so I decided to stop using everything besides a plain, trusted moisturizer to see what the problem was exactly. The cyst gradually went down in a few weeks, and 3 months or so later I decided to give it another shot. Within two days of using Eye Defense alone without anything other than my usual moisturizer the cyst was back in the same spot underneath my eye.    This product seems to be too strong for the eye area. I do not have sensitive skin and have not experienced this with any other eye product I have used. Gave it a fair chance and it ruined my face. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer below me..&lt;br /&gt;I have used nothing else but this product for over 15 yrs. I have tried so many $$$$$$$$$$$ nothing works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Some products are much too aggressive for the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Having very sensitive skin/eyes, everything I have ever tried irritates my eyes, or is to heavy &amp; greasy.&lt;br /&gt;This removes the dark circles, feels extremely cool when applying, is not greasy, but moisturizes &amp; keeps those lines in control .&lt;br /&gt;I use it morning &amp; night, can be put in fridge also for hour or (2) before if your eyes are puffy, works wonderfully for that !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect, I hope it never gets discontinued I would be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Used for a long time and this product meets my need.</li>
            <li> I Love It!!! I have used it forever-it is light and creamy and sinks right in---the best ever!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to get rid of the crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve used this now for about three months with absolutely no improvement whatsoever.  It is pleasant to use and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but just didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> This cream did not do the job I have been using it for 2 months the first week was good after that it went down hill and it caused some skin irritation underneath my eyes so that is not supposed to happen.Not buying it anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years -- don&#x27;t know if it is my genetics or if this product is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but most people guess me for over 10 years younger than my actual age!  Also love the fact there is no scent to this.</li>
            <li> This cream is good, but if you have a good over all face night and day cream you do not need it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Loreal product. Goes on cool, makes tired eyes feel fresh and prevents wrinkles. Great product to use under make-up.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something after my eyes started reacting badly to the Olay Regenerist products, and I came across something about how retinol might irritate skin.  I saw this product and decided to try it because it doesn&#x27;t use retinol.  Wow!  While it hasn&#x27;t done much for dark circles, (a good night&#x27;s sleep is WAY more helpful  it absolutely has minimized the fine lines around the corners of my eyes.  Skin looks and feels smoother and more hydrated.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this eye cream for about 4 days, but so far I like it. Its too soon to notice any improvement, but I am happy that it does not irritate my sensitive eye area. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months now and this just moisturizes. For reference, I have normal, slightly oily lids. My eye area is incredibly sensitive to retinol. I have really dark circles, mostly due to genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-my skin has not reacted negatively to this product&lt;br /&gt;-first ingredient is water, making this a good starter moisturizer for beginners&lt;br /&gt;-does not sting or bother my eyes much if I accidentally get some in&lt;br /&gt;-affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-does not get rid of dark circles. There is white shimmer in this gel, which will reflect light making it seem like your dark circles are lighter.&lt;br /&gt;-does not get rid/fill in fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;-dries tacky. I&#x27;ve varied the amount I put on and there&#x27;s still a tacky residue through out the day. Might be good for those who use makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, I would definitely recommend this product to those just starting out with eye creams. Also, this seems like it will last me a long time. I do use this twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a while.  It feels gentle around my eyes - does not irritate them.  I cannot say it reduces wrinkles but perhaps helps to keep more wrinkles from forming.  I have bought products that claim to reduce wrinkles and dark areas under the eyes but none ever had.  Since I am not willing to pay hundreds of dollars on facial products to find THE wonder cream (which I rather doubt exits), this eye moisturizer does its job at a fair price.  I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it burns when I put it under my eyes. It stays red for a bit and then goes away. Getting past the burning, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> more of an eye moisturizer than a dark circle and fine line remover. :s</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes area really bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it has in it, but it does diminish bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes (a lot of eye lotions make my eyes burn and tear up) and the Loreal Eye Defense lotion is great! I use it morning and night and I have no irritation. It has a cooling effect and makes my eyes feel refreshed! Makeup goes on great over it and stays in place. I don&#x27;t know if I buy into the claims that any of the eye creams say about reducing dark circles or lines, but I do notice that the area around my eyes is softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5+ years and I won&#x27;t buy any other eye cream.  It has caffeine in it so whether it&#x27;s a placebo effect or not, I feel like it wakes my eyes up a bit every time I use it.  And it&#x27;s not too heavy. Just perfect.</li>
            <li> Really works, no burning, itching, see improvement almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Using this product for over 20 years.  Never have dark circles under my eyes.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> my favorite eye defense treatment.</li>
            <li> didnt see a lot of results.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product religiously for over 5 years. Nothing beats it for under eye treatment</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was advertised as being formulated with liposomes.  I used a Nivea eye cream years ago with liposomes.  It was a fabulous eye cream.  I was beginning to get wrinkles on my upper fold and it smoothed them out.  This product was discontinued.  I subsequently used Rachel Perry&#x27;s vitamin A &amp; E eye cream.  Rachel Perry passed away and her line was discontinued.  I&#x27;ve used a variety of eye creams since then.  I was excited to try this.  My excitement changed to disappointment when the word &amp;#34;liposomes&amp;#34; did not appear on the packaging.  The packaging advertised hyaluronic acid instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is lightly tinted pink.  It is a very light cream with a gel like consistency.  It dries quickly.  There is no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 59 yo.  I have wrinkles.  I am beginning to get the hooded eye.  I want my corrector, concealer and crease eyeshadow to look as smooth as they can.  I also want my make up to stay and not slide or fill in my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not diminish the appearance of wrinkles and it does nothing for my hooded eye.  But, overall, my makeup looks very good over it.  My makeup looks very smooth and not at all cakey.  So, I gave it 4 stars.  I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time. I use it under my concealer, under my eyes and it works just fine. When it dries a little I put my concealer on then. Works great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis Eye Serum.  This is a nice, light cream and you use so little that a 0.5 oz. jar goes a long way.  I liked this when I first received it, but prefer the Genesis Serum that I ordered a day or two later because the price was lowered and I wanted to try it.  This does a good job, but I put it in 2nd place for backup or travel.  It works well; I won&#x27;t say that it is a disappointment as I have used it before and that was why I purchased it again.  In the future, though, I will lean towards purchasing the Genesis unless the price is too high for my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> The best that I&#x27;ve found for under makeup.  Everything else I&#x27;ve tried seems to leave a film that later peels my makeup up with it.  Seems to work pretty well for my dark circles as long as I&#x27;m consistent in using it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years.</li>
            <li> (Using my husbands amazon) I bought this at my local Walgreens with not much to go on as far as opinions and experience and was iffy. But at 21 and suffering from bags, circles, and even some tired looking fine lines I was desperate. It has a faint smell in the jar, but nothing strong or overbearing and goes away once you put it on your eye.  Also, it has a slight shine/glitter look that does not appear on the face after application. There is no residue or anything like that and kind of goes on like lotion. You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a small dab to the finger that should spread nicely over your skin. Idk about instant results as I used mine for about a week and am really just starting to see a difference. Primarily that tired look has gone away along with the sleepy wrinkle. My dark circles have lightened considerably, so much so that my husband even pointed it out. I feel after steady use the results will either get better or stay consistent, so I am happy regardless. The area around my eyes feels nice and soft. I also feel that having a good amount of sleep helps with the dark circles, along with water intake, reduce stress, and at least a semi healthy diet also helps with the lightening of dark circles so I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miracle cream but that having at least some of these can help with the effect. So far I like my results an</li>
            <li> Shipped and received on time.  Great product for under eyes.  Very Pleased</li>
            <li> Best under eye cream ever!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years!!</li>
            <li> For some reason I started waking up with puffy eye bags.  This lotion really helps to take the puffy eye away.  I love the feel and smell of this lotion also.  I think this one is a real keeper.</li>
            <li> Good product - helps skin around the eye area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a week morning and night and can say that it works for its intended purpose that I got it for. Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, they are still there a little, but it has only been a week. All in all, I say it works pretty well considering I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations at all. I&#x27;ll wait and see if it holds up over time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles around my eyes yet so I can&#x27;t speak for that part, but maybe it&#x27;ll help keep them away.</li>
            <li> I guess it works.  I don&#x27;t really know how to tell if the item is working or not, but since I keep buying it it most be doing something (smile)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth your $ if your looking for something to take away dark circles. It is a good moisturizer &amp; does not interfere with makeup. Indent have puffy eyes so I can&#x27;t say if it helps with that.</li>
            <li> I adore this eye cream.  For many years, I was able to buy it at places like Walgreens, Target, etc., but then they just stopped carrying it.  Everywhere.  Because of that, I moved onto L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other eye cream which I thought they must have replaced this original cream with, but obviously they didn&#x27;t.  It was never the same as this Eye Defense cream.  Anyway...I&#x27;m thrilled to have stumbled upon it here on Amazon.  I only bought one to try and to make sure it was the same as the original.  It is and I&#x27;ll be ordering it again and again.  Why they don&#x27;t carry this in stores is beyond me.  I&#x27;m just glad to have found it here.  What do I love the most about it?  It&#x27;s just so light and creamy, absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of irritation to my sensitive eyes.  You don&#x27;t have to pull or stretch the delicate under eye skin while applying it because it&#x27;s so silky smooth and light, it will just absorb into your skin by dabbing it on.  I love that about it too.  A little goes a long, long way.  Another plus in my book.  :-)  It&#x27;s a tiny little jar and doesn&#x27;t look like a lot but it really does last longer than you would think.  To me, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer and does not irritate the eye.</li>
            <li> Great quality, everything as expected, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last four years. It is a great moisturizer for the eye. It is not going to turn back time but it helps your makeup go on smoother.</li>
            <li> To those of us who suffer from allergic puffiness, this cream was meant for you! I have used it as long as I can remember and I still love it.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this was that it burned a bit and stung my eyes. That might be a problem for everyone though. But it definitely helped my dark circles. I put it on morning and night so my eyes were moisturized.</li>
            <li> Really helps to clear dark circles around the eyes, and take away the puffiness. I use it regularly, applying each morning and night, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  Although I don&#x27;t really see much improvement in my sometimes-dark circles/bags or my &amp;#34;laugh&amp;#34; lines, it does definitely moisturize my undereye area.  After I wash my face, my eyes feel dry and tight.  I apply Eye Defense, and it immediately makes the skin under my eyes feel softer.  I apply it before putting on makeup, and also after washing my face at the end of the day.  I would recommend it since I haven&#x27;t found anything better to use at this price point.</li>
            <li> No big change in dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Did reduce puffiness somewhat about an hour after application but did not last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Ive had better results from less expensive hand lotions containing Vitamins ACED.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend considering the cost.</li>
            <li> I tried numerous creams but this simple one is the best of all. It is difficult to find it and the prices asked are usually crazy but Amazon had this cheap option (yes it is cheap here believe me) so I made my stock of it! Never had any rash or  irritations or my eyes crying out for the whole day with it! The only one to be used if you are truly sensitive to any other creams and eye make up. Do not expect extraordinary results but this cream does the job: hydrates around the eye area (so less wrinkles), decreases puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Also loved Wrinkle defense, which L&#x27;oreal, in their wisdom??? decided to discontinue, I believe, in the U.S. Don&#x27;t know if this available internationally, but it&#x27;s now impossible to buy it here.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ve used this product for 23 years.  I love it because I have very sensitive eyes and most products make my eyes burn after applying.  This product is not irritating at all.  It adds much needed moisture around the eye, I really notice how dry my skin feels if I miss a day using it.  I do have eye circles so I don&#x27;t think this will prevent that as it is a part of aging but I&#x27;m still pleased to be able to use a moisturizer that is non irritating.</li>
            <li> Throwing it away! My eyes burned so bad had to wash it off!! Granted I have sensitive skin, but it doesn&#x27;t have any warning about burnning or sensitivity!!</li>
            <li> results nor as promised  Followed directions, saw no results so do not waste your money. Go to the drugstore and the least expensive eye cream will serve you just as well.</li>
            <li> less wrinkles in a few days. 100% happy</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer for the price.  My skin stays dewey all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 24 hours, but I already notice a difference.  I have real problems with dark circles under my eyes - usually even a layer of makeup doesn&#x27;t cover it for long.  I&#x27;ve used this cream twice - once last night and once this morning.  24 hours after my first application, and 14 hours since my last one, I still notice a significant reduction of my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> This product is getting more difficult to find in store now.  Getting it online is convenient.  No issue at all.  Same product at from store.</li>
            <li> Can really tell a difference in the dark circles under my eyes. I have bought expensive products in the past and this seems to work as well if not better.</li>
            <li> My intent to buy this eye cream was to get rid of my black circles. First time used over night and wow! My dark circles weren&#x27;t noticeable. 4yrs later and I am still using this product, now that I am older I use it for dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase - liked it so much, I purchased 2 more!</li>
            <li> Too rich for the eyelid area-woke up with filmy eyes that took some time to clear.</li>
            <li> It helps to remove the bags under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and this seemed OK for my eye area.</li>
    </ol>
