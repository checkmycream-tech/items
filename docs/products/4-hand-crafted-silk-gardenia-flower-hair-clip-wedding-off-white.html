            <li>Got to share the love.</li>
            <li>:)  Maria Chisolm</li>
            <li>It was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>The shade variations in these flowers look so much more</li>
            <li>I love hair flowers and the gardenia is lovely in my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it looked much better.</li>
            <li>The gardenia looks real on my hair, I&#x27;ve got some good comments wearing this with my floral dress.</li>
            <li>Even though the item wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting it is still a nice hair accessory</li>
            <li>It looked fine to me</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to buy this item since I was unsure of how it would actually look or if it would be too large, but it turned out to be perfect (I hope).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t respond, and within 12 hours I got a phone call from a woman asking me to please remove the feedback, and they will be happy to take the item back and refund the money.  </li>
            <li>The customer service was fine in that it shipped quickly, but then---</li>
            <li>Lovely gardenia looks like the real deal!  </li>
            <li>But I just got it the other day and was so happy.  </li>
            <li>The flower is nothing wonderful, it is flat and doesn&#x27;t have a very big clip for putting it in your hair.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that it is HUGE!</li>
            <li>&quot; it looks more yellow.  </li>
            <li>It is beautiful and larger than expected.  </li>
            <li>It fell apart first time I used it</li>
            <li>This flower is SO pretty.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wear it on the side of my head but it looked funny.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was funny that advertised for a wedding.</li>
            <li>It was flat, not as many petals as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t limit yourself to buying them for your wedding - they look amazing with a black cocktail dress and pearls.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother trying to return it, thinking maybe it would be too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>It is very tropical looking and real looking.</li>
            <li>People asked if it were real.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>They look very natural, and are exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be waiting for the other clip I ordered to arrive - hopefully, it&#x27;ll be better than this one.</li>
            <li>The flower is okay but is not exactly as it is pictured.</li>
            <li>I have try the flower clip recently and it was not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>The flower was a little bit smooshed when it arrived in the mail, so I have to make sure that I can get it back to its original shape.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer included a note about the frayed edges being part of realistic look instead of having a \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>For not being a real flower, it certainly looks close enough, and will stand out in our pictures.</li>
            <li>To add some extra punch ; )</li>
            <li>So soft and feminine and adds a lot of charm to your summer wardrobe</li>
            <li>Natural looking and felling clip.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are on the off-white side with a tiny hint of yellow, which makes them look REAL -</li>
            <li>It is darker and not as white as the pictures show, and even though they clearly stat it is \\&quot;off white\\</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it it fell apart with a half an hour</li>
            <li>Threw it out next time ill make my own.</li>
            <li>The fabric on the end of the petals was a little shredded and although the clip holds well, it just isn&#x27;t as pretty as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>it looks full, open and polished, yet the product I received was very flat and squished (I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to have a hard time getting it to lay correctly)</li>

            <li> It arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> like, when you clip it right behind you ear.</li>
            <li> Senior girls in our hometown wear white, and she wanted just a little extra something.</li>
            <li> I gave the company a 3 out of 5 review because I didn&#x27;t particularly like the flower, and they emailed me offering me half of the price back if I would remove my negative feedback.  </li>
            <li> When I received my shipment, the flower was not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste my money shipping it back</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll keep it for a few summer outfits, but I definitely won&#x27;t be using this for my wedding!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not shown in the photo, but when it arrives, the edges are frayed and unfinished with threads looking like roughly cut fabric.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because I feel like I probably could have made a flower clip that has much better quality than this one.</li>
            <li> , it holds it&#x27;s shape even if you lie down on it for a little bit.</li>
            <li> I feel as if the pictures are a little misleading -</li>
            <li> and it also looks a little shoddy/cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I like the curve and the softness that makes the flower look different from the other artificial one.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t appreciate this company who will not leave me alone for giving them a bad rating.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my head is just too small.</li>
            <li> if you see the stark white artificial flowers sold in craft stores, you can see that they look incredibly fake.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two of these gardenia hair flowers because I wanted a dramatic feminine look inspired by Billie Holiday.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing quality.</li>
            <li> The seller saw this review and sent me an email asking to describe why I was unhappy so they could improve and also offered a refund.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast deliverey and its very beautiful, it goes very well with the Jeweled Gardinia flower that is recommended!!! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> When I received my shipment, the flower was not at all what I expected. It was flat, not as many petals as shown in the picture. I didn&#x27;t bother trying to return it, thinking maybe it would be too much of a hassle. I went to a local Beauty Supply store and bought a flower for my hair and paid only $1 for it, that&#x27;s the one I ended up using...the one I purchased here is still in the box.</li>
            <li> I ordered this flower clip (and another I found on Amazon) at the same time, thinking I&#x27;d use them both for my beach wedding. While it shipped pretty fast, I was pretty disappointed with this purchase. I feel as if the pictures are a little misleading - it looks full, open and polished, yet the product I received was very flat and squished (I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to have a hard time getting it to lay correctly) and it also looks a little shoddy/cheaply made. I&#x27;m disappointed because I feel like I probably could have made a flower clip that has much better quality than this one. I&#x27;ll be waiting for the other clip I ordered to arrive - hopefully, it&#x27;ll be better than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this clip as a gift, from my wish list. I just wish that my friends would have got a hint and got it for me much earlier, for my wedding day. I would have sure incorporated it in my wedding attire. But I still like it. It is so feminine, virgin like, when you clip it right behind you ear. Good quality too, it holds it&#x27;s shape even if you lie down on it for a little bit.</li>
            <li> (Please see update at the end as well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flower looks beautiful in the pictures... but it wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d hoped for.  It is darker and not as white as the pictures show, and even though they clearly stat it is \\&quot;off white\\&quot; it looks more yellow.  The fabric on the end of the petals was a little shredded and although the clip holds well, it just isn&#x27;t as pretty as I thought it would be.  I don&#x27;t want to waste my money shipping it back so I&#x27;ll keep it for a few summer outfits, but I definitely won&#x27;t be using this for my wedding!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE: Also, I do not appreciate the company badgering my review with their comments.  If someone doesn&#x27;t like your product, just deal with it.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my gardenia flower hair clip. It is very tropical looking and real looking. People asked if it were real. I will multi-task it and wear it in a lapel as well, maybe even let it float in water at a dinner table. Got to share the love. :)  Maria Chisolm</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and larger than expected.  It arrived earlier than expected.  I get alot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Yea... so the curve of the crocodile clip actually bends against the curve of your skull instead of snugging it. Not gonna work.</li>
            <li> The flower is nothing wonderful, it is flat and doesn&#x27;t have a very big clip for putting it in your hair.  The customer service was fine in that it shipped quickly, but then--- I gave the company a 3 out of 5 review because I didn&#x27;t particularly like the flower, and they emailed me offering me half of the price back if I would remove my negative feedback.  I didn&#x27;t respond, and within 12 hours I got a phone call from a woman asking me to please remove the feedback, and they will be happy to take the item back and refund the money.  I really don&#x27;t appreciate this company who will not leave me alone for giving them a bad rating.  Don&#x27;t dare to unlike any of their products, or they won&#x27;t leave you alone!</li>
            <li> Not shown in the photo, but when it arrives, the edges are frayed and unfinished with threads looking like roughly cut fabric. The manufacturer included a note about the frayed edges being part of realistic look instead of having a \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; look. I&#x27;ll post pics soon. Disappointing quality.</li>
            <li> It fell apart first time I used it</li>
            <li> Very life like, and beautiful</li>
            <li> I used this hair clip for my wedding day and bridal portraits.  It was fantastic!  I purchased several flower hair clips to try on and this by far was the best.  I was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these gardenia hair flowers because I wanted a dramatic feminine look inspired by Billie Holiday.  These hair flowers are SO gorgeous!  They look very natural, and are exactly as pictured.  Yes, they are on the off-white side with a tiny hint of yellow, which makes them look REAL - if you see the stark white artificial flowers sold in craft stores, you can see that they look incredibly fake.  The shade variations in these flowers look so much more authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore these flowers and will get a ton of use out of them!  Don&#x27;t limit yourself to buying them for your wedding - they look amazing with a black cocktail dress and pearls.</li>
            <li> This was a prom purchase. Senior girls in our hometown wear white, and she wanted just a little extra something. The flower is as seen. The material is sturdy, and even the hairdresser was impressed. I would definitely not hesitate to buy this again. My daughter asked me to save it for her weding day!</li>
            <li> I love hair flowers and the gardenia is lovely in my hair.  So soft and feminine and adds a lot of charm to your summer wardrobe</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. Will be perfect for my wedding day</li>
            <li> I have try the flower clip recently and it was not bad at all.  The gardenia looks real on my hair, I&#x27;ve got some good comments wearing this with my floral dress. I like the curve and the softness that makes the flower look different from the other artificial one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my hair on my wedding day.  I got nervous after reading the reviews!  But I just got it the other day and was so happy.  It looked fine to me lol Mine looks like the picture.  I did have to mold it a bit since it&#x27;s been in the package.  I am satisfied that it will look awesome in my hair.  I think I&#x27;m going to get another though.  To add some extra punch ; )</li>
            <li> Natural looking and felling clip. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Lovely gardenia looks like the real deal!  Clip makes it very easy to hold in hair.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to buy this item since I was unsure of how it would actually look or if it would be too large, but it turned out to be perfect (I hope). My wedding is coming up, and I think it will make the perfect addition to my anticipated updo. The flower was a little bit smooshed when it arrived in the mail, so I have to make sure that I can get it back to its original shape. I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 for that reason. If so, I think that it will look wonderful with my dress! For not being a real flower, it certainly looks close enough, and will stand out in our pictures.</li>
            <li> This flower is SO pretty. I loked the way it looked. Only problem is that it is HUGE! I wanted to wear it on the side of my head but it looked funny. I moved it to that back of my hair when i wore it up and it looked much better. Maybe my head is just too small.</li>
            <li> The flower is okay but is not exactly as it is pictured. Looks kind of cheap and is more like a rose than a gardenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**  The seller saw this review and sent me an email asking to describe why I was unhappy so they could improve and also offered a refund.  Even though the item wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting it is still a nice hair accessory so I will keep it.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it it fell apart with a half an hour and I thought it was funny that advertised for a wedding. Threw it out next time ill make my own.</li>
            <li> I used it for my wedding, it made me shine.</li>
