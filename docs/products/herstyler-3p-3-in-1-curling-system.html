            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>love my herstyler!</li>
            <li>If I could upload a picture it would be a better review!</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>I gave this to one of my daughters for Christmas and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>It is ok for the price, but the quality isn&#x27;t as good as my original/authentic one.</li>
            <li>The curls were nice</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to have some sort of guide book as to all things it can do.</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The attachments are very easy to swap out.</li>
            <li>This curling system is very good, heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It stays hot and makes beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>Besides the amazing low price, the size of each wand is perfect.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls beautifully.</li>
            <li>I saw a YouTube video with this and was amazing and how easy it looked to use so</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron it is the best,I love how it comes with three sizes.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the glove, it makes using the product easier and keeps you from getting burned.</li>
            <li>but I got better at it</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li>The curl curl with the widest connector is also more of a &amp;#34;beach hair curl&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Rather than buy just one replacement barrel, it wasn&#x27;t much more to purchase the set.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to wear a glove.</li>
            <li>One of the most satisfying purchases.</li>
            <li>I could not be happier with the lovely curls it provides.</li>
            <li>The fact that it comes with three different wands sizes so you can choose the tightness of your curls is just wonderful!</li>
            <li>Totally love this.</li>
            <li>the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li>and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love how it comes with 3 attachment sizes.</li>
            <li>I love my wands...</li>
            <li>I like it better than a curling iron, but thats just my opinion. :)</li>
            <li>I love this curler.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it includes 3 different size curlers with one product.</li>
            <li>love the interchangeable head on the curler</li>
            <li>I recommend saving your money and buying a better quality one</li>
            <li>Get the heat mitt too, it allows you to curl quicker and hold things into place without worrying about your fingers :)</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>The two smaller barrels work wonderfully on my hair, but the largest one for some reason doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Amazing the curl pattern is flawless and it heats up and cools down</li>
            <li>First off when I opened the box it looked good until I saw the dent</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Love how my curls stay on all day easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, my curls are beautiful like never before and with 3 different sizes I just feel like a 3D princess!!!</li>
            <li>Good product, holds the curl really well.</li>
            <li>The tubes change out easily and once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>this is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And Very Quick.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and must say its quite nice.</li>
            <li>me, even with shorter hair, this curler did style my hair fine.</li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and no problems at all!</li>
            <li>Overall the wand has been great</li>
            <li>It is an overall great product.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice and so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that works really well on different hair types.</li>
            <li>This product works ok, but I highly doubt it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many things in my daughters hair and nothing would curl it and last, this was so awesome, easy and curls lasted till the next day?</li>
            <li>This curler works really well, and I was beyond happy that I got a brand new one for $60 rather than the retail price of $300.</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>Love them so much!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>so when I got it in the mail I was excited to use it</li>
            <li>The price is great, it is fun having the three different sizes, and it warms up</li>
            <li>it makes soft curls and just looks amazing.</li>
            <li>it works great and the three different attachments make it so much easier to do my hair!</li>
            <li>Its so easy to use and so fast!</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is, Amazon gave me a very fast refund so she could go out and replace it!</li>
            <li>it heats up quick</li>
            <li>warning it does get very hot.</li>
            <li>This curling wand gets very hot</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s very hot and is inter changeable.</li>
            <li>Does tge 200 degrees seem hot enough to make good curls</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like using it because I like to be able to feel how hot my hair is getting.</li>
            <li>Love the product (hopefully it lasts long unlike some of the reviewers that say theirs go out in a year) but didn&#x27;t love the process.</li>
            <li>, I then slept on it and woke the next day with a beautiful soft beach curl / wave.</li>
            <li>I love it my hair actually stays curled all day and it so fast and very easy to switch out</li>
            <li>its okay.. could be better, I think it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.. takes forever to wand my hair..</li>
            <li>Yes shipping was fast but what difference does that make when the curling wand doesn&#x27;t even work!!</li>
            <li>I recently just cut hair (shoulder length) and the small size is able to curl my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to switch out the different sizes yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but once you got it, you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>The unit shipped to me (from Golden Skin Care) has a three position sliding switch (off/low/high) and an LED power indicator.  </li>
            <li>to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li>I got what I expected and I really loved the product.</li>
            <li>Totally great and easy to use on short or long hair.</li>
            <li>She curled her own hair and then two of my other daughters with different sized rods and everyone loved the result.</li>
            <li>I ordered it right</li>
            <li>I only leave the wand on for about 3 seconds and get beautiful curls that last.  </li>
            <li>that will make my hair look amazing and not take so long.</li>
            <li>The various attachments are key to creating great curls.</li>
            <li>They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li>The iron gets hot very fast.</li>
            <li>Shipment was REALLY FAST!  </li>
            <li>The curls come out so pretty</li>
            <li>The first day I tried it</li>
            <li>Next time I use it I am going to add more hair spray before and after the curling.</li>
            <li>they do get hot</li>
            <li>but it got so hot that the ends would always bend with the clamp.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you using that at first until you get the hang of how to use it.</li>
            <li>and I love the different sizes the wand comes in.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>The other sizes are better for longer hair, but when I put in my clip in extensions, I&#x27;ll be using those too!</li>
            <li>She said it gets hot and creates a curl/wave that stays.</li>
            <li>Works on really straight Asian hair. :)</li>
            <li>so I would recommend wearing a long sleeve top when you are first using it</li>
            <li>I do not understand the mostly positive reviews for this curling system.  </li>
            <li>I was able to curl my hair in like 20 minutes and my hair is long.</li>
            <li>my hair dosnt hold curls very well</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and it curls very well.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anybody looking into a wand.</li>
            <li>I looked like I was ready for an 80s prom...</li>
            <li>The iron works very well, curls hold.</li>
            <li>The herstyler heats up so fast and it has your hair curled in no time.</li>
            <li>These barrels don&#x27;t work with my real Herstyler, they don&#x27;t heat up at all.  </li>
            <li>It created a very unnatural effect.</li>
            <li>and it takes no time whatsoever to do my whole head</li>
            <li>, the glove really helps too.</li>
            <li>I have had this for a bit to give a real review</li>
            <li>I have really long, fine hair that never holds a curl.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine semi wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wand especially since it has 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li>It works really well so far!</li>
            <li>only thing that I must say is that I did find this curler was very, very hot, hence my 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>&quot; and they gave me a FREE upgrade, from a plain black iron to a stylish leopard print one!</li>
            <li>I used this maybe 5 times it doesn&#x27;t curl very well at all just super soft waves and doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest using the glove, it gets so hot!</li>
            <li>I should have read all the bad reviews instead of just the good ones!!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and leaves hair soft and controlled.</li>
            <li>I used to really have a love/hate relationship with my old curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have a healthy head of super straight hair, I have struggled for years to try and curl it with curlers, hot tongs, straightener all which have seen it drop into barely a wave in mere moments.</li>
            <li>I was told a new one had been sent out</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new curler because mine broke and found this on here</li>
            <li>The 3p herstyler  3in1 is fabulous, am currently in Africa, and I have no issues with power or current.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine, strait hair that is even hard to curl with hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Just please be very careful at first because it does get really hot.</li>
            <li>The largest rod is plenty large enough to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t use it that frequently.</li>
            <li>Same as the ones in the mall but costs much less!I have used this on me and my daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old herstyler wand</li>
            <li>It was a Birthday gift for my14 year old Granddaughter</li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>It was to much of a hassle to send back</li>
            <li>It gets very hot though so be careful!</li>
            <li>I usually use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat setting because my hair curls fairly easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***My opinion is this: It works as advertised, yet it does get on the hot side, be careful when using this not to burn your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was exactly what I expected and arrived before it was scheduled.</li>
            <li>The cord is stiff and you have to wiggle it just right to keep it from falling off the counter.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> love my herstyler!</li>
            <li> If I could upload a picture it would be a better review!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> I gave this to one of my daughters for Christmas and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> It is ok for the price, but the quality isn&#x27;t as good as my original/authentic one.</li>
            <li> The curls were nice</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to have some sort of guide book as to all things it can do.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The attachments are very easy to swap out.</li>
            <li> This curling system is very good, heats up fast.</li>
            <li> It stays hot and makes beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Besides the amazing low price, the size of each wand is perfect.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls beautifully.</li>
            <li> I saw a YouTube video with this and was amazing and how easy it looked to use so</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron it is the best,I love how it comes with three sizes.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the glove, it makes using the product easier and keeps you from getting burned.</li>
            <li> but I got better at it</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> The curl curl with the widest connector is also more of a &amp;#34;beach hair curl&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Rather than buy just one replacement barrel, it wasn&#x27;t much more to purchase the set.  </li>
            <li> so be sure to wear a glove.</li>
            <li> One of the most satisfying purchases.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with the lovely curls it provides.</li>
            <li> The fact that it comes with three different wands sizes so you can choose the tightness of your curls is just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Totally love this.</li>
            <li> the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li> and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love how it comes with 3 attachment sizes.</li>
            <li> I love my wands...</li>
            <li> I like it better than a curling iron, but thats just my opinion. :)</li>
            <li> I love this curler.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it includes 3 different size curlers with one product.</li>
            <li> love the interchangeable head on the curler</li>
            <li> I recommend saving your money and buying a better quality one</li>
            <li> Get the heat mitt too, it allows you to curl quicker and hold things into place without worrying about your fingers :)</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> The two smaller barrels work wonderfully on my hair, but the largest one for some reason doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing the curl pattern is flawless and it heats up and cools down</li>
            <li> First off when I opened the box it looked good until I saw the dent</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Love how my curls stay on all day easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> I just love it, my curls are beautiful like never before and with 3 different sizes I just feel like a 3D princess!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, holds the curl really well.</li>
            <li> The tubes change out easily and once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> this is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> And Very Quick.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and must say its quite nice.</li>
            <li> me, even with shorter hair, this curler did style my hair fine.</li>
            <li> Super cute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and no problems at all!</li>
            <li> Overall the wand has been great</li>
            <li> It is an overall great product.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that works really well on different hair types.</li>
            <li> This product works ok, but I highly doubt it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many things in my daughters hair and nothing would curl it and last, this was so awesome, easy and curls lasted till the next day?</li>
            <li> This curler works really well, and I was beyond happy that I got a brand new one for $60 rather than the retail price of $300.</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> Love them so much!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> so when I got it in the mail I was excited to use it</li>
            <li> The price is great, it is fun having the three different sizes, and it warms up</li>
            <li> it makes soft curls and just looks amazing.</li>
            <li> it works great and the three different attachments make it so much easier to do my hair!</li>
            <li> Its so easy to use and so fast!</li>
            <li> The only good thing about it is, Amazon gave me a very fast refund so she could go out and replace it!</li>
            <li> it heats up quick</li>
            <li> warning it does get very hot.</li>
            <li> This curling wand gets very hot</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s very hot and is inter changeable.</li>
            <li> Does tge 200 degrees seem hot enough to make good curls</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like using it because I like to be able to feel how hot my hair is getting.</li>
            <li> Love the product (hopefully it lasts long unlike some of the reviewers that say theirs go out in a year) but didn&#x27;t love the process.</li>
            <li> , I then slept on it and woke the next day with a beautiful soft beach curl / wave.</li>
            <li> I love it my hair actually stays curled all day and it so fast and very easy to switch out</li>
            <li> its okay.. could be better, I think it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.. takes forever to wand my hair..</li>
            <li> Yes shipping was fast but what difference does that make when the curling wand doesn&#x27;t even work!!</li>
            <li> I recently just cut hair (shoulder length) and the small size is able to curl my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to switch out the different sizes yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but once you got it, you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> The unit shipped to me (from Golden Skin Care) has a three position sliding switch (off/low/high) and an LED power indicator.  </li>
            <li> to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected and I really loved the product.</li>
            <li> Totally great and easy to use on short or long hair.</li>
            <li> She curled her own hair and then two of my other daughters with different sized rods and everyone loved the result.</li>
            <li> I ordered it right</li>
            <li> I only leave the wand on for about 3 seconds and get beautiful curls that last.  </li>
            <li> that will make my hair look amazing and not take so long.</li>
            <li> The various attachments are key to creating great curls.</li>
            <li> They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li> The iron gets hot very fast.</li>
            <li> Shipment was REALLY FAST!  </li>
            <li> The curls come out so pretty</li>
            <li> The first day I tried it</li>
            <li> Next time I use it I am going to add more hair spray before and after the curling.</li>
            <li> they do get hot</li>
            <li> but it got so hot that the ends would always bend with the clamp.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you using that at first until you get the hang of how to use it.</li>
            <li> and I love the different sizes the wand comes in.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> The other sizes are better for longer hair, but when I put in my clip in extensions, I&#x27;ll be using those too!</li>
            <li> She said it gets hot and creates a curl/wave that stays.</li>
            <li> Works on really straight Asian hair. :)</li>
            <li> so I would recommend wearing a long sleeve top when you are first using it</li>
            <li> I do not understand the mostly positive reviews for this curling system.  </li>
            <li> I was able to curl my hair in like 20 minutes and my hair is long.</li>
            <li> my hair dosnt hold curls very well</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and it curls very well.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anybody looking into a wand.</li>
            <li> I looked like I was ready for an 80s prom...</li>
            <li> The iron works very well, curls hold.</li>
            <li> The herstyler heats up so fast and it has your hair curled in no time.</li>
            <li> These barrels don&#x27;t work with my real Herstyler, they don&#x27;t heat up at all.  </li>
            <li> It created a very unnatural effect.</li>
            <li> and it takes no time whatsoever to do my whole head</li>
            <li> , the glove really helps too.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a bit to give a real review</li>
            <li> I have really long, fine hair that never holds a curl.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine semi wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wand especially since it has 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li> It works really well so far!</li>
            <li> only thing that I must say is that I did find this curler was very, very hot, hence my 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> &quot; and they gave me a FREE upgrade, from a plain black iron to a stylish leopard print one!</li>
            <li> I used this maybe 5 times it doesn&#x27;t curl very well at all just super soft waves and doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest using the glove, it gets so hot!</li>
            <li> I should have read all the bad reviews instead of just the good ones!!</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and leaves hair soft and controlled.</li>
            <li> I used to really have a love/hate relationship with my old curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have a healthy head of super straight hair, I have struggled for years to try and curl it with curlers, hot tongs, straightener all which have seen it drop into barely a wave in mere moments.</li>
            <li> I was told a new one had been sent out</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new curler because mine broke and found this on here</li>
            <li> The 3p herstyler  3in1 is fabulous, am currently in Africa, and I have no issues with power or current.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, strait hair that is even hard to curl with hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Just please be very careful at first because it does get really hot.</li>
            <li> The largest rod is plenty large enough to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t use it that frequently.</li>
            <li> Same as the ones in the mall but costs much less!I have used this on me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old herstyler wand</li>
            <li> It was a Birthday gift for my14 year old Granddaughter</li>
            <li> So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li> It was to much of a hassle to send back</li>
            <li> It gets very hot though so be careful!</li>
            <li> I usually use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat setting because my hair curls fairly easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***My opinion is this: It works as advertised, yet it does get on the hot side, be careful when using this not to burn your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was exactly what I expected and arrived before it was scheduled.</li>
            <li> The cord is stiff and you have to wiggle it just right to keep it from falling off the counter.  </li>
            <li> I have super long and thick hair</li>
            <li> Cord Is Long Enough To Use Anywhere.</li>
            <li> Wayy too long to get my actual package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a wand or curling iron for so long</li>
            <li> Arrived in a long can with no paperwork</li>
            <li> My hair curls stay in for soo long with this!</li>
            <li> The iron get hot enough to put curl in my heavy, thick, long hair!</li>
            <li> Nor Does It Dry Out My Hair.</li>
            <li> My friend does not live close by to show me</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and the description needs to be changed.</li>
            <li> So disappointing I was really excited to receive this item.</li>
            <li> But ive only used it a few times cuz i work a lot!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the other connectors yet</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that a glove was included, but I did not get one when i ordered.</li>
            <li> I tend not to put hairspray over the curls as it drags the hair down</li>
            <li> Whenever I use the curlers, I just can put it down, I always wanna experiment.</li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got stereotypical white girl hair which is pretty thin, though.</li>
            <li> two hundered dollars less than on the her styler website</li>
            <li> , the Curling System is pictured as having black barrels with a black handle.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> The curls are too tight for me.</li>
            <li> For 8+ Hours (With Little Help Of Hairspray).</li>
            <li> Few  Days Ago</li>
            <li> I recieved it from the seller \\&quot;Small</li>
            <li> I would reccommend to anyone who has tried and failed at using traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed at first when my package was a wrong item but yesterday came my actual curling iron.</li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in late February  and received it in the mail at the end of march.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for at least 3 years and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> Stoped working after a few days!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t heat up at all.</li>
            <li> You need to use glove otherwise ends will not curl and will look awkward.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> This company is CRAP!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does tge 200 degrees seem hot enough to make good curls ive only tried 400 degrees my hair dosnt hold curls very well so im leary to try lower heat</li>
            <li> Cheap made iron that dosent work!! Stoped working after a few days!!</li>
            <li> I love this so much! My hair curls stay in for soo long with this! I tend not to put hairspray over the curls as it drags the hair down which will make the curls disappear!! And by not using hairspray the curls still stay in! Love them so much!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in late February  and received it in the mail at the end of march. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t heat up at all. I was told a new one had been sent out and I still haven&#x27;t received it...</li>
            <li> This curler works really well, and I was beyond happy that I got a brand new one for $60 rather than the retail price of $300. My only concern is that it may go out soon as the Herstyler curler I had before stopped working after 2 years and I didn&#x27;t use it that frequently.</li>
            <li> I luv this curling iron set it heats up quick n the curl stays all day but the 1 I had stopped workin after a week I think mine was jus some type of malfunction I returned n got my money back they didnt offer n exchange</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my son&#x27;s girl friend. it makes soft curls and just looks amazing. warning it does get very hot. she burned her arm frist time using it. she used utube video to help with learning how to use without burning self.</li>
            <li> I ordered this curler on dec. 2nd and recieved it on dec 6th! Shipment was REALLY FAST!  As soon as I recieved it I opened it and tried it out! The curls are perfect and stay with out the need for hairspray! Takes some practice to get a hang of which way you want the curls/waves to go but once you do get the hang of it, it&#x27;s very easy!! And the price is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron it is the best,I love how it comes with three sizes. Its so easy to use and so fast! The curls come out so pretty, it is soo much better then a clamp curling iron! I 100% recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by this curling iron. I recieved it from the seller \\&quot;Small Bill\\&quot; and they gave me a FREE upgrade, from a plain black iron to a stylish leopard print one! I was thrilled when I opened the box. The iron gets hot very fast. The glove that comes with it protects your skin well. The attachments are very easy to swap out. The iron get hot enough to put curl in my heavy, thick, long hair! I would reccommend to anyone who has tried and failed at using traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> First off when I opened the box it looked good until I saw the dent then I wanted to try all of them out but the middle sized one wasn&#x27;t working. I emailed them and they told me they will send me a replacement but never did and they have not answered me since I would definitely not recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I have really long, fine hair that never holds a curl.  My curls stayed in all day after using the 3P.  The tubes change out easily and once you get the hang of it this is really easy to use.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  If you want awesome, Rock Star hair, this is the curling iron you want!</li>
            <li> Really good !  The thing that i dont like is that the biggest barrel doesn&#x27;t curl the hair like the smallest barrels does it gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Same as the ones in the mall but costs much less!I have used this on me and my daughter. Make sure you use the glove, it makes using the product easier and keeps you from getting burned.</li>
            <li> its okay.. could be better, I think it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.. takes forever to wand my hair.. I have to keep the hair on the curling iron for about 30-45 secs to geta  great curl. I rather spend the money now to get a hotter iron. I might sale my irons soon</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wand especially since it has 3 different sizes. It heats up really fast and it curls very well. I would absolutely recommend this to anybody looking into a wand.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, strait hair that is even hard to curl with hot rollers. This thing is amazing. The first day I tried it I looked like I was ready for an 80s prom...but I got better at it and I absolutely love it!!!! I would definitely suggest using the glove, it gets so hot!</li>
            <li> I brought these for my niece for Christmas. She just loves them.</li>
            <li> So disappointing I was really excited to receive this item. Yes shipping was fast but what difference does that make when the curling wand doesn&#x27;t even work!! only 1 out of the 3 barrels heat up... so no I deff do not recommend.</li>
            <li> the description describes a digital temp display so you can choose the heat you want. The one I got has only 2 settings and NO digital display. Not what I expected and the description needs to be changed. Very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> This model advertises as having a digital temperature display. It does not have one. It has a switch with 3 selectors- Off, 1, 2. That is all. The iron works very well, curls hold. I&#x27;m happy with this curler.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for at least 3 years and have never had a problem. It is the only thing that will curl my hair! I have recommended it to friends and they have loved it as well.</li>
            <li> It works really well so far! But ive only used it a few times cuz i work a lot! The only thing i dont like is that you still get burned through the glove.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old herstyler wand and I love it! It heats up fast and leaves hair soft and controlled. I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to switch out the different sizes yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be easy. Great product, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand. Love how my curls stay on all day easy to manage.  Really good price. Super cute.</li>
            <li> This Wand is LIFE!!! i absolutely love it !!! I&#x27;ve been looking for a wand or curling iron for so long that will make my hair look amazing and not take so long. The herstyler heats up so fast and it has your hair curled in no time. i DEFINITELY recommend to EVERYONE!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I like it. The price is great, it is fun having the three different sizes, and it warms up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that these curling irons are quicker at curling my hair than a traditional. The curl curl with the widest connector is also more of a &amp;#34;beach hair curl&amp;#34; which I like! I would recommend this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the other connectors yet but if I think of it I will come back and change my review after I do!</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product very well recommended if you want to make a gift to your wife!! she will love it!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things in my daughters hair and nothing would curl it and last, this was so awesome, easy and curls lasted till the next day?</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. She says it&#x27;s a lot quicker to curl her hair with this curler.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works on really straight Asian hair. :)</li>
            <li> I love it my hair actually stays curled all day and it so fast and very easy to switch out I don&#x27;t like using the glove that it came with cause you can still feel the heat</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist I use this curling iron daily! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I looooove this set i could NEVER get the curls with a regular curling wand... i dont have to use product because the curls last ALL DAY.. im truly amazed i got the set forsuch a good price.. will buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> This product works ok, but I highly doubt it&#x27;s authentic.  I have a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Herstyler but lost one of the barrels.  Rather than buy just one replacement barrel, it wasn&#x27;t much more to purchase the set.  These barrels don&#x27;t work with my real Herstyler, they don&#x27;t heat up at all.  The cord is stiff and you have to wiggle it just right to keep it from falling off the counter.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It is ok for the price, but the quality isn&#x27;t as good as my original/authentic one.</li>
            <li> Love it works great makes beautiful curls and it was two hundered dollars less than on the her styler website</li>
            <li> Best curling wand ever.  I only leave the wand on for about 3 seconds and get beautiful curls that last.  Great investment!!!</li>
            <li> Iron did not heat properly. I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and so far so good. The reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the curls do not last however it could be my hair type. I have long, fine semi wavy hair. Next time I use it I am going to add more hair spray before and after the curling.</li>
            <li> It was a Birthday gift for my14 year old Granddaughter she says it works great!</li>
            <li> Totally love this product!</li>
            <li> I Just Received This A Few  Days Ago And Im In Love.! Heats Up Really Good And Very Quick.Cord Is Long Enough To Use Anywhere. It Had My Curls Last For 8+ Hours (With Little Help Of Hairspray). Does Not Leave Hair Smelling Burned Nor Does It Dry Out My Hair. I Did A Lot Of Research Before Purchasing This Item And I Am Very Happy And Satisfied. Definitely Recommend This For All Girls.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! they do get hot so be sure to wear a glove. Mine actually came with one included.</li>
            <li> I used to really have a love/hate relationship with my old curling iron. The curls were nice but it got so hot that the ends would always bend with the clamp. It created a very unnatural effect. I saw a YouTube video with this and was amazing and how easy it looked to use so when I had money to spare, I bought it. One of the most satisfying purchases. I don&#x27;t know if it mentions it in the product detail, but this set does come with the heat resistant glove. I would recommend you using that at first until you get the hang of how to use it. There is somewhat of a trick to it but once you got it, you&#x27;re golden. Just please be very careful at first because it does get really hot. My coworkers, friends, and family have all complimented me on my hair since I started using this. Every girl should get this!</li>
            <li> This curling wand is amazing!  I read in other reviews that a glove was included, but I did not get one when i ordered. This curling wand gets very hot so I would recommend wearing a long sleeve top when you are first using it so you don&#x27;t burn yourself.  Overall the wand has been great and I love the different sizes the wand comes in.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is amazing! I could not be happier with the lovely curls it provides. The fact that it comes with three different wands sizes so you can choose the tightness of your curls is just wonderful! For the price and quality, this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> Purchased another set for someone else. Totally love this. You need to use glove otherwise ends will not curl and will look awkward.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that works really well on different hair types. Would definitely recommend! My daughters and I both use it!</li>
            <li> I do not understand the mostly positive reviews for this curling system.  Did I receive a different item than everyone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the key advertised features is supposed to be a Digital Temperature Display.  The unit shipped to me (from Golden Skin Care) has a three position sliding switch (off/low/high) and an LED power indicator.  There is no temperature display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Curling System is pictured as having black barrels with a black handle.  The unit sent to me has a zebra pattern on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, where are the instructions?  What about including a tips sheet for using the curler?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased this unit as a holiday gift for my mother-in-law.  What I thought I had purchased versus what I received is two very different things.  Very disappointing.  Not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of trying to return this curler.</li>
            <li> This curling system is on super sale and works great! The various attachments are key to creating great curls. I have super long and thick hair and this is literally the only iron that has ever worked to keep a curl in my hair. They even stay in until the next day. Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas, She opened it and it heated up and worked great........ Went back a couple hours later to actually do her hair and it would not heat up. Lights were on and everything. We tried switching iron parts still nothing. I should have read all the bad reviews instead of just the good ones!! The only good thing about it is, Amazon gave me a very fast refund so she could go out and replace it!</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> Amazing the curl pattern is flawless and it heats up and cools down it literally seconds. I&#x27;m going to purchase one for my beautician as well as my sister. Terrific product.</li>
            <li> I love this! I get so many compliments. It stays hot and makes beautiful curls. I love how it comes with 3 attachment sizes. The price I think is good too. It comes with a glove but I don&#x27;t really like using it because I like to be able to feel how hot my hair is getting.</li>
            <li> This curling system is very good, heats up fast. I have just below shoulder length hair and it takes no time whatsoever to do my whole head, the glove really helps too. I would recommend it to my friends !!!</li>
            <li> 3 different tube sizes. Works great. you can even control the temperature which is so important if you have thin color treated hair like me. It comes packaged in this great metal tube for ez shelving. You can put it in the corner of your bathroom under a table and get it out of the way. I&#x27;m wearing my curls now. They hold for days. A great buy and excellent product and the price is significantly cheaper than all the others for what you get.</li>
            <li> I wanted a 1&amp;1/2\\&quot; barrel and figured the 2 extra wands were a plus untill I recieved them and all wands were 1/2\\&quot; smaller than listed. I never tried them just sent them back so I don&#x27;t know how they work....IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 1&amp;1/2\\&quot; BARREL FOR BEACHY WAVES GO ELSEWHERE.</li>
            <li> I love my wands... They create the perfect curls/waves.</li>
            <li> The curling iron never heated up. It was to much of a hassle to send back so I just threw it away</li>
            <li> I just love it, my curls are beautiful like never before and with 3 different sizes I just feel like a 3D princess!!! ;)</li>
            <li> I love it! Heats up fast and curls beautifully. It achieves curls like a curling iron, except without the clamp. I like it better than a curling iron, but thats just my opinion. :)</li>
            <li> I love this curler. The best part is that it includes 3 different size curlers with one product. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Good product, holds the curl really well. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the versatility</li>
            <li> Was disappointed at first when my package was a wrong item but yesterday came my actual curling iron. I used it for the first time and must say its quite nice. I was able to curl my hair in like 20 minutes and my hair is long. Love the product (hopefully it lasts long unlike some of the reviewers that say theirs go out in a year) but didn&#x27;t love the process. Wayy too long to get my actual package.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> just what i needed, came on time just a descibed..product works great..love the interchangeable head on the curler..love my curls</li>
            <li> Great product! Heats up quickly and no problems at all! Only thing was, I had to get an adapter for the plug but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal.. Works like a gem!</li>
            <li> love my herstyler! it works great and the three different attachments make it so much easier to do my hair!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get too hot. i had to end up buying one from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I thought I would like it. I was looking for a new curler because mine broke and found this on here so when I got it in the mail I was excited to use it but it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair :(</li>
            <li> This hair curler set works to curl any length of hair short to long!&lt;br /&gt;For me, even with shorter hair, this curler did style my hair fine. Have longer hair? The largest rod is plenty large enough to curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I must say is that I did find this curler was very, very hot, hence my 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;As with all reviews, what is said by any reviewer (including myself) is only the opinion of that individual after a brief period in which they have used the product.&lt;br /&gt;***My opinion is this: It works as advertised, yet it does get on the hot side, be careful when using this not to burn your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Provided for review purposes]</li>
            <li> Great product. Get&#x27;s very hot and is inter changeable. Make&#x27;s very nice curl&#x27;s that stay in all day.</li>
            <li> The size in the ad shows that the largest barrel is 1 and 1/4 inch, however, it is only a 25mm barrel which is 1 inch. The curls are too tight for me. I wanted a larger barrel.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a bit to give a real review I used this maybe 5 times it doesn&#x27;t curl very well at all just super soft waves and doesn&#x27;t last at all I recommend saving your money and buying a better quality one</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have a healthy head of super straight hair, I have struggled for years to try and curl it with curlers, hot tongs, straightener all which have seen it drop into barely a wave in mere moments. I do prep and finish my hair with sprays.&lt;br /&gt;After looking on youtube how to curl my hair I saw a tutorial using this product, I was so impressed I ordered it right away.&lt;br /&gt;I curled my hair and it stayed all night, I then slept on it and woke the next day with a beautiful soft beach curl / wave. It was incredible. It heats up in a couple of moments. Get the heat mitt too, it allows you to curl quicker and hold things into place without worrying about your fingers :)</li>
            <li> I got what I expected and I really loved the product.</li>
            <li> The 3p herstyler  3in1 is fabulous, am currently in Africa, and I have no issues with power or current. Whenever I use the curlers, I just can put it down, I always wanna experiment.</li>
            <li> When I saw the Herstyler 3-in-1 I knew I had to buy! Besides the amazing low price, the size of each wand is perfect. I recently just cut hair (shoulder length) and the small size is able to curl my hair perfectly. The other sizes are better for longer hair, but when I put in my clip in extensions, I&#x27;ll be using those too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was exactly what I expected and arrived before it was scheduled. The price was also a great deal.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! The tips are great and allow for a variety of styles. It gets very hot though so be careful!</li>
            <li> Definitely gives you movie star wavy hair. Totally great and easy to use on short or long hair. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> It is an overall great product. The two smaller barrels work wonderfully on my hair, but the largest one for some reason doesn&#x27;t work as well. I don&#x27;t know if I need to turn it onto \\&quot;high\\&quot; heat or what. I usually use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat setting because my hair curls fairly easily. I&#x27;ve got stereotypical white girl hair which is pretty thin, though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the advise of a friend. She said it gets hot and creates a curl/wave that stays. I have long thick hair and yes it would if I could figure out how to use it. It came with NO directions. Only how to turn it off and on. That part was a no brainer. My friend does not live close by to show me so I am depending on the internet and practice. Would have been nice to have some sort of guide book as to all things it can do. Arrived in a long can with no paperwork whats so over.&lt;br /&gt; Hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I gave this to one of my daughters for Christmas and the results were amazing. She curled her own hair and then two of my other daughters with different sized rods and everyone loved the result. If I could upload a picture it would be a better review!</li>
