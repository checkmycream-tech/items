            <li>She says it&#x27;s the very best concealer product</li>
            <li>PERFECT for everything else.</li>
            <li>This concealer is awesome if you want to emphasize the lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy I can find it elsewhere for the time being!</li>
            <li>got the best deal on Amazon from this company</li>
            <li>This stuff covers just about anything that pops out on my face - perfectly!</li>
            <li>Superb product!</li>
            <li>It covers perfectly, it stays on all day, and I have never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li>works incredibly for my skin!</li>
            <li>I have very very fair skin &amp; the lightest shade (which i ordered &amp; received timely)</li>
            <li>i am very, very fair complected.  </li>
            <li>This concealer is good but not the best for coverage.  </li>
            <li>great price too</li>
            <li>Great for zits.  </li>
            <li>A friend also uses it and it works great for her.  </li>
            <li>Great with redness and blemishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gives excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>This has been the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and matches my skin-tone near perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a good concealer to brighten the shadows on either side of the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for hiding blemishes.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m somewhat fair skinned so its nice</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I love this concealer!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the coverage it gives.....and was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Over the four years, it has consistently worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li>I keep buying it because it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>A nice product if it does it for you.  </li>
            <li>I even use it under my browbone as a highlighter, and it conceals imperfections there perfectly, giving me a clean, smooth look.</li>
            <li>and it comes off your skin very easily.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Love this product works on all flaws received quickly &amp; amazing price</li>
            <li>I love this product because it feels like wearing nothing, covers perfectly, blends amazingly well to your natural skin</li>
            <li>Being a very fine powder, it doesn&#x27;t cake at all.  </li>
            <li>She has a very light skin tone, and believe it or not, is one teenager who isn&#x27;t into punting globs of makeup all over her face.</li>
            <li>so I do not recommend if you want a bright perfect coverage and also if you have very dark circles.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the concealer because I use the mineral powder foundation</li>
            <li>/&gt;there are better products to use as a concealer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if stores just got rid of this stuff, or if L&#x27;Oreal stopped making it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere but Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many in all price ranges.</li>
            <li>I love this and wish I could find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer...</li>
            <li>I buy this for my grand daughter.</li>
            <li>Just wish there were more product but that would negate the size.</li>
            <li>luckily most of it is smeared off by the time the sun comes up.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love love love this concealer</li>
            <li>Was uncertain a powder could even cover like concealer, but you have to try to believe, once you do, you&#x27;ll be back for more!!!!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s cheaper..and better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, i can never find it in the store anymore</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so satisfied with any makeup product before.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand how this powder works better than liquid, but it does.</li>
            <li>This concealer has great coverage, a small size to take along in the purse, and a great brush.  </li>
            <li>Much better price than the drugstore, for the same great product.</li>
            <li>I could never find one that blended easily and didn&#x27;t get stuck in fine lines until I found this product.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is so fine that it&#x27;s easy to brush on evenly.  </li>
            <li>stores ran out, now have this, great- covers nicely without being heavy, and does not seem to clog pores, why do they want me to type more words?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get this fine make up</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and often find concealers not very concealing</li>
            <li>It is fantastic, and I hope Loreal will change their mind....</li>
            <li>I bought a smaller brush and it works great.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older do not like powder products of any kind.  </li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone, and provides full coverage.</li>
            <li>:)  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, easy purchasing options.</li>
            <li>Can dry out your skin but good for being a powder.</li>
            <li>This product is the closest to my skin color I have ever found (I am incredibly pale), covers nicely and has pretty amazing staying power.</li>
            <li>Liked this when I was younger.</li>
            <li>Works good but the foundation really could serve the same purpose.  </li>
            <li>am so disappointed they discontinued it, so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped quickly and my product arrived sealed and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>otherwise it does not look right with mix matched face.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the small price because it works great</li>
            <li>The size of a tiny trial size sample that you can easily get at the mall for free.</li>
            <li>and it surprisingly doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much.</li>
            <li>However, it is great for small blemishes.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick delivery......</li>
            <li>Makeup is easy to use, and looks really natural.</li>
            <li>It blends easily and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Use also for any other imperfections, give it more than stars available.</li>
            <li>I love this, I have purchased over 8 bottles of this over the years and now especially since Loreal has discontinued making it.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon it, initially, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be grabbing more soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks ya&#x27;ll!</li>
            <li>and it at least covers enough to make me happy!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be ordering more as long as they&#x27;re still offering it here.</li>
            <li>I first bought this concealer in stores in 2010 not knowing much about makeup but wanting to try it.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal products are usually quite good</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a powder, it is much easier to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>I still really like it</li>
            <li>Fantastic, non cakey cover up that totally blends with makeup to match.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage to under-eye circles, and looks a bit powdery when used in that area.</li>
            <li>Really like the whole line.</li>
            <li>it is my backup concealer that i use more often than expected.</li>
            <li>It covers very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well and comes in a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the expensive BM brand, I&#x27;ve used Physicians Formula, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>Item was brand new and exactly as described, it arrived fast.</li>
            <li>it covers and stays on way better than any other concealer i have ever bought.</li>
            <li>This concealer has done a better job of covering that than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I particularly like it under the eyes because it doesn&#x27;t get into wrinkles</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from Covergirl to the high end brands at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read the reviews and did have high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Only useful with powder foundation.</li>
            <li>A FEW MORE DAYS BEFORE I CAN FILE A CLAIM.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>My daughter loves that this is easy to apply and covers her dark under eye area.  </li>
            <li>I even think it might help clear my zits by drying them?  </li>
            <li>It made my eyes look so old.</li>
            <li>on my skin, it also brighten and glows skin like problem solver, its safe for sensitive and delicate type skin, thank you Loreal</li>
            <li>Plus, the price was always really good for how long that it lasted (now that it seems to be discontinued the prices have spiked and are a little harder to justify).</li>
            <li>It is not a lot of major coverage</li>
            <li>The closest thing to this is Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>However, when I got the new one, the little brush wouldn&#x27;t stay in the lid, so I switched it out with my old one.</li>

            <li> This concealer has done a better job of covering that than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I particularly like it under the eyes because it doesn&#x27;t get into wrinkles</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Covergirl to the high end brands at Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews and did have high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Only useful with powder foundation.</li>
            <li> A FEW MORE DAYS BEFORE I CAN FILE A CLAIM.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> My daughter loves that this is easy to apply and covers her dark under eye area.  </li>
            <li> I even think it might help clear my zits by drying them?  </li>
            <li> It made my eyes look so old.</li>
            <li> on my skin, it also brighten and glows skin like problem solver, its safe for sensitive and delicate type skin, thank you Loreal</li>
            <li> Plus, the price was always really good for how long that it lasted (now that it seems to be discontinued the prices have spiked and are a little harder to justify).</li>
            <li> It is not a lot of major coverage</li>
            <li> The closest thing to this is Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> However, when I got the new one, the little brush wouldn&#x27;t stay in the lid, so I switched it out with my old one.</li>
            <li> When this product came in I thought that this was too little and that this was going to waste really quick.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way to hid blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did have to wait a long time for this product though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but you need only a tiny amount, so it should last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews about this being cakey, but its a concealer not foundation, so I only use it to spot cover.</li>
            <li> I used it, tried other stuff, and came back to this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, just like all the many other concealers I&#x27;ve tried, it does a little, but not enough.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my entire face, but only on the small blemishes and red areas that appear daily, which is probably why one little thing of it has lasted me so long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She achieves a natural look with little effort, and the blemishes are totally hidden.</li>
            <li> Finally something that helps lessen the look of my dark circles!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the brush that came with the product, as it&#x27;s a little too big for me.  </li>
            <li> I have had the same little concealer bottle since I bought it over four years ago</li>
            <li> , I use it everyday, and I just realized today that there is only a little bit left</li>
            <li> Its very loose</li>
            <li> This is the only mineral concealer that I&#x27;ve found that will cover a few darker age  </li>
            <li> Totally cleared my dark circles and all day at that!!</li>
            <li> and I also have had a tough time finding a concealer that works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it covers everything well, from blemises to dark areas arouns eyes.  </li>
            <li> Very little goes a LONG WAY!  </li>
            <li> They are less noticeable using this mineral concealer than anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s not good is the brush</li>
            <li> It does conceal dark circles, though!</li>
            <li> I use it, as does my daughter, by applying liquid coverup, then brushing a little of this to hold it on the skin.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD MY TIME WASTED, AND STILL HAVE TO WAIT</li>
            <li> and it only leaves a big ugly mess.</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> but no, its so small I thought it was an eye shadow</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS, AND I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW AMAZON ALLOWS THESE MEDIOCRE INDIVIDUALS ON HERE TO TAKE OUR MONEY AND DELIVER NOTHING, THEN MAKE US WAIT</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding powder concealers.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> just not as thick as some May like.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dark under eye circles that are very difficult to conceal.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible dark circles under my eyes, and without concealer, it looks like I&#x27;ve been given two black eyes.</li>
            <li> This concealer has been very difficult to find in the stores lately.  </li>
            <li> I was like WTF</li>
            <li> Worse concealer ever!</li>
            <li> Terrible for under the eyes, it only increases lines</li>
            <li> (perhaps my application is flawed?)</li>
            <li> I would be very sad.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When I received it, I was shocked it was powder?!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> If it is horrible to you its because your brushing technique needs revising...</li>

            <li> My daughter loves that this is easy to apply and covers her dark under eye area.  I wish it was sold in stores.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I was shocked it was powder?! I was like WTF do I do with powder? I always moisturize my face and figured I&#x27;d apply this under my eyes after the lotion had sunk&#x27;n in. Man what a difference! I LOVE this product! Totally cleared my dark circles and all day at that!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  :)</li>
            <li> This product is as described. I love the concealer because I use the mineral powder foundation and it is the only one that worked for me after trying 5 different concealers. It&#x27;s hard finding powder concealers. It is not a lot of major coverage so I do not recommend if you want a bright perfect coverage and also if you have very dark circles. Only useful with powder foundation. I did have to wait a long time for this product though.</li>
            <li> Best powder concealer on the market!</li>
            <li> It was not for me, but i think that my girlfriend like it, and we didn&#x27;t have to go walmart.</li>
            <li> on the picture it looks like its a big conteiner but no, its so small I thought it was an eye shadow&lt;br /&gt;and the cover its no very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are better products to use as a concealer</li>
            <li> Liked this when I was younger. Now that I&#x27;m older do not like powder products of any kind.  Increase look of lines.</li>
            <li> Works good but the foundation really could serve the same purpose.  Seems like they just put the powder foundation in a smaller bottle and said it&#x27;s concealer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the expensive BM brand, I&#x27;ve used Physicians Formula, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far.  I have very very fair skin &amp; the lightest shade (which i ordered &amp; received timely) works perfectly for my skin type.  I read other reviews about this being cakey, but its a concealer not foundation, so I only use it to spot cover. I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This concealer has been very difficult to find in the stores lately.  I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon!  I suffer from dark under eye circles that are very difficult to conceal.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from Covergirl to the high end brands at Sephora.  This is the only thing that does the trick!  :)  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this, I have purchased over 8 bottles of this over the years and now especially since Loreal has discontinued making it. It is fantastic, and I hope Loreal will change their mind....yes I recommend it !!</li>
            <li> I love this concealer!  Because it&#x27;s a powder, it is much easier to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This has been the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and matches my skin-tone near perfectly. I can&#x27;t imagine why it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Finally something that helps lessen the look of my dark circles! They are less noticeable using this mineral concealer than anything else I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago my grown daughter emailed me a picture of this product and said &amp;#34;IF YOU FIND THIS BUY IT!!!&amp;#34;  So when I found on Amazon I ordered 4 to put in her Christmas stocking...she was very happy</li>
            <li> I really like the product.  I have one that I had used up, so I needed another one.  However, when I got the new one, the little brush wouldn&#x27;t stay in the lid, so I switched it out with my old one.</li>
            <li> This concealer is good but not the best for coverage.  Blemishes still show through a bit.  I will still buy this though,  I still really like it and it at least covers enough to make me happy! just not as thick as some May like.</li>
            <li> Worse concealer ever! Shouldn&#x27;t even be named a concealer for it covers nothing and it only leaves a big ugly mess. Its very loose and it comes off your skin very easily. Its not at all durable! Also this &amp;#34;concealer&amp;#34; is extremely tiny. The size of a tiny trial size sample that you can easily get at the mall for free. Not cool! Will never buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this product works on all flaws received quickly &amp; amazing price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if stores just got rid of this stuff, or if L&#x27;Oreal stopped making it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere but Amazon. It&#x27;s the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used, so I hope I can keep buying it from here!</li>
            <li> works great! been using this product for years..... Thanks for the quick delivery......</li>
            <li> Much better price than the drugstore, for the same great product. Makeup is easy to use, and looks really natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a good concealer to brighten the shadows on either side of the bridge of my nose. I could never find one that blended easily and didn&#x27;t get stuck in fine lines until I found this product.  The consistency is so fine that it&#x27;s easy to brush on evenly.  The bottle is small, but you need only a tiny amount, so it should last you a long time.  I don&#x27;t use a lot. I don&#x27;t use the brush that came with the product, as it&#x27;s a little too big for me.  I bought a smaller brush and it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It can be hard to find in stores. I stumbled upon it, initially, and fell in love with it. It&#x27;s easy to use and gives excellent coverage. I have very fair skin and often find concealers not very concealing and I have tried many in all price ranges. This is great! It blends easily and looks natural. The brush allows you to blend into perfection.</li>
            <li> I like this makeup , it covers visible problems of aging around my eye and any spot any were I have  on my skin, it also brighten and glows skin like problem solver, its safe for sensitive and delicate type skin, thank you Loreal</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get this fine make up</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, easy purchasing options. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the only mineral concealer that I&#x27;ve found that will cover a few darker age  spots I have.  I love this and wish I could find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Item was brand new and exactly as described, it arrived fast.</li>
            <li> When this product came in I thought that this was too little and that this was going to waste really quick. However, it&#x27;s lasted awhile. The only thing that&#x27;s not good is the brush so I just use another one to apply the powder on.</li>
            <li> This product is the closest to my skin color I have ever found (I am incredibly pale), covers nicely and has pretty amazing staying power. Plus, the price was always really good for how long that it lasted (now that it seems to be discontinued the prices have spiked and are a little harder to justify).</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin this works the best</li>
            <li> This is my go-to concealer. It doesn&#x27;t cake up or get into cracks. It is light-feeling, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and finishes off heavier concealers well if you&#x27;ve got a monster to cover up. I particularly like it under the eyes because it doesn&#x27;t get into wrinkles and it keeps eyeliner from migrating.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and I also have had a tough time finding a concealer that works well for my sensitive skin. It matches my skin tone, and provides full coverage. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, non cakey cover up that totally blends with makeup to match. A tiny bit goes a long way to hid blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed they discontinued it, so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped quickly and my product arrived sealed and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Best cover up ever, I hope it&#x27;s NEVER discontinued!</li>
            <li> stores ran out, now have this, great- covers nicely without being heavy, and does not seem to clog pores, why do they want me to type more words?  i like this lightweight makeup and i&#x27;m somewhat fair skinned so its nice</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage to under-eye circles, and looks a bit powdery when used in that area. However, it is great for small blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer...it covers everything well, from blemises to dark areas arouns eyes.  Being a very fine powder, it doesn&#x27;t cake at all.  I even use it under my browbone as a highlighter, and it conceals imperfections there perfectly, giving me a clean, smooth look. I have used this concealer for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Really like the whole line.</li>
            <li> The stores around me have stopped carrying this stuff.  It is a wonderful concealer.  I love the coverage it gives.....and was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  great price too so I&#x27;ll be ordering more as long as they&#x27;re still offering it here.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my grand daughter. She has a very light skin tone, and believe it or not, is one teenager who isn&#x27;t into punting globs of makeup all over her face. She just dusts this over any blemishes, does her eyes, adds lip gloss and goes. She says it&#x27;s the very best concealer product she&#x27;s used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She achieves a natural look with little effort, and the blemishes are totally hidden.</li>
            <li> Terrible for under the eyes, it only increases lines (perhaps my application is flawed?) PERFECT for everything else. Got a red spot? dab it. Got a freckle? dab it. Got a scar? erase that pesky beast! This is the only concealer I buy!</li>
            <li> This concealer has great coverage, a small size to take along in the purse, and a great brush.  Just wish there were more product but that would negate the size.</li>
            <li> i am very, very fair complected.  this makes my skin even lighter.  i have to put it all over my face.  otherwise it does not look right with mix matched face.  i can work it in a club or bar at night, but i would never wear this in daylight.  luckily most of it is smeared off by the time the sun comes up.</li>
            <li> Great for zits.  Built in brush covers just the zit, no extra layers anywhere else on your skin.  I used it, tried other stuff, and came back to this.</li>
            <li> I love this product and unfortunately cannot find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> AVOID THIS SELLER AT ALL COSTS!!! ALL MY EMAILS WERE IGNORED AND THE ITEM WAS NEVER SHIPPED. I HAVE HAD MY TIME WASTED, AND STILL HAVE TO WAIT A FEW MORE DAYS BEFORE I CAN FILE A CLAIM. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS, AND I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW AMAZON ALLOWS THESE MEDIOCRE INDIVIDUALS ON HERE TO TAKE OUR MONEY AND DELIVER NOTHING, THEN MAKE US WAIT AN ENTIRE MONTH TO GET OUT MONEY BACK.</li>
            <li> This concealer is awesome if you want to emphasize the lines around your eyes. Even my husband, who never notices anything makeup related, noticed I was wearing this. It made my eyes look so old. It does conceal dark circles, though!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I&#x27;m so upset L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued it. But I&#x27;m happy I can find it elsewhere for the time being! I&#x27;ll definitely be grabbing more soon.</li>
            <li> Love love love this concealer it is my backup concealer that i use more often than expected. If it is horrible to you its because your brushing technique needs revising... i&#x27;d pay 20 bucks no thought about it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must have for under the eye concealer!!!  Very little goes a LONG WAY!  Was uncertain a powder could even cover like concealer, but you have to try to believe, once you do, you&#x27;ll be back for more!!!!  Use also for any other imperfections, give it more than stars available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews and did have high hopes for this product.  A friend also uses it and it works great for her.  Unfortunately, just like all the many other concealers I&#x27;ve tried, it does a little, but not enough.  A nice product if it does it for you.  Inexpensive enough to try since it does work for others.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it feels like wearing nothing, covers perfectly, blends amazingly well to your natural skin and it has SPF included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the best deal on Amazon from this company and I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time.  It&#x27;s always sold out everywhere I go because it&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If L&#x27;Oreal stops making this I would be very sad.  The closest thing to this is Bare Minerals but this comes with a brush so it&#x27;s cheaper..and better.  Thanks ya&#x27;ll!</li>
            <li> Love this product, i can never find it in the store anymore so i hope they dont stop making it. it covers and stays on way better than any other concealer i have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I can never find this in stores anymore. I keep buying it because it&#x27;s so amazing. I have dry skin and it surprisingly doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much. It covers very well. Great with redness and blemishes. Can dry out your skin but good for being a powder.</li>
            <li> This stuff covers just about anything that pops out on my face - perfectly! And it stays on.  I even think it might help clear my zits by drying them?  I like that it feels like I have nothing on my face.  Since you only need a tiny amount each time, it lasts quite awhile.  Superb product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I thought it necessary for this product. I first bought this concealer in stores in 2010 not knowing much about makeup but wanting to try it. I have had the same little concealer bottle since I bought it over four years ago, I use it everyday, and I just realized today that there is only a little bit left and it&#x27;s probably time to buy my second one. Over the four years, it has consistently worked perfectly. I don&#x27;t use it on my entire face, but only on the small blemishes and red areas that appear daily, which is probably why one little thing of it has lasted me so long. It covers perfectly, it stays on all day, and I have never had a problem with it. I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so satisfied with any makeup product before. It is well worth the small price because it works great and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> magic in a bottle! works incredibly for my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for hiding blemishes. I use it, as does my daughter, by applying liquid coverup, then brushing a little of this to hold it on the skin. It works very well and comes in a variety of skin tones.L&#x27;Oreal products are usually quite good and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how this powder works better than liquid, but it does. I have horrible dark circles under my eyes, and without concealer, it looks like I&#x27;ve been given two black eyes. This concealer has done a better job of covering that than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
