    <ol>
            <li>Awesome effect.</li>
            <li>Also the Product is very good!!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>Love this!!!</li>
            <li>So the product is really good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week almost now, and its really great for my skin.</li>
            <li>However, my skin looks and feels so great, I don&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped to me in just a couple of days after the purchase, I am happy about it.</li>
            <li>This is a great find.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is amazing!</li>
            <li>When I started to use this one, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>The Seller is very kind and cute!</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Feel good when you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is not as good as the lotion and face wash in this brand.</li>
            <li>That is what we need in America the most!  </li>
            <li>and I immediately fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>and i can honestly say that when I wake up in the morning, my skin looks really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice product, it leaves my skin hydrated and plump.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hypoallergenic cremes by most trendy brands and all of them would cause me to have some sort of an allergic reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase, it&#x27;s extremely rare for me to purchase a face moisturizer without first trying a sample.</li>
            <li>skin feels nice and smooth afterwards</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>But then I used this product and my face became better :]</li>
            <li>i love everything about soybean</li>
            <li>I have tried many and still do</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Isoflavones come from soy and is supposed to give the skin a more youthful appearance and supple appearance.</li>
            <li>have not yet tried it under makeup because I mostly moisturize at night.  </li>
            <li>I would love to recommend this to everybody at any age.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have a clean face every day!</li>
            <li>Its rich and smells great and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog your pours and keeps your face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I had an Amazon gift certificate, and decided to try Sana Nameraka Isoflavone Facial Cream, based solely on the great reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very nice facial creme.</li>
            <li>gel(the one that&#x27;s shaped like a nesting doll) around the eyes and mouth, pretty satisfied with it as well.</li>
            <li>Extremely moisturizing, great choice for winter cream.</li>
            <li>Even though sana is a pretty cheap brand, their products are great.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am loving this product right now and better then any of the other moisturizers out there.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t particularly smell and is easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is simply a good every-day lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive since it is an import, but it&#x27;s worth making my skin happy :-)</li>
            <li>It makes me look brighter when I&#x27;m using it, and makes my overall skin appearance look minimally better.</li>
            <li>And it keeps you very Moisture a lot!</li>
            <li>I first tried this while in Japan</li>
            <li>I love this facial cream.</li>
            <li>this lasted me almost exactly 4 months.  </li>
            <li>I had rashes for many years and no facial product did help.</li>
            <li>I have fairly dry skin around the U zone and apply this mostly around the area right before I sleep.</li>
            <li>So I would recommend this if you have dry skin and need extra moisture, this would be good.</li>
            <li>For the price I really can&#x27;t beat it considering</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry redness skin and when using this for about the first 3 days, my skin is smooth, redness free and definitely NOT DRY.</li>
            <li>I use other face lotions as well, but I love this one as it softens my skins and fades my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It has a silky texture, and leaves a smooth feel to the skin that would make it very good for a makeup base.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and it can easily dry out or become irritated by skin products, especially the perfumed kind.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be repurchasing though, because of its high alcohol content.</li>
            <li>A plus is that this one doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent for those who may be sensitive.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is not thick at all, but once you put it on your face and it starts to sink in, it feels like you&#x27;ve used a thicker</li>
            <li>In contrast, when I use competitor K&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cream, I can feel the absorption pretty much within 10 minutes</li>
            <li>My new staple.</li>
            <li>the price is so low and the quality is very high.</li>
            <li>So far i like this cream.</li>
            <li>and wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>But I also frequently use it all on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a ton of lotions, high end (la mer) and pseudo low end</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how small the container was when I saw it, but really, you only need a finger&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for girls who want their skin not to dry too much while they sleeping.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, prone to dryness and flakes (&amp; redness, if I don&#x27;t use a quality facial moisturizer).</li>
            <li>absorption is so-so because at least for me, I usually feel some slippery residue when I wash my face in the morning if I had put on a good amount.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this facial creme is the only thing I can use.</li>
            <li>I usually use Celestial by Lush, as their products are quite gentle and natural.</li>
            <li>This cream is a bit thick and rich.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel drying on the skin, but when you open the little pot, the alcohol stench is pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft, no longer dry.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin without irritating it, making it super soft.</li>
            <li>It was hard to find a list of ingredients for this cream, but I decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I recently ran out of my other facial cream and decided to try a new one for the isoflavones.</li>

            <li> It can cause a slight allergy if you&#x27;re skin is as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li> just one use.&lt;br /&gt;i will totally recommend to anyone who has dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this product before going to bed and when I wake, my skin still feels soft...take into account that for 8 hours my face has been exposed to dry air through the central air system...</li>
            <li> Skin felt very dry after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry neck, and I woke up with no flakes.</li>
            <li> This one is a little bit different .because</li>
            <li> I tried it in winter, but still feels thick and hard to be absorbed</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t sell bigger tubs of it.</li>
            <li> I would be careful when using it around the eye area though.</li>
            <li> &gt; This little jar goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> At about half the price of the other cream I was using (benefit)</li>
            <li> I held off trying it for a few weeks while my other night cream ran out.  </li>
            <li> It irritates my eyes slightly, so I&#x27;ll be using something else instead.</li>
            <li> As a result, it also feels a bit heavy and slightly greasy on my face when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Too thick, like solid pork oil, hard to spread, and there is a smell of alcohol, which makes I doubt its ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like it and use it everyday</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> it just broke me out and made my face so red that I felt bad even stepping outside my house.</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night.</li>
            <li> (usually in winter)&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I just try to avoid parabens when I can, and alcohol usually dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because of a blog recommendation and because of the price, and so far I&#x27;ve used it every day, twice a day, for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t had any of my usual bad results.</li>
            <li> only disappointment is that this face cream contains methylparaben and alcohol.</li>
            <li> feels thick but locks in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I mean, I smoke cigarettes, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m a health nut, anyhow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 150$ on la mer and have had bad effects from that supposed \\&quot;miracle cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually sad</li>
            <li> Bad for skin.</li>
            <li> I tried using skinfood for about a week before using this product, and let me just say skinfood is BAD....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out of it :(  </li>
            <li> Really hate it</li>
            <li> Very very very bad product experience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a ton of lotions, high end (la mer) and pseudo low end (oil of olay) and have never found one that doesn&#x27;t turn me into a grease ball or make me break out. I tried this one because of a blog recommendation and because of the price, and so far I&#x27;ve used it every day, twice a day, for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t had any of my usual bad results. It&#x27;s not a miracle working cream by any stretch, but it&#x27;s also not claiming to be one. It makes me look brighter when I&#x27;m using it, and makes my overall skin appearance look minimally better. Other than that, it is simply a good every-day lotion. For the price I really can&#x27;t beat it considering I&#x27;ve spent 150$ on la mer and have had bad effects from that supposed \\&quot;miracle cream\\&quot;. A lot of people use the the milky one during the day and this one at night, but because I&#x27;m also using proactiv I need the extra moisture all day.</li>
            <li> I brought a seris products of this brand.  Because my japanese friends told me that, this is the cheapest beauty product. And no Alchol in it.    I like it a lot. It&#x27;s different from American beauty product.   Because I&#x27;m asian. So I dont like to use western product here a lot. I prefer something from Asian. because it&#x27;s desgin for our skin^^ even though sometimes they also have it here in USA.    And it keeps you very Moisture a lot! That is what we need in America the most!  This one is a little bit different .because it&#x27;s for girls who want their skin not to dry too much while they sleeping. but i used it different way and it&#x27;s also helps a lot!     So the product is really good!</li>
            <li> feels thick but locks in the moisture. skin feels nice and smooth afterwards</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 2 weeks and I LOVE IT!!! the price is so low and the quality is very high. My skin is so soft, no longer dry. It has also helped me reducing the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t clog your pours and keeps your face feeling smooth. I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a list of ingredients for this cream, but I decided it was worth a try. It has a silky texture, and leaves a smooth feel to the skin that would make it very good for a makeup base. It seems to be highly moisturizing without being heavy, oily, or sticky. This cream has no fragrance added, and no scent. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and it can easily dry out or become irritated by skin products, especially the perfumed kind. I first tried this while in Japan and I immediately fell in love with it! It moisturizes my skin without irritating it, making it super soft. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t sell bigger tubs of it. It&#x27;s a bit expensive since it is an import, but it&#x27;s worth making my skin happy :-)</li>
            <li> I like it and use it everyday</li>
            <li> very nice facial creme. it is my second bottle. love it.</li>
            <li> Even though sana is a pretty cheap brand, their products are great.&lt;br /&gt; My skin is very sensitive and this facial creme is the only thing I can use. I&#x27;ve tried hypoallergenic cremes by most trendy brands and all of them would cause me to have some sort of an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt; This little jar goes a long way too. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 4 months before I ran out.&lt;br /&gt; I would be careful when using it around the eye area though. It can cause a slight allergy if you&#x27;re skin is as sensitive as mine. I use sana eye gel(the one that&#x27;s shaped like a nesting doll) around the eyes and mouth, pretty satisfied with it as well.</li>
            <li> Bad for skin. Skin felt very dry after I use it. Very very very bad product experience. Really hate it</li>
            <li> So far i like this cream. Its rich and smells great and really moisturizes. i don&#x27;t use it everyday but i am 23 and l like to use something on my face to help prevent whatever age will throw my way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week almost now, and its really great for my skin. I have very sensitive, dry redness skin and when using this for about the first 3 days, my skin is smooth, redness free and definitely NOT DRY. I am loving this product right now and better then any of the other moisturizers out there. I tried using skinfood for about a week before using this product, and let me just say skinfood is BAD.... it just broke me out and made my face so red that I felt bad even stepping outside my house. But then I used this product and my face became better :] What a life saver! So I would recommend this if you have dry skin and need extra moisture, this would be good.</li>
            <li> i love everything about soybean so i decided to give this a try&lt;br /&gt;and i am beyond surprise to see the difference of my skin after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;i will totally recommend to anyone who has dry skin</li>
            <li> We all know that moisturizing is the key to keeping your skin moist and flexible. I have tried many and still do and my skin soaks in the liquid creams like a sponge. I use this product before going to bed and when I wake, my skin still feels soft...take into account that for 8 hours my face has been exposed to dry air through the central air system...so this is a winner. BTW, I got the idea from the Dr Oz show.</li>
            <li> Awesome effect. Love it. Feel good when you wake up in the morning. I usually use it at night. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry skin around the U zone and apply this mostly around the area right before I sleep. (usually in winter)&lt;br /&gt;Its absorption is so-so because at least for me, I usually feel some slippery residue when I wash my face in the morning if I had put on a good amount. In contrast, when I use competitor K&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cream, I can feel the absorption pretty much within 10 minutes and I never feel any residue the next day. As a result, it also feels a bit heavy and slightly greasy on my face when I put it on. A plus is that this one doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent for those who may be sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream. I recently ran out of my other facial cream and decided to try a new one for the isoflavones. Isoflavones come from soy and is supposed to give the skin a more youthful appearance and supple appearance. I can say that it is doing just that. This cream is a bit thick and rich. It&#x27;s also creamy. I use it as the last step before I go to bed and i can honestly say that when I wake up in the morning, my skin looks really nice. I might buy the facial foaming cleanser when I am finished with my milk cleanser to see how the two do together.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, it&#x27;s extremely rare for me to purchase a face moisturizer without first trying a sample. I have very sensitive skin, prone to dryness and flakes (&amp; redness, if I don&#x27;t use a quality facial moisturizer). I usually use Celestial by Lush, as their products are quite gentle and natural. I had an Amazon gift certificate, and decided to try Sana Nameraka Isoflavone Facial Cream, based solely on the great reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment is that this face cream contains methylparaben and alcohol. However, my skin looks and feels so great, I don&#x27;t even care. I mean, I smoke cigarettes, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m a health nut, anyhow. I just try to avoid parabens when I can, and alcohol usually dries my skin out. However, this cream moisturizes my skin, quite nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The INGREDIENTS are not listed anywhere that I could find, so I&#x27;m copying them verbatim from the packaging, for anybody else who is considering purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sana Nameraka Isoflavone Facial Cream INGREDIENTS (from English translation sticker on packaging):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATER, CYCLOMETHICONE, GLYCERIN, SQUALANE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, GLYCERYL STEARATE SE, ALCOHOL, ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, STEARIC ACID, PALMITIC ACID, CETYL ALCOHOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, BEESWAX, PEG-25 STEARATE, METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, CARBOMER, XANTHAN GUM, LACTOBACILLUS/ SOYBEAN EXTRACT FERMENT FILTRATE, CITRIC ACID, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) PROTEIN, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) SEED EXTRACT</li>
            <li> I saw this on amazon and went to my local Japanese market to see if they had it.  What luck, they did.  I held off trying it for a few weeks while my other night cream ran out.  I tried this and wow, what a difference.  At about half the price of the other cream I was using (benefit) this one feels a lot nicer on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t particularly smell and is easy to spread.  The cream itself is not thick at all, but once you put it on your face and it starts to sink in, it feels like you&#x27;ve used a thicker cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tried it under makeup because I mostly moisturize at night.  I was surprised by how small the container was when I saw it, but really, you only need a finger&#x27;s worth.  Also, it&#x27;s larger than most expensive creams and works just as well.  I am trying to get into the habit of moisturizing my neck/chest as well though, so it will probably last about two months in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update!: this lasted me almost exactly 4 months.  also, it does have alcohol in it but I feel like it kept any acne or blemishes at bay so I really personally do not mind.  I&#x27;m actually sad I&#x27;m out of it :(  Definitely will repurchase!</li>
            <li> The item was shipped to me in just a couple of days after the purchase, I am happy about it.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as the lotion and face wash in this brand. Too thick, like solid pork oil, hard to spread, and there is a smell of alcohol, which makes I doubt its ingredients. I tried it in winter, but still feels thick and hard to be absorbed</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing, great choice for winter cream. I have a very dry neck, and I woke up with no flakes. This is a great find. My new staple. Love this!!!</li>
            <li> I had rashes for many years and no facial product did help. I tried different brand, no one worked. When I started to use this one, it&#x27;s amazing! Since then, I have a clean face every day! I would love to recommend this to everybody at any age.</li>
            <li> Nice product, it leaves my skin hydrated and plump. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing though, because of its high alcohol content. It doesn&#x27;t feel drying on the skin, but when you open the little pot, the alcohol stench is pretty noticeable. It irritates my eyes slightly, so I&#x27;ll be using something else instead.</li>
            <li> The Seller is very kind and cute! Also the Product is very good!!</li>
            <li> I use other face lotions as well, but I love this one as it softens my skins and fades my wrinkles. I pair it with a line filler and an AHA/BHA one. But I also frequently use it all on it&#x27;s own. I even use under my eyes, without a problem. I&#x27;m 42 but my sister is 30, with very different skin and she loves it too.</li>
