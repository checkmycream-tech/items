    <ol>
            <li>Probably the best nail glue I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best stuff ever</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THE BEST glue</li>
            <li>Awesome Product!  </li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT.</li>
            <li>IT GOOD FOR TRAVELING.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with acrylic nails and nail glues now for 25 years, and this Big Bondini Hypo-Allergenic nail glue is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when you order it, you think you&#x27;re getting a case of it :)</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a great, great product.</li>
            <li>Awesome product I have super sensitive skin &amp; had no reaction to this glue.</li>
            <li>I reacted just as strongly to this one.</li>
            <li>nice fast glue although it was deceiving as to what i was getting with the pic</li>
            <li>Why would they say the original price is 69.99?  </li>
            <li>and I was so happy to see that my nail was totally repaired and solid as a rock where the crack was.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I am so allergic to so many chemicals, and this glue didn&#x27;t faze me whatsoever, as far as being harsh or causing any allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>So I went on here and ordered the bigger size that came with a brush :3</li>
            <li>Shows a full display and it represents a full display by saying you save $59.70, but only ships 1 bottle!</li>
            <li>I was surprise by how small the bottle was, but anyway on the other hand it works amazingly!!!</li>
            <li>The glue also held better than any other nail glue I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Next time I needed it, 2 days later, even Superman could not unscrew the top.</li>
            <li>No other nail glue works like this one!!!</li>
            <li>This is completely deceptive.</li>
            <li>My only problem with it is that I live in a big city and despite researching all local resources, had to order it, i.e., read \\&quot;pay shipping,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>A bit confusing that the price is for one item and not a box full.</li>

            <li> and I am sensitive to other nail glues.  </li>
            <li> So far i havent had a reaction like i did with other nail glues</li>
            <li> I noticed that one of my nails was starting to crack a little bit, my natural nail, so I put some of the nail glue on the crack</li>
            <li> I think the picture should be of a single bottle or somehow labeled different.</li>
            <li> this was toooo.....expensive for 1 little tiny ass bottle.</li>
            <li> Bottle was empty with no glue was a rip off</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out around my nails when I use any other nail glue.  </li>
            <li> Has been holding my set of tips on longer than any other product.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the value of this product because sometimes I will shop and get extreme values on Amazon this particular item every picture that I found was of multiple bottles leaving me to believe that what was pictured is what I would get .</li>
            <li> The glue held my nail art stones for at least a week.</li>
            <li> so it couldn&#x27;t stand up, and the glue is so thick it took all my might to squeeze it out of the container.</li>
            <li> I bet the post office was not very happy.</li>
            <li> False advertising plus mine came broken and stuck ti other mail.</li>
            <li> I assumed that i was getting 12 small bottles for $5.76, I feel like this was falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to use it with my fake nails.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. IT WORKS GREAT. I ALSO HAVE THE LARGER SIZE IN A BOTTLE THAT HAS A BRUSH, BUT THE SMALLER SIZE IT GOOD FOR TRAVELING. IT DOES NOT CLOG.</li>
            <li> I feel ripped off!  Product could not be opened.  I submitted a request for replacement,  it&#x27;s been a month and still no response!</li>
            <li> Wife uses it on split nails .</li>
            <li> this was toooo.....expensive for 1 little tiny ass bottle. I assumed that i was getting 12 small bottles for $5.76, I feel like this was falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> Big Bondini was a total flop.  I bought it because it was hypo-allergenic and I am sensitive to other nail glues.  Well, I could NOT tell a difference.  I reacted just as strongly to this one. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product.  The glue itself works okay but the bottled had a bubble on the bottom so it couldn&#x27;t stand up, and the glue is so thick it took all my might to squeeze it out of the container. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Probably the best nail glue I&#x27;ve used, no joke. I just wish it came in a bigger size! So I went on here and ordered the bigger size that came with a brush :3 But anyway, the day it got to my house I noticed that one of my nails was starting to crack a little bit, my natural nail, so I put some of the nail glue on the crack and I was so happy to see that my nail was totally repaired and solid as a rock where the crack was. And its lasted almost a week now and has gone through me redoing my nails twice and still hasn&#x27;t moved or dissolved! It&#x27;s the best stuff ever and I can&#x27;t wait to use it with my fake nails.</li>
            <li> This product does the job, but the listing incorrectly states it is a brush on glue. It is not</li>
            <li> I used it once and wiped it around when was finished.  Next time I needed it, 2 days later, even Superman could not unscrew the top. It was sealed forever.  I would not buy this one again.  Went back to Kiss.</li>
            <li> Gave me an allergic reaction after I adhered 2 stones to my nails and then must have slept on my hand as the next morning I woke up to both my under eyes swollen to the max. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Bottle was empty with no glue was a rip off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THE BEST glue I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when you order it, you think you&#x27;re getting a case of it :)</li>
            <li> Why would they say the original price is 69.99?  False advertising plus mine came broken and stuck ti other mail.Dont know if it works it was all gone.  I bet the post office was not very happy.</li>
            <li> The glue held my nail art stones for at least a week.</li>
            <li> nice fast glue although it was deceiving as to what i was getting with the pic</li>
            <li> So far i havent had a reaction like i did with other nail glues</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out around my nails when I use any other nail glue.  This is the only nail glue I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause that breakout.</li>
            <li> Awesome product I have super sensitive skin &amp; had no reaction to this glue. Product arrived on time as promise.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product!  Has been holding my set of tips on longer than any other product.  This is a must have!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the value of this product because sometimes I will shop and get extreme values on Amazon this particular item every picture that I found was of multiple bottles leaving me to believe that what was pictured is what I would get . I think the picture should be of a single bottle or somehow labeled different. For the actual product I have not tried it the reason I marked it so low was so surprised at the small amount. I will write another review once I use the actual item.</li>
            <li> Zero stars ..This is completely deceptive. Shows a full display and it represents a full display by saying you save $59.70, but only ships 1 bottle!</li>
