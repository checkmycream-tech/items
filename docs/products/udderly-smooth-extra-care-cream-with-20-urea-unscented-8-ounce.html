            <li>So glad I did!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;of effective moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight, non greasy and pleasant, but it has no healing properties whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>it is the best thing so far, but I think I still have to continue looking for something more effective.</li>
            <li>It works well on many skin types, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and this is a nice size for travel or the office.</li>
            <li>On the positive side it is a wonderful smooth skin care cream that leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li>Smooth &amp; goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>Great stuff -- very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It was OK but made my skin itch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got to love the name.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that because of the Urea, it would be more beneficial for eczema...</li>
            <li>Decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try one more product, so I ordered this cream with the 20% Urea.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Udder cream has been better than anything else</li>
            <li>Best hand lotion for really dry hands.</li>
            <li>My physician thought it was eczema, even though it did not itch, and prescribed a steroid cream, they a strong steroid, and then an even stronger steroid.</li>
            <li>Have read about Udderly Smooth Cream and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived ahead of time.  </li>
            <li>helps smooth and comforts foot pain</li>
            <li>Shipping thriugh amazon was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Great for extremely dry skin!</li>
            <li>Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many hand cream and this one works very well.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this is helping me - but it will take some time for full effect</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results and short turn around.  </li>
            <li>I read that urea is good for dry hands and tried it.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbed by the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first!  </li>
            <li>Works very, very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to The People&#x27;s Pharmacy for that tip!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;heavy or greasy, just comfortable and actually soft feeling.  </li>
            <li>Skin is clearly smoother, worth more than many more expensive creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>My hands were just as dry and never got any better.</li>
            <li>This cream is outstanding for smoothing out rough areas.</li>
            <li>The urea in the lotion really makes a difference in terms of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Smooth but not soft.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li>It does work well, though, and I&#x27;m excited to see if it makes a difference through a Kansas dry winter.</li>
            <li>is MUCH cheaper, doesn&#x27;t cause itching and - as far as I can tell - works about as well as the 40% concentration.  </li>
            <li>It works good and even cured my broken nails.  </li>
            <li>Very rich cream - I could literally rub dead skin off immediately after applying it (this is after washing already).</li>
            <li>Consider this an early report, but early results are certainly impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Note that the Udderly Smooth in the larger containers that say &amp;#34;Extra Care&amp;#34; and have the same design and color are NOT the same.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very greasy, and contains chemicals known to be carcinogenic, such as Paraben.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more of this little miracle worker!</li>
            <li>And unlike every other cream, lotion and oil, this product actually is absorbed.</li>
            <li>The thing is neither of them work as well as Be Natural heel cream... which I also bought on Amazon and is priced about the same as this Udderly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried moisturizing them with typical body creams, pumice stones and other mechanical and chemical peels (pretty feet and hands) and nothing has really worked well..</li>
            <li>Before, pealing skin left the underlying skin that quickly cracked and became raw..</li>
            <li>I purchased mainly for the urea as I have eczema, so due to the chalky feeling, I passed on to a friend who likes it.</li>
            <li>three years, I have had a condition the leaves some fingers, near the tips, red, dry, pealing, and cracking.</li>

            <li> the skin remains a bit dry and the toes still peel a bi...</li>
            <li> My brother in law has dry skin</li>
            <li> I have so much trouble with my hands getting dry, especially my fingertips cracking open.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, all I know right now is that this product has made an immediate and dramatic difference and shows every sign of eventually clearing it up.</li>
            <li> Have very dry hands.</li>
            <li> My heels are very dry,</li>
            <li> I bought this cream based on positive reviews for getting rid of spider veins but unfortunately it didnt work.</li>
            <li> I once had thick, tough, dry areas on my heels, and a urea-based product pealed the hard skin and left it soft and well.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and hope it fades my little spider veins a bit.</li>
            <li> My heels have become so dry they actually are uncomfortable....</li>
            <li> Not harder, just less vulnerable.</li>
            <li> My feet are horrible (constantly dry and cracked) and daily application of this really helps.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets dry cracked hands in the cold, this is the only lotion that has worked for her.</li>
            <li> I was recommend a cream with urea by my dermatologist for keratosis pilaris (those annoying bumps on the back your upper arms) to help slough dead skin.</li>
            <li> He specifically requested this one for a gift for this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this cream, it came so highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> All but one painful crack have disappeared, and the last is almost healed.</li>
            <li> and it is expensive by the ounce.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is extremely expensive too.</li>
            <li> I expect it will be needed continuously or from time to time, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay after three years of an annoying condition.</li>
            <li> That seemed to reduce the problem on some fingers, leaving some as bad as ever.</li>
            <li> The cracks are very painful and require Bandaids just to keep the pain from being distracting.</li>

            <li> Very nice cream for my feet. Smooth &amp; goes on nicely. I use this twice a day and hope it fades my little spider veins a bit.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE IMPROVEMENT TO MY FEET!!!  My doctor recommends this stuff to his patients with severe symptoms from cancer, diabetes, etc. I am very pleased with the results and short turn around.  Works best if you can apply 3x per day.</li>
            <li> Best Care Cream on the market.</li>
            <li> Great stuff -- very moisturizing.  Even helps with spider veins.  (Must have 20% Urea).  Thanks to The People&#x27;s Pharmacy for that tip!</li>
            <li> Have very dry hands. I have tried many hand cream and this one works very well.  Need to apply only or twice a day.</li>
            <li> Consider this an early report, but early results are certainly impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For three years, I have had a condition the leaves some fingers, near the tips, red, dry, pealing, and cracking. The cracks are very painful and require Bandaids just to keep the pain from being distracting. My physician thought it was eczema, even though it did not itch, and prescribed a steroid cream, they a strong steroid, and then an even stronger steroid. That seemed to reduce the problem on some fingers, leaving some as bad as ever. I tried creams, petroleum jelly, coconut oil, and even mink oil. Nothing did much good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found some references to this product. I have now used it for three days,. All but one painful crack have disappeared, and the last is almost healed. There has been some pealing, but with a big difference. Before, pealing skin left the underlying skin that quickly cracked and became raw.. This pealing leaves intact skin, softer than before. The skin seems somehow tougher. Not harder, just less vulnerable. Smooth but not soft. And unlike every other cream, lotion and oil, this product actually is absorbed. Everything else refused to penetrate and left excess to be wiped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the key factor to be the urea. I once had thick, tough, dry areas on my heels, and a urea-based product pealed the hard skin and left it soft and well. Otherwise, all I know right now is that this product has made an immediate and dramatic difference and shows every sign of eventually clearing it up. I expect it will be needed continuously or from time to time, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay after three years of an annoying condition.</li>
            <li> Have read about Udderly Smooth Cream and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived ahead of time.  That&#x27;s a first!  Though a cream it isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;heavy or greasy, just comfortable and actually soft feeling.  Yes, I&lt;br /&gt;would recommend this to anyone with dry skin issues, or in need&lt;br /&gt;of effective moisturizing.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Great for extremely dry skin! It works well to soften the callouses on the palms of my hands. It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I try a 40% urea product,,,, prescription only.  That was $18 per ounce excluding the cost of the office visit.  It was OK but made my skin itch.&lt;br /&gt;This is MUCH cheaper, doesn&#x27;t cause itching and - as far as I can tell - works about as well as the 40% concentration.  The thing is neither of them work as well as Be Natural heel cream... which I also bought on Amazon and is priced about the same as this Udderly Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;But you&#x27;ve got to love the name.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  My dermatologist suggested I find a lotion with 20% urea cream for help with my extremely dry feet.  I started noticing a difference after only 3 days of use.  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> I read that urea is good for dry hands and tried it.  It works good and even cured my broken nails.  It is not greasy and absorbed by the skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Results with the lotion may be a bit over promised by some websites-- and it is expensive by the ounce.</li>
            <li> That stuff is great!  My heels are very dry, crack and  bleed, but haven&#x27;t had a problem since started using it.  Would highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> This cream is outstanding for smoothing out rough areas. Unfortunately, it is extremely expensive too. Note that the Udderly Smooth in the larger containers that say &amp;#34;Extra Care&amp;#34; and have the same design and color are NOT the same.</li>
            <li> Frangrance makes me sneeze, and there is no sneezing with this lotion. Great for very dry skin. Already ordered another one.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this a 5 is because it makes my hands feel a bit tacky for a short while after I apply it. It does work well, though, and I&#x27;m excited to see if it makes a difference through a Kansas dry winter.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that because of the Urea, it would be more beneficial for eczema...not so.</li>
            <li> I have so much trouble with my hands getting dry, especially my fingertips cracking open.  Decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try one more product, so I ordered this cream with the 20% Urea.  So glad I did!  It helped to heal my hands when nothing else I have tried did.  Will definitely be ordering more of this little miracle worker!</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion for really dry hands. My daughter gets dry cracked hands in the cold, this is the only lotion that has worked for her.</li>
            <li> My heels have become so dry they actually are uncomfortable....and the skin under my big toes looks like it is peeling in strips - yuck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve tried moisturizing them with typical body creams, pumice stones and other mechanical and chemical peels (pretty feet and hands) and nothing has really worked well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Udder cream has been better than anything else but I can&#x27;t say it is a miracle...the skin remains a bit dry and the toes still peel a bi... it is the best thing so far, but I think I still have to continue looking for something more effective.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet.  Especially on my heels.  It seems to work well.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a week.  I think my heels are smoother.</li>
            <li> This cream is a must try! I was recommend a cream with urea by my dermatologist for keratosis pilaris (those annoying bumps on the back your upper arms) to help slough dead skin. Very rich cream - I could literally rub dead skin off immediately after applying it (this is after washing already). Skin is clearly smoother, worth more than many more expensive creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very greasy, and contains chemicals known to be carcinogenic, such as Paraben.</li>
            <li> Works very, very well. Now, I just need to remember to use it! LOL!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this cream, I thought it had a chalky feel to it.  Disclaimer:  I over-apply for overnight moisturizing so perhaps with a much smaller quantity of cream, the chalkiness would not be noticeable.  I purchased mainly for the urea as I have eczema, so due to the chalky feeling, I passed on to a friend who likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream based on positive reviews for getting rid of spider veins but unfortunately it didnt work. On the positive side it is a wonderful smooth skin care cream that leaves no oily residue. I would buy it again. Shipping thriugh amazon was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The urea in the lotion really makes a difference in terms of moisturizing. My feet are horrible (constantly dry and cracked) and daily application of this really helps. Add it to your subscribe and save for additional savings!</li>
            <li> I feel like this is helping me - but it will take some time for full effect</li>
            <li> helps smooth and comforts foot pain</li>
            <li> I would like to return it, Don&#x27;t like at all</li>
            <li> My brother in law has dry skin and I bought a selection of lotions last winter. He specifically requested this one for a gift for this past Christmas. It works well on many skin types, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and this is a nice size for travel or the office.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this cream, it came so highly recommended.  It is light weight, non greasy and pleasant, but it has no healing properties whatsoever.  My hands were just as dry and never got any better.</li>
