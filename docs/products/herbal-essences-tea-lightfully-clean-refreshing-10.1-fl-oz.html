            <li>Like them will buy more</li>
            <li>I love the formula in this product, it&#x27;s not too drying.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Mostly like.</li>
            <li>:-))</li>
            <li>Lightly and nice smelling</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel nice and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>thought product this might be a good replacement for me, but after the first wash my scalp did not like it and broke out.</li>
            <li>The formula is very light weight and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This has a light, nice scent and leaves hair feeling and, more importantly, looking clean.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It was a bit surprising for me...didn&#x27;t really expect that.</li>
            <li>Contains Tea Tree Oil... does a nice job of really cleaning my hair and has a nice clean tingly feeling on your scalp.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews say that they like Drama Clean better.</li>
            <li>Tealightfully clean is more minty feeling.</li>
            <li>Have used Drama Clean for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Not as strong as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels OK but not as clean as it did with Drama Clean.</li>
            <li>Sort of an apple-y light soapy smell.</li>
            <li>Worth it in many ways.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shine like gold and so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much, but I find that this works better than most &amp;#34;light clean&amp;#34; shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this as much as I like the &amp;#34;Drama Clean&amp;#34; shampoo that this replaces, but it&#x27;s not terrible-</li>
            <li>for me this one leaves my hair extremely clean without over drying it like others do.</li>
            <li>This is especially true if you just want a basic cleansing shampoo with a light scent and aren&#x27;t expecting any miracles.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, my husband liked the smell, so maybe this is marketed more towards men?</li>
            <li>I use Drama Clean shampoo and conditioner now, and added this to my routine.</li>
            <li>Both clean hair without silicones or build-up as promised.</li>
            <li>Tried Tea-Lightfully Clean</li>
            <li>When I heard that Drama Clean was being discontinued, I started trying a bunch of others</li>
            <li>shampoos I heard was close and this is the closet I have come to Drama Clean.</li>
            <li>and I can tell when I use Drama Clean when my hair dries-</li>
            <li>Drama Clean always did the trick for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this is the replacement/upgrade for Drama Clean since stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>My hair never feels as clean as it does with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my fine hair - it cleans away any product/dirt/oil that tends to weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Soothing cool.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s sort of minty), but it is not bad or offensive, and I got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your scalp oily, but clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Leaves my husband&#x27;s hair feeling squeaky clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>So, thanks herbal essence for coming out with a silicone free and light formula.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find this particular one and fortunately found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Daughter has gorgeous long hair and swears by this product.  </li>
            <li>is my new favorite shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine, wavy hair, but a lot of it, so it can sort of stand on end instead of waving with certain shampoos.</li>
            <li>But I like my hair REALLY clean, squeaky clean in the shower, so it&#x27;s been a challenge to find a shampoo that really cleans my hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it looking like either a straw patch</li>
            <li>One of the few remaining &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoos out there, great for oily hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little different than Drama Clean but very pleasant.</li>
            <li>My long hair liked both the shampoo and conditioner for this product.</li>
            <li>Less good than the same-brand shampoo, which was bottled into an old-fashioned bottle and sold in Europe.</li>
            <li>It is a mild tea smell and doesn&#x27;t have that burn that real tea shampoos have.</li>
            <li>also did not like the smell very much.</li>
            <li>Very light green tea scent, not enough to make you think you steeped your hair in a pot,but enough just be refreshing - surprisingly, like the description says.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different ones, from the dollar store up to the well known salon brands and</li>
            <li>usually love Herbal Essences smells, but the actual job that the shampoo does lacks results for me</li>
            <li>The first use of this product had me hooked.</li>
            <li>I am to blame for not reading the ingredients first, but I thought Herbal Essences had stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels light and soft and the tea scent sort of floats around every time I run a brush through it.</li>
            <li>But I also must reference the first review for this product.</li>
            <li>Once again I&#x27;ll reference the smell mentioned in the first review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and brands of various types for 29 years and have never found something that works as well as this!</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good shampoo for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing with a slight tingle</li>
            <li>I just like how it clean and soft</li>
            <li>I wish the size of the bottle was bigger as the quantity of one bottle is probably good only for two or three weeks for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and I don&#x27;t notice any residue.</li>
            <li>Tea-Lightfully Clean left my hair CLEAN and SOFT and SHINEY!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my tween who&#x27;s currently suffering the fine greasy hair drama of puberty.</li>
            <li>In fact, as a body wash, it&#x27;s actually very cleansing but gentle.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair really well</li>
            <li>The scents are heavenly and it is a gentle shampoo causing no damage or wear yo my hair (drying it out and making it frizzy).</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I compare this one to that one, so I expected more.</li>
            <li>Hair stays clean/dry for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Wish they would bring back Drama Clean.</li>
            <li>I have used Drama Clean for years because it was the only &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Through the rest of it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also previously tried a generic Sally Beauty Supply version of the Paul Mitchell stuff, and didn&#x27;t have any reactions really, just didn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well or smell as good.</li>
            <li>do hope Herbal Essences re-release the Drama Clean, but until then, I&#x27;ll use the Tea-Lightfully Clean (with a few days of Prell thrown in here and there just to clarify.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this and Drama Clean for a long time.</li>
            <li>So, I use this shampoo to get my hair perfectly clean, then a heavier conditioner (like the long term relationship) to keep the hair sleek.</li>
            <li>If you want that tingle, you&#x27;ll probably have to invest a little more, but this does the job of cleaning some hair.</li>
            <li>Even my 14 year old son loves it and my son is very picky on his shower items.</li>
            <li>I actually kinda like tea trea oil&#x27;s distinct woody/piney aroma, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have even a hint of it.  </li>
            <li>I still have half a bottle of Drama Clean left, and I am alternating days when I use it and use this (the Tea-Lightfully Clean)</li>
            <li>I have to use HUGE amounts of this versus other HE products to cover my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells refreshing and makes your scalp a little tingly!</li>
            <li>I actually searched for &amp;#34;tea tree shampoo&amp;#34; and bought this on a whim as the first thing that came up</li>
            <li>There are better shampoos out there, but not many in this price range.</li>
            <li>I like the minty feeling, its really refreshing on my scalp, especially since I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice between uses with my normal shampoo and conditioner and is does seem to clear any build up.</li>
            <li>First time users of tea tree oil are usually pretty sensitive to tea tree&#x27;s menthol-like effects, but I find that I barely feel it anymore after being a long time</li>
            <li>It is hard to find on local store shelves, so I am very glad I can get it</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge bottle going to waste if I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo twice since I have oily hair and leaving it on during the second time creates this tingly feeling on my head, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft after using this.</li>
            <li>do recommend the product because my hair looks shiny and feels soft.</li>
            <li>one of the few TeaTreeOil shampoos left - like to use this in the summer for ticks, lice, etc that tend to show up more in hotter weather on animals and at friend&#x27;s houses....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to creamy shampoo, this will feel dry as first but the conditioners fix that issue.</li>
            <li>It works great-leave her hair clean and soft without drying it out or being to harsh.</li>
            <li>OTHER shampoos either leave my hair brittle and straw-like, or don&#x27;t get my hair clean and leave my hair looking like it hasn&#x27;t even been washed at all (for several days!), and leave a greasy film on it.</li>
            <li>It left my hair shiny, soft and there is no heavy build up.  </li>
            <li>Our waves and curls aren&#x27;t weighed down, and our hair feels strong and soft, and our sensitive scalps are less itchy and</li>
            <li>Weights my hair down and it isn&#x27;t silky and shiny - kind of dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft enough.</li>
            <li>I have oily/ wavy thick hair, one of my daughters has oily thin wavy hair, and my other daughter has curly thick but fine hair, and for each of us it works GREAT!!</li>
            <li>And without the stripped out dry feeling from other super cleansing shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have long, normal hair, and after using this product, my shoulders, forehead and back feel like I put on Bengay cream.</li>
            <li>There is just enough tea tree oil in the product to feel the effect but not as much as Jason tea tree shampoos contain, or some of those other brands.</li>
            <li>I used my normal stuff for a few days and it went back to normal.</li>
            <li>it still leaves my hair very shiny and not weighed down.</li>
            <li>When drying my hair outside the shower my head feels cool and tingly for a few minutes until it&#x27;s completely dry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> My hair never feels as clean as it does with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my fine hair - it cleans away any product/dirt/oil that tends to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Soothing cool.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s sort of minty), but it is not bad or offensive, and I got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your scalp oily, but clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Leaves my husband&#x27;s hair feeling squeaky clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> So, thanks herbal essence for coming out with a silicone free and light formula.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this particular one and fortunately found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Daughter has gorgeous long hair and swears by this product.  </li>
            <li> is my new favorite shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine, wavy hair, but a lot of it, so it can sort of stand on end instead of waving with certain shampoos.</li>
            <li> But I like my hair REALLY clean, squeaky clean in the shower, so it&#x27;s been a challenge to find a shampoo that really cleans my hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it looking like either a straw patch</li>
            <li> One of the few remaining &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoos out there, great for oily hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different than Drama Clean but very pleasant.</li>
            <li> My long hair liked both the shampoo and conditioner for this product.</li>
            <li> Less good than the same-brand shampoo, which was bottled into an old-fashioned bottle and sold in Europe.</li>
            <li> It is a mild tea smell and doesn&#x27;t have that burn that real tea shampoos have.</li>
            <li> also did not like the smell very much.</li>
            <li> Very light green tea scent, not enough to make you think you steeped your hair in a pot,but enough just be refreshing - surprisingly, like the description says.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many different ones, from the dollar store up to the well known salon brands and</li>
            <li> usually love Herbal Essences smells, but the actual job that the shampoo does lacks results for me</li>
            <li> The first use of this product had me hooked.</li>
            <li> I am to blame for not reading the ingredients first, but I thought Herbal Essences had stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels light and soft and the tea scent sort of floats around every time I run a brush through it.</li>
            <li> But I also must reference the first review for this product.</li>
            <li> Once again I&#x27;ll reference the smell mentioned in the first review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and brands of various types for 29 years and have never found something that works as well as this!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good shampoo for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing with a slight tingle</li>
            <li> I just like how it clean and soft</li>
            <li> I wish the size of the bottle was bigger as the quantity of one bottle is probably good only for two or three weeks for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and I don&#x27;t notice any residue.</li>
            <li> Tea-Lightfully Clean left my hair CLEAN and SOFT and SHINEY!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my tween who&#x27;s currently suffering the fine greasy hair drama of puberty.</li>
            <li> In fact, as a body wash, it&#x27;s actually very cleansing but gentle.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair really well</li>
            <li> The scents are heavenly and it is a gentle shampoo causing no damage or wear yo my hair (drying it out and making it frizzy).</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I compare this one to that one, so I expected more.</li>
            <li> Hair stays clean/dry for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> Wish they would bring back Drama Clean.</li>
            <li> I have used Drama Clean for years because it was the only &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Through the rest of it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also previously tried a generic Sally Beauty Supply version of the Paul Mitchell stuff, and didn&#x27;t have any reactions really, just didn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well or smell as good.</li>
            <li> do hope Herbal Essences re-release the Drama Clean, but until then, I&#x27;ll use the Tea-Lightfully Clean (with a few days of Prell thrown in here and there just to clarify.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and Drama Clean for a long time.</li>
            <li> So, I use this shampoo to get my hair perfectly clean, then a heavier conditioner (like the long term relationship) to keep the hair sleek.</li>
            <li> If you want that tingle, you&#x27;ll probably have to invest a little more, but this does the job of cleaning some hair.</li>
            <li> Even my 14 year old son loves it and my son is very picky on his shower items.</li>
            <li> I actually kinda like tea trea oil&#x27;s distinct woody/piney aroma, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have even a hint of it.  </li>
            <li> I still have half a bottle of Drama Clean left, and I am alternating days when I use it and use this (the Tea-Lightfully Clean)</li>
            <li> I have to use HUGE amounts of this versus other HE products to cover my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing and makes your scalp a little tingly!</li>
            <li> I actually searched for &amp;#34;tea tree shampoo&amp;#34; and bought this on a whim as the first thing that came up</li>
            <li> There are better shampoos out there, but not many in this price range.</li>
            <li> I like the minty feeling, its really refreshing on my scalp, especially since I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice between uses with my normal shampoo and conditioner and is does seem to clear any build up.</li>
            <li> First time users of tea tree oil are usually pretty sensitive to tea tree&#x27;s menthol-like effects, but I find that I barely feel it anymore after being a long time</li>
            <li> It is hard to find on local store shelves, so I am very glad I can get it</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge bottle going to waste if I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo twice since I have oily hair and leaving it on during the second time creates this tingly feeling on my head, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft after using this.</li>
            <li> do recommend the product because my hair looks shiny and feels soft.</li>
            <li> one of the few TeaTreeOil shampoos left - like to use this in the summer for ticks, lice, etc that tend to show up more in hotter weather on animals and at friend&#x27;s houses....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to creamy shampoo, this will feel dry as first but the conditioners fix that issue.</li>
            <li> It works great-leave her hair clean and soft without drying it out or being to harsh.</li>
            <li> OTHER shampoos either leave my hair brittle and straw-like, or don&#x27;t get my hair clean and leave my hair looking like it hasn&#x27;t even been washed at all (for several days!), and leave a greasy film on it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair shiny, soft and there is no heavy build up.  </li>
            <li> Our waves and curls aren&#x27;t weighed down, and our hair feels strong and soft, and our sensitive scalps are less itchy and</li>
            <li> Weights my hair down and it isn&#x27;t silky and shiny - kind of dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft enough.</li>
            <li> I have oily/ wavy thick hair, one of my daughters has oily thin wavy hair, and my other daughter has curly thick but fine hair, and for each of us it works GREAT!!</li>
            <li> And without the stripped out dry feeling from other super cleansing shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have long, normal hair, and after using this product, my shoulders, forehead and back feel like I put on Bengay cream.</li>
            <li> There is just enough tea tree oil in the product to feel the effect but not as much as Jason tea tree shampoos contain, or some of those other brands.</li>
            <li> I used my normal stuff for a few days and it went back to normal.</li>
            <li> it still leaves my hair very shiny and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> When drying my hair outside the shower my head feels cool and tingly for a few minutes until it&#x27;s completely dry.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my hair soft and not as dry!!!</li>
            <li> Living in an extremely humid city, this is the only shampoo that gets my hair through the summer.  </li>
            <li> Combined, my hair gets dry and frail.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy proteins and I can not deal with glycerin due to the matter that I&#x27;m from the South.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have a buddy or family member willing to take it off your hands if you&#x27;re not happy with either product.</li>
            <li> Burned and made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little different</li>
            <li> Not exactly as much tea tree smell as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> For the past several years, I&#x27;d been using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which is about 3-5x as expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the price was low and it was a small bottle, so I figured I could try it out</li>
            <li> and it has a tingly effect due to the mint extract in the poo.</li>
            <li> I gave it a second try and had a similar but worse reaction.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shiny, not weighed down, but also isn&#x27;t quite as fly-away.</li>
            <li> I like it because its not too heavy, but cleans well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people think it&#x27;s menthol or heavy.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m usually a fan of the &amp;#34;pure and simple&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; version of shampoos.</li>
            <li> although I am not sure I like the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s called Tea-Lightfully; it should be called Menthol-Lightfully.</li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient is causing this &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation, but it makes me nervous to use the product.</li>
            <li> This product contains sodium lauryl sulfate, the harsher of the two common surfactants used in shampoos.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve used other products that left me very unhappy because they do leave your hair feeling like you coated it with wax</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, it has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> It leaves no gunk behind nor is the fragrance offensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sticking with the expensive stuff it looks like.</li>
            <li> Not everyone will have this, unfortunately I&#x27;m one of those who do have effect to this chemical.</li>
            <li> But I know a lot of people have smell sensitivities and a lot of people might be unhappy with the smell because it does smell a bit medicine-y.</li>
            <li> Pleasent scent and leaves no residue behind!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this for my tween who&#x27;s currently suffering the fine greasy hair drama of puberty. It works great-leave her hair clean and soft without drying it out or being to harsh.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and I&#x27;ve tried many different ones, from the dollar store up to the well known salon brands and for me this one leaves my hair extremely clean without over drying it like others do. Even my 14 year old son loves it and my son is very picky on his shower items. I will and have repeat purchases i even signed up for it with subscribe and save since i am sure I&#x27;m sticking with this for a while.</li>
            <li> I previously have used the blue hello hydration Herbal Essences shampoo, but switch to Paul Mitchell because my scalp was sometimes breaking out a stylist recommended tea tree oil, and the Paul Mitchell one in particular. For the past several years, I&#x27;d been using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which is about 3-5x as expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought product this might be a good replacement for me, but after the first wash my scalp did not like it and broke out. I used my normal stuff for a few days and it went back to normal. I gave it a second try and had a similar but worse reaction. Through the rest of it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also previously tried a generic Sally Beauty Supply version of the Paul Mitchell stuff, and didn&#x27;t have any reactions really, just didn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well or smell as good. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the expensive stuff it looks like.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t lather well or clean well, garnier fructise is a much better alternative since it smells great ANDY washes well</li>
            <li> I actually searched for &amp;#34;tea tree shampoo&amp;#34; and bought this on a whim as the first thing that came up, the price was low and it was a small bottle, so I figured I could try it out and it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge bottle going to waste if I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;I usually love Herbal Essences smells, but the actual job that the shampoo does lacks results for me and I never buy their products. I spend quite a bit of time smelling and comparing shampoos in stores before choosing one, so buying one without knowing anything about it had me expecting a crappy shampoo. I actually almost cancelled but the order had already been started, and like I said, it was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;But surprise!!! The first use of this product had me hooked. For a tea tree oil shampoo, the smell is great. Sort of an apple-y light soapy smell. There is just enough tea tree oil in the product to feel the effect but not as much as Jason tea tree shampoos contain, or some of those other brands. First time users of tea tree oil are usually pretty sensitive to tea tree&#x27;s menthol-like effects, but I find that I barely feel it anymore after being a long time tea tree oil fanatic.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter used this one day, and her hair looked AMAZING!! we got both the conditioner and shampoo. I have oily/ wavy thick hair, one of my daughters has oily thin wavy hair, and my other daughter has curly thick but fine hair, and for each of us it works GREAT!! Our waves and curls aren&#x27;t weighed down, and our hair feels strong and soft, and our sensitive scalps are less itchy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to find it in a 32 oz container.</li>
            <li> This has a light, nice scent and leaves hair feeling and, more importantly, looking clean. There are better shampoos out there, but not many in this price range. This is especially true if you just want a basic cleansing shampoo with a light scent and aren&#x27;t expecting any miracles.</li>
            <li> This product contains sodium lauryl sulfate, the harsher of the two common surfactants used in shampoos. I am to blame for not reading the ingredients first, but I thought Herbal Essences had stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not like the smell very much.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It&#x27;s great for my fine hair - it cleans away any product/dirt/oil that tends to weigh it down. Paired with the conditioner, it&#x27;s a great combination for fine/thin hair!</li>
            <li> Smells great, and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, smells good and seems to clean well</li>
            <li> One of the best H E products out there! I loved the scent!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It cleans your hair without over drying it. I have oily hair and this works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and Drama Clean for a long time. I like it because its not too heavy, but cleans well. A lot of reviews say that they like Drama Clean better. Maybe I do not pay attention enough, but they seem similar to me. Tealightfully clean is more minty feeling. I like the minty feeling, its really refreshing on my scalp, especially since I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so good!!! It also makes my hair soft and not as dry!!!</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo twice since I have oily hair and leaving it on during the second time creates this tingly feeling on my head, which I really like.  When drying my hair outside the shower my head feels cool and tingly for a few minutes until it&#x27;s completely dry.  I wish the size of the bottle was bigger as the quantity of one bottle is probably good only for two or three weeks for me.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I wanted.  Great shampoo though.</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing and makes your scalp a little tingly!</li>
            <li> Great price and good travel shampoo</li>
            <li> This has worked successfully for over a year to control dandruff. It is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. I had to cancel after only one subscription. And I&#x27;m usually a fan of the &amp;#34;pure and simple&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; version of shampoos. Like other reviewers have said, it has a weird smell. Oddly enough, my husband liked the smell, so maybe this is marketed more towards men? It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft enough.</li>
            <li> love the way it leaves my hair feeling and the smell</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo. It does not leave your scalp oily, but clean and fresh. I have used it for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> Hair smells wonderful. Does it job and cleans it well.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing with a slight tingle</li>
            <li> I use Drama Clean shampoo and conditioner now, and added this to my routine. I don&#x27;t know why people think it&#x27;s menthol or heavy. It leaves no gunk behind nor is the fragrance offensive. In fact, as a body wash, it&#x27;s actually very cleansing but gentle. Perfect for summer. And I love the fragrance. It&#x27;s a little different than Drama Clean but very pleasant. Both clean hair without silicones or build-up as promised. If you&#x27;re used to creamy shampoo, this will feel dry as first but the conditioners fix that issue. I use them sparingly as leave-ins, and I don&#x27;t feel greasy or unclean. These are basic shampoos, not meant to moisturize or detangle.</li>
            <li> Daughter has gorgeous long hair and swears by this product.  Worth it in many ways.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.My hair feels so soft after using this.I have oily hair and it cleans well .I would definitely purchase this again.I just like how it clean and soft it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> Very light green tea scent, not enough to make you think you steeped your hair in a pot,but enough just be refreshing - surprisingly, like the description says. I&#x27;ve used this twice between uses with my normal shampoo and conditioner and is does seem to clear any build up. I have had no skin irritation either. My hair feels light and soft and the tea scent sort of floats around every time I run a brush through it.</li>
            <li> I really do love this. I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much, but I find that this works better than most &amp;#34;light clean&amp;#34; shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Contains Tea Tree Oil... does a nice job of really cleaning my hair and has a nice clean tingly feeling on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Like them will buy more</li>
            <li> I love the way this leave my hair and scalp feeling! My hair is super soft and I don&#x27;t notice any residue.</li>
            <li> The Tea-Tree oil is very refreshing and gives you a tingly refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> one of the few TeaTreeOil shampoos left - like to use this in the summer for ticks, lice, etc that tend to show up more in hotter weather on animals and at friend&#x27;s houses....</li>
            <li> But I also must reference the first review for this product. Every person is different. I know I&#x27;ve used other products that left me very unhappy because they do leave your hair feeling like you coated it with wax and it feels gummy. My long hair liked both the shampoo and conditioner for this product. Once again I&#x27;ll reference the smell mentioned in the first review. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell. But I know a lot of people have smell sensitivities and a lot of people might be unhappy with the smell because it does smell a bit medicine-y. The shampoo didn&#x27;t tingle for me. I put the shampoo on my scalp and my length but I only use conditioner on my length. The conditioner made my neck tingle. It was a bit surprising for me...didn&#x27;t really expect that. I didn&#x27;t mind but I know a lot of people might not like that tingling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the product because my hair looks shiny and feels soft. I&#x27;d have a buddy or family member willing to take it off your hands if you&#x27;re not happy with either product.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. One of the few remaining &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoos out there, great for oily hair.</li>
            <li> i dont like this line. i especially dont like the conditioner, which makes my head..um..tingle? that&#x27;s not normal. I have to use HUGE amounts of this versus other HE products to cover my hair. would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and brands of various types for 29 years and have never found something that works as well as this! OTHER shampoos either leave my hair brittle and straw-like, or don&#x27;t get my hair clean and leave my hair looking like it hasn&#x27;t even been washed at all (for several days!), and leave a greasy film on it. Tea-Lightfully Clean left my hair CLEAN and SOFT and SHINEY! The scent is a little different (it&#x27;s sort of minty), but it is not bad or offensive, and I got used to it quickly. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine like gold and so smooth.  Just kidding, got this for my girlfriend, she likes it.</li>
            <li> I love the formula in this product, it&#x27;s not too drying. It cleans my hair really well and it has a tingly effect due to the mint extract in the poo. I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy proteins and I can not deal with glycerin due to the matter that I&#x27;m from the South. So, thanks herbal essence for coming out with a silicone free and light formula.</li>
            <li> Tea-lightfully clean is delightful indeed! I love Herbal Essence! The scents are heavenly and it is a gentle shampoo causing no damage or wear yo my hair (drying it out and making it frizzy).</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find anywhere in stores. Great price.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Burned and made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shampoo.  It left my hair shiny, soft and there is no heavy build up.  It smells great and works wonderfully.  I didn&#x27;t get the tingling that some people were complaining about in the reviews.</li>
            <li> Not exactly as much tea tree smell as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Love Herbal Essences!!! Every product they make has a wonderful smell and this one is like the rest. Pleasent scent and leaves no residue behind!!</li>
            <li> Mostly like. Soothing cool. Aromatic. Less good than the same-brand shampoo, which was bottled into an old-fashioned bottle and sold in Europe. I compare this one to that one, so I expected more. :-)) still prefer this brand over others. Do recommend.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing feel and cleans well...although I am not sure I like the smell</li>
            <li> Leaves my husband&#x27;s hair feeling squeaky clean and fresh.  He has to switch shampoos every so often because of build up, and I stumbled upon this in the drug store.  Couldn&#x27;t find this particular one and fortunately found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is your basic, get the job done, sudsy shampoo. It is a mild tea smell and doesn&#x27;t have that burn that real tea shampoos have. If you want that tingle, you&#x27;ll probably have to invest a little more, but this does the job of cleaning some hair.</li>
            <li> Have used Drama Clean for years and love it.  Tried Tea-Lightfully Clean and there is no comparison.  Weights my hair down and it isn&#x27;t silky and shiny - kind of dull and lifeless.  Wish they would bring back Drama Clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this as much as I like the &amp;#34;Drama Clean&amp;#34; shampoo that this replaces, but it&#x27;s not terrible- it still leaves my hair very shiny and not weighed down. When I heard that Drama Clean was being discontinued, I started trying a bunch of others shampoos I heard was close and this is the closet I have come to Drama Clean. It&#x27;s just not quite as great as Drama Clean is/was. I still have half a bottle of Drama Clean left, and I am alternating days when I use it and use this (the Tea-Lightfully Clean) and I can tell when I use Drama Clean when my hair dries- it&#x27;s shiny, not weighed down, but also isn&#x27;t quite as fly-away. I have fairly fine, wavy hair, but a lot of it, so it can sort of stand on end instead of waving with certain shampoos. But I like my hair REALLY clean, squeaky clean in the shower, so it&#x27;s been a challenge to find a shampoo that really cleans my hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it looking like either a straw patch or like I stuck my finger in a socket. Drama Clean always did the trick for me. The Tea-Lightfully comes in a close second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope Herbal Essences re-release the Drama Clean, but until then, I&#x27;ll use the Tea-Lightfully Clean (with a few days of Prell thrown in here and there just to clarify.)</li>
            <li> Lightly and nice smelling</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells strongly of generic apple.  It&#x27;s a pleasant scent, just not at all what I was expecting.  I actually kinda like tea trea oil&#x27;s distinct woody/piney aroma, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have even a hint of it.  However, it cleans my hair well, so I don&#x27;t have any complaints....just a surprise smell!</li>
            <li> I have used Drama Clean for years because it was the only &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner that didn&#x27;t leave a waxy residue in my hair. I&#x27;m assuming this is the replacement/upgrade for Drama Clean since stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. But if you&#x27;re thinking if buying this, be warned that it is not the same. I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s called Tea-Lightfully; it should be called Menthol-Lightfully. I have long, normal hair, and after using this product, my shoulders, forehead and back feel like I put on Bengay cream. Not sure what ingredient is causing this &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation, but it makes me nervous to use the product. The aroma also evokes a menthol-like sensation in my chest. My hair feels OK but not as clean as it did with Drama Clean. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter&#x27;s favorite.  Clean.</li>
            <li> Great product and love the way it made my hair feel.  My hair had bounce again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shampoo for everyday use. My son likes it and asked to get ig again.</li>
            <li> Smells delightful and my hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel nice and squeaky clean. Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> Living in an extremely humid city, this is the only shampoo that gets my hair through the summer.  The formula is very light weight and smells fantastic.  Hair stays clean/dry for the whole day.  It is hard to find on local store shelves, so I am very glad I can get it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only tip I can offer is not to use the same line of conditioner with this shampoo. Combined, my hair gets dry and frail.  So, I use this shampoo to get my hair perfectly clean, then a heavier conditioner (like the long term relationship) to keep the hair sleek.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product, the smell was great. Though I had noticed my skin was getting drier and drier. Now that I&#x27;m halfway finish with this product.. There&#x27;s a news report about products containing methylchloroisothiazolinone will cause skin dryness. Not everyone will have this, unfortunately I&#x27;m one of those who do have effect to this chemical. I think I will be tossing out the remaining shampoo.

            <li> This shampoo is really light and smells awesome</li>
            <li> My hair never feels as clean as it does with this shampoo.  And without the stripped out dry feeling from other super cleansing shampoos.</li>
