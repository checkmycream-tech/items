            <li>/&gt;Since buying this product, I have found the best cleanser ever: Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser.</li>

            <li>It had a wonderful fresh scent to it as well.</li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love the price!</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>, thats for sure!</li>
            <li>They are refreshing!</li>
            <li>First off - the smell is delicious.</li>
            <li>but the face wash will be added as a house favorite on the shopping list!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it smells!</li>
            <li>First, the smell is so great!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this cleanser!</li>
            <li>LOVE this cleanser!</li>
            <li>I was able to wash in just a couple minutes and be done with it!</li>
            <li>I now know that I am going to be a customer for sure!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I definitely love the cleanser!</li>
            <li>love the wipes!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the scent-not too overpowering-but still pleasant.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing after I use it.</li>
            <li>It feels nice &amp; is affordable.</li>
            <li>It is also nice and creamy in texture</li>
            <li>I removed it by splashing then with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be nicely scented..nothing overbearing.</li>
            <li>THe consistency was nice.</li>
            <li>Nice quality product and scent.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I almost never get away with cleansing my skin and not having a rash.</li>
            <li>It lathered nicely</li>
            <li>The towelettes conveniently come in their own re-sealable pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I reached for the ultra convenient and equally effective towelettes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to say that the Pond&#x27;s is nice &#x60;for a drugstore product&#x27;, because I feel that if this were packaged and sold at a high-end counter, it could pass for a high-end branded product.</li>
            <li>By the time you finish a cycle, the cleanser has dispersed all over your face and made a nice cleansing buffer, and rinses away with no residue.</li>

            <li>By the time you finish a cycle, the cleanser has dispersed all over your face and made a nice cleansing buffer, and rinses away with no residue.</li>
            <li>Still, when my teenager tried it, she liked the feel of it, and if I were to keep buying it, she would use it.</li>
            <li>Nice creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li>That is my kind of face wash</li>
            <li>The towelettes are also nice for when you are on the go.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and well and very convenient, great for removing makeup too.</li>
            <li>Nice sized bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that the texture and the design of the cleaning cloths were better than most.</li>
            <li>I liked this a lot -</li>
            <li>I realized after I washed it off that it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I would have liked, but it did remove dirt and make-up.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser, nice fresh scent!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong for me, it has a nice, pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>This product works wonderful for older skin.  </li>
            <li>smell great, clean feeling, value</li>
            <li>The product has a creamy texture that lathers easily and its scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>While it is a pleasant, floral scent, it is a bit strong and causes my sinuses to itch some when I am using them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very pleasant, but not overbearing odor and felt very silky on my skin.</li>
            <li>After washing my face, I was happy to feel a cool refreshment to my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not overbearing in the slightest, and pleasant.</li>
            <li>this skin care line is that the towelettes have a very strong scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li>I liked it better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that my acne has started to clear up.</li>
            <li>Actually liked it more than my Elizabeth Grant cleanser.</li>
            <li>Just soft and wonderful!</li>
            <li>I LOVE how silky this product is, and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>It gives you that natural glow that you get when you are having one of your best days.  </li>
            <li>Both of these prodcuts are very refreshing and they smell amazing and leave ur skin so smooth</li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash had a great texture, it was silky, smooth, and felt nice rubbing in on my face.</li>
            <li>Its very light, yet clean and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and feels really great, the best part is althought its so gentle, it really was effective at removing traces of dirt &amp; maekup.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is great and if your looking for a great product, Pond&#x27;s is your choice.</li>
            <li>The cream cleanser was great for daily use and the towelettes are a great option if you&#x27;re in a rush or on the go.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED the Ponds Luminous Clean cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended as a good all-around cleanser; good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Another great factor about this product is it isn&#x27;t perfumey it has a mild clean smell to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, economic &amp; refreshing are the best words to describe this product!!</li>

            <li>I love it :-)</li>

            <li>I am so glad I was able to sample this product...</li>
            <li>but im glad I tried Ponds.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s no tightness afterwards like there can be with soap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not over the top about the scent though.</li>
            <li>Love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes out kind of opalescent and has a really smooth texture to it.  </li>

            <li>Even My pre-teen tried the product &amp; she also loves the refreshing feeling that it leaves.</li>
            <li>The Ponds Luminous Clean Towelettes are a great, quick tool for just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an iridescent wash that is more creamy than sudsy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I was really thinking I would love this product with all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>keep thinking that I should give it one more try, just to be sure--maybe the breakout was just a coincidence?</li>
            <li>Recently I tried the Luminous Cream Cleanser and was impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>but nothing, i also love the packages, for the towlettes ur able to close it</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way that it applies to my skin when I wash with it.</li>
            <li>routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cleansing towelettes are my favorite!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and the bottle is pretty in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin feels soft and bright!</li>
            <li>Could not find this anywhere in the stores and was very excited to find it online.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly, &amp; does not lather, but then, lather doesn&#x27;t clean anyway!!</li>
            <li>I used the Ponds Luminous Clean face wash this morning, and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s produced a nice luminous cleanser that will leave one&#x27;s skin feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>A great value compared to some of the high end cleansers.</li>
            <li>It rinses very clean like soap</li>
            <li>I will never just use a bar soap to clean my face because it does not leave my face feeling nice and clean like PONDS luminous cream does!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would have to say I am very pleased with this product, and it&#x27;s worth a try, for both men and women..........</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant but there&#x27;s an underlying scent that I don&#x27;t care for too much.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, washes off clean and removed all makeup easily.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and feels so smooth on your face.</li>
            <li>First off I loved the smell of the product, it wasn&#x27;t too strong or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I use the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser both in and out of the shower!  </li>
            <li>Another fine note is the fantastic smell!</li>
            <li>It left my face clean, moisturized and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>I received this product as a sample via bzzagent,Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cleanser left my skin feeling wonderful</li>
            <li>The product has a nice smell, goes on smoothly, and makes your face feel squeaky clean without any dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smells, and while this product is scented, it&#x27;s very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of strong (not unpleasant though) in the packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes eye makeup which was an unexpected but welcome</li>
            <li>We would like to order more than 5 at a time and how about free shipping?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented now, but the old scent was so great.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I was oil free for most of the day and in the morning it made my face feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and always am hesitant about using things on my face, and this product was great...</li>
            <li>It goes on very creamy and the smell is light, but pleasant.</li>
            <li>So smooth and rich - and left my skin feeling so wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 77 years old with very nice skin</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and very clean.</li>
            <li>It was passed to my sister who does not have the same problem as me and she loved it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The odor is very mild and not ojectionable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and non pore-clogging, so</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product -- it gets my skin clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>I love Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I like the availibility of being able to clean my face on the go, since I go to the gym..</li>
            <li>They have been very mild on my face</li>
            <li>The towelettes removes waterproof mascara easily and doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume smell that can irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li>The Pond&#x27;s cleanser worked wonderfully on my combination skin, the dry patches were moisturized (but I did need to apply a moisturizer after this product still) and the oily areas stayed moist but not oily even 24 hours after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser</li>
            <li>, it gets all the makeup off, and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>But once applied to the face, the scent is not bothersome at all and does not seem as strong anymore.</li>
            <li>They even travel with me right in my purse! :)</li>
            <li>Ponds has shockingly surprised me because honestly I couldn&#x27;t find a reason to not like it!  </li>
            <li>I rarely use drug store type face products, whether it be make-up or cleansers, so imagine my surprise when I actually liked the results from using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was able to try the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Cream Cleanser as well as the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Towlettes for free through bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>I loved this new face wash.</li>
            <li>I usually use L&#x27;Oreal age perfect cleanser which I love</li>
            <li>Cream Cleanser went on smooth and came off easily during rinsing.</li>
            <li>and this is fine with me.</li>
            <li>Even though the towelettes took most of my make-up off, I would still do a quick wash with the Ponds cleansing cream.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, love it!</li>
            <li>This product had a wonderful light scent to it and left my skin with a more natural glow!!  </li>
            <li>This product had a wonderful light scent to it and left my skin with a more natural glow!!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this new Pond&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>Good cleanser, removes all my makeup, doesnt leave skin tight ,and despite its wonderful scent hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin and roseacea.</li>
            <li>It does such a great job taking off makeup, including mascara, without drying my skin.  </li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is great for my skin.</li>
            <li>, I wish ponds would make it available in stores.</li>
            <li>This is a smooth and relaxing cleansing lotion packaged in a tube.  </li>
            <li>smooth and cleansing.  </li>
            <li>cleanse my face without drying it, and leaving it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I used this cream cleanser along with the towelettes available in this skin care line.</li>
            <li>This  product is fabulous</li>
            <li>I also used it with full makeup on instead of starting with an eye makeup remover, and it did a wonderful job of removing my eye makeup while still feeling really gentle!  </li>
            <li>: I tried this product free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was given both the creamy cleanser and the towelettes free from BzzAgent.com to use and review.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in your purse or bag and have on hand when you need to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t still smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li>It has a creamy consistency and feels really smooth when it&#x27;s applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li>how light it felt.  </li>
            <li>The texture was smooth, and lathered well.</li>
            <li>received this item for free to try as a bzzagent.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the fresh scent...</li>
            <li>Since I am a BzzAgent, I got this product free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>They are not just a smooth cloth that wipes off your make-up; it has a texture to it that cleans your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, to balance things out I&#x27;ve been alternating between Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free acne wash and the Pond&#x27;s Luminous to keep my skin acne free and also moisturized.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li>I think it would be good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price wise, the MAC Cremewash is $5.88 an ounce (I order directly from MAC to avoid fakes).</li>
            <li>It also has a nice soft scent which I love.</li>
            <li>I am not typically a fan of these products because they lack the sudsy, foamy, scrubbing bubbles and tends to leave my skin with that not so clean feeling....but not this one!!!  </li>
            <li>it does a good job leaving your skin feeling very soft after you wash, however if you have a face full of makeup</li>
            <li>It gives you a cool, clean &amp; refreshing feeling while working to brighten &amp; cool your skin.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good end-of-the-day make up remover or quick cleaner before putting on new makeup.</li>
            <li>I loved the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and it made my face feel soft and had a heathy glow to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fairly faithful user of Clean and Clear cleansers of the years.</li>
            <li>although I like the more moisturizing components of them I often feel as though they can leave a film or not give me that fresh, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell was fresh, clean and fabulous!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, fresh scent and you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it.</li>
            <li>It has a light, clean smell.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and leaves my skin feeling silky and clean afterward.</li>
            <li>Feels great &amp; creamy, washes off easily, &amp; leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the wash, my face felt clean, smooth and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Removed even the most stubborn eye makeup and a full day&#x27;s worth of grime from my sensitive/breakout prone skin.  </li>
            <li>However, When I applied it, I found it easy to rub in and to quickly penetrate to remove the makeup and days dust.</li>
            <li>I want something quick, easy, and doesn&#x27;t have a million steps.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>They are great to quickly take off my makeup before bed, or simply refresh my face in the morning!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited that I&#x27;ve found something that works for me!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer</li>
            <li>The towelettes are great when you are in a hurry or had a long day.</li>
            <li>Just put some on your hand about the size of a dime, add water and you&#x27;ve got yourself a nice, sudsy cleaner that leaves your face feeling smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>My face is softer and feels fresh!</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my bzz agent bzzkit.  </li>
            <li>However, I was really excited to try the products</li>
            <li>The difference in your skin after even just a few days is amazing!!</li>
            <li>My face feels so refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>It removes all traces of foundation-makeup at night when I apply it to a wash cloth then clean face.</li>
            <li>It also takes make up off better than anything else, and so far its been safe to take off my eye</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 1mth now and have seen a difference in the tone of my skin, it leaves skin clean and refreshed without over drying.  </li>
            <li>I received the luminous clean cream cleanser and towelettes as part of a Bzzkit for Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>let alone really clean my face without leaving it feeling like a</li>
            <li>When I received the package with the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Towelettes</li>
            <li>I tried the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean cleanser &amp; towelettes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face and does a great job removing make-up.</li>
            <li>ponds line surpassed its promises of clean and radiant skin...</li>
            <li>It lathers well and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li>my skin but it removes makeup &amp; made my skin feel clean wo overdrying it.</li>
            <li>I decided to give Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash and cleansing towelettes</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean</li>
            <li>Before I started to use this product I use to just use soap and water to clean my face...</li>
            <li>Having breakout-prone skin, I&#x27;m always looking for products that leave my face noticeably clean.</li>
            <li>i absoutely loved the ponds luminous clean cream cleanser and the luminous clean weat cleansing towlettes, with the cream cleanser its so soft on ur skin and it just makes ur face feel like u were just at the spa fresh and with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the pond&#x27;s clean cream cleanser</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent, foams just enough while using, and does not clump up.</li>
            <li>I use acne medicine that dries out my face but most moisturizing cleansers give me more acne--this one doesn&#x27;t break me out at all, and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out and in fact makes my skin softer and more supple.</li>
            <li>Certainly like it better than the Olay</li>
            <li>Certainly like it better than the Olay</li>
            <li>So I was happy when I received the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Wet Cleaning Towelettes.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not so much that it will stop me from using the product or rating it lower than 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;After using both the cleanser &amp; the towelettes consistently for 5 days I&#x27;m seeing a nice difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I will never use another face cleaner, this one is a full package..</li>
            <li>I just wanted to get a good deep cleaning</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the feel of it on my face and felt it was moisturizing and gentle.  </li>
            <li>The towlettes are of good size and were tried before and also after I cleaned my face with my regular cleanser.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is fairly creamy, so takes a bit of extra rinsing (or use a washcloth to get it all).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to do the two cycles I really need, without irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to do the two cycles I really need, without irritation.</li>
            <li>This is a low cost product, so that&#x27;s always good.  </li>
            <li>The ponds cleanser does have clay in it, so just make sure you rinse it really well.</li>
            <li>really like the cleansing cloths, I love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d notice a feeling of this tingling sensation on my face and, not a bad feeling a smoothing sensation so</li>
            <li>For consumers that have used other notable brands of cleanser, Pond&#x27;s is comparable, especially because of the beautiful scent and the satisfying results.</li>
            <li>Its not oily or abrasive and washes off pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty, convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling fresh and clean and it has a nice light, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin and finding a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me red and itchy is quite a feat.</li>
            <li>but his skin was very smooth and also looked cleaner than normal.</li>
            <li>fresh, clean skin and all eye make up removed with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather mild.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but somehow after I bought it at Walmart 1 year ago, I cannot find it in local stores any more.  </li>
            <li>I love the gentle fresh smell of this cleaner.  </li>
            <li>After using it my skin felt soft and smooth for many hours.</li>
            <li>has a wonderful smell as well as a very convenient bottle with the opening at the bottom, the product always comes out smoothly no need to shake and shake trying to get it</li>
            <li>Well, the nice, thick foamy, creamy texture is almost FUN to play with while you rub it all over your face and the scent is quite pleasant and not over-bearing.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using it very much.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was its light, fresh, and clean scent.</li>
            <li>Luminous clean goes on sooth and make your face feel clean after the first use.</li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s knocked the ball right out of the park with their Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Softer, more balanced, fewer dry patches, less redness &amp; my psoriasis spots have calmed down as well.&lt;br /&gt;Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser makes me a happy girl with happy skin!</li>
            <li>I also love that it freshens the bristles on my Clarisonic&#x27;s brush head; normally I have to wash the brush</li>
            <li>I also love that it freshens the bristles on my Clarisonic&#x27;s brush head; normally I have to wash the brush</li>
            <li>(he was so thrilled :-P) to see if his normal skin would get dried out at all</li>
            <li>The wet cleansing towelettes left the same refreshing, clean feeling as the cream cleanser but are more convienent when in a hurry or just needing a quick refresher - would be perfect to throw in a gym bag.</li>
            <li>:  I love the fact that the cream cleanser comes in an easy to squeeze tube like bottle that stands up side down with a flip top cap, so there will never be a struggle to get the cleanser out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite cleanser</li>
            <li>I was less happy with the results, though.</li>
            <li>It rinsed off clean, and my face felt super soft and clean!</li>
            <li>The cleansing cream allowed me to get a deep and refreshing cleaning!</li>
            <li>I am constantly fighting dry skin but after using this my skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s nice and smooth and just generally feels much better than regular soap.</li>
            <li>I am lucky enough to be a bzz agent and was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products</li>
            <li>The first time I used the cleanser and rinsed it off my face felt as clean as if I had just used a scrub.  </li>
            <li>I have been stuck on one certain face wash for over 10 years and every time I buy a new one it never compares to my first love!</li>
            <li>My face is really oily and certain soaps and face cleaners I can not use, but I really love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice smell, a little girly, but not terrible.</li>
            <li>Good foaming creamy effective cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, but seems to clean it thoroughly, and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin!</li>
            <li>It works great and cleans my face well everyday.</li>
            <li>It is a light gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t irritate me when I go to bed after cleaning my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks again to Bzz agent as well as thanks to Pond&#x27;s for creating such a great product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I have been pleased so far.</li>
            <li>As far as the claims of making my skin more lumonious..</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome-very fresh and feminine.  </li>
            <li>but it would be nice if these came in smaller packaging.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin and leaves me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>The towelettes I found useful to remove eye make-up and pre-clean my face before showering.</li>
            <li>Anyone wanting a nice creamy cleanser, that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, I would recommend the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean line.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser washes away easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>and I like the soft, refreshing scent it has.</li>
            <li>love Ponds - have been using their products forever - this especially leaves my skin smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>still worth noting, the cream leaked into the cap when stored vertically (standing upright with the cap on the bottom).</li>
            <li>They have the same great scent and the towelettes are soft.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>He said his skin felt soft and looked healthy.  </li>
            <li>there for I rarely use any face cleansers.</li>
            <li>It might be great for people with oily skin, but for normal or dry skin, I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the floral fragrance; it was a welcome after dealing with other products that definitely had a \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smell to them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great simple cream cleanser that left my face feeling fresh, toned and clean.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean but leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling very clean, and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>to the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean line, I can now say that I have clean, clear and well moisturized skin!</li>
            <li>I had the biggest pimple on my face right beteew</li>
            <li>I think I am still going to try again, but right now this is a so-so product for me.</li>
            <li>but they were not the right one for me.</li>
            <li>That convinced me instantly that this face wash is pretty spectacular at removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it every morning in the shower and my skin feels soft, and moisturized and clean!</li>
            <li>but, more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used several difference facial cleansers and this is by far one of the best!  </li>
            <li>Frothed up nicely and left my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other pond&#x27;s cleansers &amp; they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Would be good for anyone with normal, dry, or combination skin, however might be good for someone with oily skin due to the Kaolin Clay.</li>
            <li>Many other cleaners smell like chemicals or strong perfumes.  </li>
            <li>This cream cleanser is very mild and has a soft scent.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and super soft.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my face feeling clean and fresh and my skin feels so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean products to others.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>So, I believe that I&#x27;m going to like this very much.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle yet works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream cleanser has a light, clean, feminine scent that simply enhances the beauty ritual of face cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I love the clay ingredient added for extra smoothness.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use products of Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it seems I cannot locate it anywhere locally.</li>
            <li>I will gladly endorse this entire line of products.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>After the first use (of the cleanser) I was pretty convinced that this product wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li>I found this cleanser to work pretty well for my skin.</li>
            <li>After the first day, I felt a difference in the texture of my skin, and my skin itself felt revitalized.</li>
            <li>I would use the towelettes first to remove any makeup, then apply the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t deny that I got real results this time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results: I was a bit frightened at first because I was beginning to breakout a bit during the first week.  </li>
            <li>After using it I found that it basically just sat on top of my skin and didn&#x27;t do the deep cleaning that my face needs.</li>
            <li>the facial cleanser is an OK cleanser does the job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found something way better and,the cost is lesser.</li>
            <li>and I love starting my day off using the cream cleanser in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>So with the Pond&#x27;s I have to first use an eye makeup remover, and then follow up with the Pond&#x27;s cleanser.</li>
            <li>After 2 days, I squeezed the cream into a jar (more like traditional Pond&#x27;s containers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Id use it again but definitely not going to think its going to give me better skin.</li>
            <li>As a mom of two kiddos and a military wife who is often on her own, I don&#x27;t have the time or energy for that.</li>
            <li>The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this cleanser is the smell.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that there&#x27;s a tightness to your face for a minute or so afterwards.</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I think it&#x27;s a sign of a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>The texture is thick and creamy and you don&#x27;t need a lot; it provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>I have tried many facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li>Soft scent, and smooth cream.  </li>
            <li>At first I did like it.</li>
            <li>In fact, my face felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Although to be fair, I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li>Add just a little bit to your face then put warm water on a wash rag and it suds up so much making your face feel squeaky clean after wards.</li>
            <li>It definitely did not dry it out and during the winter, and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I used Ponds for many years before changing to Clinique and later to Clean and Clear.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Pond&#x27;s product but have always heard positive things about the brand.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling refreshed and very clean.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be perfect for camping too (or just when I&#x27;m too lazy to actually wash my face haha).</li>
            <li>other night I used the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash for the first time and not only did it clean my face brilliantly, my clarisonic brush head was white again as if it were new.</li>
            <li>There are no harsh scents which really helped me to enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Radiant is not the word for how my face feels, it is so soft and looks like it has a amazing glow, which was not there prior to using ponds.</li>
            <li>and I think it is too soon to tell however, my skin feels clean and soft and I know that ponds have been around for years infact</li>
            <li>Leaves my face clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when my Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products arrived in the mail.  </li>
            <li>, it felt so soft and purely clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin also felt clean and soft, no dryness or tightness.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It has helped my skin to feel clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>I switched from a foaming gel cleanser, which seemed a little hash and was very satisfied with this cream cleanser.</li>
            <li>gives you a deep clean feeling with a fresh feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li>After using the product my face feels very soft and moisturized, not dry like from most products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately we are not troubled with acne or big breakouts, so all I can say for this Pond&#x27;s cleanser is that it maintains our skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better and does not look dry.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle, i have very sensitive skin and had no irritation with this product!</li>
            <li>It was super gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my face was not left dry and flaky or with a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I was hesitant to try this cleanser at first, but immediately after using the cleanser for the first time, I noticed that it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>A little dab will do ya with this great facial cleaner!!!</li>
            <li>I really must say that I always associated Ponds with older women!</li>
            <li>With cleansers it is hard to tell how good they really are.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly a huge step above hand soap, which has been resorted to on occasion, and your face feels like sandpaper afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However they work, they do work, really well.</li>
            <li>It really removes your makeup (even mascara) while you wash your face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>this worked really well for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>When i recieved it, it was packaged really well.</li>
            <li>This face wash met my standards, I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to face wash.</li>
            <li>This cream cleanser left my skin feeling super soft and clean without the tightness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, while it gently cleanses and detoxes your skin.</li>
            <li>: Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>and I really like them.  </li>
            <li>I feel the information on the website as well as packaging is very informative and answered all of my questions regarding performance and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Pond&#x27;s for letting me try it.</li>
            <li>I really like this Ponds luminous cleanser.</li>
            <li>but I do really like it.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is gentle, yet removes make-up without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>This cream cleanser really is the creamiest I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>she said that the skin cleaner worked really well.  </li>
            <li>The cream cleaner is a generous 6oz size and very creamy.</li>
            <li>you can see how hydrating and gentle it will be.</li>
            <li>I really felt like my skin was glowing and radiant.</li>
            <li>and it really cleaned my skin.</li>
            <li>It cleaned out my pours and really opened them up.</li>
            <li>Every face wash dries my face out too much and makes it peeling and pimply.</li>
            <li>Used this product yesterday and I found it comparable to products that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so gentle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so gentle</li>
            <li>Really does remove all my makeup in one wash.</li>
            <li>I have very oil skin which may be why this irritates it.</li>
            <li>It has a silky smooth texture (which I was not expecting, because it contains clay) and left my skin feeling soft, fresh, and...</li>
            <li>The product is very creamy out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>very</li>
            <li>It really cleaned my skin and helped unify it to one creamy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much of a lather with this cleanser</li>
            <li>But I really feel no desire to use this product again.</li>
            <li>and u get 30 which is like a whole months supply.</li>
            <li>I really like the softness of the product.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you might feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>I recently joined bzzagent and that is a group where you get to try products for free and let people know what you think.</li>
            <li>and I really like the creamy texture and</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very creamy.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser works well, even removing waterproof mascara, but it&#x27;s kind of messy, so I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I received the ponds luminous facial cleanser and wipes from BzzAgent for review:I am loving the pond&#x27;s luminous facial wipes.....</li>
            <li>I really liked the Pond&#x27;s Cream Cleanser - it left my skin feeling soft and smooth, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my face like my normal face wash does.</li>
            <li>I have a real problem with irritation after a shower, this isn&#x27;t a cure but its definitely much better than the other things I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I only needed a dime size to clean my whole face.</li>
            <li>You only need a dime sized amount to clean your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quite unlike most any other drugstore cleansers I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took off everything my normal cleanser didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>Plus, there isn&#x27;t any dried-out feeling that I have gotten with so many other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many other face cleanser</li>
            <li>This is nice, but isn&#x27;t enough to make me switch from my regular Cetaphil for sensitive skin, I really prefer a gentle, gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>face is left feeling squeaky clean yet not dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to wash my face several times to get it to feel clean.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a visible reduction in the number of blackheads and it has left my face feeling clean and reinvigorating.</li>
            <li>After using the product, it left my skin feeling clean, and refresh.</li>
            <li>Every cream cleanser I&#x27;ve tried has left my skin feeling sticky and not all that clean.</li>
            <li>The face wash left my face feeling clean without a filmy residue.</li>
            <li>I have been using CeraVe products for my face, but recently tried the Ponds luminous clean cream cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Not only does my face feel clean, it feels silky after washing and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since I started using it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very simple and clean looking as well.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use very much to clean my entire face.</li>
            <li>The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser left my face with a radiant glow.</li>
            <li>it left my skin clean without any feelings of tightness or dryness.</li>
            <li>the wipes are better than any other brand I have tried---definitely a product i plan on using for as long as available.....</li>
            <li>Really like this cleanser and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser for about a week and half, and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, and it left my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve also been great for a quick refresh if my skin is feeling dirty on a make up-free day.</li>
            <li>The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean line left my face feeling fresh, not dry.</li>
            <li>time I open it, the cap is full of product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased upon first trying the product, noting that the texture was very creamy and soft unlike my previous facial washes.  </li>
            <li>This product is not only making my face clean and soft, but my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s face is clearing from acne, and is soft and clean now.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin because it does not contain any harsh beads or rough exfoliants and yet my skin had a gorgeous, radiant glow!</li>
            <li>so I really like this new cleanser from Ponds.</li>
            <li>Can actually say it does make skin luminous if massaged for 30 seconds or more after a weeks use noticed less roseacea bumps and soft smooth texture with a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li>The Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser does get my face clean without a dry after feeling, but I can&#x27;t exactly same</li>
            <li>I always thought it worked decent with my combination skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommed this product to anyone with a dry/oily skin combination who is looking for a change from the smelly, overpriced, burning products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My face felt fresher and it made my face a little more brighter.</li>
            <li>I have tried the ponds cream cleanser and after using it for a few days I felt more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Cleans the face nicely, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out like other products and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t dry after the wash and it feels sooo clean.</li>
            <li>it worked as a normal soap, I did not feel any difference on my face.</li>
            <li>Also the Wet Cleansing Towelettes and they removed my eye makeup very well and had no bad reactions to either product even on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am a heavy makeup user, and I also have combination type skin, so finding a product that can remove all residual makeup without drying me out is sometimes challenging.</li>
            <li>Now after a week of not using this product my face has returned to normal.</li>
            <li>Sort of like spring flowers mixed with a fresh ocean breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a new find - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER its a pretty decent cream facial wash.</li>
            <li>but before long, I noticed the same tightness, burning and red spots that appear after I use any kind of soap on my face.</li>
            <li>This was a new experience for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a retired makeup artist so like to try new things when it comes to skincare...</li>
            <li>Trying this new \\&quot;Luminous</li>
            <li>Again I do not see any brightness that is new</li>
            <li>While this product is the new kid on the block, Pond&#x27;s has been a trust brand for years.  </li>
            <li>It does, however live up to the promise of &#x27;drawing out impurities.&#x27;</li>
            <li>The New Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and the Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes is a must have..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the scent was less strong and perfumed.</li>
            <li>washing it goes on smoothly, rinses cleanly and did not make my skin feel dry, greasy or tight.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>tried this product for two weeks alongside the towelettes and was very surprised that it did, in face, brighten my skin some.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>creamy cleanser works quite well to dissolve make-up and oil and leave your skin squeaky clean, but not tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>I do use makeup remover first, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li>my face has a natural glow,the cream cleanser has the texture of a Mask or Clay but not as heavy, when on the face,I love the soft scent (it&#x27;s not a overwhelming scent)I love</li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses, I was totally grossed out by the amount of gunk in my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised!</li>
            <li>I usually do not care for cream cleansers because they leave a filmy residue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been spending a lot more money on name brand expensive products, and they have not been providing the results I&#x27;ve seen &amp; felt with Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helpful for filling the $35 free s&amp;h requirement when buying other items!</li>
            <li>After rinsing, I noticed that my face felt a little dry, but my everyday moisturizer quickly fixed that, and my skin was left with a lovely glow that I loved.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, but not as mild as normal cold cream.  </li>
            <li>In every other area, the Pond&#x27;s product is just as nice as the more expensive MAC cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this cleanser because I&#x27;ve really liked the daily exfoliating cleanser in this same line, and it seemed like the two would complement each other well.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel silky smooth and less oily.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough to feel luxurious but lathers enough to be clean and  fulfilling.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how moisturized and soft my face looked and felt after only the first use.</li>
            <li>A little bit of lotion and everything was all fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a facial mask going on your skin than a typical cleanser, which makes me feel like I&#x27;m being pampered.</li>
            <li>When first applying a small portion of the cream, the undeniable fresh scent that automatically comes from the contents of the medium tube invigorates the senses with a variety of floral fragrances leaving a lasting impression after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I recently until now  was using the Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser wasn&#x27;t really happy with it because it made my face dry and felt tight after washing my face, and had dry patches.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of face wash and used to think the ones with the scrubbers (that are so bad for your pores) were the only ones that made my face feel clean, but Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash changed my mind!</li>
            <li>The POND&#x27;S luminous cream cleanser left my skin feeling clean without it being too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li>I never have skin breakouts, so it clearly cleans my skin well.</li>
            <li>You do not want to get this near your eyes.</li>
            <li>Rinses off completely.  </li>
            <li>It completely took off all makeup, including foundation and waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>It offers no miracles but provides what I need it to do....</li>
            <li>and it made my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>If you have seriously sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin just felt so soft after every use.</li>
            <li>The cream is a white pearly color and gently foams when rubbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have definitely shared this gem with friends and family who are looking for an affordable skin care system  with high quality results!</li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this for anyone sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Pond&#x27;s product rather surprised me......</li>
            <li>/&gt;The towelettes were soft and not abrasive.  </li>
            <li>After three days of using both of these Pond&#x27;s products my11 year old son came up to me and said.\\&quot; Mom are you getting lighter or something\\</li>
            <li>On my second bottle thanks to those results.</li>
            <li>she gave some to her young neice, ( who triles on the make-up )  </li>
            <li>my skin is glowing (a bit too old for that).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate at all and made my face feel really soft after.</li>
            <li>but it has done no harm to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am not the type of person who wants to wash my face every night, adding an extra 15 minutes to my nightly routine.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>it does not take it all off completely.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, &amp; these work like a charm.  </li>
            <li>My skin can be sensitive and this did not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>It works well but is sensitive to my skin.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>how it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>way\\&quot; I&#x27;ve have, had problem with acne and dark spots,I used this products for about five days now,not even a full week</li>
            <li>The cleanser is nice because a little bit goes a long ways so it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough to use as an eye makeup remover and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out</li>
            <li>But if you have dry skin then this is really for you, It does make my skin feel very soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li>The towelettes have the same light fragrance with a pre-moistened, pre-portioned, slightly textured soft cloth that creates and effortless and thoughtless face cleansing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t love about this product was that my skin was a tad dry, which is to be expected for my type of skin if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer immediately.  </li>
            <li>I am particular about the facial cleansers that I use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using the towelettes to take my make up off at the end of a busy work day when I am too lazy to wash my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a cleaner that spoils you and cleans at the same time!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the amount of make up that my old cleanser left on my face!!</li>
            <li>The soft white Kaolin clay really helped get the dirt and impurities from my pores and left my face radiant.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was, pull out the wet cleansing towelettes and start wiping my face.</li>
            <li>The cleanser left my face a bit tight and dry, but I can easily moisturize for a cleanser which works this well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, a tube will last a LONG TIME as you don&#x27;t need very much at all....</li>
            <li>After using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Wet Cleansing Towelettes, my combination skin was left feeling softer, smoother, clearer, and glowing with smaller pores.  </li>
            <li>The cream cleanser is \\&quot;enriched with moisturizing ingredients and soft white Kaolin clay: a natural mineral known to act like a magnet to draw out deep-dwelling impurities.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It cleaned my face and left me with skin as soft as my 8 month old.</li>
            <li>It also left my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Most face cleansers tend to dry my skin out and leave my face feeling tight (especially during the winter)</li>
            <li>It washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and not full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll never go back to my old one!</li>
            <li>At first I thought that the cleansing towelettes and the cream cleanser were just like all the other products out there.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the heavy cold cream for which Pond&#x27;s became famous; it&#x27;s a light, gentle cleanser to use after you&#x27;ve removed your makeup.</li>
            <li>The cream felt light as I put it on and wasn&#x27;t hard to wash off either.</li>
            <li>It removed all make-up with minimal left under my eye (could easily remove with a Q-Tip) just like every other cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li>It really is starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>I usually only use proactive on my face because I have adult acne</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and getting moisture.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and moist, removed makeup well.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Pond&#x27;s product I have tried, and I was heartily surprised at what a quality product this is.</li>
            <li>When I read that this has clay in it, I expected that it would be very drying since that is what clay does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soothing cream that leaves my skin feeling hydrated &amp; soft &amp; actually brighter!</li>
            <li>It barely foams at all</li>
            <li>texture of the cleanser is silky, reminds me of said old school cleanser that used to come in a blue jar.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>And after I use it, I can definitely say that my skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  totally recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a little water and building the lather before you put it on your face, you use less product and it seems to work more effectively this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have older skin, and it&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip it dry, or make it feel tight, itchy, flaky, you name it.</li>
            <li>You can feel the clay in it and there is a slight grainy texture that is a very gentle exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely crazy for both the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Luminous Clean Towelettes.</li>
            <li>I was excited to open it and shocked, frankly that these were NOT any small sample sizes, but 4 very large full size items to keep and use for myself!!  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin, so dry skin after use was a surprise.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is needed to work up a rich lather on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser for the past five days as part of my daily showering routine.  </li>
            <li>This would be something my family would buy, knowing how clean it gets our faces.. especially with teenage daughters who may not clean their faces like they should!</li>
            <li>Not oily, not dry, and not blotchy.</li>
            <li>and I have been using a far more expensive cleaner</li>
            <li>It smells flowery which scared me a little at first</li>
            <li>I think the combination of both cleansers, instead of just plain soap in the evening, was somehow too much for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Ponds Cold Cream and Deep Cleanser for nearly 2 decades, so I was pleased to try this new product.</li>
            <li>it was red and blotchy in general</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and use Philosopy purity cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I waited a few days and tried again, and the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li>When I first found &amp; purchased this cleanser in the local discount big-box store a few years ago, it was only $3.99...</li>
            <li>I usually prefer a daily scrub because I&#x27;ve always felt that was the only way I could get my face to feel this fresh</li>
            <li>so you really felt it work into your skin and my skin, which typically gets very dry immediately after washing, felt soft and not tight or dry at all after.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, but use this cleanser daily without any irritation.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Since buying this product, I have found the best cleanser ever: Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser.</li>
            <li> It was very smooth and silky!  </li>
            <li> It had a wonderful fresh scent to it as well.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this face wash and plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> They shine as a grab-and-go wipe if you like to start fresh any time during the day - making them absolutely perfect in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> The smell is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It has an awesome fresh smell that I love!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love the price!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> , thats for sure!</li>
            <li> They are refreshing!</li>
            <li> First off - the smell is delicious.</li>
            <li> but the face wash will be added as a house favorite on the shopping list!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way it smells!</li>
            <li> First, the smell is so great!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleanser!</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I was able to wash in just a couple minutes and be done with it!</li>
            <li> I now know that I am going to be a customer for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I definitely love the cleanser!</li>
            <li> love the wipes!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the scent-not too overpowering-but still pleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after I use it.</li>
            <li> It feels nice &amp; is affordable.</li>
            <li> It is also nice and creamy in texture</li>
            <li> I removed it by splashing then with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be nicely scented..nothing overbearing.</li>
            <li> THe consistency was nice.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product and scent.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I almost never get away with cleansing my skin and not having a rash.</li>
            <li> It lathered nicely</li>
            <li> The towelettes conveniently come in their own re-sealable pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I reached for the ultra convenient and equally effective towelettes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to say that the Pond&#x27;s is nice &#x60;for a drugstore product&#x27;, because I feel that if this were packaged and sold at a high-end counter, it could pass for a high-end branded product.</li>
            <li> By the time you finish a cycle, the cleanser has dispersed all over your face and made a nice cleansing buffer, and rinses away with no residue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to say that the Pond&#x27;s is nice &#x60;for a drugstore product&#x27;, because I feel that if this were packaged and sold at a high-end counter, it could pass for a high-end branded product.</li>
            <li> By the time you finish a cycle, the cleanser has dispersed all over your face and made a nice cleansing buffer, and rinses away with no residue.</li>
            <li> Still, when my teenager tried it, she liked the feel of it, and if I were to keep buying it, she would use it.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li> That is my kind of face wash</li>
            <li> The towelettes are also nice for when you are on the go.  </li>
            <li> Great smell and well and very convenient, great for removing makeup too.</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that the texture and the design of the cleaning cloths were better than most.</li>
            <li> I liked this a lot -</li>
            <li> I realized after I washed it off that it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I would have liked, but it did remove dirt and make-up.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, nice fresh scent!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong for me, it has a nice, pleasant smell to it.</li>

            <li> smell great, clean feeling, value</li>
            <li> The product has a creamy texture that lathers easily and its scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> While it is a pleasant, floral scent, it is a bit strong and causes my sinuses to itch some when I am using them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very pleasant, but not overbearing odor and felt very silky on my skin.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I was happy to feel a cool refreshment to my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, not overbearing in the slightest, and pleasant.</li>
            <li> this skin care line is that the towelettes have a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li> I liked it better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that my acne has started to clear up.</li>
            <li> Actually liked it more than my Elizabeth Grant cleanser.</li>
            <li> Just soft and wonderful!</li>
            <li> I LOVE how silky this product is, and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> It gives you that natural glow that you get when you are having one of your best days.  </li>
            <li> Both of these prodcuts are very refreshing and they smell amazing and leave ur skin so smooth</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash had a great texture, it was silky, smooth, and felt nice rubbing in on my face.</li>

            <li> It goes on so smoothly and feels really great, the best part is althought its so gentle, it really was effective at removing traces of dirt &amp; maekup.</li>

            <li> I was able to get this really amazing product for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after washing with the cleanser.</li>
            <li> The difference in this cleaner and most is the smell.  </li>
            <li> so I made sure to follow up with moisturizer after each cleansing.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my skin clear, feels great and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light, floral scent.</li>
            <li> I love how the cream is not oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> , my face feels and looks more radiant :)  </li>
            <li> my nose and lip area (what a better time to arrive in mail),as well as makeup to cover the pimple.</li>
            <li> but you look light in a nice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know about Pond&#x27;s and how great their products really are, I don&#x27;t need a monthly subscription that&#x27;ll cost me $400.00 a year.</li>
            <li> After just two weeks of using this product my skin feels smoother and looks more even than before.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the consistency of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> love using the towelettes at night to take off any makeup before bed</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell or act like a drugstore cleanser, and I&#x27;d even say that I like this better than a lot of the high-end cleansers I have tried.</li>
            <li> : This cleanser is FABULOUS to use with a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> and I love how it leaves my face.</li>
            <li> I have purchased more and will continue.akes).</li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells</li>
            <li> Much better than what I&#x27;ve found when I tried to find a replacement in the stores.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love it :-)</li>
            <li> and I was actually quite impressed! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was able to sample this product...</li>
            <li> but im glad I tried Ponds.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no tightness afterwards like there can be with soap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not over the top about the scent though.</li>
            <li> Love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes out kind of opalescent and has a really smooth texture to it.  </li>
            <li> I use the Ponds Luminous Cream Cleanser in the shower, so I like that it has a snap top.</li>
            <li> Even My pre-teen tried the product &amp; she also loves the refreshing feeling that it leaves.</li>
            <li> The Ponds Luminous Clean Towelettes are a great, quick tool for just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an iridescent wash that is more creamy than sudsy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I was really thinking I would love this product with all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> keep thinking that I should give it one more try, just to be sure--maybe the breakout was just a coincidence?</li>
            <li> Recently I tried the Luminous Cream Cleanser and was impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> but nothing, i also love the packages, for the towlettes ur able to close it</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way that it applies to my skin when I wash with it.</li>
            <li> routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cleansing towelettes are my favorite!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and the bottle is pretty in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin feels soft and bright!</li>
            <li> Could not find this anywhere in the stores and was very excited to find it online.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smoothly, &amp; does not lather, but then, lather doesn&#x27;t clean anyway!!</li>
            <li> I used the Ponds Luminous Clean face wash this morning, and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s produced a nice luminous cleanser that will leave one&#x27;s skin feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> A great value compared to some of the high end cleansers.</li>
            <li> It rinses very clean like soap</li>
            <li> I will never just use a bar soap to clean my face because it does not leave my face feeling nice and clean like PONDS luminous cream does!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have to say I am very pleased with this product, and it&#x27;s worth a try, for both men and women..........</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant but there&#x27;s an underlying scent that I don&#x27;t care for too much.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, washes off clean and removed all makeup easily.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and feels so smooth on your face.</li>
            <li> First off I loved the smell of the product, it wasn&#x27;t too strong or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I use the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser both in and out of the shower!  </li>
            <li> Another fine note is the fantastic smell!</li>
            <li> It left my face clean, moisturized and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample via bzzagent,Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cleanser left my skin feeling wonderful</li>
            <li> The product has a nice smell, goes on smoothly, and makes your face feel squeaky clean without any dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smells, and while this product is scented, it&#x27;s very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of strong (not unpleasant though) in the packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes eye makeup which was an unexpected but welcome</li>
            <li> We would like to order more than 5 at a time and how about free shipping?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented now, but the old scent was so great.  </li>
            <li> The smell is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I was oil free for most of the day and in the morning it made my face feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and always am hesitant about using things on my face, and this product was great...</li>
            <li> It goes on very creamy and the smell is light, but pleasant.</li>
            <li> So smooth and rich - and left my skin feeling so wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 77 years old with very nice skin</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and very clean.</li>
            <li> It was passed to my sister who does not have the same problem as me and she loved it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The odor is very mild and not ojectionable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and non pore-clogging, so</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product -- it gets my skin clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I love Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I like the availibility of being able to clean my face on the go, since I go to the gym..</li>
            <li> They have been very mild on my face</li>
            <li> The towelettes removes waterproof mascara easily and doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume smell that can irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> The Pond&#x27;s cleanser worked wonderfully on my combination skin, the dry patches were moisturized (but I did need to apply a moisturizer after this product still) and the oily areas stayed moist but not oily even 24 hours after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser</li>
            <li> , it gets all the makeup off, and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> But once applied to the face, the scent is not bothersome at all and does not seem as strong anymore.</li>
            <li> They even travel with me right in my purse! :)</li>
            <li> Ponds has shockingly surprised me because honestly I couldn&#x27;t find a reason to not like it!  </li>
            <li> I rarely use drug store type face products, whether it be make-up or cleansers, so imagine my surprise when I actually liked the results from using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Cream Cleanser as well as the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Towlettes for free through bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> I loved this new face wash.</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal age perfect cleanser which I love</li>
            <li> Cream Cleanser went on smooth and came off easily during rinsing.</li>
            <li> and this is fine with me.</li>
            <li> Even though the towelettes took most of my make-up off, I would still do a quick wash with the Ponds cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, love it!</li>

            <li> Good cleanser, removes all my makeup, doesnt leave skin tight ,and despite its wonderful scent hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin and roseacea.</li>
            <li> It does such a great job taking off makeup, including mascara, without drying my skin.  </li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is great for my skin.</li>
            <li> , I wish ponds would make it available in stores.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth and relaxing cleansing lotion packaged in a tube.  </li>
            <li> smooth and cleansing.  </li>
            <li> cleanse my face without drying it, and leaving it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this cream cleanser along with the towelettes available in this skin care line.</li>
            <li> This  product is fabulous</li>
            <li> I also used it with full makeup on instead of starting with an eye makeup remover, and it did a wonderful job of removing my eye makeup while still feeling really gentle!  </li>
            <li> : I tried this product free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was given both the creamy cleanser and the towelettes free from BzzAgent.com to use and review.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in your purse or bag and have on hand when you need to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t still smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy consistency and feels really smooth when it&#x27;s applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li> how light it felt.  </li>
            <li> The texture was smooth, and lathered well.</li>
            <li> received this item for free to try as a bzzagent.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the fresh scent...</li>
            <li> Since I am a BzzAgent, I got this product free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> They are not just a smooth cloth that wipes off your make-up; it has a texture to it that cleans your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, to balance things out I&#x27;ve been alternating between Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free acne wash and the Pond&#x27;s Luminous to keep my skin acne free and also moisturized.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Price wise, the MAC Cremewash is $5.88 an ounce (I order directly from MAC to avoid fakes).</li>
            <li> It also has a nice soft scent which I love.</li>
            <li> I am not typically a fan of these products because they lack the sudsy, foamy, scrubbing bubbles and tends to leave my skin with that not so clean feeling....but not this one!!!  </li>
            <li> it does a good job leaving your skin feeling very soft after you wash, however if you have a face full of makeup</li>
            <li> It gives you a cool, clean &amp; refreshing feeling while working to brighten &amp; cool your skin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good end-of-the-day make up remover or quick cleaner before putting on new makeup.</li>
            <li> I loved the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and it made my face feel soft and had a heathy glow to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fairly faithful user of Clean and Clear cleansers of the years.</li>
            <li> although I like the more moisturizing components of them I often feel as though they can leave a film or not give me that fresh, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell was fresh, clean and fabulous!</li>
            <li> It has a nice, fresh scent and you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it.</li>
            <li> It has a light, clean smell.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and leaves my skin feeling silky and clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Feels great &amp; creamy, washes off easily, &amp; leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the wash, my face felt clean, smooth and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Removed even the most stubborn eye makeup and a full day&#x27;s worth of grime from my sensitive/breakout prone skin.  </li>
            <li> However, When I applied it, I found it easy to rub in and to quickly penetrate to remove the makeup and days dust.</li>
            <li> I want something quick, easy, and doesn&#x27;t have a million steps.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> They are great to quickly take off my makeup before bed, or simply refresh my face in the morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited that I&#x27;ve found something that works for me!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer</li>
            <li> The towelettes are great when you are in a hurry or had a long day.</li>
            <li> Just put some on your hand about the size of a dime, add water and you&#x27;ve got yourself a nice, sudsy cleaner that leaves your face feeling smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> My face is softer and feels fresh!</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my bzz agent bzzkit.  </li>
            <li> However, I was really excited to try the products</li>
            <li> The difference in your skin after even just a few days is amazing!!</li>
            <li> My face feels so refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> It removes all traces of foundation-makeup at night when I apply it to a wash cloth then clean face.</li>
            <li> It also takes make up off better than anything else, and so far its been safe to take off my eye</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 1mth now and have seen a difference in the tone of my skin, it leaves skin clean and refreshed without over drying.  </li>
            <li> I received the luminous clean cream cleanser and towelettes as part of a Bzzkit for Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> let alone really clean my face without leaving it feeling like a</li>
            <li> When I received the package with the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Towelettes</li>
            <li> I tried the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean cleanser &amp; towelettes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face and does a great job removing make-up.</li>
            <li> ponds line surpassed its promises of clean and radiant skin...</li>
            <li> It lathers well and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li> my skin but it removes makeup &amp; made my skin feel clean wo overdrying it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash and cleansing towelettes</li>
            <li> My skin felt clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean</li>
            <li> Before I started to use this product I use to just use soap and water to clean my face...</li>
            <li> Having breakout-prone skin, I&#x27;m always looking for products that leave my face noticeably clean.</li>
            <li> i absoutely loved the ponds luminous clean cream cleanser and the luminous clean weat cleansing towlettes, with the cream cleanser its so soft on ur skin and it just makes ur face feel like u were just at the spa fresh and with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pond&#x27;s clean cream cleanser</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent, foams just enough while using, and does not clump up.</li>
            <li> I use acne medicine that dries out my face but most moisturizing cleansers give me more acne--this one doesn&#x27;t break me out at all, and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out and in fact makes my skin softer and more supple.</li>
            <li> Certainly like it better than the Olay</li>
            <li> Certainly like it better than the Olay</li>
            <li> So I was happy when I received the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Wet Cleaning Towelettes.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so much that it will stop me from using the product or rating it lower than 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;After using both the cleanser &amp; the towelettes consistently for 5 days I&#x27;m seeing a nice difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I will never use another face cleaner, this one is a full package..</li>
            <li> I just wanted to get a good deep cleaning</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the feel of it on my face and felt it was moisturizing and gentle.  </li>
            <li> The towlettes are of good size and were tried before and also after I cleaned my face with my regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is fairly creamy, so takes a bit of extra rinsing (or use a washcloth to get it all).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to do the two cycles I really need, without irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to do the two cycles I really need, without irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a low cost product, so that&#x27;s always good.  </li>
            <li> The ponds cleanser does have clay in it, so just make sure you rinse it really well.</li>
            <li> really like the cleansing cloths, I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d notice a feeling of this tingling sensation on my face and, not a bad feeling a smoothing sensation so</li>
            <li> For consumers that have used other notable brands of cleanser, Pond&#x27;s is comparable, especially because of the beautiful scent and the satisfying results.</li>
            <li> Its not oily or abrasive and washes off pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty, convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling fresh and clean and it has a nice light, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin and finding a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me red and itchy is quite a feat.</li>
            <li> but his skin was very smooth and also looked cleaner than normal.</li>
            <li> fresh, clean skin and all eye make up removed with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather mild.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but somehow after I bought it at Walmart 1 year ago, I cannot find it in local stores any more.  </li>
            <li> I love the gentle fresh smell of this cleaner.  </li>
            <li> After using it my skin felt soft and smooth for many hours.</li>
            <li> has a wonderful smell as well as a very convenient bottle with the opening at the bottom, the product always comes out smoothly no need to shake and shake trying to get it</li>
            <li> Well, the nice, thick foamy, creamy texture is almost FUN to play with while you rub it all over your face and the scent is quite pleasant and not over-bearing.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using it very much.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was its light, fresh, and clean scent.</li>
            <li> Luminous clean goes on sooth and make your face feel clean after the first use.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s knocked the ball right out of the park with their Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Softer, more balanced, fewer dry patches, less redness &amp; my psoriasis spots have calmed down as well.&lt;br /&gt;Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser makes me a happy girl with happy skin!</li>
            <li> I also love that it freshens the bristles on my Clarisonic&#x27;s brush head; normally I have to wash the brush</li>
            <li> I also love that it freshens the bristles on my Clarisonic&#x27;s brush head; normally I have to wash the brush</li>
            <li> (he was so thrilled :-P) to see if his normal skin would get dried out at all</li>
            <li> The wet cleansing towelettes left the same refreshing, clean feeling as the cream cleanser but are more convienent when in a hurry or just needing a quick refresher - would be perfect to throw in a gym bag.</li>
            <li> :  I love the fact that the cream cleanser comes in an easy to squeeze tube like bottle that stands up side down with a flip top cap, so there will never be a struggle to get the cleanser out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite cleanser</li>
            <li> I was less happy with the results, though.</li>
            <li> It rinsed off clean, and my face felt super soft and clean!</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream allowed me to get a deep and refreshing cleaning!</li>
            <li> I am constantly fighting dry skin but after using this my skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s nice and smooth and just generally feels much better than regular soap.</li>
            <li> I am lucky enough to be a bzz agent and was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products</li>
            <li> The first time I used the cleanser and rinsed it off my face felt as clean as if I had just used a scrub.  </li>
            <li> I have been stuck on one certain face wash for over 10 years and every time I buy a new one it never compares to my first love!</li>
            <li> My face is really oily and certain soaps and face cleaners I can not use, but I really love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice smell, a little girly, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> Good foaming creamy effective cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, but seems to clean it thoroughly, and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin!</li>
            <li> It works great and cleans my face well everyday.</li>
            <li> It is a light gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t irritate me when I go to bed after cleaning my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks again to Bzz agent as well as thanks to Pond&#x27;s for creating such a great product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I have been pleased so far.</li>
            <li> As far as the claims of making my skin more lumonious..</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome-very fresh and feminine.  </li>
            <li> but it would be nice if these came in smaller packaging.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin and leaves me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> The towelettes I found useful to remove eye make-up and pre-clean my face before showering.</li>
            <li> Anyone wanting a nice creamy cleanser, that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, I would recommend the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean line.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser washes away easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> and I like the soft, refreshing scent it has.</li>
            <li> love Ponds - have been using their products forever - this especially leaves my skin smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> still worth noting, the cream leaked into the cap when stored vertically (standing upright with the cap on the bottom).</li>
            <li> They have the same great scent and the towelettes are soft.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> He said his skin felt soft and looked healthy.  </li>
            <li> there for I rarely use any face cleansers.</li>
            <li> It might be great for people with oily skin, but for normal or dry skin, I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the floral fragrance; it was a welcome after dealing with other products that definitely had a \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smell to them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great simple cream cleanser that left my face feeling fresh, toned and clean.  </li>
            <li> It rinses clean but leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling very clean, and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li> to the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean line, I can now say that I have clean, clear and well moisturized skin!</li>
            <li> I had the biggest pimple on my face right beteew</li>
            <li> I think I am still going to try again, but right now this is a so-so product for me.</li>
            <li> but they were not the right one for me.</li>
            <li> That convinced me instantly that this face wash is pretty spectacular at removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it every morning in the shower and my skin feels soft, and moisturized and clean!</li>
            <li> but, more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used several difference facial cleansers and this is by far one of the best!  </li>
            <li> Frothed up nicely and left my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other pond&#x27;s cleansers &amp; they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Would be good for anyone with normal, dry, or combination skin, however might be good for someone with oily skin due to the Kaolin Clay.</li>
            <li> Many other cleaners smell like chemicals or strong perfumes.  </li>
            <li> This cream cleanser is very mild and has a soft scent.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt clean and super soft.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my face feeling clean and fresh and my skin feels so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean products to others.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> So, I believe that I&#x27;m going to like this very much.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle yet works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream cleanser has a light, clean, feminine scent that simply enhances the beauty ritual of face cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I love the clay ingredient added for extra smoothness.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use products of Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it seems I cannot locate it anywhere locally.</li>
            <li> I will gladly endorse this entire line of products.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> After the first use (of the cleanser) I was pretty convinced that this product wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li> I found this cleanser to work pretty well for my skin.</li>
            <li> After the first day, I felt a difference in the texture of my skin, and my skin itself felt revitalized.</li>
            <li> I would use the towelettes first to remove any makeup, then apply the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t deny that I got real results this time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: I was a bit frightened at first because I was beginning to breakout a bit during the first week.  </li>
            <li> After using it I found that it basically just sat on top of my skin and didn&#x27;t do the deep cleaning that my face needs.</li>
            <li> the facial cleanser is an OK cleanser does the job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found something way better and,the cost is lesser.</li>
            <li> and I love starting my day off using the cream cleanser in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> So with the Pond&#x27;s I have to first use an eye makeup remover, and then follow up with the Pond&#x27;s cleanser.</li>
            <li> After 2 days, I squeezed the cream into a jar (more like traditional Pond&#x27;s containers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Id use it again but definitely not going to think its going to give me better skin.</li>
            <li> As a mom of two kiddos and a military wife who is often on her own, I don&#x27;t have the time or energy for that.</li>
            <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this cleanser is the smell.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that there&#x27;s a tightness to your face for a minute or so afterwards.</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I think it&#x27;s a sign of a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> The texture is thick and creamy and you don&#x27;t need a lot; it provides great coverage.</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Soft scent, and smooth cream.  </li>
            <li> At first I did like it.</li>
            <li> In fact, my face felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Although to be fair, I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Add just a little bit to your face then put warm water on a wash rag and it suds up so much making your face feel squeaky clean after wards.</li>
            <li> It definitely did not dry it out and during the winter, and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I used Ponds for many years before changing to Clinique and later to Clean and Clear.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Pond&#x27;s product but have always heard positive things about the brand.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling refreshed and very clean.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d be perfect for camping too (or just when I&#x27;m too lazy to actually wash my face haha).</li>
            <li> other night I used the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash for the first time and not only did it clean my face brilliantly, my clarisonic brush head was white again as if it were new.</li>
            <li> There are no harsh scents which really helped me to enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Radiant is not the word for how my face feels, it is so soft and looks like it has a amazing glow, which was not there prior to using ponds.</li>
            <li> and I think it is too soon to tell however, my skin feels clean and soft and I know that ponds have been around for years infact</li>
            <li> Leaves my face clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when my Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products arrived in the mail.  </li>
            <li> , it felt so soft and purely clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin also felt clean and soft, no dryness or tightness.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin to feel clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> I switched from a foaming gel cleanser, which seemed a little hash and was very satisfied with this cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> gives you a deep clean feeling with a fresh feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li> After using the product my face feels very soft and moisturized, not dry like from most products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately we are not troubled with acne or big breakouts, so all I can say for this Pond&#x27;s cleanser is that it maintains our skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better and does not look dry.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle, i have very sensitive skin and had no irritation with this product!</li>
            <li> It was super gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my face was not left dry and flaky or with a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I was hesitant to try this cleanser at first, but immediately after using the cleanser for the first time, I noticed that it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya with this great facial cleaner!!!</li>
            <li> I really must say that I always associated Ponds with older women!</li>
            <li> With cleansers it is hard to tell how good they really are.  </li>
            <li> It is clearly a huge step above hand soap, which has been resorted to on occasion, and your face feels like sandpaper afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> However they work, they do work, really well.</li>
            <li> It really removes your makeup (even mascara) while you wash your face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> this worked really well for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> When i recieved it, it was packaged really well.</li>
            <li> This face wash met my standards, I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to face wash.</li>
            <li> This cream cleanser left my skin feeling super soft and clean without the tightness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, while it gently cleanses and detoxes your skin.</li>
            <li> : Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> and I really like them.  </li>
            <li> I feel the information on the website as well as packaging is very informative and answered all of my questions regarding performance and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Pond&#x27;s for letting me try it.</li>
            <li> I really like this Ponds luminous cleanser.</li>
            <li> but I do really like it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is gentle, yet removes make-up without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream cleanser really is the creamiest I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> she said that the skin cleaner worked really well.  </li>
            <li> The cream cleaner is a generous 6oz size and very creamy.</li>
            <li> you can see how hydrating and gentle it will be.</li>
            <li> I really felt like my skin was glowing and radiant.</li>
            <li> and it really cleaned my skin.</li>
            <li> It cleaned out my pours and really opened them up.</li>
            <li> Every face wash dries my face out too much and makes it peeling and pimply.</li>
            <li> Used this product yesterday and I found it comparable to products that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so gentle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so gentle</li>
            <li> Really does remove all my makeup in one wash.</li>
            <li> I have very oil skin which may be why this irritates it.</li>
            <li> It has a silky smooth texture (which I was not expecting, because it contains clay) and left my skin feeling soft, fresh, and...</li>
            <li> The product is very creamy out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> very</li>
            <li> It really cleaned my skin and helped unify it to one creamy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much of a lather with this cleanser</li>
            <li> But I really feel no desire to use this product again.</li>
            <li> and u get 30 which is like a whole months supply.</li>
            <li> I really like the softness of the product.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you might feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I recently joined bzzagent and that is a group where you get to try products for free and let people know what you think.</li>
            <li> and I really like the creamy texture and</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very creamy.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser works well, even removing waterproof mascara, but it&#x27;s kind of messy, so I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I received the ponds luminous facial cleanser and wipes from BzzAgent for review:I am loving the pond&#x27;s luminous facial wipes.....</li>
            <li> I really liked the Pond&#x27;s Cream Cleanser - it left my skin feeling soft and smooth, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my face like my normal face wash does.</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with irritation after a shower, this isn&#x27;t a cure but its definitely much better than the other things I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I only needed a dime size to clean my whole face.</li>
            <li> You only need a dime sized amount to clean your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quite unlike most any other drugstore cleansers I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took off everything my normal cleanser didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Plus, there isn&#x27;t any dried-out feeling that I have gotten with so many other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many other face cleanser</li>
            <li> This is nice, but isn&#x27;t enough to make me switch from my regular Cetaphil for sensitive skin, I really prefer a gentle, gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> face is left feeling squeaky clean yet not dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to wash my face several times to get it to feel clean.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a visible reduction in the number of blackheads and it has left my face feeling clean and reinvigorating.</li>
            <li> After using the product, it left my skin feeling clean, and refresh.</li>
            <li> Every cream cleanser I&#x27;ve tried has left my skin feeling sticky and not all that clean.</li>
            <li> The face wash left my face feeling clean without a filmy residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using CeraVe products for my face, but recently tried the Ponds luminous clean cream cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Not only does my face feel clean, it feels silky after washing and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since I started using it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very simple and clean looking as well.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use very much to clean my entire face.</li>
            <li> The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser left my face with a radiant glow.</li>
            <li> it left my skin clean without any feelings of tightness or dryness.</li>
            <li> the wipes are better than any other brand I have tried---definitely a product i plan on using for as long as available.....</li>
            <li> Really like this cleanser and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser for about a week and half, and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, and it left my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve also been great for a quick refresh if my skin is feeling dirty on a make up-free day.</li>
            <li> The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean line left my face feeling fresh, not dry.</li>
            <li> time I open it, the cap is full of product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased upon first trying the product, noting that the texture was very creamy and soft unlike my previous facial washes.  </li>
            <li> This product is not only making my face clean and soft, but my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s face is clearing from acne, and is soft and clean now.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin because it does not contain any harsh beads or rough exfoliants and yet my skin had a gorgeous, radiant glow!</li>
            <li> so I really like this new cleanser from Ponds.</li>
            <li> Can actually say it does make skin luminous if massaged for 30 seconds or more after a weeks use noticed less roseacea bumps and soft smooth texture with a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li> The Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser does get my face clean without a dry after feeling, but I can&#x27;t exactly same</li>
            <li> I always thought it worked decent with my combination skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommed this product to anyone with a dry/oily skin combination who is looking for a change from the smelly, overpriced, burning products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My face felt fresher and it made my face a little more brighter.</li>
            <li> I have tried the ponds cream cleanser and after using it for a few days I felt more vibrant.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Cleans the face nicely, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out like other products and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t dry after the wash and it feels sooo clean.</li>
            <li> it worked as a normal soap, I did not feel any difference on my face.</li>
            <li> Also the Wet Cleansing Towelettes and they removed my eye makeup very well and had no bad reactions to either product even on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am a heavy makeup user, and I also have combination type skin, so finding a product that can remove all residual makeup without drying me out is sometimes challenging.</li>
            <li> Now after a week of not using this product my face has returned to normal.</li>
            <li> Sort of like spring flowers mixed with a fresh ocean breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a new find - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER its a pretty decent cream facial wash.</li>
            <li> but before long, I noticed the same tightness, burning and red spots that appear after I use any kind of soap on my face.</li>
            <li> This was a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retired makeup artist so like to try new things when it comes to skincare...</li>
            <li> Trying this new \\&quot;Luminous</li>
            <li> Again I do not see any brightness that is new</li>
            <li> While this product is the new kid on the block, Pond&#x27;s has been a trust brand for years.  </li>
            <li> It does, however live up to the promise of &#x27;drawing out impurities.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The New Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and the Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes is a must have..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the scent was less strong and perfumed.</li>
            <li> washing it goes on smoothly, rinses cleanly and did not make my skin feel dry, greasy or tight.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> tried this product for two weeks alongside the towelettes and was very surprised that it did, in face, brighten my skin some.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> creamy cleanser works quite well to dissolve make-up and oil and leave your skin squeaky clean, but not tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> I do use makeup remover first, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> my face has a natural glow,the cream cleanser has the texture of a Mask or Clay but not as heavy, when on the face,I love the soft scent (it&#x27;s not a overwhelming scent)I love</li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses, I was totally grossed out by the amount of gunk in my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised!</li>
            <li> I usually do not care for cream cleansers because they leave a filmy residue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spending a lot more money on name brand expensive products, and they have not been providing the results I&#x27;ve seen &amp; felt with Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful for filling the $35 free s&amp;h requirement when buying other items!</li>
            <li> After rinsing, I noticed that my face felt a little dry, but my everyday moisturizer quickly fixed that, and my skin was left with a lovely glow that I loved.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but not as mild as normal cold cream.  </li>
            <li> In every other area, the Pond&#x27;s product is just as nice as the more expensive MAC cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this cleanser because I&#x27;ve really liked the daily exfoliating cleanser in this same line, and it seemed like the two would complement each other well.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel silky smooth and less oily.</li>
            <li> It is soft enough to feel luxurious but lathers enough to be clean and  fulfilling.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe how moisturized and soft my face looked and felt after only the first use.</li>
            <li> A little bit of lotion and everything was all fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a facial mask going on your skin than a typical cleanser, which makes me feel like I&#x27;m being pampered.</li>
            <li> When first applying a small portion of the cream, the undeniable fresh scent that automatically comes from the contents of the medium tube invigorates the senses with a variety of floral fragrances leaving a lasting impression after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I recently until now  was using the Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser wasn&#x27;t really happy with it because it made my face dry and felt tight after washing my face, and had dry patches.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of face wash and used to think the ones with the scrubbers (that are so bad for your pores) were the only ones that made my face feel clean, but Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash changed my mind!</li>
            <li> The POND&#x27;S luminous cream cleanser left my skin feeling clean without it being too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li> I never have skin breakouts, so it clearly cleans my skin well.</li>
            <li> You do not want to get this near your eyes.</li>
            <li> Rinses off completely.  </li>
            <li> It completely took off all makeup, including foundation and waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> It offers no miracles but provides what I need it to do....</li>
            <li> and it made my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> If you have seriously sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin just felt so soft after every use.</li>
            <li> The cream is a white pearly color and gently foams when rubbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have definitely shared this gem with friends and family who are looking for an affordable skin care system  with high quality results!</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this for anyone sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Pond&#x27;s product rather surprised me......</li>
            <li> /&gt;The towelettes were soft and not abrasive.  </li>
            <li> After three days of using both of these Pond&#x27;s products my11 year old son came up to me and said.\\&quot; Mom are you getting lighter or something\\</li>
            <li> On my second bottle thanks to those results.</li>
            <li> she gave some to her young neice, ( who triles on the make-up )  </li>
            <li> my skin is glowing (a bit too old for that).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate at all and made my face feel really soft after.</li>
            <li> but it has done no harm to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am not the type of person who wants to wash my face every night, adding an extra 15 minutes to my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> it does not take it all off completely.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, &amp; these work like a charm.  </li>
            <li> My skin can be sensitive and this did not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> It works well but is sensitive to my skin.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> how it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> way\\&quot; I&#x27;ve have, had problem with acne and dark spots,I used this products for about five days now,not even a full week</li>
            <li> The cleanser is nice because a little bit goes a long ways so it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild enough to use as an eye makeup remover and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out</li>
            <li> But if you have dry skin then this is really for you, It does make my skin feel very soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> The towelettes have the same light fragrance with a pre-moistened, pre-portioned, slightly textured soft cloth that creates and effortless and thoughtless face cleansing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t love about this product was that my skin was a tad dry, which is to be expected for my type of skin if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer immediately.  </li>
            <li> I am particular about the facial cleansers that I use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the towelettes to take my make up off at the end of a busy work day when I am too lazy to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a cleaner that spoils you and cleans at the same time!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the amount of make up that my old cleanser left on my face!!</li>
            <li> The soft white Kaolin clay really helped get the dirt and impurities from my pores and left my face radiant.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was, pull out the wet cleansing towelettes and start wiping my face.</li>
            <li> The cleanser left my face a bit tight and dry, but I can easily moisturize for a cleanser which works this well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, a tube will last a LONG TIME as you don&#x27;t need very much at all....</li>
            <li> After using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Wet Cleansing Towelettes, my combination skin was left feeling softer, smoother, clearer, and glowing with smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> The cream cleanser is \\&quot;enriched with moisturizing ingredients and soft white Kaolin clay: a natural mineral known to act like a magnet to draw out deep-dwelling impurities.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It cleaned my face and left me with skin as soft as my 8 month old.</li>
            <li> It also left my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Most face cleansers tend to dry my skin out and leave my face feeling tight (especially during the winter)</li>
            <li> It washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and not full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never go back to my old one!</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the cleansing towelettes and the cream cleanser were just like all the other products out there.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the heavy cold cream for which Pond&#x27;s became famous; it&#x27;s a light, gentle cleanser to use after you&#x27;ve removed your makeup.</li>
            <li> The cream felt light as I put it on and wasn&#x27;t hard to wash off either.</li>
            <li> It removed all make-up with minimal left under my eye (could easily remove with a Q-Tip) just like every other cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li> It really is starting to clear up.</li>
            <li> I usually only use proactive on my face because I have adult acne</li>
            <li> It left my skin soft and getting moisture.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and moist, removed makeup well.  </li>
            <li> This is the second Pond&#x27;s product I have tried, and I was heartily surprised at what a quality product this is.</li>
            <li> When I read that this has clay in it, I expected that it would be very drying since that is what clay does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soothing cream that leaves my skin feeling hydrated &amp; soft &amp; actually brighter!</li>
            <li> It barely foams at all</li>
            <li> texture of the cleanser is silky, reminds me of said old school cleanser that used to come in a blue jar.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> And after I use it, I can definitely say that my skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  totally recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a little water and building the lather before you put it on your face, you use less product and it seems to work more effectively this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have older skin, and it&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip it dry, or make it feel tight, itchy, flaky, you name it.</li>
            <li> You can feel the clay in it and there is a slight grainy texture that is a very gentle exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely crazy for both the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Luminous Clean Towelettes.</li>
            <li> I was excited to open it and shocked, frankly that these were NOT any small sample sizes, but 4 very large full size items to keep and use for myself!!  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin, so dry skin after use was a surprise.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed to work up a rich lather on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser for the past five days as part of my daily showering routine.  </li>
            <li> This would be something my family would buy, knowing how clean it gets our faces.. especially with teenage daughters who may not clean their faces like they should!</li>
            <li> Not oily, not dry, and not blotchy.</li>
            <li> and I have been using a far more expensive cleaner</li>
            <li> It smells flowery which scared me a little at first</li>
            <li> I think the combination of both cleansers, instead of just plain soap in the evening, was somehow too much for my sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ponds Cold Cream and Deep Cleanser for nearly 2 decades, so I was pleased to try this new product.</li>
            <li> it was red and blotchy in general</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and use Philosopy purity cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I waited a few days and tried again, and the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li> When I first found &amp; purchased this cleanser in the local discount big-box store a few years ago, it was only $3.99...</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a daily scrub because I&#x27;ve always felt that was the only way I could get my face to feel this fresh</li>
            <li> so you really felt it work into your skin and my skin, which typically gets very dry immediately after washing, felt soft and not tight or dry at all after.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, but use this cleanser daily without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> Both products proved to be gentle on my sensitive skin and left me with a subtle dewy glow (not greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was in the wrong to think that that was helping clean my face completely.</li>
            <li> It rinses away clean, with no product residue left behind.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling tight like face washes normally do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling clean and less oily, but not nearly as fresh or airy as other cleansers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My face now soft, the dark spots are fading away</li>
            <li> The 6-ounce tube should last a long time.</li>
            <li> container should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I expect this tube to last twice as long as others that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I am always a little hesitant before trying a new face wash product.</li>
            <li> However, for the price I think I can live with this little issue.</li>
            <li> If you add a little water after you spread it on your face it makes a very small amount of lather and you can rub it around on your face easily.  </li>
            <li> It has a faint rose scent, but not strong enough to irritate my nose.</li>
            <li> When I first put a small dab of the cream cleanser on my fingertip, it looked like a pearl!  </li>
            <li> My dry patches are gone, the blemishes in my face and neck are clearing, and my pores are actually shrinking.</li>
            <li> It never burned my skin, or left it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s is most like a cross between a cold cream and liquid cleanser</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin that vacillates between oily in the T zone and dry in the forehead.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning but, unlike cold cream, it leaves my skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I was expecting  the same old harsh stinky cleanser and when the back of the package mentioned clay I expected grit .  </li>
            <li> The only downside for me is that it leaves my face very dry.</li>
            <li> so my skin is very dry except for my face which is actually combination.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually stopped trying to use my generic pro active like product</li>
            <li> It claims to be a product that \\&quot;gently draws out impurities and make-up to brighten dull skin.\\&quot; It keeps up on its promise.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice how dull my skin was looking until after I had used this and looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good face wash for YEARS and spent way too much money on horrible products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundred&#x27;s of dollars on lotions and potions for my skin, low and behold</li>
            <li> so it lasts long.  </li>
            <li> The wipes were not really for me because I did feel like it left a soapy residue</li>
            <li> Although it does not completely remove makeup.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that this pearly white \\&quot;cream cleanser\\&quot; actually does have a bit of thick, soft, fluffy foaminess to it.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product comes in to forms, the cleanser and the lazy girl toweletteso that you don&#x27;t have to veer from you regimen when your too tired to wash your face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> During the winter my face feels so dry and looks dull, but after using the cream cleanser it really seemed brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> and I am usually hesitant to try something new.</li>
            <li> I usually am hesitant to try new brands</li>
            <li> Not for long!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t gritty like other washes I have tried.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Does not break me out or make my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;combination\\&quot; skin, and this works well on both dry and oily areas.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed without that irritating tightness afterwards!</li>
            <li> I allowed my mother who has dry skin to use the product and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel over dry or rubbery before I put lotion on.  </li>
            <li> to stop using this after 3 weeks because it made my face so dry</li>
            <li> This cleanser removes makeup and exfoliates without leaving skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> So its tricky to find products that wont make me to dry or to oily.  </li>
            <li> In the winter my skin gets so dry</li>
            <li> Maybe in single packs?</li>
            <li> Products usually don&#x27;t cause me to break out, so it surprised me.</li>
            <li> head out with soap in order to avoid that sour smell it inevitably gets.</li>
            <li> head out with soap in order to avoid that sour smell it inevitably gets.</li>
            <li> over the top praise is based on the fact that I have very difficult combination skin</li>
            <li> Typically after using facial cleansers I always have red dry scaly skin along my hairline and a line that runs down my nose out under my eyes, I call it my batwings.</li>
            <li> I see me re-purchasing as soon as I&#x27;m down to my last squeeze!</li>
            <li> You will only need about a nickel-sized dollop, as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser left my face dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Just squeeze out a dime size amount, spread it on your dry face, wet your Clarisonic brush and have at it.</li>
            <li> Just squeeze out a dime size amount, spread it on your dry face, wet your Clarisonic brush and have at it.</li>
            <li> It was very creamy and thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This worked really well on my combination skin, which is usually oily in the t-zone but is overall much drier now that the weather has turned cold.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little</li>
            <li> but it foamed up nicely &amp; a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of cleansers to cope with my adult acne and dull skin over the years</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s extremely sensitive &amp; it&#x27;s hard to keep it balanced &amp; not irritated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once to twice a day for the last week and my skin is considerably less dry and less blotchy.</li>
            <li> I spoke about earlier was dried out and nothing but a scab.</li>
            <li> My only quibble is the packaging, with the upsidedown tube, the product leaks out into the lid causing some of it to be wasted.</li>
            <li> This is a product I would definitely buy again, I&#x27;ve always used Neutrogena, but they&#x27;ve gotten a bit heavy handed with the added scents.</li>
            <li> Be careful though.</li>
            <li> it cleans the skin, does not irritate (I have sensitive skin), and are thick wipes like a cloth.</li>
            <li> My face was a little dry after, but my skin is always dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> its was bad, it was like trying to wash your face with lotion, my face didn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards, and to me it felt like it left a film of that lotion on your face!</li>
            <li> Basically if you have decent skin and you use a cleanser, you should expect to maintain your skin and not have it get worse.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> It washes my makeup off and does not leave my skin dry and tight</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using it, which is a concern of mine during winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe every other day for the wash and 2 out of 3 days for the wipes.</li>
            <li> The cleanser lathers up really nicely, so only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> I usually pay $15-$20 for a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was reluctant to try this product due to its categorization of being a cream cleanser.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> a face wash usually does...that is one thing I like about my current products.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed because it suds so well.  </li>
            <li> I have upgraded it to five stars, because I&#x27;ve found myself reaching for this cleanser over any other when I need to wash my face</li>
            <li> I have upgraded it to five stars, because I&#x27;ve found myself reaching for this cleanser over any other when I need to wash my face</li>
            <li> They do not require me to rinse my face like some other cloths</li>
            <li> It has a thicker consistency than other cleansers</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d use one in the morning and the other at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream cleanser several times a day for the past week</li>
            <li> I expected the cream application to be a bit abrasive with a little wait.  </li>
            <li> All in all I would definitely recommend that you at least try this product out.</li>
            <li> This morning I did not experience any negative reaction to this product, so I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> and I rank this at the top.  </li>
            <li> It also did not remove my makeup in any way, but instead just smeared everything down my face.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed, so it is cost efficient as well!</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult not to take breaks while wiping my face because the scent was so intense.</li>
            <li> dried out feeling afterwards like other soaps/cleansers leave your skin feeling.  </li>
            <li> While other brands are harsh on my face and lead to skin flakiness, Ponds does not.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a harsh scent that you get from some other cleansers.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt she was ecstatic to learn that the bottles are twice the size of her previous one.  </li>
            <li> However I did notice it was less greasy.</li>
            <li> I found myself using the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Wet Towelettes after this process and the wipes had residue from what the cleanser left behind.</li>
            <li> There is a slight floral/rose water scent that is not overpowering, but</li>
            <li> then the wash) was the old Pond&#x27;s cold cream from &#x27;back in the day&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> less importance, but</li>
            <li> Because of my previous experience, I thought I would like this product.</li>
            <li> There was also one evening when I washed my face with this cleanser and after about half an hour</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use POND&#x27;S products</li>
            <li> At 1st I thought I might have failed to close the cap tightly, but after cleaning it &amp; storing on end again, the next morning I encountered the same mess.</li>
            <li> For the past week I&#x27;ve been using both the cream cleanser and the wet wipes.</li>
            <li> but it does leave a tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> However, my face did feel a tad tight</li>
            <li> What I did not like is the tight feeling that I had after using it.  </li>
            <li> I liked that I didn&#x27;t have that awful dried out feeling afterwards like other soaps/cleansers</li>
            <li> I washed my face twice a day with the cleanser (except for the times that I was feeling far too exhausted and lazy</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t harsh and I have had less break outs since using this product.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t harsh and I have had less break outs since using this product.</li>
            <li> Also, the fragrance is a little over powering and could stand to be lightened just a bit.</li>
            <li> so I was a little apprehensive to use this</li>
            <li> she used just a little bit on her face while taking a shower.  </li>
            <li> I did a little experiment with this product-</li>
            <li> I would recommend this little gem to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a little over a week</li>
            <li> gave it to my husband to try as well, as his skin has been very dry lately.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product but it&#x27;s definitely not suited for my: combination, oily and still sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> dried husk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my skin is not as dried out after washing it.  </li>
            <li> I liked that I didn&#x27;t have that awful</li>
            <li> Cream Cleanser for a few days now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of over perfumed, harsh face washes</li>
            <li> have been using MAC&#x27;s Cremewash cleanser for a few months and like it, and the Pond&#x27;s product compares to the MAC product in consistency and usage.</li>
            <li> It draws all of the oil from my face without leaving it dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> had a hard time deciding to give it a 4/5 or 5/5 stars due to my face drying out a little.</li>
            <li> I think that this was due to the product drawing out impurities, dirt and grime that were leaving my skin dull and pasty.  </li>
            <li> felt like there was still something on my face, so that I went and washed again with plain soap and water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didnt leave me feeling tight and taunt after my cleansing, but refreshed!  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or taught!</li>
            <li> The towelettes seal is very tight and don&#x27;t think I will have a problem with the seal lifting and the product drying out.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fragrance; if it stinks I won&#x27;t use it, and even the fragrance can irritate my skin and make it feel chapped and tortured.</li>
            <li> I am unable to find this in stores for several months now, I come to Amazon for it.</li>
            <li> so I was quite skeptical that this product would actually brighten my skin</li>
            <li> I stopped using my usual Mary Kay cleanser to give this a try</li>
            <li> and this works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t too fragrant, which is hard to come by, and had a spa-esque scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least 1 year.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m still using and enjoying this product, I must say that I am thoroughly disappointed in Pond&#x27;s for the outrageous price increase over the last few years!  </li>
            <li> I noticed lately that my clarisonic brush was turning tan colored from my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so thick and creamy-it is like putting lotion on your face.</li>
            <li> had some doubts about the cleanser because it is so thick &amp; lotion like</li>
            <li> No more build up!</li>
            <li> While less greasy is a plus, the blotchy and angry</li>
            <li> When I ran out, I wanted to try something less expensive.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, but the texture was awful.</li>
            <li> No longer sold locally :(</li>
            <li> I also have psoriasis patches that become worse with some products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ADDICTED to the smell.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use cream cleansers so I was very skeptical when it was recommended to me.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to see that it is unavailable in stores.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> At a mere fraction of the price of premium-branded products, I find this Pond&#x27;s cleanser to be something that I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> At a mere fraction of the price of premium-branded products, I find this Pond&#x27;s cleanser to be something that I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it was not to be.</li>
            <li> After two days, I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> Stereotypical?</li>
            <li> This cleanser, in comparison is thicker and has a subtle scent that isn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a week after I started using the cleanser, I had one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like cold cream as I always feel that it is leaving a residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My face was unhappy</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in my age bracket then the word &#x60;Pond&#x27;s&#x27; probably brings to mind memories of greasy cold cream that was guaranteed to clog your pores and cause your skin to breakout.  </li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t a bad product but for someone with my skin I don&#x27;t believe it would be beneficial to add to their skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I broke out really badly.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> am disappointed by this product and will not be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> I hate cleansers that take forever to wash off.  </li>
            <li> I hated this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> not for me, getting very disappointed in ponds</li>
            <li> It was one of the worst cleansers that I&#x27;ve ever</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This face wash cleanses off makeup effortlessly, and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth! I love the clay ingredient added for extra smoothness. I have noticed a big difference in my skin since using it.</li>
            <li> best cleaner on the market.  I have psoriasis and this is the best product for me</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily use. My face feels so refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out my skin. I have tried other pond&#x27;s cleansers &amp; they are pretty good. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least 1 year. It removes all traces of foundation-makeup at night when I apply it to a wash cloth then clean face. Once in a while I swipe face with toner on cotton ball to assure myself I have removed all the make-up, I have. In the morning I just use a dab to cleanse with my hands and splash my face.. It feels nice &amp; is affordable. I am unable to find this in stores for several months now, I come to Amazon for it. It&#x27;s helpful for filling the $35 free s&amp;h requirement when buying other items!</li>
            <li> 2nd time buyer.&lt;br /&gt;this cleans makeup and leave skin bright.&lt;br /&gt;works excellent on me.&lt;br /&gt;at this price, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!!! And it&#x27;s always been my favorite cleanser ever!! I use it every night before I go to bed and my skin feels soft and bright! love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many face washes and this one works great. I have been using this product for about 6 months, and I love it. My skin has never looked better. Does not break me out or make my skin too dry. It has a light, clean smell. Love the price!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser have used it for many years. No longer sold locally :(</li>
            <li> Product is very good, but I am not a fan of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Each time I open it, the cap is full of product.</li>
            <li> This product is a terrific cleanser but, more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It&#x27;s mild enough to use as an eye makeup remover and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, nice fresh scent!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use products of Pond&#x27;s. It works great and cleans my face well everyday. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Really like this cleanser and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cream is just okay.  I don&#x27;t love it or hate it.  I think it would be good for sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s rather mild.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> This product works wonderful for older skin.  It adds a brightness to the skin and you feel refreshed from using it.  I am sorry to see that it is unavailable in stores.</li>
            <li> Works very well, love it! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used!  It does such a great job taking off makeup, including mascara, without drying my skin.  Perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 8/22/16:  Although I&#x27;m still using and enjoying this product, I must say that I am thoroughly disappointed in Pond&#x27;s for the outrageous price increase over the last few years!  When I first found &amp; purchased this cleanser in the local discount big-box store a few years ago, it was only $3.99...an increase of $10?!  I wish my wages had this kind of percentage increase!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use acne medicine that dries out my face but most moisturizing cleansers give me more acne--this one doesn&#x27;t break me out at all, and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out and in fact makes my skin softer and more supple. It also takes make up off better than anything else, and so far its been safe to take off my eye make up (disclaimer, would not recommend rubbing it IN your actual eye.) And it smells amazing. And it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it seems I cannot locate it anywhere locally.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff so I ordered her two bottles of it.  Upon receipt she was ecstatic to learn that the bottles are twice the size of her previous one.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cleanser I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face, it gets all the makeup off, and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  It is also nice and creamy in texture and I enjoy using it very much.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is great for my skin. I do not have acne but it does cleanse well and is priced well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundred&#x27;s of dollars on lotions and potions for my skin, low and behold I try a sample of this product and I am hooked. This is the best my skin has looked in many years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second tube and I love it !! I will never use another face cleaner, this one is a full package..cleaner and a facial mask !!! My face isn&#x27;t dry after the wash and it feels sooo clean. It washes off all my makeup. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this one for me and I think it is too soon to tell however, my skin feels clean and soft and I know that ponds have been around for years infact my grandmother used ponds and in her 90&#x27;s she never had ANY wrinkles NONE. I just wanted to get a good deep cleaning and I have been pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my spouse and asked her to give me feedback after she used it so that I could write a review. She provided the following comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is very mild and not ojectionable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squeeze only an amount the size of a quarter into your palm and it will be enough to do your face and neck. You will get many uses out  of one tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes eye makeup which was an unexpected but welcome surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product it is recommended that you use moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a five star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, she is pleased. Me too.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, but not as mild as normal cold cream.  You do not want to get this near your eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent cleanser that leaves your skin glowing. I have been using it for about a week now and can see am improvement in my complexion. I an also using another product in this line, the make-up removing wipes. I have been using them for over a month. I will gladly endorse this entire line of products. They contain some type of clay (kaolin?) that is said to draw impurities from the skin. However they work, they do work, really well. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CLEANSER!!!!! It washes my makeup off and does not leave my skin dry and tight, I wish ponds would make it available in stores.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!   We would like to order more than 5 at a time and how about free shipping?</li>
            <li> I just received this today and have used it once.  I like it very much.  If you add a little water after you spread it on your face it makes a very small amount of lather and you can rub it around on your face easily.  I removed it by splashing then with a warm washcloth. I liked it better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve used.  I don&#x27;t like cold cream as I always feel that it is leaving a residue on my skin.  I have always washed my face with Dove soap but am trying to switch to something gentler.  Noxema is a good cleanser but it does leave a tight feeling.  So, I believe that I&#x27;m going to like this very much.  I&#x27;m 77 years old with very nice skin so I hope this doesn&#x27;t harm it any. I&#x27;ll report back later if I have any problems. 2 weeks later:  Well, I am ordering more so I&#x27;ll be sure not to run out.  I have not been able to find this anywhere else in stores or on line.</li>
            <li> This cream is so smooth and feels wonderful on your face.  You only need a little so it lasts long.  It&#x27;s unscented now, but the old scent was so great.  I miss that.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but somehow after I bought it at Walmart 1 year ago, I cannot find it in local stores any more.  Glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  Leaves my face clean and soft.  Rinses off completely.  Especially good for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin care.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 1mth now and have seen a difference in the tone of my skin, it leaves skin clean and refreshed without over drying.  This is a great makeup remover as well, I will def be repurchasing and recommending to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am particular about the facial cleansers that I use. I found this product to be nicely scented..nothing overbearing. THe consistency was nice. It was very creamy and thick so a little goes a long way. It lathers nicely, washes off clean and removed all makeup easily. As far as the claims of making my skin more lumonious..didn&#x27;t notice any of that. It&#x27;s facial cleanser after all.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every facial cleanser out there and this is my favorite.  The smell is awesome-very fresh and feminine.  It completely took off all makeup, including foundation and waterproof mascara.  My skin feels soft and smooth.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Cleans the face nicely, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out like other products and the price was reasonable.  I will use again in the future.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product and scent. Easy to use and non pore-clogging, so it is great to use home or away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell but the cleaner is nice and makes me feel refreshed. I like Ponds BB cream though!</li>
            <li> The texture of this is wonderful.  It is smooth and leaves my skin feeling silky and clean afterward.I still use a moisturizer but this definitely hydrates as well.</li>
            <li> Good foaming creamy effective cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, but seems to clean it thoroughly, and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin!</li>
            <li> Another great product from ponds .a happy customer.</li>
            <li> It is a brand I has been using all my life .</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser. It is very gentle yet works well.&lt;br /&gt;My face is left feeling squeaky clean yet not dry.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell, a little girly, but not terrible. The scent does not linger.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it too with no complaints.</li>
            <li> it worked as a normal soap, I did not feel any difference on my face. I never order this again.</li>
            <li> I hated this cleanser. The scent is mild, but the texture was awful. It felt almost greasy, and left my face feeling like it was coated with slime. It also did not remove my makeup in any way, but instead just smeared everything down my face. I had to wash my face several times to get it to feel clean. It was one of the worst cleansers that I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Since buying this product, I have found the best cleanser ever: Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser. It really removes your makeup (even mascara) while you wash your face. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product -- it gets my skin clean without drying it out. It has a nice, fresh scent and you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it. I do use makeup remover first, especially around the eyes. This isn&#x27;t the heavy cold cream for which Pond&#x27;s became famous; it&#x27;s a light, gentle cleanser to use after you&#x27;ve removed your makeup. I have \\&quot;combination\\&quot; skin, and this works well on both dry and oily areas. The 6-ounce tube should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s produced a nice luminous cleanser that will leave one&#x27;s skin feeling refreshed and clean.  When first applying a small portion of the cream, the undeniable fresh scent that automatically comes from the contents of the medium tube invigorates the senses with a variety of floral fragrances leaving a lasting impression after the first use.  For consumers that have used other notable brands of cleanser, Pond&#x27;s is comparable, especially because of the beautiful scent and the satisfying results.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth and relaxing cleansing lotion packaged in a tube.  A little goes a long way so use it sparingly.  I like the way it feels on my skin...smooth and cleansing.  It offers no miracles but provides what I need it to do....cleanse my face without drying it, and leaving it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when my Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products arrived in the mail.  I have been using the Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser for the past five days as part of my daily showering routine.  I was very pleased upon first trying the product, noting that the texture was very creamy and soft unlike my previous facial washes.  I also enjoyed the floral fragrance; it was a welcome after dealing with other products that definitely had a \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; smell to them.  I have been applying the cleanser according to the directions.  I have noticed a visible reduction in the number of blackheads and it has left my face feeling clean and reinvigorating. Most importantly, my face was not left dry and flaky or with a burning sensation. I would highly recommed this product to anyone with a dry/oily skin combination who is looking for a change from the smelly, overpriced, burning products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl a Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> I love Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser. After using the product, it left my skin feeling clean, and refresh. The great thing about this product, it leaves no residue on the skin. Overall this product is great and if your looking for a great product, Pond&#x27;s is your choice.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is moisturizing and silky. It leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed without that irritating tightness afterwards! It is very gentle, i have very sensitive skin and had no irritation with this product! Only a small amount is needed, so it is cost efficient as well! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this worked really well for my daughter.  she needed a  hypoallergenic product to use to wash her face before using her acne medicine.  it works great and even better smells great! I  used it myself  and it made my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean line left my face feeling fresh, not dry. Most face cleansers tend to dry my skin out and leave my face feeling tight (especially during the winter) this product didn&#x27;t do that. It left my skin feeling fresh and clean and it has a nice light, clean fragrance. The cream cleanser was great for daily use and the towelettes are a great option if you&#x27;re in a rush or on the go.  I would definitely recommend it and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> For the past week I&#x27;ve been using both the cream cleanser and the wet wipes. After the first use (of the cleanser) I was pretty convinced that this product wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. My face was unhappy it was red and blotchy in general just kinda ehhh. However I did notice it was less greasy. While less greasy is a plus, the blotchy and angry, if it continued, wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. I went to sleep. Once I woke up I realized that I had no rash!!! This was a new experience for me. I can honestly say that I almost never get away with cleansing my skin and not having a rash. So I decided to keep trying the product despite the initial discomfort. The second day I only used the wipes and skipped washing with the cleanser and only used the wipes. Today I took a photo of myself. My skin on my face feels great. Not oily, not dry, and not blotchy. The only criticism I have for this product is this: the packaging does not say if it is for daily use or weekly use. If you have seriously sensitive skin like I do I would recommend not using both the face wash and the wipes every day. Maybe every other day for the wash and 2 out of 3 days for the wipes.</li>
            <li> I loved this cream cleanser!  It smells fresh and not full of chemicals.  You can feel the clay in it and there is a slight grainy texture that is a very gentle exfoliate.  I use it in the morning and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s brighter and my pores seem smaller.  I definitely would recommend this face cleanser to my friends.</li>
            <li> I found this cleanser to work pretty well for my skin. The product has a creamy texture that lathers easily and its scent is pleasant and not overpowering. After rinsing, I noticed that my face felt a little dry, but my everyday moisturizer quickly fixed that, and my skin was left with a lovely glow that I loved.</li>
            <li> I rarely use drug store type face products, whether it be make-up or cleansers, so imagine my surprise when I actually liked the results from using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using it once to twice a day for the last week and my skin is considerably less dry and less blotchy. I have very fair, sensitive skin and finding a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me red and itchy is quite a feat. It also leaves zero residue. Every cream cleanser I&#x27;ve tried has left my skin feeling sticky and not all that clean. This one rinses clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser delivers the results I want and has me considering giving up the more expensive brand I was using prior to giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! It&#x27;s a new find - highly recommended. Feels great &amp; creamy, washes off easily, &amp; leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped &amp; dry. I&#x27;ll be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I was able to get this really amazing product for free from BzzAgent.  When i recieved it, it was packaged really well. I was excited to open it and shocked, frankly that these were NOT any small sample sizes, but 4 very large full size items to keep and use for myself!!  The smell of both the cream cleanser and towelettes were very pleasant.  When I first put a small dab of the cream cleanser on my fingertip, it looked like a pearl!  It was very smooth and silky!  I enjoyed the feel of it on my face and felt it was moisturizing and gentle.  It didnt leave me feeling tight and taunt after my cleansing, but refreshed!  The towlettes are of good size and were tried before and also after I cleaned my face with my regular cleanser. I was very surprised at the amount of make up that my old cleanser left on my face!! Even if I dont buy this cleanser.. i know I wont be purchasing my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; one anymore, thats for sure! I like the availibility of being able to clean my face on the go, since I go to the gym.. but it would be nice if these came in smaller packaging. Maybe in single packs? That you could throw in your purse? I would have given 5 stars if it were for that.  This would be something my family would buy, knowing how clean it gets our faces.. especially with teenage daughters who may not clean their faces like they should!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream cleanser. I have very sensitive skin and I am usually hesitant to try something new. I am lucky enough to be a bzz agent and was able to try this product for free. I wish I would have tried it sooner. The smell is light and refreshing. My face feels smooth and very clean. Radiant is the word that comes to mind to sum it up. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Great for sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> I recently until now  was using the Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser wasn&#x27;t really happy with it because it made my face dry and felt tight after washing my face, and had dry patches.  So I was happy when I received the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Wet Cleaning Towelettes.  I loved the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and it made my face feel soft and had a heathy glow to it.  Also the Wet Cleansing Towelettes and they removed my eye makeup very well and had no bad reactions to either product even on my eyes.  The towelettes seal is very tight and don&#x27;t think I will have a problem with the seal lifting and the product drying out.  So very happy with the cleaner and towelettes and when the product runs out I will repurchase the items.  Would be good for anyone with normal, dry, or combination skin, however might be good for someone with oily skin due to the Kaolin Clay.</li>
            <li> I used this cream cleanser along with the towelettes available in this skin care line. After the first day, I felt a difference in the texture of my skin, and my skin itself felt revitalized. My dry patches are gone, the blemishes in my face and neck are clearing, and my pores are actually shrinking. My face feels refreshed and has a glow to it that I haven&#x27;t had since I was a teenager! My only dislike abou this skin care line is that the towelettes have a very strong scent. While it is a pleasant, floral scent, it is a bit strong and causes my sinuses to itch some when I am using them. I would definitely recommend those who are considering this product to try it, and share with a friend. The difference in your skin after even just a few days is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Cream Cleanser as well as the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Towlettes for free through bzzagent.com. My skin is very sensitive and I was hesitant to try this cleanser at first, but immediately after using the cleanser for the first time, I noticed that it is very moisturizing. It left my skin clean and very soft. Initially I thought that the scent would bother me. It smells kind of strong (not unpleasant though) in the packaging. But once applied to the face, the scent is not bothersome at all and does not seem as strong anymore. The cleanser lathers up really nicely, so only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> I received the luminous clean cream cleanser and towelettes as part of a Bzzkit for Bzzagent.com. I&#x27;ve tried lots of cleansers to cope with my adult acne and dull skin over the years so I was quite skeptical that this product would actually brighten my skin let alone really clean my face without leaving it feeling like a dried husk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for two weeks alongside the towelettes and was very surprised that it did, in face, brighten my skin some. I would use the towelettes first to remove any makeup, then apply the cleanser. The best part is that my acne has started to clear up. Even when I forget to use it for day my skin didn&#x27;t freak out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very pleasant, but not overbearing odor and felt very silky on my skin. It never burned my skin, or left it feeling dry. My skin just felt so soft after every use. I&#x27;ve actually stopped trying to use my generic pro active like product and I&#x27;m switching to this. I can&#x27;t deny that I got real results this time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fairly faithful user of Clean and Clear cleansers of the years. I always thought it worked decent with my combination skin. When I received the package with the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Towelettes I was skeptical. The cream cleanser is \\&quot;enriched with moisturizing ingredients and soft white Kaolin clay: a natural mineral known to act like a magnet to draw out deep-dwelling impurities.\\&quot; It claims to be a product that \\&quot;gently draws out impurities and make-up to brighten dull skin.\\&quot; It keeps up on its promise. I use this every morning and use the towelettes at night. The cream is a white pearly color and gently foams when rubbed into my skin. It has a faint rose scent, but not strong enough to irritate my nose. The towelettes are thicker than any others I have tried. They have a quilted type pattern which helps remove my make-up at night. It moisturizes my skin and leaves me feeling fresh. I would highly recommend this and I am now a customer of theirs!</li>
            <li> This face wash met my standards, I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to face wash. I have sensitive combination skin. I was oil free for most of the day and in the morning it made my face feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> This  product is fabulous gives you a deep clean feeling with a fresh feminine fragrance. Leaves your skin feeling smooth and refreshed, and the best thing.  They have a portable pack of towelettes  that you can carry on the go to get the same refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream cleanser and towelettes for over a week in place of my clinique cleanser.  They have been very mild on my face and I have noticed that my skin is not as dried out after washing it.  I am very pleased with the results and have not had a breakouts since using the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean.  I received the cleanser and towelettes as part of a bzzagent campaign.  Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> This cream cleanser left my skin feeling super soft and clean without the tightness.  Removed even the most stubborn eye makeup and a full day&#x27;s worth of grime from my sensitive/breakout prone skin.  I&#x27;m actually seeing an improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance, too!  Definitely a Pond&#x27;s girl now.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser for about a week and half, and so far I love it. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, while it gently cleanses and detoxes your skin. It&#x27;s also great a removing face makeup if you wear powder or foundation. I love how my face feels after washing with the cleanser. The Luminous Clean Towlettes are also great at removing makeup and great to ready your skin for the Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser. Although I have oily skin I don&#x27;t find this cleanser to be too moisturizing for my skin and that&#x27;s because of the white kaolin clay I believe. The kaolin clay helps to draw out oil and impurities from the skin, and it seems  to actual help control the oiliness of my skin and to balance it out. I allowed my mother who has dry skin to use the product and she loves it too. All in all I would definitely recommend that you at least try this product out. I think it would be great for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Pros-  smell great, clean feeling, value&lt;br /&gt;cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this cleaner is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like cleaner.  Many other cleaners smell like chemicals or strong perfumes.  I love the gentle fresh smell of this cleaner.  My kids are always asking to smell it when I am using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner works well and is a great value.  In my opinion there are lots of great cleaners that you can use.  The difference in this cleaner and most is the smell.  It is a light gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t irritate me when I go to bed after cleaning my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received both the Pond&#x27;s towelettes and the cream cleanser as part of the BzzKit. I am truly impressed with the value and benefits of both.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Cream cleansers&amp;#34; to me are hit or miss because although I like the more moisturizing components of them I often feel as though they can leave a film or not give me that fresh, clean feeling.  This was totally different.  It lathered nicely so you really felt it work into your skin and my skin, which typically gets very dry immediately after washing, felt soft and not tight or dry at all after.  I also used it with full makeup on instead of starting with an eye makeup remover, and it did a wonderful job of removing my eye makeup while still feeling really gentle!  Great products!</li>
            <li> I usually pay $15-$20 for a facial cleanser. When I ran out, I wanted to try something less expensive. I tried the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean cleanser &amp; towelettes. I loved the cleanser! It goes on very creamy and the smell is light, but pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face and does a great job removing make-up. The towelettes I found useful to remove eye make-up and pre-clean my face before showering. Even though the towelettes took most of my make-up off, I would still do a quick wash with the Ponds cleansing cream. Anyone wanting a nice creamy cleanser, that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, I would recommend the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean line.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly Surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  I love the fact that the cream cleanser comes in an easy to squeeze tube like bottle that stands up side down with a flip top cap, so there will never be a struggle to get the cleanser out of the tube.  The towelettes conveniently come in their own re-sealable pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent/Texture/Dosage:  This cream cleanser has a light, clean, feminine scent that simply enhances the beauty ritual of face cleansing.  I must admit that I was reluctant to try this product due to its categorization of being a cream cleanser.  I am not typically a fan of these products because they lack the sudsy, foamy, scrubbing bubbles and tends to leave my skin with that not so clean feeling....but not this one!!!  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this pearly white \\&quot;cream cleanser\\&quot; actually does have a bit of thick, soft, fluffy foaminess to it.  You will only need about a nickel-sized dollop, as a little goes a long way.  The towelettes have the same light fragrance with a pre-moistened, pre-portioned, slightly textured soft cloth that creates and effortless and thoughtless face cleansing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I was a bit frightened at first because I was beginning to breakout a bit during the first week.  I think that this was due to the product drawing out impurities, dirt and grime that were leaving my skin dull and pasty.  Not for long!  After using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Wet Cleansing Towelettes, my combination skin was left feeling softer, smoother, clearer, and glowing with smaller pores.  However, my face did feel a tad tight so I made sure to follow up with moisturizer after each cleansing.  I washed my face twice a day with the cleanser (except for the times that I was feeling far too exhausted and lazy so I reached for the ultra convenient and equally effective towelettes.  (Don&#x27;t judge, you have all been there!)  I love that this product comes in to forms, the cleanser and the lazy girl toweletteso that you don&#x27;t have to veer from you regimen when your too tired to wash your face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Absolutely.  I would recommend this product for people with oily to combination skin and plan to continue using it myself.</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream allowed me to get a deep and refreshing cleaning! It is soft enough to feel luxurious but lathers enough to be clean and  fulfilling. Finally, when I am done using it,  my face has such a glow that I feel like I look younger.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well, even removing waterproof mascara, but it&#x27;s kind of messy, so I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a great job of taking my makeup off by itself, but it does make my skin nicer!</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin clear, feels great and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal age perfect cleanser which I love but it became quite pricey so I thought I would try this one the smell is&lt;br /&gt;not so great I have sensitive skin I felt it dried my skin to much  I did like the exfoiliating  beads in it though</li>
            <li> This cream cleanser is very mild and has a soft scent.  It cleans my skin well without drying it.  I&#x27;m excited that I&#x27;ve found something that works for me!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I tried this product free through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product but it&#x27;s definitely not suited for my: combination, oily and still sensitive skin. After using it I found that it basically just sat on top of my skin and didn&#x27;t do the deep cleaning that my face needs. I found myself using the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Wet Towelettes after this process and the wipes had residue from what the cleanser left behind. Also, the fragrance is a little over powering and could stand to be lightened just a bit. It was a little difficult not to take breaks while wiping my face because the scent was so intense. Again I&#x27;ll state this isn&#x27;t a bad product but for someone with my skin I don&#x27;t believe it would be beneficial to add to their skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I loved the product! The towelettes are great when you are in a hurry or had a long day. They are refreshing! The cleaner also leaves my face feeling great!</li>
            <li> I received this cleanser through BzzAgent and received it today. This morning I used the POND&#x27;S Luminious Cream Cleanser. LOVE IT!! This literally feels liks I&#x27;m putting lotion on my face. So smooth and rich - and left my skin feeling so wonderful. I usually prefer a daily scrub because I&#x27;ve always felt that was the only way I could get my face to feel this fresh but I stand corrected. I will definitely switch to this product. I&#x27;ve already told my mom and mother in law about it and I brought the products in to work to share the news with my friends!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products and I was very impressed!!  The Cream cleanser worked wonderful on my skin.  It wasn&#x27;t harsh and I have had less break outs since using this product.  I liked that I didn&#x27;t have that awful dried out feeling afterwards like other soaps/cleansers leave your skin feeling.  This product had a wonderful light scent to it and left my skin with a more natural glow!!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product!  I use the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser both in and out of the shower!  It always leaves my face feeling clean and fresh and my skin feels so soft afterwards! One of the biggest things I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical or cleanser! It has an awesome fresh smell that I love!</li>
            <li> I received the ponds luminous facial cleanser and wipes from BzzAgent for review:I am loving the pond&#x27;s luminous facial wipes.....it cleans the skin, does not irritate (I have sensitive skin), and are thick wipes like a cloth. the wipes are better than any other brand I have tried---definitely a product i plan on using for as long as available.....the facial cleanser is an OK cleanser does the job but for me the wipes are the star in this line!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the POND&#x27;S® Luminous Clean(tm) Cream Cleanser for a few days now and I really like them.  I stopped using my usual Mary Kay cleanser to give this a try and my skin feels great.  The cleanser has a wonderful fragrance and has a pearl like look to it.  Only a small amount is needed to work up a rich lather on my face.  It washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED the Ponds Luminous Clean cream wash!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the wash, my face felt clean, smooth and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was fresh, clean and fabulous! Both products proved to be gentle on my sensitive skin and left me with a subtle dewy glow (not greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t possibly list enough positives about these products. I feel the information on the website as well as packaging is very informative and answered all of my questions regarding performance and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ponds line surpassed its promises of clean and radiant skin...I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I have definitely shared this gem with friends and family who are looking for an affordable skin care system  with high quality results!</li>
            <li> I tried this cleanser and it feels great on my skin. I wanted to know if it would give me the cleanse I needed without drying my skin. It did just that. It cleaned my face and left me with skin as soft as my 8 month old. The cleanser looks like pearls and is very light. I only needed a dime size to clean my whole face. It comes in a 6.oz tube. This should last me a while. Thanks Pond&#x27;s for letting me try it. I love it and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I really like this Ponds luminous cleanser. I was given both the creamy cleanser and the towelettes free from BzzAgent.com to use and review. I usually only use proactive on my face because I have adult acne so I was a little apprehensive to use this but I do really like it. It smells really good and a little goes a long way. Add just a little bit to your face then put warm water on a wash rag and it suds up so much making your face feel squeaky clean after wards. I really enjoy using the towelettes to take my make up off at the end of a busy work day when I am too lazy to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was overwhelming.  Did not too a great job of removing makeup.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in my age bracket then the word &#x60;Pond&#x27;s&#x27; probably brings to mind memories of greasy cold cream that was guaranteed to clog your pores and cause your skin to breakout.  But this is not your mother&#x27;s &#x60;Pond&#x27;s&#x27;; the brand has definitely expanded on their product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creamy cleanser works quite well to dissolve make-up and oil and leave your skin squeaky clean, but not tight and dry.  (I should note that I do use a make-up remover before I cleanse).  About a nickel sized amount should do the trick; you don&#x27;t need a lot of product. The 6 oz. container should last a long time.  It rinses away clean, with no product residue left behind.  There is a slight floral/rose water scent that is not overpowering, but definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked really well on my combination skin, which is usually oily in the t-zone but is overall much drier now that the weather has turned cold.  Those with oily and/or acne prone skins might find the product a bit too creamy.  I would NOT recommend this for anyone sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended as a good all-around cleanser; good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retired makeup artist so like to try new things when it comes to skincare...This Pond&#x27;s product rather surprised me......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a tube will last a LONG TIME as you don&#x27;t need very much at all....even an amount the size of a dime is a lot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, &amp; does not lather, but then, lather doesn&#x27;t clean anyway!! it just lathers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say I am very pleased with this product, and it&#x27;s worth a try, for both men and women..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pond&#x27;s, you have a winner!!!</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ponds Luminous Clean products are wonderful! First off - the smell is delicious. It has a nice light, floral scent. Cream Cleanser went on smooth and came off easily during rinsing. It left my face clean, moisturized and smelling wonderful. The soft white Kaolin clay really helped get the dirt and impurities from my pores and left my face radiant. The wet cleansing towelettes left the same refreshing, clean feeling as the cream cleanser but are more convienent when in a hurry or just needing a quick refresher - would be perfect to throw in a gym bag.</li>
            <li> I love how the cream is not oily or greasy.  It made my skin feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes were soft and not abrasive.  Easy to put in your purse or bag and have on hand when you need to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my face feels and looks more radiant :)  Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean smells great too!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Pond&#x27;s product but have always heard positive things about the brand. Let me tell you, my skin feels softer than it ever has! I&#x27;ve been spending a lot more money on name brand expensive products, and they have not been providing the results I&#x27;ve seen &amp; felt with Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser. The cleanser is gentle, yet removes make-up without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> The POND&#x27;S luminous cream cleanser left my skin feeling clean without it being too oily or too dry. The smell wasn&#x27;t too fragrant, which is hard to come by, and had a spa-esque scent. The cream felt light as I put it on and wasn&#x27;t hard to wash off either. It removed all make-up with minimal left under my eye (could easily remove with a Q-Tip) just like every other cleanser I have used. I would recommend to a friend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> The New Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and the Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes is a must have..I had the biggest pimple on my face right beteew my nose and lip area (what a better time to arrive in mail),as well as makeup to cover the pimple.The first thing I did was, pull out the wet cleansing towelettes and start wiping my face. I&#x27;d notice a feeling of this tingling sensation on my face and, not a bad feeling a smoothing sensation so, I had to go look and the mirror and;with one towelette.I&#x27;d taken all the make up off (woohoo money saver).Later that night I took a shower,I&#x27;d applied the cleanser cream on my face. I let the cleanser set on my face then I rinse my face last. The next morning that big pimple.I spoke about earlier was dried out and nothing but a scab.After three days of using both of these Pond&#x27;s products my11 year old son came up to me and said.\\&quot; Mom are you getting lighter or something\\&quot; I said why,I look lighter?\\&quot;He said yes,but you look light in a nice way\\&quot; I&#x27;ve have, had problem with acne and dark spots,I used this products for about five days now,not even a full week and I&#x27;ve seen changes.My face now soft, the dark spots are fading away my face has a natural glow,the cream cleanser has the texture of a Mask or Clay but not as heavy, when on the face,I love the soft scent (it&#x27;s not a overwhelming scent)I love this product and I&#x27;ll keep buying and telling everyone,I know about this product especially if they have embarrassed skin moments like myself,I also wanna let y&#x27;all know I&#x27;d used Pond&#x27;s once daily to get the result I&#x27;ve gotten.I didn&#x27;t know about Pond&#x27;s and how great their products really are, I don&#x27;t need a monthly subscription that&#x27;ll cost me $400.00 a year.I&#x27;ve found something way better and,the cost is lesser. Thanks again to Bzz agent as well as thanks to Pond&#x27;s for creating such a great product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This cream cleanser really is the creamiest I&#x27;ve tried. I like the texture and the way it cleans. I switched from a foaming gel cleanser, which seemed a little hash and was very satisfied with this cream cleanser. It rinses clean but leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> After just two weeks of using this product my skin feels smoother and looks more even than before.  Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser washes away easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  I have tried my products to control the oil and dryness of my skin and I rank this at the top.  I will defintely be telling my friends to give this one a try!</li>
            <li> I have used Ponds products in earlier years. Trying this new \\&quot;Luminous Clean\\&quot; Cream Face Cleanser by Ponds gave me a surprising experience. I expected the cream application to be a bit abrasive with a little wait.  However, When I applied it, I found it easy to rub in and to quickly penetrate to remove the makeup and days dust. It left my skin soft and getting moisture. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I found this cleanser looking for a replacement for my longtime cleanser St. Ives cream cleanser. I wash my face in the shower and have tried others and they always burn my eyes. This cleaner is an excellent choice! I have fresh, clean skin and all eye make up removed with this product. I never have skin breakouts, so it clearly cleans my skin well. And a little goes a LONG way! I put about a nickel size amount in my hand and then apply it to my face with my hands and then rinse it off. PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Good cleanser, removes all my makeup, doesnt leave skin tight ,and despite its wonderful scent hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin and roseacea. Can actually say it does make skin luminous if massaged for 30 seconds or more after a weeks use noticed less roseacea bumps and soft smooth texture with a bit of a glow. On my second bottle thanks to those results. Actually liked it more than my Elizabeth Grant cleanser.</li>
            <li> i gave this to the wife to use.  she used just a little bit on her face while taking a shower.  after he shower i asked her how te cleaner did.  she said that the skin cleaner worked really well.  it got alot of the deep dirt out of her skin and it felt softer.  i touched her face and it did feel softer.  her skin also looked shinny(er).  she said she would recommend this product for a deeper cleaning.  she gave some to her young neice, ( who triles on the make-up )  the neice said that her face felt softer, looked cleaner and was shinny(er).  she said she would buy it to help get the excess makeup residoooooooooooooo  off her face.  so here yah go from a grandma to a teeny bopper they say it is great stuff for cleansing of dah face</li>
            <li> Although to be fair, I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, so your mileage may vary. The Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser does get my face clean without a dry after feeling, but I can&#x27;t exactly same my skin is glowing (a bit too old for that). The cleanser is fairly creamy, so takes a bit of extra rinsing (or use a washcloth to get it all). I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smells, and while this product is scented, it&#x27;s very light and pleasant. My only quibble is the packaging, with the upsidedown tube, the product leaks out into the lid causing some of it to be wasted. I&#x27;d have preferred a push dispenser. This is a product I would definitely buy again, I&#x27;ve always used Neutrogena, but they&#x27;ve gotten a bit heavy handed with the added scents.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser. It was super gentle on my sensitive skin. I will definitely use this product again!</li>
            <li> I really liked the Pond&#x27;s Cream Cleanser - it left my skin feeling soft and smooth, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my face like my normal face wash does. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too keen on was that it doesn&#x27;t lather like a face wash usually does...that is one thing I like about my current products. Other than that though, the product was really good and I like the soft, refreshing scent it has.</li>
            <li> This product is not only making my face clean and soft, but my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s face is clearing from acne, and is soft and clean now. No more build up! Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am always a little hesitant before trying a new face wash product. I have been stuck on one certain face wash for over 10 years and every time I buy a new one it never compares to my first love! Ponds has shockingly surprised me because honestly I couldn&#x27;t find a reason to not like it!  The face wash left my face feeling clean without a filmy residue. I didn&#x27;t feel over dry or rubbery before I put lotion on.  I was also pleasantly surprised that my makeup was successfully removed without having to scrub! The wipes were not really for me because I did feel like it left a soapy residue but the face wash will be added as a house favorite on the shopping list!</li>
            <li> The cream cleaner is a generous 6oz size and very creamy. You only need a dime sized amount to clean your whole face and neck. It lathers well and rinses off clean. I like this cleaner and I have been using a far more expensive cleaner and this works just as well if not better. Again I do not see any brightness that is new but I have just started using this item. The cream cleanser won&#x27;t clog pores and is hypoallergenic. I have sensitive skin and this is fine with me. I think that this product would be something that I would use again and again.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample via bzzagent,Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cleanser left my skin feeling wonderful, it felt so soft and purely clean. There are no harsh scents which really helped me to enjoy this product. Radiant is not the word for how my face feels, it is so soft and looks like it has a amazing glow, which was not there prior to using ponds. I think I am a pond&#x27;s fan for life.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got this product. It&#x27;s my new favorite cleanser and I&#x27;ll never go back to my old one! I love the smell and the consistency of the cleanser. Only a small amount is needed because it suds so well.  I use this product twice a day, morning and night. I LOVE the way it smells!</li>
            <li> I am a heavy makeup user, and I also have combination type skin, so finding a product that can remove all residual makeup without drying me out is sometimes challenging. I have used may different brands of face wash and when I got the POND&#x27;S® Luminous Clean(tm) Cream Cleanser, I immediately noted this product was different from others. First, the smell is so great! Its very light, yet clean and pleasant. The second thing I noticed was the creamy texture. The words ribbon and silky come to mind when describing it. The minute you squeeze the tube you can see how hydrating and gentle it will be. It goes on so smoothly and feels really great, the best part is althought its so gentle, it really was effective at removing traces of dirt &amp; maekup. I really felt like my skin was glowing and radiant.</li>
            <li> I loved this new face wash. I&#x27;m not a fan of over perfumed, harsh face washes so I really like this new cleanser from Ponds. It has a nice light scent and feels so smooth on your face. It didn&#x27;t irritate at all and made my face feel really soft after. I also got the towelettes which are awesome for the gym. They&#x27;d be perfect for camping too (or just when I&#x27;m too lazy to actually wash my face haha).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely crazy for both the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Luminous Clean Towelettes. Having acne-prone, combination skin I&#x27;m always looking for a product that not only clears up breakouts, but also keeps from drying out my skin -- this product does just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using the towelettes at night to take off any makeup before bed and I love starting my day off using the cream cleanser in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean line, I can now say that I have clean, clear and well moisturized skin!</li>
            <li> This product is really awesome. It smells really great it has a silky feel to it and it really cleaned my skin. My face is really oily and certain soaps and face cleaners I can not use, but I really love this product. It cleaned out my pours and really opened them up. It actually felt like my face could breath. I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I was so very impressed with this product! I love the scent-not too overpowering-but still pleasant. It is so thick and creamy-it is like putting lotion on your face. I use it every morning in the shower and my skin feels soft, and moisturized and clean! I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a cleaner that spoils you and cleans at the same time!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good face wash for YEARS and spent way too much money on horrible products. Every face wash dries my face out too much and makes it peeling and pimply. This face wash has made my skin look and feel SOOOOOOO good. I have never been happier with any beauty supply item. I have been using it for a month now. It smells flowery which scared me a little at first but it has done no harm to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> love Ponds - have been using their products forever - this especially leaves my skin smooth and silky.  highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used this product yesterday and I found it comparable to products that cost twice as much. It left my skin feeling soft and moist, removed makeup well.  I will definitley be purchasing this in the future, and recommend that you give it a try for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the second Pond&#x27;s product I have tried, and I was heartily surprised at what a quality product this is. My only experience before trying the wipes (and then the wash) was the old Pond&#x27;s cold cream from &#x27;back in the day&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using MAC&#x27;s Cremewash cleanser for a few months and like it, and the Pond&#x27;s product compares to the MAC product in consistency and usage. I don&#x27;t think the Pond&#x27;s is like any of the Olay cleansing products. Pond&#x27;s is most like a cross between a cold cream and liquid cleanser and it&#x27;s quite unlike most any other drugstore cleansers I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the scent is wonderful! I am very sensitive to fragrance; if it stinks I won&#x27;t use it, and even the fragrance can irritate my skin and make it feel chapped and tortured. The Pond&#x27;s product smells like something you would get at a high-end makeup counter! It smells like LUXURY. It&#x27;s so nice. I love it! I would recommend using a little water and building the lather before you put it on your face, you use less product and it seems to work more effectively this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have older skin, and it&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip it dry, or make it feel tight, itchy, flaky, you name it. When I read that this has clay in it, I expected that it would be very drying since that is what clay does. But....no. Just soft and wonderful! It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling coated either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MAC Cremewash cleanser is superior to the Pond&#x27;s cleanser at removing eye makeup. If Pond&#x27;s removed my eye makeup, I would have rated it 5 stars. So with the Pond&#x27;s I have to first use an eye makeup remover, and then follow up with the Pond&#x27;s cleanser. MAC&#x27;s cleansing cream takes it all off in one swipe. However, for the price I think I can live with this little issue. In every other area, the Pond&#x27;s product is just as nice as the more expensive MAC cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price wise, the MAC Cremewash is $5.88 an ounce (I order directly from MAC to avoid fakes). Pond&#x27;s at Amazon price (as of this review) is $1.04 an ounce. I don&#x27;t even want to say that the Pond&#x27;s is nice &#x60;for a drugstore product&#x27;, because I feel that if this were packaged and sold at a high-end counter, it could pass for a high-end branded product. At a mere fraction of the price of premium-branded products, I find this Pond&#x27;s cleanser to be something that I will buy again and again. It doesn&#x27;t smell or act like a drugstore cleanser, and I&#x27;d even say that I like this better than a lot of the high-end cleansers I have tried. Certainly like it better than the Olay cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This cleanser is FABULOUS to use with a Clarisonic! Just squeeze out a dime size amount, spread it on your dry face, wet your Clarisonic brush and have at it. By the time you finish a cycle, the cleanser has dispersed all over your face and made a nice cleansing buffer, and rinses away with no residue. I&#x27;m able to do the two cycles I really need, without irritation. LOVE this cleanser! I also love that it freshens the bristles on my Clarisonic&#x27;s brush head; normally I have to wash the brush head out with soap in order to avoid that sour smell it inevitably gets. Don&#x27;t need to with this product! I have upgraded it to five stars, because I&#x27;ve found myself reaching for this cleanser over any other when I need to wash my face (cleansing oil not included). It&#x27;s just so gentle and I love how it leaves my face. I have purchased more and will continue.akes). Pond&#x27;s at Amazon price (as of this review) is $1.04 an ounce.

            <li> I have been using Ponds Cold Cream and Deep Cleanser for nearly 2 decades, so I was pleased to try this new product. After using it for a week, I am disappointed. It does a good job cleaning but, unlike cold cream, it leaves my skin feeling dry and tight. I have normal skin, so dry skin after use was a surprise. It might be great for people with oily skin, but for normal or dry skin, I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of less importance, but still worth noting, the cream leaked into the cap when stored vertically (standing upright with the cap on the bottom). At 1st I thought I might have failed to close the cap tightly, but after cleaning it &amp; storing on end again, the next morning I encountered the same mess. After 2 days, I squeezed the cream into a jar (more like traditional Pond&#x27;s containers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I can only give it 2*, solely for its cleansing ability, and I have stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Really does remove all my makeup in one wash. I am truly amazed and happy with this product. The only downside for me is that it leaves my face very dry. It&#x27;s nothing a moisturizer can&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;m keeping this product!&lt;br /&gt;Had to stop using this after 3 weeks because it made my face so dry it started to peel and foundation wouldn&#x27;t still smoothly on my face. Now after a week of not using this product my face has returned to normal.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think I should stop believing marketing ads on products. I&#x27;ve used this for a week now but haven&#x27;t noticed anything different.HOWEVER its a pretty decent cream facial wash. Neutragena has that creamy facial wash in a tube and it works about the same. This product did nothing to &amp;#34;brightnen&amp;#34; my skin but it removes makeup &amp; made my skin feel clean wo overdrying it. Id use it again but definitely not going to think its going to give me better skin. Its good at removing makeup wo harshness after effects so I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> With cleansers it is hard to tell how good they really are.  Basically if you have decent skin and you use a cleanser, you should expect to maintain your skin and not have it get worse.  That is how it is in our family.  Fortunately we are not troubled with acne or big breakouts, so all I can say for this Pond&#x27;s cleanser is that it maintains our skin.  It definitely did not dry it out and during the winter, and that is a good thing.  It is clearly a huge step above hand soap, which has been resorted to on occasion, and your face feels like sandpaper afterwards.  This is nice, but isn&#x27;t enough to make me switch from my regular Cetaphil for sensitive skin, I really prefer a gentle, gentle cleanser.  Still, when my teenager tried it, she liked the feel of it, and if I were to keep buying it, she would use it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how silky this product is, and the scent is nice. But would prefer a citrus scent. Leaves skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I would prefer to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cleanser. It has a pleasant scent, foams just enough while using, and does not clump up. It cleans off all of my makeup, even the waterproof mascara. After using it my skin felt soft and smooth for many hours. This morning I did not experience any negative reaction to this product, so I will definitely keep using it. Thank you Pond&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya with this great facial cleaner!!! Just put some on your hand about the size of a dime, add water and you&#x27;ve got yourself a nice, sudsy cleaner that leaves your face feeling smooth and soft!  Another great factor about this product is it isn&#x27;t perfumey it has a mild clean smell to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, economic &amp; refreshing are the best words to describe this product!!</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s knocked the ball right out of the park with their Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.  While this product is the new kid on the block, Pond&#x27;s has been a trust brand for years.  This cleanser removes makeup and exfoliates without leaving skin feeling dry.  I have dry, sensitive skin, but use this cleanser daily without any irritation.  It has a pleasant smell and leaves your skin feeling soft.  This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Could not find this anywhere in the stores and was very excited to find it online.  Love the way it smells and it removes makeup great as well!  Much better than what I&#x27;ve found when I tried to find a replacement in the stores.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy consistency.  Toleratable fragrance.</li>
            <li> Mary and I both use this cleanser on alternate days with the exfoliating cleanser of the same brand. While other brands are harsh on my face and lead to skin flakiness, Ponds does not. We both now have a 35-year history of use of Ponds facial cleanser and it has done us well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the cream cleanser. During the winter my face feels so dry and looks dull, but after using the cream cleanser it really seemed brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products and I was very impressed!! The Cream cleanser worked wonderful on my skin. It wasn&#x27;t harsh and I have had less break outs since using this product. I liked that I didn&#x27;t have that awful dried out feeling afterwards like other soaps/cleansers leave your skin feeling. This product had a wonderful light scent to it and left my skin with a more natural glow!! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using CeraVe products for my face, but recently tried the Ponds luminous clean cream cleanser.  First off I loved the smell of the product, it wasn&#x27;t too strong or overpowering.  It has a creamy consistency and feels really smooth when it&#x27;s applied to the skin.  Its not oily or abrasive and washes off pretty easily.  I hate cleansers that take forever to wash off.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t love about this product was that my skin was a tad dry, which is to be expected for my type of skin if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer immediately.  I would definitely recommend trying this cleanser!</li>
            <li> With just 1 day of use you can tell the difference. My face is softer and feels fresh! I love it :-)</li>
            <li> I am not the type of person who wants to wash my face every night, adding an extra 15 minutes to my nightly routine. I want something quick, easy, and doesn&#x27;t have a million steps. As a mom of two kiddos and a military wife who is often on her own, I don&#x27;t have the time or energy for that. So, face washing often gets skipped! I decided to give Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash and cleansing towelettes a try...and I was actually quite impressed! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash had a great texture, it was silky, smooth, and felt nice rubbing in on my face. It wasn&#x27;t gritty like other washes I have tried. It had a wonderful fresh scent to it as well. Not too strong, and it left my face feeling soft. I was able to wash in just a couple minutes and be done with it! That is my kind of face wash routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cleansing towelettes are my favorite! They are great to quickly take off my makeup before bed, or simply refresh my face in the morning! They have the same great scent and the towelettes are soft. They do not require me to rinse my face like some other cloths do that I have tried. They even travel with me right in my purse! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would honestly recommend this product to anyone! I am so glad I was able to sample this product...I now know that I am going to be a customer for sure!</li>
            <li> I did a little experiment with this product- I washed off my makeup with my every day cleanser, then washed again, using the Pond&#x27;s cleanser and a white washcloth. It took off everything my normal cleanser didn&#x27;t! The cleanser left my face a bit tight and dry, but I can easily moisturize for a cleanser which works this well!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use cream cleansers so I was very skeptical when it was recommended to me.  I am so happy that I got this!  It&#x27;s a great simple cream cleanser that left my face feeling fresh, toned and clean.  Finally a cream cleanser that didn&#x27;t leave a film feeling on my face!  It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin because it does not contain any harsh beads or rough exfoliants and yet my skin had a gorgeous, radiant glow!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my skin feel silky smooth and less oily. I usually am hesitant to try new brands but im glad I tried Ponds. You don&#x27;t need a lot of the cleanser, just a dime size will do the trick! It also has a nice soft scent which I love.</li>
            <li> Creamy, moisturizing face cleanser.  Great as a body wash in a pinch</li>
            <li> I have very oil skin which may be why this irritates it. I have noticed breakouts since use. But if you have dry skin then this is really for you, It does make my skin feel very soft and moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product as part of a Bzzagent campaign. I definitely love the cleanser! It has a silky smooth texture (which I was not expecting, because it contains clay) and left my skin feeling soft, fresh, and... well, luminous! Love this stuff, and the price is very reasonable. A great value compared to some of the high end cleansers.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of face wash and used to think the ones with the scrubbers (that are so bad for your pores) were the only ones that made my face feel clean, but Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash changed my mind! Not only does my face feel clean, it feels silky after washing and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since I started using it. I am very satisfied with this face wash and plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I used the Ponds Luminous Clean face wash this morning, and my skin feels amazing.  The product is very creamy out of the tube.  After using the product my face feels very soft and moisturized, not dry like from most products I&#x27;ve tried.  I will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> My friend has great skin and I asked her what she uses and she said she uses what her Grandma used all her life - Ponds!  I loved the smell of this product and how light it felt.  The packaging is very simple and clean looking as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I use it along with the luminous towelettes. My skin feels great. It really is starting to clear up. I would recommend this stuff to everyone. I have been suffering with acne for a couple years and I have combination skin. So its tricky to find products that wont make me to dry or to oily.  I feel great about my skin again 5 stars you have one happy girl hear!! I would recommend this little gem to everyone. Thank you Ponds!!!</li>
            <li> I have used several difference facial cleansers and this is by far one of the best!  After using this product, my skin feeling so soft.  My skin feels so much better and does not look dry.  The towelettes are also nice for when you are on the go.  I would highly recommend Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean products to others.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this new Pond&#x27;s product. I tried it as part of a Bzz Agent campaign &amp; I will be purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;My over the top praise is based on the fact that I have very difficult combination skin that&#x27;s extremely sensitive &amp; it&#x27;s hard to keep it balanced &amp; not irritated. I also have psoriasis patches that become worse with some products.&lt;br /&gt;I had some doubts about the cleanser because it is so thick &amp; lotion like but it foamed up nicely &amp; a little goes a long, long way. I expect this tube to last twice as long as others that I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s a soothing cream that leaves my skin feeling hydrated &amp; soft &amp; actually brighter! I didn&#x27;t believe this advertising claim until I used it. It rinses very clean like soap but there&#x27;s no tightness afterwards like there can be with soap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not over the top about the scent though. It&#x27;s pleasant but there&#x27;s an underlying scent that I don&#x27;t care for too much. Maybe the clay. I&#x27;m not sure what it is but it&#x27;s not so much that it will stop me from using the product or rating it lower than 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;After using both the cleanser &amp; the towelettes consistently for 5 days I&#x27;m seeing a nice difference in my skin. Softer, more balanced, fewer dry patches, less redness &amp; my psoriasis spots have calmed down as well.&lt;br /&gt;Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser makes me a happy girl with happy skin!</li>
            <li> it does a good job leaving your skin feeling very soft after you wash, however if you have a face full of makeup it does not take it all off completely. It did not make my skin  break out at all.</li>
            <li> I received this just yesterday and before going to sleep, I tested it out to wash away my makeup. Well, the nice, thick foamy, creamy texture is almost FUN to play with while you rub it all over your face and the scent is quite pleasant and not over-bearing. Rinsing it off is a breeze and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or taught! I&#x27;m thrilled to have purchased this! I see me re-purchasing as soon as I&#x27;m down to my last squeeze!</li>
            <li> I used Ponds for many years before changing to Clinique and later to Clean and Clear. I used to like the Pond&#x27;s Cleanser a lot. Because of my previous experience, I thought I would like this product. I don&#x27;t, at all. I have mixed skin that vacillates between oily in the T zone and dry in the forehead. The cleanser left my face dry and tight. It barely foams at all and it did not fully remove my makeup. I had to use a cotton ball the remove the rest. There has been no luminous effect to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed by this product and will not be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a low cost product, so that&#x27;s always good.  I have dry, sensitive skin and use Philosopy purity cleanser.  This cleanser, in comparison is thicker and has a subtle scent that isn&#x27;t bad at all.  What I did not like is the tight feeling that I had after using it.  Then when I went to put on my night cream, it balled up because of the residue on my skin.  The ponds cleanser does have clay in it, so just make sure you rinse it really well. I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my face and I was so looking forward to this product! Sadly, it was not to be. After washing my face, I was happy to feel a cool refreshment to my skin but before long, I noticed the same tightness, burning and red spots that appear after I use any kind of soap on my face. It was passed to my sister who does not have the same problem as me and she loved it! I gave it three stars because of this.</li>
            <li> The first thing you&#x27;ll notice about this cleanser is the smell. It&#x27;s light, not overbearing in the slightest, and pleasant. Sort of like spring flowers mixed with a fresh ocean breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next - the feel. It&#x27;s more like a facial mask going on your skin than a typical cleanser, which makes me feel like I&#x27;m being pampered. Love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the effect. it leaves my skin feeling very clean, and surprisingly soft. Overall, I feel refreshed and renewed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides? The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that there&#x27;s a tightness to your face for a minute or so afterwards. Sort of the same effect you get when you use a clay mask, the Kaolin clay in this cleanser tightens your face a bit as it cleans. Truth be told, I think it&#x27;s a sign of a higher quality product. Plus, there isn&#x27;t any dried-out feeling that I have gotten with so many other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is great.  It comes out kind of opalescent and has a really smooth texture to it.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot but does get frothy.  It feels SO good on your skin, you just want to keep washing!  I was thinking it was going to leave a residue or leave my skin greasy after..just because it feels SO good...but it didn&#x27;t!  My skin felt clean and super soft.</li>
            <li> I knew almost instantly I would like it, just from the scent! It isn&#x27;t a harsh scent that you get from some other cleansers. The texture was smooth, and lathered well. It rinsed off clean, and my face felt super soft and clean! My face was a little dry after, but my skin is always dry in the winter. A little bit of lotion and everything was all fine. I gave this cleanser 5 stars, because I think everyone should give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free to try as a bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Thank you Ponds for another great product. My face feels so clean and soft. This is a great product for makeup removal as well. Another fine note is the fantastic smell!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the packaging...it&#x27;s pretty, convenient and easy to use. Good size for the value in both the cleanser and wipes. Now for the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s - The smell of the cleanser and wipes is awesome! very fresh!&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the cleanser is silky, reminds me of said old school cleanser that used to come in a blue jar.&lt;br /&gt;When washing it goes on smoothly, rinses cleanly and did not make my skin feel dry, greasy or tight. My skin felt clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I love the wipes! Great smell and well and very convenient, great for removing makeup too. My skin also felt clean and soft, no dryness or tightness. I have adult acne and always am hesitant about using things on my face, and this product was great...definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I use the Ponds Luminous Cream Cleanser in the shower, so I like that it has a snap top. The texture is thick and creamy and you don&#x27;t need a lot; it provides great coverage. It leaves me feeling clean and I LOVE the fresh scent...I&#x27;m ADDICTED to the smell. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> Before I started to use this product I use to just use soap and water to clean my face... I was in the wrong to think that that was helping clean my face completely. PONDS Luminous clean goes on sooth and make your face feel clean after the first use. I will never just use a bar soap to clean my face because it does not leave my face feeling nice and clean like PONDS luminous cream does!</li>
            <li> I am loving this cream cleanser! The first thing I noticed was its light, fresh, and clean scent. It has a thicker consistency than other cleansers so I don&#x27;t have to use very much to clean my entire face. My skin feels amazing after I use it. It draws all of the oil from my face without leaving it dried out. I have fairly sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the cleansing towelettes and the cream cleanser were just like all the other products out there. After two days, I was proven wrong. My face was softer and visibly cleaner. The towelettes removes waterproof mascara easily and doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume smell that can irritate your eyes. The cleanser is nice because a little bit goes a long ways so it will last quite a while. As a bonus, I used it on my son to get Sharpie pen off of his face and it worked great!</li>
            <li> The Cream Cleanser is Great!! It gives you a cool, clean &amp; refreshing feeling while working to brighten &amp; cool your skin. I have sensitive skin, &amp; these work like a charm.  Even My pre-teen tried the product &amp; she also loves the refreshing feeling that it leaves.</li>
            <li> Having breakout-prone skin, I&#x27;m always looking for products that leave my face noticeably clean. The Ponds Luminous Clean Towelettes are a great, quick tool for just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the towelettes and the cleanser together - but the cleanser didn&#x27;t blow me away. It&#x27;s an iridescent wash that is more creamy than sudsy. It left my face feeling clean and less oily, but not nearly as fresh or airy as other cleansers I&#x27;ve used. It does, however live up to the promise of &#x27;drawing out impurities.&#x27; After the first couple of uses, I was totally grossed out by the amount of gunk in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes have been awesome. They&#x27;re a good end-of-the-day make up remover or quick cleaner before putting on new makeup. They shine as a grab-and-go wipe if you like to start fresh any time during the day - making them absolutely perfect in my gym bag. They&#x27;ve also been great for a quick refresh if my skin is feeling dirty on a make up-free day.</li>
            <li> Since I am a BzzAgent, I got this product free from BzzAgent.  I love this product.  I have tried many facial cleansers.  This has been my favorite so far. It left my skin feeling refreshed and very clean. It also left my skin very soft.  My skin can be sensitive and this did not irritate it at all. The smell is very refreshing. I would definitely recommend trying these products!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my bzz agent bzzkit.  I was expecting  the same old harsh stinky cleanser and when the back of the package mentioned clay I expected grit .  Boy was I surprised! Soft scent, and smooth cream.  Frothed up nicely and left my skin soft and smooth.  I have a real problem with irritation after a shower, this isn&#x27;t a cure but its definitely much better than the other things I&#x27;ve tried.  Would definitely keep using and recommending to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wash my face twice a day with Clinique face wash an a clarisonic. I noticed lately that my clarisonic brush was turning tan colored from my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other night I used the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean face wash for the first time and not only did it clean my face brilliantly, my clarisonic brush head was white again as if it were new. That convinced me instantly that this face wash is pretty spectacular at removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how moisturizing it is.  My face didn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using it, which is a concern of mine during winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my husband to try as well, as his skin has been very dry lately.  He raved about it as soon as he washed his face.  He said his skin felt soft and looked healthy.  And he didn&#x27;t feel the need for moisturizer afterwards.  It didn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling tight like face washes normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 starts because the face wash worked great and I would use it again.</li>
            <li> The cleanser smells great. It works well but is sensitive to my skin. Nice sized bottle for the price. The towelettes are great too.</li>
            <li> I really must say that I always associated Ponds with older women! Stereotypical? YES! I have to admit that I had a preconceived notion that Ponds products were not made for me.  However, I was really excited to try the products when my package came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cleansing cloths, I love them. I can see that they work! I was happy to see that the texture and the design of the cleaning cloths were better than most. They are not just a smooth cloth that wipes off your make-up; it has a texture to it that cleans your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am not a fan of ANY cream cleanser. Cream cleansers tend to leave a residue on my face that feels waxy, or they just don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  The first time I used the cleanser and rinsed it off my face felt as clean as if I had just used a scrub.  I have not had a cream cleanser rinse off so well and leave my face feeling so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been really impressed with the Ponds Products.</li>
            <li> Love this product! The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser left my face with a radiant glow. It gives you that natural glow that you get when you are having one of your best days.  I really didn&#x27;t notice how dull my skin was looking until after I had used this and looked in the mirror. It really cleaned my skin and helped unify it to one creamy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema so my skin is very dry except for my face which is actually combination. Typically after using facial cleansers I always have red dry scaly skin along my hairline and a line that runs down my nose out under my eyes, I call it my batwings. The Pond&#x27;s cleanser worked wonderfully on my combination skin, the dry patches were moisturized (but I did need to apply a moisturizer after this product still) and the oily areas stayed moist but not oily even 24 hours after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser has a wonderful smell as well as a very convenient bottle with the opening at the bottom, the product always comes out smoothly no need to shake and shake trying to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time deciding to give it a 4/5 or 5/5 stars due to my face drying out a little. (was this because of my eczema or the product) so I had my husband try it out (he was so thrilled :-P) to see if his normal skin would get dried out at all but his skin was very smooth and also looked cleaner than normal. So 5/5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I received this cream cleanser from BzzAgent and I absolutely love it. I usually do not care for cream cleansers because they leave a filmy residue but this does NOT and smells incredible.</li>
            <li> its was bad, it was like trying to wash your face with lotion, my face didn&#x27;t feel clean afterwards, and to me it felt like it left a film of that lotion on your face! not for me, getting very disappointed in ponds</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much of a lather with this cleanser and it broke my skin out.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a Pond &#x27;s product so I had no idea what to expect. I liked this a lot - it left my skin clean without any feelings of tightness or dryness. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the scent was less strong and perfumed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong for me, it has a nice, pleasant smell to it. I can sometimes get an oily forehead and this helped with that without drying my skin out. And after I use it, I can definitely say that my skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I was really thinking I would love this product with all the great reviews. At first I did like it. I smelled great, and I liked the consistency of it. I realized after I washed it off that it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I would have liked, but it did remove dirt and make-up. However, within days of using it I broke out really badly. Products usually don&#x27;t cause me to break out, so it surprised me. I waited a few days and tried again, and the exact same thing happened. I think I am still going to try again, but right now this is a so-so product for me.</li>
            <li> I got this cleanser because I&#x27;ve really liked the daily exfoliating cleanser in this same line, and it seemed like the two would complement each other well. I figured I&#x27;d use one in the morning and the other at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that it&#x27;s pleasant to wash my face with this cleanser; it&#x27;s nice and smooth and just generally feels much better than regular soap. I was less happy with the results, though. Maybe a week after I started using the cleanser, I had one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve had in a long time. I think the combination of both cleansers, instead of just plain soap in the evening, was somehow too much for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. There was also one evening when I washed my face with this cleanser and after about half an hour felt like there was still something on my face, so that I went and washed again with plain soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep thinking that I should give it one more try, just to be sure--maybe the breakout was just a coincidence? But I really feel no desire to use this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product! I don&#x27;t typically use POND&#x27;S products but I think my mind has been changed. Recently I tried the Luminous Cream Cleanser and was impressed with the results. The product has a nice smell, goes on smoothly, and makes your face feel squeaky clean without any dryness. In fact, my face felt soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i absoutely loved the ponds luminous clean cream cleanser and the luminous clean weat cleansing towlettes, with the cream cleanser its so soft on ur skin and it just makes ur face feel like u were just at the spa fresh and with the cleansing towlettes the design is so beautiful it looks like lace and its very durable i kept stretching it but nothing, i also love the packages, for the towlettes ur able to close it and u get 30 which is like a whole months supply.Both of these prodcuts are very refreshing and they smell amazing and leave ur skin so smooth</li>
            <li> I have combo skin on my face (dry/oily). In the winter my skin gets so dry I get flaky skin around my chin and on my cheeks. I used this cleanser and I couldn&#x27;t believe how moisturized and soft my face looked and felt after only the first use. My flaky skin went away after about 3 uses and my skin didn&#x27;t feel oily at all. I also have sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin at all. I will def. be using this cleanser again.</li>
            <li> I really like the softness of the product. Be careful though. If you use too much, you might feel a bit greasy. A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I recently joined bzzagent and that is a group where you get to try products for free and let people know what you think. I have tried the ponds cream cleanser and after using it for a few days I felt more vibrant. My face felt fresher and it made my face a little more brighter. I would recommend this product to anyone..</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. I dont need moisturizer after I use this product. The toweletts a conveinent and do a wonderful job refreshing my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a little over a week and I really like the creamy texture and how it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. The scent is pleasant and the bottle is pretty in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I have is it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with acne. So, to balance things out I&#x27;ve been alternating between Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free acne wash and the Pond&#x27;s Luminous to keep my skin acne free and also moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. there for I rarely use any face cleansers. I have tried many other face cleanser but they were not the right one for me.I received this product for free to try and review. I&#x27;ve been using the pond&#x27;s clean cream cleanser and I love it. It smells really good and it&#x27;s very easy to rinse.  Although it does not completely remove makeup. It leaves your face feeling soft and clean. I  totally recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I am constantly fighting dry skin but after using this my skin looks and feels great! I don&#x27;t even need to put on lotion!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream cleanser several times a day for the past week and I can tell a difference in my skin.  It has helped my skin to feel clean but not dried out. The cream cleanser is very light on my skin. It has made my skin feel softer since I started using this soap.  I love the way that it applies to my skin when I wash with it. The cleanser is very creamy.  This is a product that I recommend to friends and my sister told her friend about it. I would definitely buy this at the store.</li>
