            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results after just a few days of use.  </li>
            <li>I found a new favorite!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this organic shampoo.</li>
            <li>it is so worth the money.</li>
            <li>its worth every penny makes my hair feel so much more alive</li>
            <li>let me just say that it was worth every penny,even from the first wash with this shampoo</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for years (23 to be exact)</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and does wonders to your hair.</li>
            <li>I use this whole line of products</li>
            <li>Great Shampoo for thin hair</li>
            <li>This shampoo was actually the shampoo that I used as I was going through my hair growth journey,it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>it is very sudsy.</li>
            <li>love the way it smells and leaves your hair feeling soft and silky, seems to help with our dry scalp as well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Its ok, but I prefer the other brands, especially the volumizing ones.</li>
            <li>would of been a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>I like that my hair is shinny and soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair silky soft and my boyfriend loves the way my hair smells.</li>
            <li>my hair now feels like a 20 year old me again...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product I advise it for African American hair and technically anyone who has very dry hair, this will change your life please purchase it,</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo and lather without have the laurel sulfate in it which is a nasty chemical.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li>it made my hair so much frizzier than other cheaper shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It would work well for people with normal and not especially coarse or dry hair, as well as people who like to look like Don King.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s become very dry and brittle and I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product on the market I can afford... and this product hits the mark, used in conjunction with the conditioner and the oil</li>

            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it seemed to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> it  turned my my hair into a tangled ,dry, breaking mess it literally does the opposite of what it claims.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thick and clumpy coming out of the bottle, but the smell and quality ingredients really make up for the texture.</li>
            <li> I can tell you for a fact that this will work for your hair, it makes my hair feel soft,lasted for about 6 months and me and my mom were using it!!!A little</li>
            <li> It was a little bit hard to get sudsing, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> It is heavy into my Lubbage bag when I will start airplane.</li>
            <li> My hair was very hard to comb through took me like 20 minutes to comb though my long thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I styled my hair as usual, but this time I looked like Don King.</li>
            <li> And it has an Unpleasant manly cologne scent.</li>

            <li> Who the hell would put this on market it  turned my my hair into a tangled ,dry, breaking mess it literally does the opposite of what it claims.It should get zero stars but amazon requires you too rate.</li>
            <li> Really good for your hair! Smells good too, but the oil in the shampoo makes your hair oily quickly.</li>
            <li> best stuff i have ever used for my fine curly irish colleen hair :-)</li>
            <li> This is not the same quality product that you would get at any drug store. I am wondering if it was counterfeit!</li>
            <li> Good product and arrived on time. Reasonably priced and does wonders to your hair. In combination with keratin conditioner my hair feels better than ever.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while. I like that my hair is shinny and soft. I feel that it has grown faster since using this product. That is just my opinion and how it works for me. I like the smell. I like that it is organic. I will continue to use this product for a long time. I like the larger size.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it is so worth the money. Keeps hair healthy shiny and strong. I use this whole line of products</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Smells wonderful and makes my hair so soft.</li>

            <li> Great Shampoo for thin hair</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this organic shampoo. The smell was pleasant and not overwhelming. It was a little bit hard to get sudsing, but I expected that. It cleaned my hair satisfactorily, but it did not do anything to improve my hair. I styled my hair as usual, but this time I looked like Don King. It would work well for people with normal and not especially coarse or dry hair, as well as people who like to look like Don King.</li>
            <li> It is heavy into my Lubbage bag when I will start airplane. I wanted to cancel shampoo bottle 750 ml.&lt;br /&gt;I buy this locals moisture shampoo 100 ml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry! We have end of second homeland.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Does everything it claims to do</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product - I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for years (23 to be exact) and it&#x27;s become very dry and brittle and I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product on the market I can afford... and this product hits the mark, used in conjunction with the conditioner and the oil... my hair now feels like a 20 year old me again... Thank you, thank you, thank you</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my hair!! I used it as my shampoo and conditioner! I can tell you for a fact that this will work for your hair, it makes my hair feel soft,lasted for about 6 months and me and my mom were using it!!!A little goes a long way. This shampoo was actually the shampoo that I used as I was going through my hair growth journey,it&#x27;s sulfate free and I lose almost NO hair every time I wash my hair.. compared to my mother when she wasn&#x27;t using the shampoo I lost nothing! let me just say that it was worth every penny,even from the first wash with this shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe it was  my hair! I absolutely love this product I advise it for African American hair and technically anyone who has very dry hair, this will change your life please purchase it, its worth every penny makes my hair feel so much more alive and I&#x27;m about to purchase my next bottle!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i bought the trial versions of the shampoo and conditioner to try this product out instead of spending 6.00 for each bottle and end up not liking it . While lathering the shampoo it felt like I was lathering my hair in grease! I kept feeling the need to wash my hair more and more. My hair was very hard to comb through took me like 20 minutes to comb though my long thick wavy hair. Once it dried it made my hair shinier but very oily and frizzy it made my hair so much frizzier than other cheaper shampoos I&#x27;ve used. And it has an Unpleasant manly cologne scent. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy the full bottles would of been a huge waste of money. I&#x27;m going to stick to herbal essence they work soooo much better than any expensive salon brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this. it&#x27;s a little thick and clumpy coming out of the bottle, but the smell and quality ingredients really make up for the texture. it is very sudsy. great job!!!!</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t love this stuff...it seemed to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> This has become my &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; shampoo of choice.  I am very happy with the results after just a few days of use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo and lather without have the laurel sulfate in it which is a nasty chemical.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> the best shampoo around</li>
            <li> Its ok, but I prefer the other brands, especially the volumizing ones.</li>
            <li> Good product. Got it on time.</li>
            <li> Love it!! But the stores are now selling it for only $6.!!!</li>
