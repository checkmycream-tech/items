            <li>:-D</li>
            <li>Perfect order.</li>
            <li>so that is a good start!</li>
            <li>Great product that works</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>It worked GREAT.</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing how often I must have been biting away on the skin and nails and never realize it.  </li>
            <li>Seemed everyone either liked it or didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly good not expensive what so ever I really liked this product !</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Needs to be better.</li>
            <li>It is ok..</li>
            <li>Should have read more reviews....</li>
            <li>Like many with this problem I have been able to get it under control at times,</li>
            <li>First, your nails become shiny after applying it, and for a guy that does not look good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and seems to be working pretty well after three weeks.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work and comes off easily</li>
            <li>Tried it...seem to work at first, but then I started to think that our toddler liked the taste.&lt;br /&gt;Tasted</li>
            <li>This product, so far, seems to be effective.</li>
            <li>even though it says you need to put more on after you wash your hands, I have found so far once in the morning and once after my shower at night is just fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at not biting my nails in general, but every week or two I need that reminder.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty mild formula so it&#x27;s maybe not going to work as fast as others, but probably better for young kids because they eat so many finger foods.</li>
            <li>Another concern of mine is that the nail polish might not be safe for a 2 year old baby.  </li>
            <li>But i should think it would be effective on younger children.</li>
            <li>This is really useful if you bite your nails without realizing it.</li>
            <li>Best $5 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>Also, I tried it before our three year old and it isn&#x27;t a strong taste</li>
            <li>In just a couple of days my fingers are healing very fast.  </li>
            <li>The trick to getting you to stop biting your nails is to first want to stop biting your nails, then to put on horrible-tasting nail polish that will deter you from doing it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product of this type I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I did not realize how often I must have had my fingers in my mouth before, because even when I got the open wounds on my fingers under control it took many days to heal up.  </li>
            <li>I had to trim his nails for the first time in 6 months today.</li>
            <li>but if you are an avid nail biter it will not be strong enough.</li>
            <li>The nail polish needs to simultaneously be a strong reminder that you&#x27;ve just bitten your nails, and remind you for seconds later that you&#x27;ve just bitten them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the taste was strong enough.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this product was applied to his thumb and didn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really deter my nail biting.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this to anyone who has a nail biting problem</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care about it.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but we don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my cell phone and ipad power cord and so far, she&#x27;s staying away!  </li>
            <li>It is clear and thicker than normal nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than having tiny bitten down nail beds.</li>
            <li>We purchased this because we have a three year old who just won&#x27;t give up sucking his thumb</li>
            <li>I just purchased this....mostly for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>A determined finger-chewer like me has so far not been deterred.</li>
            <li>I found this product did not deter my 3 yr old from biting her nails.</li>
            <li>It only worked the first day used and my son was back to sucking his thumb with the product on.</li>
            <li>far I have noticed two major things.  </li>
            <li>The mere thought of having something on my nails was effective at first, after it was dry</li>
            <li>Because I am not putting my fingers in my mouth hardly at all now, the healing is very quick.  </li>
            <li>but I would remind him that it was icky and he&#x27;d be fine with it.</li>
            <li>Not bitter at all.  </li>
            <li>but unfurtanately it barely has any flavor</li>
            <li>Apparently we need something with a stronger adverse flavor.</li>
            <li>the other hand, there are two main flaws to this product.</li>

            <li> Because I am not putting my fingers in my mouth hardly at all now, the healing is very quick.  </li>

            <li> but unfurtanately it barely has any flavor</li>
            <li> Apparently we need something with a stronger adverse flavor.</li>
            <li> the other hand, there are two main flaws to this product.</li>
            <li> As a man I am not use to the feeling of nail polish and that always sort of wet feeling you have even though it is not wet to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like nail polish, which is really the only negative I can think of.  </li>
            <li> I have to keep reapplying the product and if you&#x27;re really busy its kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> It did not taste bitter at all, not even enough to remind you that you are biting.</li>
            <li> And one last thing: be careful when eating food with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from compulsive nail biting for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> The other major thing I have noticed is how every once in a while I will taste that bitter taste and not even remember putting my finger in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> it makes your nails very shiny, so if you are a male it will make look so creepy..</li>
            <li> Not very helpful.</li>
            <li> The second is that the taste fades away faster than you would like, so you probably have to reapply a few times a day.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no</li>
            <li> Mildly bitter.</li>
            <li> product isnt bitter, and it dosent prevent you at all from biting.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> i put on my daughters fingernails and few seconds later she was biting her nails</li>
            <li> He only asked for it a few times</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for other \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> if I can fix the nasty mess my fingers become under great stress.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave three stars for the prompt service and the attempt but minus two starts for the overall failure of it not working.</li>
            <li> but i kinda like that better because ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past make everything i touch taste bad.  </li>
            <li> Figured since it was less then $5 even with S/H I would try it.</li>
            <li> so I plan on updating every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few times</li>
            <li> A few brushes of this stuff on the tip</li>
            <li> I needed to stop biting my nails,but this product was not strong enough,so i wasnt too detered from stopping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely strong  </li>
            <li> It is not instant-shock nasty, but more of a slow bitter taste that you notice in seconds.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stop my son or even slow him down chewing his nails</li>
            <li> This nail polish cannot do the job, and I need to find other nail bite deterring nail polish with a strong, horrible taste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It is a small price to pay though</li>
            <li> for my daughter it works for both of them no more nail biting or thumb sucking</li>
            <li> and once he tasted it no more pacifier.</li>
            <li> He still does bite his nails but usually if we forgot to apply the polish.</li>
            <li> The only other thing i have to say is that it dries kinda glossy and it can start to peel and look bad.  </li>
            <li> This bad taste stays long after you apply it, so</li>
            <li> It certainly tasted terrible and worked well.</li>
            <li> Stress at work will increase the amount of damage to my fingers, but over the last few years it has gotten worst.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t put a lot of confidence behind this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even though its a polish, it rubs off on the rest of your hands throughout the day, gets onto your food, gets on your face and into your mouth.</li>
            <li> terrible to me, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work for or little girl.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless!</li>
            <li> It tastes bad.</li>
            <li> It tastes bad.....</li>
            <li> Hope to help my daughter kick the bad habit of nail biting!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.  </li>
            <li> product itself does taste nasty.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works okay but if you are an avid nail biter it will not be strong enough. I prefer Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> I have to keep reapplying the product and if you&#x27;re really busy its kind of annoying. Needs to be better.</li>
            <li> It is ok..but u have to constantly put it on..I am washing my hands constantly throughout the day..I don&#x27;t have time to put it on every time I wash my hands</li>
            <li> Not bitter at all.  Actually, I can&#x27;t taste it at all.  Should have read more reviews.... This is a horrible product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The trick to getting you to stop biting your nails is to first want to stop biting your nails, then to put on horrible-tasting nail polish that will deter you from doing it.  The nail polish needs to simultaneously be a strong reminder that you&#x27;ve just bitten your nails, and remind you for seconds later that you&#x27;ve just bitten them.  Having said this, the \\&quot;SuperNail Bite No More\\&quot; is terrible--there is almost no flavor at all.  I got this as a replacement for other \\&quot;No Bite\\&quot; nail polish I can no longer find, but this doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.  I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at not biting my nails in general, but every week or two I need that reminder.  This nail polish cannot do the job, and I need to find other nail bite deterring nail polish with a strong, horrible taste.</li>
            <li> I have a cat with Pica..she chews wires!  I put this on my cell phone and ipad power cord and so far, she&#x27;s staying away!  :-D</li>
            <li> We purchased this because we have a three year old who just won&#x27;t give up sucking his thumb and we are running out of things to try. Anyway, this product was applied to his thumb and didn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect so we eventually have up and now the stuff is just sitting in our cabinet collecting dust. I gave three stars for the prompt service and the attempt but minus two starts for the overall failure of it not working. It may work for others but not this kid. Also, I tried it before our three year old and it isn&#x27;t a strong taste so I wouldn&#x27;t put a lot of confidence behind this product.</li>
            <li> Not very helpful. My child continues to suck his thumb</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless! It did not taste bitter at all, not even enough to remind you that you are biting.</li>
            <li> Perfect order. Just as described.</li>
            <li> I like that it is shiney but unfurtanately it barely has any flavor so it doesn&#x27;t really deter my nail biting.</li>
            <li> I bite my nails, chew my fingers and even press my fingers against my teeth and I was looking at something that would basically take my fingers away from my face. This product, so far, seems to be effective. The mere thought of having something on my nails was effective at first, after it was dry the taste did the rest of the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, there are two main flaws to this product. First, your nails become shiny after applying it, and for a guy that does not look good. The second is that the taste fades away faster than you would like, so you probably have to reapply a few times a day. And one last thing: be careful when eating food with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my 5 year old.  I don&#x27;t think the taste was strong enough.  It didn&#x27;t deter her at all.</li>
            <li> It only worked the first day used and my son was back to sucking his thumb with the product on.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stop my son or even slow him down chewing his nails</li>
            <li> Once the nail polish dries,  it stops working. Another concern of mine is that the nail polish might not be safe for a 2 year old baby.  The nail polish did not stop my son&#x27;s nail byting.</li>
            <li> It certainly tasted terrible and worked well. I have absolutely no will power so after one use, I didn&#x27;t reapply. It is clear and thicker than normal nail polish.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this....mostly for my 4 year old. I put in on my nails so that I can give it a trial run...and it taste terrible.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s just what I was looking for. I put in her later that night, and she can&#x27;t stand the taste it either. I think we found a winner!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from compulsive nail biting for as long as I can remember.  Stress at work will increase the amount of damage to my fingers, but over the last few years it has gotten worst.  Like many with this problem I have been able to get it under control at times, but it always sneaks back up on me.  This is the first product of this type I have tried.  I have just begun using the it so I plan on updating every few weeks.  After suffering from this problem for over 30 years, I hope I can finally fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself does taste nasty.  It is not instant-shock nasty, but more of a slow bitter taste that you notice in seconds.  This bad taste stays long after you apply it, so even though it says you need to put more on after you wash your hands, I have found so far once in the morning and once after my shower at night is just fine.  It goes on like nail polish, which is really the only negative I can think of.  As a man I am not use to the feeling of nail polish and that always sort of wet feeling you have even though it is not wet to the touch.  It also shines a bit, making my fingernails look like that have something on them.  It is a small price to pay though if I can fix the nasty mess my fingers become under great stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have noticed two major things.  In just a couple of days my fingers are healing very fast.  I did not realize how often I must have had my fingers in my mouth before, because even when I got the open wounds on my fingers under control it took many days to heal up.  What I must have been doing is chewing on them at times and never noticing and maybe even doing it in my sleep.  Because I am not putting my fingers in my mouth hardly at all now, the healing is very quick.  The other major thing I have noticed is how every once in a while I will taste that bitter taste and not even remember putting my finger in my mouth.  It is truly amazing how often I must have been biting away on the skin and nails and never realize it.  That biter taste is a shock that has already got me to stop putting my fingers in my mouth.  FINGERS CROSSED...updates to followr realize it.  That biter taste is a shock that has already got me to stop putting my fingers in my mouth.  FINGERS CROSSED...updates to follow</li>
            <li> Great product that works well i bought it for my husband and for my daughter it works for both of them no more nail biting or thumb sucking</li>
            <li> Mildly bitter. A determined finger-chewer like me has so far not been deterred. This is a lightweight. It does let you know you&#x27;re doing it, though, so if you&#x27;re an unconscious digit-digester, this might help.</li>
            <li> I needed to stop biting my nails,but this product was not strong enough,so i wasnt too detered from stopping. But i should think it would be effective on younger children.</li>
            <li> Helps me limit nail biting.... great product I would really recommend this to anyone who has a nail biting problem</li>
            <li> Works amazingly good not expensive what so ever I really liked this product ! Its a must buy for people who bite their nails</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and seems to be working pretty well after three weeks.  It&#x27;s not extremely strong  but i kinda like that better because ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past make everything i touch taste bad.  The only other thing i have to say is that it dries kinda glossy and it can start to peel and look bad.  I don&#x27;t really care about it. It&#x27;s actually god because it gives me something to do instead of biting them. I just sit there and peel off the polish. haha so all in all I like this product.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times but i still found myself with my finger in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;This product isnt bitter, and it dosent prevent you at all from biting.&lt;br /&gt;also it makes your nails very shiny, so if you are a male it will make look so creepy..</li>
            <li> i put on my daughters fingernails and few seconds later she was biting her nails so did not work well for us.</li>
            <li> I read the review before I bought this. Seemed everyone either liked it or didn&#x27;t like it. Figured since it was less then $5 even with S/H I would try it. It worked GREAT. My son is almost 3 and was hooked on his pacifier. A few brushes of this stuff on the tip and once he tasted it no more pacifier. He only asked for it a few times but I would remind him that it was icky and he&#x27;d be fine with it. Best $5 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> It tastes bad. Use sparingly, not two coats! I only put one dab. Unfortunately, even though its a polish, it rubs off on the rest of your hands throughout the day, gets onto your food, gets on your face and into your mouth. Yuck!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 yo son. It&#x27;s been about a month and I can see improvement.  I had to trim his nails for the first time in 6 months today. This is a pretty mild formula so it&#x27;s maybe not going to work as fast as others, but probably better for young kids because they eat so many finger foods. He still does bite his nails but usually if we forgot to apply the polish. It does make the nails look shiny but we don&#x27;t really care. It&#x27;s better than having tiny bitten down nail beds.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son who bites his nails and it didn&#x27;t even phase him he still bites his nails just the same amount as he did before the product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and comes off easily</li>
            <li> Hope to help my daughter kick the bad habit of nail biting! It tastes bad.....so that is a good start!</li>
            <li> I found this product did not deter my 3 yr old from biting her nails. In fact, at one point, I found her licking the product after I had applied it to her nails. Apparently we need something with a stronger adverse flavor.</li>
            <li> Tried it...seem to work at first, but then I started to think that our toddler liked the taste.&lt;br /&gt;Tasted terrible to me, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work for or little girl.</li>
            <li> Made me stop biting my nails, I&#x27;ve done it since I was a kid. If you&#x27;re determined you can still bite them with this stuff on so you need to still have some self-discipline not to. This is really useful if you bite your nails without realizing it.</li>
