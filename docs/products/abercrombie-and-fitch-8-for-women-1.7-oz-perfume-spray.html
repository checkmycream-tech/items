            <li>Love the perfume butOnly 50 in store</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume at this point.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this perfume about 10  years ago.  </li>
            <li>wish I would&#x27;ve been told that before I bought it, I will still use it, but its not my favorite.</li>
            <li>great and shipped fast</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent, not heavy or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>i got both compliments from wearing the perfum from it smells nice and sweet to smells like detergeant .. or cleaning supplies odor</li>
            <li>(Strong perfumes)then  abercrombie 41 is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a softer smell, if you like stuff like Clinique happy, or D&amp;G light blue, or any ralph lauren perfume-</li>
            <li>Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly</li>
            <li>I have always like this smell and was excited when I saw it on here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However if you like softer stuff like CK euphoria, or the original Juicy perfume...</li>
            <li>sweet smells</li>
            <li>Definitely a must have sexy scent for any woman&#x27;s collection!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent that you can wear anytime.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I chose this scent when Abercrombie discontinued my absolute favorite-Classic 41-I</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>Anyway, Abercrombie 8 is the closest scent I have found to the classic 41.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite purfume, easier to have sent then drive 45 minutes to a store just to purchase, and a little bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>There are a few misc bottles of it out there, but I don&#x27;t love it enough to pay $200 for the bottle!!</li>
    </ol>
