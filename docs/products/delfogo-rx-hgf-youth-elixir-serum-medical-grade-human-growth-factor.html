    <ol>
            <li>Another excellent product from the Delfolgo skincare line.</li>
            <li>Also their service is excellent.</li>
            <li>If you want to get the best bang for your dollar</li>
            <li>I use this twice a day and have been so impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>The serum works great with the moisturizer</li>
            <li>and I am also happy with the decrease in wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It lasts longer, but still has great results, even the morning after.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>It feels so good and soothing after a citrus treatment.</li>
            <li>I feel more beautiful in my skin now.</li>
            <li>I have talked with one of their consultants over the phone and emailed several times with questions The customer service was excellent, and they advised me on what products and steps are best for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the results and glad I decided to give this youth serum a try.</li>
            <li>Love the HGF Youth Elixir Serum!  </li>
            <li>and  I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Good serum but perhaps not the best choice for older skin.</li>
            <li>I am happy with how smooth my skin feels after I apply the serum</li>
            <li>and I really liked that too.  </li>
            <li>This combination works well for me and probably would for others with problematic skin who are hesitant about trying those products that do more harm than good.</li>
            <li>My foundation went on nicely and the fragrance is nice but not over-powering.</li>
            <li>Honestly the name sounds like it was made on the moon and was for aliens, but I was intrigued by the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what that means as it relates to my skin but anything that helps to stimulate cellular growth has to be a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and feels good on my skin, not too oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>and I have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased that I did</li>
            <li>or so I noticed my skin was noticeably smoother and brighter and felt so much better.</li>
            <li>You will feel better and healthier once you see your skin start glowing.</li>
            <li>But out of many products used I do recommend this one since I noticed the change a lot sooner than most products out there</li>
            <li>I have to share my experience with this product because it is one of the better serum&#x27;s I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I chose to spend more on this Youth Serum.</li>
            <li>Be sure to exfolliate your face when using this.</li>
            <li>Since using Delfogo&#x27;s Youth Elixir Serum every day for several weeks, I am extremely impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and more even-toned; my age spots have visibly faded.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried many products over the years and most were so-so</li>
            <li>Of the many products I have tried, this is the one I will be recommending to my friends.</li>
            <li>Her glowing skin was all the convincing I needed.</li>
            <li>really impressed with in recent times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product that I would readily recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;fresh look&#x27; was something that I honestly had not seen in some time.</li>
            <li>product goes on nicely, absorbs quickly, is fragrance free</li>
            <li>So I went to Amazon to look for a product that can increase production of cells necessary for beautiful skin, and I came across Delfogo Rx .</li>
            <li>I saw healthy looking, and feeling skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old, and luckily for me I have great</li>
            <li>On top of that, my skin began to look brighter and had a fresh look.</li>
            <li>I must say I tend to smile more after using DelfogoRx.</li>
            <li>Not only did I get great results…the customer service for this company is there to answer any questions you might have.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful, does keep face straight, minimizing wrinkles, however that&#x27;s only during the time of use..</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>I use the Marque line for the older skin and love it.</li>
            <li>This is a decent serum for the most part.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is simple and quick to apply even when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I don&#x27;t even like to smile to take pictures because the wrinkles around my eyes are so noticeable.  </li>
            <li>and I despise droppers, just my own personal preference.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because after a month of use, I didn&#x27;t really see any significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good purchase as it will free you from hours of skin care routine which not many of us can anyway afford.</li>
            <li>With so many skin products on the market, today, it can be difficult to select the one that will be most effective.</li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderful and after only a few weeks my skin seems to glow.</li>
            <li>This serum is the first thing I apply to my face after washing it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves your face feeling hydrated, silky and soft.</li>
            <li>The price of this product might seem high, but it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it is worth it to take a chance on a new brand.</li>
            <li>I must say this was a nice little surprise</li>
            <li>I always speak to the same sales person and know that if in case a product would not agree with my skin, I can return it and try another product for free.</li>
            <li>After much research, I tried the Delfogo products.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t even realized how much help my skin needed until I saw the improvement.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll revise this after three months to really evaluate its effectiveness and truth in advertising.</li>
            <li>I’m actually really amazed at the price of this, because it’s clinical grade.</li>
            <li>The oil was gentle on my skin, and helped moisturize and rejuvenate with irritation.</li>
            <li>When I noticed a close friend&#x27;s much improved skin appearance, I had to ask what she had been using, and she recommended DelfogoRx HGF Youth Elixir Serum.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend it all those who are looking for a product to rejuvenate their skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks even better than it did when I used only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>For me…this was a great little discovery and worth every penny I spent!</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find the positive effects that the seaweed extract had on my face.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve tried to stick with a more natural approach without using much if any “product” that isn&#x27;t organic, pure or raw.</li>
            <li>and I have since purchased a few more items from them.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of products over the years and was looking for a new skin care line.  </li>
            <li>I mean come on, there are so many &#x27;youthful skin promising&#x27; products out there.</li>
            <li>I have done extensive research and tried many other face creams before finding this Company.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty educated when it comes to anti-aging products, but Delfogo Rx HGF Youth Elixir contains Human Growth Factors, and I don&#x27;t have any experience with this.  </li>
            <li>A definite positive difference in volume and texture.</li>
            <li>Plus I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even though I am still young, I have problems with crow&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this since early June, and it has firmed the area around my mouth and under the chin (</li>
            <li>The Delfogo RX Youth Elixir Serum is among the better ones out there as the claims are actually noticeable, giving my skin a glow and softness I have been missing for some time now.</li>
            <li>It only took a couple weeks before I started to notice that my wrinkles were becoming less defined.</li>
            <li>As I started getting older I began noticing my need to care for my skin on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for older women who value the benefits of hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets at all!</li>
            <li>Although, the other product was more affordable, I basically just wasted my money.</li>
            <li>Seaweed extract brings a natural aspect to this product that infused my skin with essential vitamins.</li>
            <li>So far, my skin is smoothe overall</li>
            <li>I was wary of paying so much for a serum, my usual range is $60 or below, but I was willing to give it a go if the results proved satisfying.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like to spend this much on a single skin care product.</li>
            <li>I want to combat aging as early as possible so that I can hopefully avoid plastic surgery in my future.</li>
            <li>It was not long before others started noticing it too.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment and one of the very few things that I have been</li>
            <li>When it comes to finding the right skin care it’s usually hit or miss.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as well as any of the other Delfogo products.  </li>

            <li> When it comes to finding the right skin care it’s usually hit or miss.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as well as any of the other Delfogo products.  </li>
            <li> Due to the constant onslaught of work related stress and exposure to sun and pollution, my skin was showing visible signs of aging.</li>
            <li> and those I spent a lot of money on were no better than those that didn’t cost me as much.</li>
            <li> My sister had me try the Hyaluronic Cream for my dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin used to be so dry and flaky and even when I used lotion on it, it never seemed to help.</li>
            <li> The last time I spent good money on an expensive skincare product kit from one of those very well known “subscription” care lines, I was disappointed in the lack of results.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way; 3 is enough for my face and under chin, neck.</li>
            <li> However, I tried a major name brand serum in the past and saw zero effects.</li>
            <li> I spent less money on the other product than this specific serum.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using the product my skin was definitely softer and tighter, and visibly noticeable improvements have followed.</li>
            <li> , I Use very little so it will last me for a while.</li>
            <li> See difference after 1 week of use;lines less noticeable on face.</li>
            <li> I honestly believed that the results I have been seeing from the use of DelfogoRx could only be achieved by having expensive and painful surgical procedures, but this tiny bottle, which slips conveniently into any make-up bag, has proven me wrong.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks I noticed a few changes like brighter complexion, fresher and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical of DelfogoRx HGF.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is apply a small amount</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working.</li>

            <li> There are numerous products on the market for toning and rejuvenating skin. The Delfogo RX Youth Elixir Serum is among the better ones out there as the claims are actually noticeable, giving my skin a glow and softness I have been missing for some time now. It&#x27;s a really good product that I would readily recommend to family and friends. If you want see noticeable results and experience smoother, healthier skin, this product is probably for you</li>
            <li> Another excellent product from the Delfolgo skincare line. I have done extensive research and tried many other face creams before finding this Company. Since using their products, my skin has improved a lot and I have received many compliments. I use the Marque line for the older skin and love it. Also their service is excellent. I always speak to the same sales person and know that if in case a product would not agree with my skin, I can return it and try another product for free.</li>
            <li> The last time I spent good money on an expensive skincare product kit from one of those very well known “subscription” care lines, I was disappointed in the lack of results. Since then I&#x27;ve tried to stick with a more natural approach without using much if any “product” that isn&#x27;t organic, pure or raw. But I needed something to supplement my regimen. I want to combat aging as early as possible so that I can hopefully avoid plastic surgery in my future. I purchased the Youth Elixir Serum and I have no regrets at all! My sister had me try the Hyaluronic Cream for my dry skin and I really liked that too.  It feels so good and soothing after a citrus treatment. The serum works great with the moisturizer, I Use very little so it will last me for a while. My skin feels and looks even better than it did when I used only natural ingredients. This combination works well for me and probably would for others with problematic skin who are hesitant about trying those products that do more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Love the HGF Youth Elixir Serum!  I have used a lot of products over the years and was looking for a new skin care line.  After much research, I tried the Delfogo products.  This serum is the first thing I apply to my face after washing it.  I highly recommend this product as well as any of the other Delfogo products.  After using the products for two months, I can truly see and feel a difference.  I have talked with one of their consultants over the phone and emailed several times with questions The customer service was excellent, and they advised me on what products and steps are best for my skin.  This is definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I was wary of paying so much for a serum, my usual range is $60 or below, but I was willing to give it a go if the results proved satisfying. My mom mentioned that she swears by Delfogo products and I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m quite pleased that I did and I have since purchased a few more items from them. After a month or so I noticed my skin was noticeably smoother and brighter and felt so much better. I hadn&#x27;t even realized how much help my skin needed until I saw the improvement. If you want to get the best bang for your dollar then I recommend this product. You will feel better and healthier once you see your skin start glowing.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, does keep face straight, minimizing wrinkles, however that&#x27;s only during the time of use.. After being wash off face is back to square one..  But out of many products used I do recommend this one since I noticed the change a lot sooner than most products out there</li>
            <li> As I started getting older I began noticing my need to care for my skin on a regular basis. I heard about this from a coworker of mine and she used it daily it so I gave it a try. I love how easy it is simple and quick to apply even when I&#x27;m in a rush. It absorbs quickly and feels good on my skin, not too oily or greasy. And my skin is actually looking smoother and brighter than it was before. Plus I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s worked well for me. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical of DelfogoRx HGF. I mean come on, there are so many &#x27;youthful skin promising&#x27; products out there. Why should this any be any different? I did a bit of research into the actual ingredients before buying, because we should all pay attention to what we put on our faces. I was surprised to find the positive effects that the seaweed extract had on my face. Seaweed extract brings a natural aspect to this product that infused my skin with essential vitamins. It only took a couple weeks before I started to notice that my wrinkles were becoming less defined. On top of that, my skin began to look brighter and had a fresh look. This &#x27;fresh look&#x27; was something that I honestly had not seen in some time. Talk about a confidence booster! I must say I tend to smile more after using DelfogoRx.</li>
            <li> I have to share my experience with this product because it is one of the better serum&#x27;s I have tried.  Even though I am still young, I have problems with crow&#x27;s feet.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t even like to smile to take pictures because the wrinkles around my eyes are so noticeable.  I tried a different product I found on Amazon a while back and it didn&#x27;t give me the same results that DelfogoRx HGF does.  I am happy with how smooth my skin feels after I apply the serum and I am also happy with the decrease in wrinkles around my eyes.  The price of this product might seem high, but it is definitely worth it.  All you need to do is apply a small amount so I know this bottle will last me a while.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this serum to reduce aging signs. I normally don&#x27;t like to spend this much on a single skin care product. However, I tried a major name brand serum in the past and saw zero effects. I spent less money on the other product than this specific serum. Although, the other product was more affordable, I basically just wasted my money. I am glad I chose to spend more on this Youth Serum. After a couple weeks I noticed a visible difference in my skin. It helped reduce some wrinkles on my skin. It also improved my crows feet. I feel more beautiful in my skin now. Sometimes it is worth it to take a chance on a new brand. I have never heard of this brand before I stumbled upon it on Amazon. However, now it is a brand I will stick with.</li>
            <li> Must be a miracle. See difference after 1 week of use;lines less noticeable on face. Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent serum for the most part. It goes on smoothly and leaves your face feeling hydrated, silky and soft. My foundation went on nicely and the fragrance is nice but not over-powering. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because after a month of use, I didn&#x27;t really see any significant improvement in my skin. Good serum but perhaps not the best choice for older skin.</li>
            <li> This seems to work along with my Retin A.  I put on this at night, and Retin A in the morning.  Be sure to exfolliate your face when using this.</li>
            <li> Since using Delfogo&#x27;s Youth Elixir Serum every day for several weeks, I am extremely impressed with the results. This serum combines ingredients which have been proven to stimulate cell growth, including Thymulen 4 which is derived from the youth hormone. I have tried other serums but was always disappointed with the results. After reading about Delfogo&#x27;s Youth Elixer, I decided to give it a try and  I&#x27;m so glad I did! It has turned my somewhat dull complexion into a fresher, glowing one. My skin feels smoother and more even-toned; my age spots have visibly faded. I definitely recommend Delfogo&#x27;s Serum to anyone with aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since early June, and it has firmed the area around my mouth and under the chin (but I wasn&#x27;t too saggy to begin with). It did fade my scars, but it didn&#x27;t happen overnight. What I like is that it gives an extra hydrating boost. A few drops go a long way; 3 is enough for my face and under chin, neck. I would definitely recommend this for older women who value the benefits of hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old, and luckily for me I have great genes- but that doesn’t mean I need to ignore my skin. I’ve tried many products over the years and most were so-so and those I spent a lot of money on were no better than those that didn’t cost me as much. When it comes to finding the right skin care it’s usually hit or miss. I decided to give the Elite HGF Youth Serum a try after reading some of the reviews. I must say this was a nice little surprise and I didn’t have to break my wallet. My skin feels wonderful and after only a few weeks my skin seems to glow. Not only did I get great results…the customer service for this company is there to answer any questions you might have. I am happy with the results and glad I decided to give this youth serum a try. For me…this was a great little discovery and worth every penny I spent!</li>
            <li> My skin used to be so dry and flaky and even when I used lotion on it, it never seemed to help. So I went to Amazon to look for a product that can increase production of cells necessary for beautiful skin, and I came across Delfogo Rx . Honestly the name sounds like it was made on the moon and was for aliens, but I was intrigued by the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty educated when it comes to anti-aging products, but Delfogo Rx HGF Youth Elixir contains Human Growth Factors, and I don&#x27;t have any experience with this.  Turns out, HGF helps to stimulate cellular growth.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what that means as it relates to my skin but anything that helps to stimulate cellular growth has to be a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on nicely, absorbs quickly, is fragrance free so it doesn&#x27;t have any smell to it.  It didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or dryness.  In fact, it contains seaweed extract and hyaluronic acid to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has a dropped to dispense the product and I despise droppers, just my own personal preference.  I prefer pumps.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ll revise this after three months to really evaluate its effectiveness and truth in advertising. So far, my skin is smoothe overall</li>
            <li> This will instantly tighten your face.  I just turned 30, so I&#x27;m in that transition from the 20&#x27;s and now beyond so trying not to freak out about aging.  I use this twice a day and have been so impressed with the results.  I can see a noticeable difference in pictures recently - my face glows!  Try it.</li>
            <li> I’m actually really amazed at the price of this, because it’s clinical grade. I saw healthy looking, and feeling skin quickly. The oil was gentle on my skin, and helped moisturize and rejuvenate with irritation. And like I said, for this price—you can’t get anything better.&lt;br /&gt;You don’t need a lot. I found that putting a drop in the palm of my hand, rubbing my hands together, and then wiping along my face, lips, and eyes does the trick. It lasts longer, but still has great results, even the morning after.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, and see the difference. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> With so many skin products on the market, today, it can be difficult to select the one that will be most effective. When I noticed a close friend&#x27;s much improved skin appearance, I had to ask what she had been using, and she recommended DelfogoRx HGF Youth Elixir Serum. Within a few days of using the product my skin was definitely softer and tighter, and visibly noticeable improvements have followed. Troublesome crows feet around my eyes have diminished and age spots on my cheeks and forehead have disappeared. I honestly believed that the results I have been seeing from the use of DelfogoRx could only be achieved by having expensive and painful surgical procedures, but this tiny bottle, which slips conveniently into any make-up bag, has proven me wrong.  Of the many products I have tried, this is the one I will be recommending to my friends.</li>
            <li> A definite positive difference in volume and texture.</li>
            <li> Due to the constant onslaught of work related stress and exposure to sun and pollution, my skin was showing visible signs of aging. A friend at work recommended DelfogoRx HGF Youth Elixir Serum. Her glowing skin was all the convincing I needed. After using it for a few weeks I noticed a few changes like brighter complexion, fresher and smoother skin. It was not long before others started noticing it too. I would really recommend it all those who are looking for a product to rejuvenate their skin. It is a good purchase as it will free you from hours of skin care routine which not many of us can anyway afford. Well worth the investment and one of the very few things that I have been really impressed with in recent times.</li>
