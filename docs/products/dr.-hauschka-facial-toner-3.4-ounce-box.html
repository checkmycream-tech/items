            <li>I was happy after I used my first bottle, but I still wanted to find something better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may have been the top was not protected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put it on a cotton pad (works better than a cotton) ball.</li>
            <li>As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the Lavender Bath Essence to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and holistic.</li>
            <li>Just love the smell of Hauschka body products.</li>
            <li>but your skin will appear firmer and refreshingly more youthful.</li>
            <li>I almost love this product.</li>
            <li>I love them .</li>
            <li>simply the best, my wife&#x27;s go to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it anyway for it seems to be ok.</li>
            <li>Everything we have tried has been impeccable and really works.</li>
            <li>This works great, Helps face look clear.</li>
            <li>It works well with my sensitive and combination skin, and I&#x27;m always happy to see my face in a mirror in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is the first toner I&#x27;ve been able to use!  </li>
            <li>They are gentile and easily remove makeup and tone skin on use.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>We have become strong supporters of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>the fine mist feels good on my face... like a mini spa facial :)</li>
            <li>This is not only the best, herb-based, holistic healthy facial toning product out there, and I&#x27;ve tried more than 10 or 12 of these over the decades, but it never smells perfume-y, or chemically.</li>
            <li>It tightens the pores and makes my face smooth.</li>
            <li>I decided to get it right away because the price is much better.</li>
            <li>but so worth it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This facial toner feels so nice going on and is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Dr. H&#x27;s products for about 3 months now and my face feels so smooth, calm and moisture balanced.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to it at a yoga retreat where I had a great facial with Dr. Hauschka products.  </li>
            <li>This is crafted in Switzerland with mostly true organic herbs, and processed in the spagyric method pioneered by ancient alchemists and refined by Rudolph Steiner, which builds up the potency of herbal concentrates and transforms the molecular structure of the water used, resulting in multiplying the benefits and stability.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Toner was well packed for shipment and arrived quite quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very refreshed and smooth</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s 2 outrageously useful bonuses.</li>
            <li>Of course using their whole facial line would probably produce the best result, but for me the toner is enough to do the trick.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the Dr. Hauschka Sensitive Skin products.</li>
            <li>Because I believe it is very important what I put on my skin, I always use the Facial Toner and Revitalizing Day Cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 8 months and am just finishing up my first bottle, so it lasts a while for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m male and love Dr. Hauschka.  </li>
            <li>I use this exactly as directed: alone at night after cleansing, and alone in the morning after cleansing and under makeup.  </li>
            <li>I find it satisfactory in that it does exactly what it claimed it would do.</li>
            <li>and my check is clear, smooth and even toned.  </li>
            <li>Light base toner, very effective when applied before the rose cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried SOOOOO many different products in the past couple of years, so was excited to read such great reviews on these sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li>The moisturizers smell pretty decent.</li>
            <li>This product seems expensive but it is the most amazing stuff for remove grime and oil from your face and neck.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of it at Whole Foods and was really hooked but didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for it.</li>
            <li>I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive&lt;</li>
            <li>This toner is sprayed on your face and you can either let it soak in or you can gently &amp;#34;press&amp;#34; it into your pores.</li>
            <li>The products from Dr haushka are so gentle</li>
            <li>It arrived fast with no packaging issues</li>
            <li>the one from Whole Foods did not bring them in the package.</li>
            <li>About six years ago, I started using Dr. H&#x27;s Toner like religion, with sweet almond oil as my only moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF.</li>
            <li>After I tried many different cosmetic items, I realized I always come back to this toner!</li>
            <li>What this toner does is accelerate the cooling off process, but without drying like all colognes, with their high alcohol content would.</li>
            <li>I like trying new cosmetics, and I have tried many other facial toners after I used Dr. Hauschka first time.</li>
            <li>I rarely need an extra moisturizer or acne spot treatment because it balances my skin to normal.  </li>
            <li>Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li>Delicate but effective.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have oily skin (use the Clarifying Toner) or very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This one from Amazon is a little darker and the smell is not so pleasant as the other one.</li>
            <li>I tried to compare the ingredients to find something new but</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is simply the only brand  that leaves my skin smooth without that  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s subtle but effective.</li>
            <li>Very natural &amp; nourishing.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>&quot; does not mean you can&#x27;t be allergic or sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these products work well for me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula since I had the old one it&#x27;s been a while, or one of them is really not the original.</li>
            <li>have a mixed complexion which gets dry depending on weather conditions and the cleaning combination have worked great for the past almost 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I actually cannot tell if this product (alone) helps decrease shine of my sensitive, mildy acne-prone skin, but it certainly does not hurt.</li>
            <li>The scent and the feel is so refreshing, sometimes I just spritz a little in the middle of the day as a pick-me-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got quite sensitive skin, and mosquito bites blow up and itch for 48 hours.</li>
            <li>It *never, ever* dries out the skin, not even the sensitive under-eye skin.</li>
            <li>It feels natural and not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how alcohol is acceptable in a sensitive skin care line.</li>
            <li>But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine</li>
            <li>It does have alcohol (from the fermentation of the flowers) but it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>this right after cleaning my face - it&#x27;s not drying at all but seems to balance my combination skin with the other products I use (Acne.org&#x27;s AHA+ lotion and Neutrogena sensitive lotion).</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend trying Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Facial Toner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came from NYC, just a short distance from where I live, so it didn&#x27;t have that far to travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to buy this toner at Whole Foods, but not as often as I wanted due to the high price.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, with peri-oral dermatitis, generally at the touch of a product.</li>
            <li>My new bottle also smells different than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; scent, but I am keeping it anyway.  </li>
            <li>but I noticed right away the slight difference of color between the two products.</li>
            <li>This stuff is High Quality, more expensive than some, but it&#x27;s highly concentrated so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Dermatologists will tell you to stay away from alcohol, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>one of those ladies whose face is really red after washing it so using this toner has helped naturally calm that down ALOT.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Not good for true sensitive/allergenic skin!</li>
            <li>What ever the composition of this elixir from heaven is, it also helps fight extreme heat, whether diluted in a water spray bottle or used straight from the glass bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have had problems finding a good facial treatment since cutting out parabans, sulfates, etc from my products.</li>
            <li>So the speedy way this product not only removes mosquito bite swelling but also stops the itching is a major feature for me.</li>
            <li>be means of AMAZON.COM which is a great , awful pretty web.</li>
            <li>I like this toner because others I&#x27;ve tried tend to dry my skin, for example, the Clinique sensitive toner years ago or simple witch hazel.</li>
            <li>A weird additional WOW feature,that no one ever talks about: Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Facial Toner DISAPPEARS MOSQUITO BITES AND in 4 quick sprays over 15 minutes, IT EVEN STOPS THE ITCHING!</li>
            <li>Those annoying large pores that many of us get near the nose and chin are visibly smaller.</li>
            <li>I cannot say I noticed any effect- good or bad, except on my credit card.</li>

            <li> have a mixed complexion which gets dry depending on weather conditions and the cleaning combination have worked great for the past almost 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually cannot tell if this product (alone) helps decrease shine of my sensitive, mildy acne-prone skin, but it certainly does not hurt.</li>
            <li> The scent and the feel is so refreshing, sometimes I just spritz a little in the middle of the day as a pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got quite sensitive skin, and mosquito bites blow up and itch for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> It *never, ever* dries out the skin, not even the sensitive under-eye skin.</li>
            <li> It feels natural and not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how alcohol is acceptable in a sensitive skin care line.</li>
            <li> But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine</li>
            <li> It does have alcohol (from the fermentation of the flowers) but it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> this right after cleaning my face - it&#x27;s not drying at all but seems to balance my combination skin with the other products I use (Acne.org&#x27;s AHA+ lotion and Neutrogena sensitive lotion).</li>
            <li> I still highly recommend trying Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Facial Toner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came from NYC, just a short distance from where I live, so it didn&#x27;t have that far to travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to buy this toner at Whole Foods, but not as often as I wanted due to the high price.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, with peri-oral dermatitis, generally at the touch of a product.</li>
            <li> My new bottle also smells different than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; scent, but I am keeping it anyway.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed right away the slight difference of color between the two products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is High Quality, more expensive than some, but it&#x27;s highly concentrated so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Dermatologists will tell you to stay away from alcohol, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> one of those ladies whose face is really red after washing it so using this toner has helped naturally calm that down ALOT.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Not good for true sensitive/allergenic skin!</li>
            <li> What ever the composition of this elixir from heaven is, it also helps fight extreme heat, whether diluted in a water spray bottle or used straight from the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have had problems finding a good facial treatment since cutting out parabans, sulfates, etc from my products.</li>
            <li> So the speedy way this product not only removes mosquito bite swelling but also stops the itching is a major feature for me.</li>
            <li> be means of AMAZON.COM which is a great , awful pretty web.</li>
            <li> I like this toner because others I&#x27;ve tried tend to dry my skin, for example, the Clinique sensitive toner years ago or simple witch hazel.</li>
            <li> A weird additional WOW feature,that no one ever talks about: Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Facial Toner DISAPPEARS MOSQUITO BITES AND in 4 quick sprays over 15 minutes, IT EVEN STOPS THE ITCHING!</li>
            <li> Those annoying large pores that many of us get near the nose and chin are visibly smaller.</li>
            <li> I cannot say I noticed any effect- good or bad, except on my credit card.</li>
            <li> But it does smell just ever so slightly of a green meadow with tiny mountain flowers, and I swear, also like high mountain stream water.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this for a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin immediately went back to looking dull and older.  </li>
            <li> The product lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> As soon as I use them up, I&#x27;m going back to the other products.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to other toners,</li>
            <li> inside of the box was wet and the bottle was not completely full.&lt;br /&gt;There was a bubble inside for protection and it was in a plastic bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 59) should be treated with the Regenerating Serum and Cream, I plunked down the big bucks for those items.  </li>
            <li> I recently received a toner bottle which had brown specks floating in it and the smell of the product was completely different than it&#x27;s usual scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in public spaces and camping when thegreatest thing to help heat-intolerant me is using one of those little plastic water spritzers on your face and neck to fight off heat where there&#x27;s no a/c.</li>
            <li> I love these products , but some smell so bad .</li>
            <li> Toner has a unusual smell...not bad, just don&#x27;t like it on face, and it has a unusual sensation residual on face that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricier than I was looking to spend, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, I will definitely purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received other toner and never had this happen.  </li>
            <li> And my daughter, who is 25 and battling some acne, is now using the other products, too.  </li>
            <li> Apparently you can develop just as bad reactions to them (maybe even more likely) than others unfortunately.</li>
            <li> they live up to their expectations, do what they&#x27;re supposed to do without irritating your skin and even though a bit pricey -</li>
            <li> Apparently that&#x27;s another reason so little alcohol is used, less than usual for a toner-type product.</li>
            <li> you will perceive smaller pores, fewer blemishes, less redness and fewer small lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores, oily combination skin, random zits, and loads of blackheads.  </li>
            <li> but I did not have the chance to narrow it down with \\&quot;on fire\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> dried out feeling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong like when you have a mask on</li>
            <li> I get very subtle red bumps when I overuse this product around my skin, so I spritz it around my face or into my hands and pat it everywhere</li>
            <li> I swear it&#x27;s helped slow down the aging process by keeping my skin firm.</li>
            <li> In the spray bottle you use very, very little.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was caused by all of them or just one,</li>
            <li> during the slightly oily era into the, ahem!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems as though the toner product has changed or somehow possibly this is a bad batch of toners (I have read other reviews with similar complaints)?  </li>
            <li> mature skin era :()</li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> You will become addicted too!</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Best. Over the last 25 years, on and off I&#x27;ve used this product...during the slightly oily era into the, ahem!! mature skin era :() This is not only the best, herb-based, holistic healthy facial toning product out there, and I&#x27;ve tried more than 10 or 12 of these over the decades, but it never smells perfume-y, or chemically. But it does smell just ever so slightly of a green meadow with tiny mountain flowers, and I swear, also like high mountain stream water. I&#x27;m not kidding.    A weird additional WOW feature,that no one ever talks about: Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Facial Toner DISAPPEARS MOSQUITO BITES AND in 4 quick sprays over 15 minutes, IT EVEN STOPS THE ITCHING! I&#x27;ve got quite sensitive skin, and mosquito bites blow up and itch for 48 hours. Mosquitoes inevitably find their way in the kitchen window or sneak in when the front door&#x27;s opened. About six years ago, I started using Dr. H&#x27;s Toner like religion, with sweet almond oil as my only moisturizer. So the speedy way this product not only removes mosquito bite swelling but also stops the itching is a major feature for me. That&#x27;s 2 outrageously useful bonuses. It *never, ever* dries out the skin, not even the sensitive under-eye skin. I&#x27;ve seen it reduce bruises and their achyness in 24 hours, as well.     How does it do that? This is crafted in Switzerland with mostly true organic herbs, and processed in the spagyric method pioneered by ancient alchemists and refined by Rudolph Steiner, which builds up the potency of herbal concentrates and transforms the molecular structure of the water used, resulting in multiplying the benefits and stability. Apparently that&#x27;s another reason so little alcohol is used, less than usual for a toner-type product.I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, but I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference this Dr. Hauschka product made in my skin.    Finally, I&#x27;d add that there&#x27;s another stealth benefit/bonus use no one has publicized for Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Facial Toner. I&#x27;ve been in public spaces and camping when thegreatest thing to help heat-intolerant me is using one of those little plastic water spritzers on your face and neck to fight off heat where there&#x27;s no a/c. What this toner does is accelerate the cooling off process, but without drying like all colognes, with their high alcohol content would. What ever the composition of this elixir from heaven is, it also helps fight extreme heat, whether diluted in a water spray bottle or used straight from the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> This works great, Helps face look clear.</li>
            <li> We have become strong supporters of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products. Everything we have tried has been impeccable and really works. This toner leaves your face feeling perfectly taught without that stretch feeling. It feels natural and not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! If I had to choose, this would be the one beauty product I took with me on a desert island. The scent and the feel is so refreshing, sometimes I just spritz a little in the middle of the day as a pick-me-up. Those annoying large pores that many of us get near the nose and chin are visibly smaller. I swear it&#x27;s helped slow down the aging process by keeping my skin firm. Highly recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have oily skin (use the Clarifying Toner) or very sensitive skin. You will become addicted too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful--Dr Hauschka is the best!</li>
            <li> great. Good seller. Product as described. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for over 2 years now and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the Dr. Hauschka Sensitive Skin products. I have tried SOOOOO many different products in the past couple of years, so was excited to read such great reviews on these sensitive skin products. I purchased the cleansing milk, toner and rose day cream-light. After 2 days my face felt like it was on fire and since has been extrememly flakey all over. Not sure if it was caused by all of them or just one, but I did not have the chance to narrow it down with \\&quot;on fire\\&quot; skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had problems finding a good facial treatment since cutting out parabans, sulfates, etc from my products. I found the reason is just bc it&#x27;s organic or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; does not mean you can&#x27;t be allergic or sensitive to it. Apparently you can develop just as bad reactions to them (maybe even more likely) than others unfortunately. These products also have alcohol! I have no idea how alcohol is acceptable in a sensitive skin care line. Dermatologists will tell you to stay away from alcohol, especially if you have sensitive skin. Disappointed in this line. Not good for true sensitive/allergenic skin!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this facial toner.  I feel so refreshed using this.  I have been using Dr. H&#x27;s products for about 3 months now and my face feels so smooth, calm and moisture balanced.  This facial toner feels so nice going on and is so refreshing.  I love it.  I will definitely be buying this for a long time.</li>
            <li> When the facial toner arrived, on Oct 8, the outside of the box was wet.&lt;br /&gt;It came from NYC, just a short distance from where I live, so it didn&#x27;t have that far to travel.&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the box was wet and the bottle was not completely full.&lt;br /&gt;There was a bubble inside for protection and it was in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;It may have been the top was not protected.&lt;br /&gt;I did not return it because I hate going to the post office.  It&#x27;s a headache for me.&lt;br /&gt;But the product was somehow damaged in order for it to leak like that.&lt;br /&gt;Could you send a replacement?&lt;br /&gt;Mary MOrgan</li>
            <li> I actually cannot tell if this product (alone) helps decrease shine of my sensitive, mildy acne-prone skin, but it certainly does not hurt. I like the smell and the feel of this right after cleaning my face - it&#x27;s not drying at all but seems to balance my combination skin with the other products I use (Acne.org&#x27;s AHA+ lotion and Neutrogena sensitive lotion). I have been using this for about 8 months and am just finishing up my first bottle, so it lasts a while for the price.</li>
            <li> This product seems expensive but it is the most amazing stuff for remove grime and oil from your face and neck. I got a sample of it at Whole Foods and was really hooked but didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for it. When I found it on Amazon I was very happy. In the spray bottle you use very, very little. I put it on a cotton pad (works better than a cotton) ball. It is the best smell ever.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t imagined that I could buy it in US be means of AMAZON.COM which is a great , awful pretty web. As you know, this product is made in Deuschland.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of treatments, some rx&#x27;d by Dermatologists and nothing moderates the redness like these products.  They are gentile and easily remove makeup and tone skin on use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and love Dr. Hauschka.  I use the cleansing cream, clarifying toner, daily eye cream, quince day cream and recently the rejuvenation serum.  Takes an extra 5 minutes in the morning.  Great products with results.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this morning and night time. It tightens the pores and makes my face smooth. I pair this with quince face cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is High Quality, more expensive than some, but it&#x27;s highly concentrated so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores, oily combination skin, random zits, and loads of blackheads.  Within a week of using this twice a day, I can actually run my fingers over my face and not feel a million tiny bumps. My nose is not even blackhead central anymore.  My complexion is brighter, clearer, and cleaner.  I use this exactly as directed: alone at night after cleansing, and alone in the morning after cleansing and under makeup.  I rarely need an extra moisturizer or acne spot treatment because it balances my skin to normal.  I also use a Pretika facial sonic brush and an eye cream twice a day.  At 24, I look younger than I did 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products. Because I believe it is very important what I put on my skin, I always use the Facial Toner and Revitalizing Day Cream. I have very good skin with no wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Three out of the four dr Hauschka bottles of toner had brown stuff floating around in the bottle even though the expiry date is 01 2015.  I&#x27;ve received other toner and never had this happen.  Would like to know if this will effect the product.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be mixing in with the liquid after being shaken.</li>
            <li> This toner is great! Especially during the summer. I tend to get oily by the end of the day and this toner has help keep my t-zone under control. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.</li>
            <li> I bumped into a Hauschka saleswoman stocking her shelves at a Whole Foods and she explained how to care for my skin with the product line. So I ordered the Cleansing Milk, Cleansing Cream, Facial Toner, Normalizing Day Oil, Daily Moisturizing Cream and the Lavender Oil from Amazon since it was a better deal than at WF. As she instructed, I filled a basin with really warm water and added the Lavender Bath Essence to it, then soaked a facecloth in it and held that to my face for a bit.  Then cleaned with the cream in the morning, the milk at night.  At night, per her instructions, I only applied the Facial Toner and patted that in. In the morning, I applied the toner, then squirted a bit of Moisturizing Cream into palm and mixed that with 2 drops of the Normalizing Oil.  Within a week, people were complimenting me on my skin. I could see that it looked brighter, healthier, younger. But after reading on the Haushka website that mature skin like mine (I&#x27;m 59) should be treated with the Regenerating Serum and Cream, I plunked down the big bucks for those items.  My skin immediately went back to looking dull and older.  The serum leaves the skin feeling sticky; the cream reeks of mocha and doesn&#x27;t seem to add any moisture.  As soon as I use them up, I&#x27;m going back to the other products.  And my daughter, who is 25 and battling some acne, is now using the other products, too.  Her skin is improving daily, hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy and clear in several years.</li>
            <li> Been using Dr H products for 30 years. Have tried others &amp; always returned to these. Very natural &amp; nourishing.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr. Hauschka Facial Toner for over a year.  I was first introduced to it at a yoga retreat where I had a great facial with Dr. Hauschka products.  Unfortunately, it seems as though the toner product has changed or somehow possibly this is a bad batch of toners (I have read other reviews with similar complaints)?  I recently received a toner bottle which had brown specks floating in it and the smell of the product was completely different than it&#x27;s usual scent.  I returned the bottle and re-ordered as I really love the product!  My new bottle also smells different than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; scent, but I am keeping it anyway.  I am now questioning if this is the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;  Dr. Hauschka product???</li>
            <li> Seriously- I cannot say I noticed any effect- good or bad, except on my credit card. I would skip this one.</li>
            <li> I have the Quince cream the, cleanser, the mask, etc. and thought I would give the toner a try... love it! My skin feels nourished... the fine mist feels good on my face... like a mini spa facial :)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  It&#x27;s refreshing and holistic.</li>
            <li> I like trying new cosmetics, and I have tried many other facial toners after I used Dr. Hauschka first time. I was happy after I used my first bottle, but I still wanted to find something better. After I tried many different cosmetic items, I realized I always come back to this toner! It works well with my sensitive and combination skin, and I&#x27;m always happy to see my face in a mirror in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Hauschka products for 15 years. I have sensitive skin and these products work well for me! Very Happy!</li>
            <li> This is the first toner I&#x27;ve been able to use!  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, with peri-oral dermatitis, generally at the touch of a product. I get very subtle red bumps when I overuse this product around my skin, so I spritz it around my face or into my hands and pat it everywhere but my problem areas. It does have alcohol (from the fermentation of the flowers) but it&#x27;s all natural so I know no damage is being done. I&#x27;m hoping my skin will ease up to it soon!</li>
            <li> Delicate but effective.</li>
            <li> Just love the smell of Hauschka body products. Expensive but so worth it!  Toner was well packed for shipment and arrived quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like how it made my skin feel somewhat tacky.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr Hauschka&#x27;s facial toner and cleanser for over a year now. I have very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;skin and these products have worked the best for me. I use the toner because it gives my face a smoother look and reduces the size of pores. I am very satisfied with the product  but I do think it is way overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;It is simply the only brand  that leaves my skin smooth without that  dried out feeling</li>
            <li> Let me please say that all of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products are wonderful... they live up to their expectations, do what they&#x27;re supposed to do without irritating your skin and even though a bit pricey - you get what you pay for. This toner is sprayed on your face and you can either let it soak in or you can gently &amp;#34;press&amp;#34; it into your pores. Either way, you are left with a glowing (NOT oily) face that feels invigorated and cleased of impurities with smaller pores. The product lasts a long time... perhaps about two months when used as directed. Of course using their whole facial line would probably produce the best result, but for me the toner is enough to do the trick. It&#x27;s worth every penny! I believe it&#x27;s even on S&amp;S so you can save even more money! Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so please remember my experience may not be yours. I still highly recommend trying Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Facial Toner. I think you will notice a change in your skin... you will perceive smaller pores, fewer blemishes, less redness and fewer small lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle or an anti-aging wonder but your skin will appear firmer and refreshingly more youthful. Keep with it and you&#x27;ll notice the difference. Good health and beauty while using this product!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m hooked. It makes my skin feel very refreshed and smooth and it has a nice scent. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than I was looking to spend, but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, I will definitely purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> I use the Dr Haushka line and this toner  makes me feel &amp;#34;finished &amp;#34; after cleansing.  The products from Dr haushka are so gentle</li>
            <li> I almost love this product. It&#x27;s almost a 5 star. I just can&#x27;t get over the herbal smell of it, but it feels SO good to use!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those ladies whose face is really red after washing it so using this toner has helped naturally calm that down ALOT.&lt;br /&gt;You can also feel the actual tightening once it starts drying too! It&#x27;s not strong like when you have a mask on and it&#x27;s drying..it&#x27;s subtle but effective. I can&#x27;t go back to other toners, not even dermalogica has this beat!</li>
            <li> This made a big impact in my wife&#x27;s facial skin, she uses it daily and loves it. It smells roses, i like the smell</li>
            <li> Light base toner, very effective when applied before the rose cream. After using a year you will notice an amazing difference in your skin tone.</li>
            <li> Probably some of the best skincare out there</li>
            <li> Love this stuff best toner ever</li>
            <li> I like this toner because others I&#x27;ve tried tend to dry my skin, for example, the Clinique sensitive toner years ago or simple witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I love these products , but some smell so bad . If it was not for the smell they would be 5 STARS in my book , but the smell does not help. The moisturizers smell pretty decent. I love them .</li>
            <li> simply the best, my wife&#x27;s go to.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of brand&#x27;s products, I am faithful to this and the cleansing milk.&lt;br /&gt;I have a mixed complexion which gets dry depending on weather conditions and the cleaning combination have worked great for the past almost 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I like the &amp;#34;no night cream&amp;#34; Hauschka&#x27;s solution, it saves me money and the skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;FYI i am 38</li>
            <li> I have used it as a part of my daily facial care routine for about a year.  I find it satisfactory in that it does exactly what it claimed it would do.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this toner at Whole Foods, but not as often as I wanted due to the high price. When I saw it in Amazon.com I decided to get it right away because the price is much better. It arrived fast with no packaging issues but I noticed right away the slight difference of color between the two products. This one from Amazon is a little darker and the smell is not so pleasant as the other one. I tried to compare the ingredients to find something new but the one from Whole Foods did not bring them in the package. Nevertheless I&#x27;m using it and it seems to have the same effect. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula since I had the old one it&#x27;s been a while, or one of them is really not the original. I&#x27;m using it anyway for it seems to be ok.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and she swears by this. Has been using it for years and after trying others always comes back.</li>
            <li> This toner is not one that I like on my face...I&#x27;ve decided to use on my neck, decollage  and it feels good and my check is clear, smooth and even toned.  Toner has a unusual smell...not bad, just don&#x27;t like it on face, and it has a unusual sensation residual on face that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
