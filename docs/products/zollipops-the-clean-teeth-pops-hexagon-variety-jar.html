            <li>Well, they LOVED them.  </li>
            <li>my kids said it taste really good</li>
            <li>Sweets that are actually good for you.</li>
            <li>and I feel much better about giving them candy knowing that they&#x27;re sugar-free and good for their teeth!</li>

            <li>This is an Amazing Product.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell what flavor I was eating.....</li>
            <li>He liked the flavors.</li>
            <li>My family liked the taste of these lollipops, but there were some issues with them.</li>
            <li>I liked the flavor variety too, no yucky lemons or limes.  </li>
            <li>to see if they even liked them.  </li>
            <li>Kids are loving that too.</li>
            <li>I wish this young entrepreneur all the good fortune with a very good product</li>
            <li>My husband and I also ate 2 each and those came off very easily from the stick as well.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I love how they make my mouth and breath feel.</li>
            <li>I need to order more.</li>
            <li>The taste is okay.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a sue happy person because it really dehydrated me.....  </li>
            <li>Already requested that I buy more.</li>
            <li>My kids love the flavors and of course I love that I can give the kids lollypops without the candy guilt.</li>
            <li>my grandsons love them</li>
            <li>Perfect pop size for them also, not too big.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably end up ordering some more</li>
            <li>I ordered these just for that reason, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>They love them.</li>
            <li>Kids love the flavors.  </li>
            <li>I bought more.</li>
            <li>Kids should love them.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would get my finicky grandchildren to reach for the zollipop bag, versus their candies of choice, but it was easier than I thought.</li>
            <li>Immediately, they asked if it was ok to have one, as well?</li>
            <li>I am glad that they are healthy for him.</li>
            <li>They taste just like a lollipop  my kids love them</li>
            <li>My kids love these</li>
            <li>I threw most of them away.  </li>
            <li>My kids love these.</li>
            <li>These taste pretty good</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>If I could give these a zero, that would be more accurate.</li>
            <li>Within the first week, they started, kind of, sorta melting.  </li>
            <li>Great lollipops to give my kids as an after dinner treat or middle of the day treat.</li>
            <li>We also tried Nature&#x27;s Plus sugar free Vitamin C that has xylitol .  </li>
            <li>My only issue is that our bag did not have a good mix of flavors, we got mostly orange and raspberry for some reason.</li>
            <li>I will still use them myself but that was not the original intention.</li>
            <li>daughter and granddaughter were so excited when they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Emma</li>
            <li>However, users should be aware that more often than not, the stick comes out of the lollipop.</li>
            <li>Grandchildren love these purchased them several times, parents were thrilled also</li>
            <li>Tasted great &amp; nice treat, sent them to my kids in the military to have something decent for their teeth.</li>
            <li>Come in interesting flavors, take as long to eat as most desserts, and are much better for your teeth and your waistline.</li>
            <li>they fall right off the stick!</li>
            <li>They taste good and clean your teeth at the same time.</li>
            <li>However, there are times I want a sweet treat but want to avoid any sugar on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They think i am the cool mom letting them have candy....</li>
            <li>My daughter goes gaga for candy and sweet treats and we don&#x27;t want to give her junk.</li>
            <li>Low calorie and good assortment of flavors.</li>
            <li>More like very unstable hard-ish candy.  </li>
            <li>not bad seems to start getting sticky inside package tho</li>
            <li>so I have clean teeth and fresh breath as I am screaming at the opposing team!&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>MADE MY TEETH, AND MOUTH FEEL CLEAN, AND FRESH</li>
            <li>The flavors are delicious, natural tasting, and do not have a bitter aftertaste you often expect from alternative sweeteners.  </li>
            <li>They are super sticky so don&#x27;t leave them out on anything.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>They were for my husband who needs sugar-free, and I wanted him to try the more natural kinds.</li>
            <li>I saw these on TV and thought they were worth a shot.</li>
            <li>However, I think these are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the flavors are good, but I wish the variety packs were more evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>I love that they are not sour!</li>
            <li>The flavor is great, but these should not be given to small children, but anyone could choke on them.</li>
            <li>Took a while to get them, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>And they won&#x27;t get cavities ( 2 pops a day is the limit for each of them otherwise they would eat the whole bag ! )</li>
            <li>but it is unfortunately not something I would buy again unless this problem is resolved.</li>
            <li>Yes they did, very tastety!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll just stick with regular  lollipops which also taste a lot better.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d known about xylitol in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having these products!  </li>
            <li>That was probably due to the lollipop being kind of gooey and stuck to the wrapper.</li>
            <li>Other than that, she liked the taste.</li>
            <li>They really taste great but hard to overcome thr negitives.  </li>
            <li>One, they came off the stick pretty much as soon as we started sucking on them.</li>
            <li>These lollipops taste just as good if not better than those bought at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>These melt too easily, at about 80+ degrees, then get slimy and gritty.</li>
            <li>On the bright side the suckers do not leave that sugary feeling on our teeth</li>
            <li>order was processed and shipped in a very timely manner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because we really like the way they taste.</li>
            <li>I did the Heimlich maneuver on him and it came out whole.</li>
            <li>My grandsons liked them but the pops got sticky and gooey after a few weeks plus when you managed to unwrap them, the stick came out.</li>
            <li>I feel better handing these to my children when they have earned a treat rather than the conventional lollipop with food coloring and/or</li>
            <li>Overall not bad.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of these pops, however only 4 stars because my daughter says they&#x27;re gross.</li>
            <li>high fructose</li>
            <li>Again, this does not make them bad, but I suspect that a repackaging and reformulation is in order to make them a perfect item on every level.</li>
            <li>My kids like them (not quite as much as dum dums that they get outside of the home, but they &#x27;accept&#x27; these and enjoy them all the same).</li>
            <li>I myself tested a few more</li>
            <li>As time went by, they liquified inside the bag, and they were being kept in a cool, dry place.</li>
            <li>Kate looked forwarded to getting a new treat every evening after finishing her meal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(We are still on our first bag, so I suppose it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just an issue with this bag, but I doubt it.)</li>
            <li>I do not ordinarily give candy to my grandchildren</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but bought these for my 2year old, &amp; although she didn&#x27;t mind the taste (there pretty gross!)</li>
            <li>Great little suckers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We purchased a bag of these at our local Whole Foods Market and my 2.5 year old was sucking on it</li>
            <li>wow had to try it.</li>
            <li>So far, she likes them (20 months old).</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended these Zollipops for my five year old son.</li>
            <li>so they were surprised when I offered them these.</li>
            <li>and, if left in the bag for a week or so, becoming a sticky mess (melting?).  </li>
            <li>and yep they come right off the stick, one came off the stick before I even got it out of the wrapper (by the way there super sticky &amp; hard to open!)</li>
            <li>Be careful eating too much xylitol!</li>
            <li>I really like these, flavor is nice and nothing artificial.</li>
            <li>I think this is a problem with xylitol in general but should be pointed out on the package.  </li>
            <li>That is fine with me,  though can be problematic for kids who actually want a sucker on a stick.</li>
            <li>We love how these taste, however both bags we ordered (on separate occasions) were full of melted pops. :(</li>
            <li>A few was broken ,taste good though ,kids like the pineapple ones</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would still recommend them, as long as your kids are old enough to handle a &amp;#34;hard candy&amp;#34; without the stick.</li>
            <li>However, nearly every single one came off the stick and became a choking hazard.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give my 2 1/2 year old a lollypop where the stick is going to come loose</li>
            <li>Too bad, they are a good idea.</li>

            <li> daughter and granddaughter were so excited when they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Emma</li>
            <li> However, users should be aware that more often than not, the stick comes out of the lollipop.</li>
            <li> Grandchildren love these purchased them several times, parents were thrilled also</li>
            <li> Tasted great &amp; nice treat, sent them to my kids in the military to have something decent for their teeth.</li>
            <li> Come in interesting flavors, take as long to eat as most desserts, and are much better for your teeth and your waistline.</li>
            <li> they fall right off the stick!</li>
            <li> They taste good and clean your teeth at the same time.</li>
            <li> However, there are times I want a sweet treat but want to avoid any sugar on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> They think i am the cool mom letting them have candy....</li>
            <li> My daughter goes gaga for candy and sweet treats and we don&#x27;t want to give her junk.</li>
            <li> Low calorie and good assortment of flavors.</li>
            <li> More like very unstable hard-ish candy.  </li>
            <li> not bad seems to start getting sticky inside package tho</li>
            <li> so I have clean teeth and fresh breath as I am screaming at the opposing team!&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> MADE MY TEETH, AND MOUTH FEEL CLEAN, AND FRESH</li>
            <li> The flavors are delicious, natural tasting, and do not have a bitter aftertaste you often expect from alternative sweeteners.  </li>
            <li> They are super sticky so don&#x27;t leave them out on anything.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> They were for my husband who needs sugar-free, and I wanted him to try the more natural kinds.</li>
            <li> I saw these on TV and thought they were worth a shot.</li>
            <li> However, I think these are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the flavors are good, but I wish the variety packs were more evenly mixed.</li>
            <li> I love that they are not sour!</li>
            <li> The flavor is great, but these should not be given to small children, but anyone could choke on them.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get them, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> And they won&#x27;t get cavities ( 2 pops a day is the limit for each of them otherwise they would eat the whole bag ! )</li>
            <li> but it is unfortunately not something I would buy again unless this problem is resolved.</li>
            <li> Yes they did, very tastety!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll just stick with regular  lollipops which also taste a lot better.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about xylitol in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having these products!  </li>
            <li> That was probably due to the lollipop being kind of gooey and stuck to the wrapper.</li>
            <li> Other than that, she liked the taste.</li>
            <li> They really taste great but hard to overcome thr negitives.  </li>
            <li> One, they came off the stick pretty much as soon as we started sucking on them.</li>
            <li> These lollipops taste just as good if not better than those bought at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> These melt too easily, at about 80+ degrees, then get slimy and gritty.</li>
            <li> On the bright side the suckers do not leave that sugary feeling on our teeth</li>
            <li> order was processed and shipped in a very timely manner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because we really like the way they taste.</li>
            <li> I did the Heimlich maneuver on him and it came out whole.</li>
            <li> My grandsons liked them but the pops got sticky and gooey after a few weeks plus when you managed to unwrap them, the stick came out.</li>
            <li> I feel better handing these to my children when they have earned a treat rather than the conventional lollipop with food coloring and/or</li>
            <li> Overall not bad.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of these pops, however only 4 stars because my daughter says they&#x27;re gross.</li>
            <li> high fructose</li>
            <li> Again, this does not make them bad, but I suspect that a repackaging and reformulation is in order to make them a perfect item on every level.</li>
            <li> My kids like them (not quite as much as dum dums that they get outside of the home, but they &#x27;accept&#x27; these and enjoy them all the same).</li>
            <li> I myself tested a few more</li>
            <li> As time went by, they liquified inside the bag, and they were being kept in a cool, dry place.</li>
            <li> Kate looked forwarded to getting a new treat every evening after finishing her meal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(We are still on our first bag, so I suppose it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just an issue with this bag, but I doubt it.)</li>
            <li> I do not ordinarily give candy to my grandchildren</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but bought these for my 2year old, &amp; although she didn&#x27;t mind the taste (there pretty gross!)</li>
            <li> Great little suckers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We purchased a bag of these at our local Whole Foods Market and my 2.5 year old was sucking on it</li>
            <li> wow had to try it.</li>
            <li> So far, she likes them (20 months old).</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these Zollipops for my five year old son.</li>
            <li> so they were surprised when I offered them these.</li>
            <li> and, if left in the bag for a week or so, becoming a sticky mess (melting?).  </li>
            <li> and yep they come right off the stick, one came off the stick before I even got it out of the wrapper (by the way there super sticky &amp; hard to open!)</li>
            <li> Be careful eating too much xylitol!</li>
            <li> I really like these, flavor is nice and nothing artificial.</li>
            <li> I think this is a problem with xylitol in general but should be pointed out on the package.  </li>
            <li> That is fine with me,  though can be problematic for kids who actually want a sucker on a stick.</li>
            <li> We love how these taste, however both bags we ordered (on separate occasions) were full of melted pops. :(</li>
            <li> A few was broken ,taste good though ,kids like the pineapple ones</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would still recommend them, as long as your kids are old enough to handle a &amp;#34;hard candy&amp;#34; without the stick.</li>
            <li> However, nearly every single one came off the stick and became a choking hazard.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give my 2 1/2 year old a lollypop where the stick is going to come loose</li>
            <li> Too bad, they are a good idea.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers (the 1-star ones at least) I experienced the sad and dangerous situation of the lollipops coming off the stick much too easily</li>
            <li> continue ordering as long as possible!!!</li>
            <li> They have turned all sticky after a short time and the sticks are coming loose from the candy.</li>
            <li> but at least I can give my son a treat without worrying about his teeth so much.</li>
            <li> Another tip is to store xylitol lollipops long term in the fridge-</li>
            <li> First bag had half grape, the other half berry flavor  in it.</li>
            <li> There is no warning that if you have more than one within a certain time frame that it will act like a very bad laxative.  </li>
            <li> My 1 year old loves them and keeps him from crying!</li>
            <li> Also, the sticks seem loose even without the melting.</li>
            <li> Pretty sticky little suckers ....</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> Not a good idea for real young ones because of the choking hazard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult who hasn&#x27;t had a sucker or lollipop since childhood.  </li>
            <li> My kids can never just suck on one without the stick slipping out after a minute.  </li>
            <li> Two year old and his older brothers weren&#x27;t too crazy about them.</li>
            <li> should I have had some other issues and this happened</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and I appreciate that they don&#x27;t have food coloring compared to some other xylitol lollipop brands.</li>
            <li> keep these away from dogs, they are extremely toxic due to the xylitol.</li>
            <li> so they are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Also, since the individual lolllies aren&#x27;t labeled it&#x27;s hard to tell which of the three pink flavors you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> They became sticky and hard to open.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve eaten maybe 6-10 of these, and I&#x27;d say at least 2/3 have come off the stick shortly after you start licking / sucking on it.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing wrong with the taste of these anti-cavity lollypops.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that over time they all melt and are uneatable.</li>
            <li> so there is no risk of my four-year-old setting it down on the coffee table.</li>
            <li> So kids didnt even get to eat half of them.</li>
            <li> We ended up eating about half of them and throwing the rest away because they were so messy.</li>
            <li> Saw the little gal on tv on the Steve Harvey Show &amp; listened to her idea...</li>
            <li> little do they know.</li>
            <li> they are just a little expansive</li>
            <li> cause I can eat a few in one sitting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They came half ruin and melted!</li>
            <li> had five melted stuck together suckers and the other had three!</li>
            <li> I had three at one time as they are EXTREMELY small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they do that, but I&#x27;m going to try another bag and keep them in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> not sure how well they work on teeth yet</li>
            <li> She nearly choked, it was a very scary situation.  </li>
            <li> I bought three bags and have opened two both have random loose sticks and one bag</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so unheard of and hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Halfway through the sucker falls off the stick.</li>
            <li> and it detached from the stick and the sucker became lodged in his throat.</li>
            <li> I am a dental assistant and I specifically searched for the suckers with xylitol.</li>
            <li> slowly trying to get sugar out of our house.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the suckers come off their sticks.  </li>
            <li> The stickiness just gets worse after the bag has been opened.</li>
            <li> I started slow with one of these lollipops daily (they&#x27;re expensive!!!)</li>
            <li> it could have been a very serious issue.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the worst -- they get soft and chewy -- not lollipops at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless to try to use them at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> The ones that weren&#x27;t ruin before I opened my packages turned nasty and gooey in a very short time!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was greatly disappointed with Zollipops but</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I had with these is that they became too sticky it was practically impossible to remove the wrapper.</li>
            <li> It becomes absolutely impossible to get them out of the wrapper.</li>
            <li> I guess she has bad breath-</li>
            <li> This is bad for my toddler.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> They were awful tasting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My kids like it (2 yo an 7 yo).</li>
            <li> A few was broken ,taste good though ,kids like the pineapple ones but there is only one in my bag .bad luck 😆</li>
            <li> These things taste great! I love them! Love all flavors!  Try them out!</li>
            <li> I loved the lollipops for my grandson.</li>
            <li> What a great product! I just wish they were a little bigger cause I can eat a few in one sitting. I tested them out and showed them to my dad and he said please give some to my sister cause I guess she has bad breath- I am going to give them to her and see if it helps her!&lt;br /&gt;I bring them with me to baseball games after eating and drinking these are perfect so I have clean teeth and fresh breath as I am screaming at the opposing team!&lt;br /&gt;Great idea and I wish more people would buy these!</li>
            <li> They tasted good. Took a while to get them, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love how they make my mouth and breath feel. I need to order more.</li>
            <li> The taste is okay.  Unfortunately, the suckers come off their sticks.  This is bad for my toddler.  I will still use them myself but that was not the original intention.</li>
            <li> There is no warning that if you have more than one within a certain time frame that it will act like a very bad laxative.  It&#x27;s a good thing I wasn&#x27;t a sue happy person because it really dehydrated me.....  should I have had some other issues and this happened it could have been a very serious issue.  I had three at one time as they are EXTREMELY small.  There should be a warning about the Consumption of Zollipops my have a laxative effect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the flavors are not all that great tasting.... I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell what flavor I was eating.....</li>
            <li> Bought them for my granddaughter and she loves them. Already requested that I buy more. Great gift for doing good in school and no guilt for giving to kids while knowing it&#x27;s doing their teeth good.</li>
            <li> Within the first week, they started, kind of, sorta melting.  They became sticky and hard to open.  They really taste great but hard to overcome thr negitives.  Do let me know if you fix the problems.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my granddaughter after seeing them on the Steve Harvey Show.&lt;br /&gt;My order was processed and shipped in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and granddaughter were so excited when they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Emma Kate looked forwarded to getting a new treat every evening after finishing her meal.</li>
            <li> They were for my husband who needs sugar-free, and I wanted him to try the more natural kinds. He liked the flavors.</li>
            <li> Love love love! My kids love the flavors and of course I love that I can give the kids lollypops without the candy guilt. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> 2 of my grand kids have braces and 2 of them are on medication, so these work out great... to have a treat at Grandma&#x27;s house!</li>
            <li> my grandsons love them</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers (the 1-star ones at least) I experienced the sad and dangerous situation of the lollipops coming off the stick much too easily and, if left in the bag for a week or so, becoming a sticky mess (melting?).  Other than that, they tasted very good (consequently my 2-star rating).  Needless to say I was greatly disappointed with Zollipops but see their potential is some of their shortcomings could be overcome in the future.</li>
            <li> Yummy for my sons ! And they won&#x27;t get cavities ( 2 pops a day is the limit for each of them otherwise they would eat the whole bag ! ) I sneak one too, lol ! Perfect pop size for them also, not too big.</li>
            <li> Come in interesting flavors, take as long to eat as most desserts, and are much better for your teeth and your waistline.</li>
            <li> I had planed to give them to children, but I have partaken some for my self</li>
            <li> it seems to be a great product delivery was good I&#x27;ll probably end up ordering some more</li>
            <li> MADE MY TEETH, AND MOUTH FEEL CLEAN, AND FRESH</li>
            <li> We love how these taste, however both bags we ordered (on separate occasions) were full of melted pops. :(</li>
            <li> I let my son have these.  There were a lot of pineapple ones in the bag.  Halfway through the sucker falls off the stick. Overall not bad.</li>
            <li> Outstanding!  I&#x27;m an adult who hasn&#x27;t had a sucker or lollipop since childhood.  However, there are times I want a sweet treat but want to avoid any sugar on my teeth.  I ordered these just for that reason, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The flavors are delicious, natural tasting, and do not have a bitter aftertaste you often expect from alternative sweeteners.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. I will not ever purchase again</li>
            <li> My family liked the taste of these lollipops, but there were some issues with them. One, they came off the stick pretty much as soon as we started sucking on them. Two, I had them stored upright in a cup in an air-conditioned house, and the lollipops melted so that the sticks, wrappers, and bottom of the cup were coated in ooey-gooey stickiness. We ended up eating about half of them and throwing the rest away because they were so messy. Perhaps storing them in the refrigerator would help? It&#x27;s a shame, because we really like the way they taste.</li>
            <li> The fact that these are good for the kids&#x27; teeth makes me still give them 4 stars. However, users should be aware that more often than not, the stick comes out of the lollipop. We&#x27;ve eaten maybe 6-10 of these, and I&#x27;d say at least 2/3 have come off the stick shortly after you start licking / sucking on it. We opened one tonight where the stick came out before the wrapping was even off. That was probably due to the lollipop being kind of gooey and stuck to the wrapper. (Not sure why this was, since we keep it in the house, not in a hot spot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would still recommend them, as long as your kids are old enough to handle a &amp;#34;hard candy&amp;#34; without the stick. Not a good idea for real young ones because of the choking hazard they could pose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(We are still on our first bag, so I suppose it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just an issue with this bag, but I doubt it.)</li>
            <li> I give these to the kids as a after dinner treat.  They love them.</li>
            <li> Kids love the flavors.  I bought more.</li>
            <li> Very good flavor, more robust flavor than sugar water lollipops.  I liked the flavor variety too, no yucky lemons or limes.  And I like that it&#x27;s good for your teeth!</li>
            <li> Tasted great &amp; nice treat, sent them to my kids in the military to have something decent for their teeth. Saw the little gal on tv on the Steve Harvey Show &amp; listened to her idea... wow had to try it. Good price too, I recommend you try it!!</li>
            <li> Purchased it to see how they taste.  Kids should love them.  I like that they do not contain sugar.</li>
            <li> Kids like them a lot.  They have  good flavors.  What I like is that they don&#x27;t leave a gritty film on your teeth like sugary sweets.</li>
            <li> Great lollipops to give my kids as an after dinner treat or middle of the day treat. I love that they are not sour! Plus they have no idea that these pops are good for their teeth.  I keep a stash in my purse when we are out and about for after meals. They think i am the cool mom letting them have candy....little do they know.</li>
            <li> My daughter goes gaga for candy and sweet treats and we don&#x27;t want to give her junk. I saw these on TV and thought they were worth a shot. So far, she likes them (20 months old). They are super sticky so don&#x27;t leave them out on anything.</li>
            <li> These taste pretty good and I appreciate that they don&#x27;t have food coloring compared to some other xylitol lollipop brands. My kids like them (not quite as much as dum dums that they get outside of the home, but they &#x27;accept&#x27; these and enjoy them all the same). I just wish these were as inexpensive as dum dums! However, I think these are well worth the price. I feel better handing these to my children when they have earned a treat rather than the conventional lollipop with food coloring and/or high fructose corn syrup and/or GMO ingredients. We will purchase these again for sure! WARNING: keep these away from dogs, they are extremely toxic due to the xylitol. Educate your children about this as well. I only give these in the car or at outings so there is no risk of my four-year-old setting it down on the coffee table. Another tip is to store xylitol lollipops long term in the fridge- they last a lot longer and don&#x27;t get as &#x27;sticky&#x27; as if stored at room temp.</li>
            <li> They have turned all sticky after a short time and the sticks are coming loose from the candy. I can&#x27;t give my 2 1/2 year old a lollypop where the stick is going to come loose so they are pretty much useless. Other than that, she liked the taste.</li>
            <li> These melt too easily, at about 80+ degrees, then get slimy and gritty. I think this is a problem with xylitol in general but should be pointed out on the package.  Also, the sticks seem loose even without the melting. My kids can never just suck on one without the stick slipping out after a minute.  Lastly, the flavors are good, but I wish the variety packs were more evenly mixed. First bag had half grape, the other half berry flavor  in it. Also, since the individual lolllies aren&#x27;t labeled it&#x27;s hard to tell which of the three pink flavors you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I had with these is that they became too sticky it was practically impossible to remove the wrapper. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a xylitol product or something else unrelated to the xylitol but it is unfortunately not something I would buy again unless this problem is resolved.</li>
            <li> CHOKING HAZARD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchased a bag of these at our local Whole Foods Market and my 2.5 year old was sucking on it and it detached from the stick and the sucker became lodged in his throat. I did the Heimlich maneuver on him and it came out whole. Praise God!  My husband and I also ate 2 each and those came off very easily from the stick as well. The flavor is great, but these should not be given to small children, but anyone could choke on them. I would like to see these in a softer candy form.</li>
            <li> Great taste. Low calorie and good assortment of flavors.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but bought these for my 2year old, &amp; although she didn&#x27;t mind the taste (there pretty gross!) they fall right off the stick! She nearly choked, it was a very scary situation.  I myself tested a few more and yep they come right off the stick, one came off the stick before I even got it out of the wrapper (by the way there super sticky &amp; hard to open!) The rest of the bag went in the trashcan!</li>
            <li> Yes they did, very tastety!</li>
            <li> Great little suckers. Good flavor too.</li>
            <li> I really liked the pineapple flavored zollipops!!! I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would get my finicky grandchildren to reach for the zollipop bag, versus their candies of choice, but it was easier than I thought. One night after dinner, I  started eating one without asking them did they won&#x27;t to try it. Immediately, they asked if it was ok to have one, as well? No fuss, only smiles even from the parents; especially when they saw the anti-cavity label!!!</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great idea. got them to help with potty training. Two year old and his older brothers weren&#x27;t too crazy about them. Still in my cabinet. Sorry I can&#x27;t give a better review.</li>
            <li> They are awesome. Would buy from again..</li>
            <li> Delicious, but come apart easily. Stick doesn&#x27;t stay in the candy. Still yummy &amp; good for teeth so it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing wrong with the taste of these anti-cavity lollypops. I did not purchase them for the taste, and they are not objectionable in any way. However, they seem to almost border on a chewable candy. That is also not a problem, except for the fact that they stick to the wrapper with great tenacity yet dislodge from the stick almost immediately. Again, this does not make them bad, but I suspect that a repackaging and reformulation is in order to make them a perfect item on every level. Otherwise, recommended. (Absolutely not, however, for young children for obvious reasons.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/20/15:  I threw these into the trash. It&#x27;s useless to try to use them at all. The stickiness just gets worse after the bag has been opened. It becomes absolutely impossible to get them out of the wrapper. I tossed several of them out during the futile attempts to remove the wrapper -- forget about the sticks. As time went by, they liquified inside the bag, and they were being kept in a cool, dry place. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I really like these, flavor is nice and nothing artificial. The only complaint is that over time they all melt and are uneatable. I had a 1/2 of a bag that I had to throw away. I&#x27;m not sure why they do that, but I&#x27;m going to try another bag and keep them in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> not sure how well they work on teeth yet but great flavors</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and kid loves it.</li>
            <li> My son loved the taste of these. However, nearly every single one came off the stick and became a choking hazard. It bummed me out because they were inexpensive and he loved them. Fix the sticks and you&#x27;ll have a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Literally no raspberry or pineapple flavor. Don&#x27;t taste as good as I thought.</li>
            <li> Taste great, though they always come off the stick.  That is fine with me,  though can be problematic for kids who actually want a sucker on a stick.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the worst -- they get soft and chewy -- not lollipops at all.  More like very unstable hard-ish candy.  If I could give these a zero, that would be more accurate.</li>
            <li> Disgusting&lt;br /&gt;They are NOT for diabetics&lt;br /&gt;Awful customer service&lt;br /&gt;Never&lt;br /&gt;Again&lt;br /&gt;Run! Do not buy!</li>
            <li> These melted and came off the stick just in the drawer I kept them in, in my climate controlled house.  So kids didnt even get to eat half of them.</li>
            <li> The lollipops were delicious.The only thing that seemed bothersome,is that they are sticky.Even before you open the individual pops they are sticky.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these Zollipops for my five year old son. They actually said that not only would these not contribute to tooth decay but they would actually help to prevent decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit on the expensive side. The good news is our son likes them.</li>
            <li> My grandson loves them. I am glad that they are healthy for him.</li>
            <li> My twins&#x27; dentist said to give them 5-6 servings of xylitol per day to prevent tooth decay and cavities.  I started slow with one of these lollipops daily (they&#x27;re expensive!!!) to see if they even liked them.  Well, they LOVED them.  But what I didn&#x27;t bargain for was the stomach cramps and diarrhea it gave them.  It took 2 weeks for me to figure out these lollipops were causing theirs issues.  We stopped using them and no stomach upset.  Be careful eating too much xylitol!</li>
            <li> My grandsons loved these pops! Bonus that they help protect their teeth instead of causing tooth decay!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed evidence of what was claimed in the advertisement.  But it is a lollipop.</li>
            <li> They came half ruin and melted! The ones that weren&#x27;t ruin before I opened my packages turned nasty and gooey in a very short time!</li>
            <li> Delicious! The kids love them! I can feel the difference in my mouth after having one! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Pretty sticky little suckers .... but at least I can give my son a treat without worrying about his teeth so much. I am a dental assistant and I specifically searched for the suckers with xylitol.</li>
            <li> They are delicious and well worth using after eating.</li>
            <li> Total ripoff! 15 lollipops for $6.00?  That is just highway robbery. We&#x27;ll just stick with regular  lollipops which also taste a lot better.</li>
            <li> I wish this young entrepreneur all the good fortune with a very good product</li>
            <li> slowly trying to get sugar out of our house.  my kids said it taste really good so it worked out!  I chose this candy because of the xylitol...good for teeth!  I wish I&#x27;d known about xylitol in the first place.  Too bad it&#x27;s so unheard of and hard to find.  Thanks Amazon for having these products!  We also tried Nature&#x27;s Plus sugar free Vitamin C that has xylitol .  Kids are loving that too.</li>
            <li> Grandchildren love these purchased them several times, parents were thrilled also</li>
            <li> My 1 year old loves them and keeps him from crying!</li>
            <li> They taste just like a lollipop  my kids love them</li>
            <li> My kids love these and I feel much better about giving them candy knowing that they&#x27;re sugar-free and good for their teeth! My only issue is that our bag did not have a good mix of flavors, we got mostly orange and raspberry for some reason.</li>
            <li> This is an Amazing Product. Bought them for my Grandchildren and will continue to!</li>
            <li> these are great for kids with tooth decay problems</li>
            <li> My son loves these...</li>
            <li> Luv!!!  Just what I needed and just what I saw on the Dr. Oz Show!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will continue ordering as long as possible!!!</li>
            <li> not bad seems to start getting sticky inside package tho</li>
            <li> I bought three bags and have opened two both have random loose sticks and one bag had five melted stuck together suckers and the other had three! On the bright side the suckers do not leave that sugary feeling on our teeth so they may work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recently diagnosed diabetic. So I am trying different low carb sweets.  These are pretty good. There was one flavor I don&#x27;t like. I think it&#x27;s the strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the story of the company that makes them and that they donate part of the proceeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also like the ingredients. Sweets that are actually good for you.</li>
            <li> These are great! They taste good and clean your teeth at the same time. I ordered 6 packages of these because I never want to run out!</li>
            <li> My grandsons liked them but the pops got sticky and gooey after a few weeks plus when you managed to unwrap them, the stick came out. I threw most of them away.  Too bad, they are a good idea.</li>
            <li> I​ like them they are just a little expansive</li>
            <li> They were awful tasting.</li>
            <li> These lollipops taste just as good if not better than those bought at the grocery store.  I do not ordinarily give candy to my grandchildren so they were surprised when I offered them these.</li>
            <li> My kids love these. They are the best tasting lollipops that are sweetened with xylitol.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of these pops, however only 4 stars because my daughter says they&#x27;re gross. She&#x27;s quite picky, though. If you want these for a lollipop that will actually help your teeth, I say purchase them. If you want to fool a picky child, think again.</li>
