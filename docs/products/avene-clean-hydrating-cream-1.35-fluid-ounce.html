            <li>Truly amazing service!</li>
            <li>Good product..</li>
            <li>Very glad i had found this.</li>
            <li>Awesome cream non greasy and very calming</li>
            <li>Advised by my own dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I now use it as hand cream, but, honestly, it&#x27;s just not that moisturizing</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great product, does exactly what it should.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this available online because I live a good distance from my dermatologist now.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light smell as well.</li>
            <li>Works Ok</li>
            <li>it has been like 3 years and this is still my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I regularly buy it from Amazon and very happy with it...</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>No irritation, no scent, just a nice cream that absorbs quickly and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I love Avene&#x27;s Clean Ac line and have used it for 2+ years.  </li>
            <li>It really moisturizers nicely without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>it is oily free.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Clean AC\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great value for your money, goes light on my skin, does not clog my pores, beats other pricey brands, recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: happy that I can get this delivered, NOT pleased with the shipping.</li>
            <li>Overall though, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer for temperamental skin that tends to flake or get dry easily.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very light, but not gel-like (something I often find, and dislike, in &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; related moisturizers).</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any cream from this line.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it adds just enough moisture without being too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got my first one by prescription in Dominican Republic</li>
            <li>My friend had one that looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I love it because my skin is so sensitive and acne prone and it works well with me - it is also wonderful to use after a peel without irritating my skin - only thing</li>
            <li>Amazon wants a longer description...</li>
            <li>Very soothing face cream.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and soothing when my skin is irritated from prescription creams.</li>
            <li>Though there are times when it leaves my face feeling really oily.</li>
            <li>This really is a moisturizer, don&#x27;t get fooled by the name</li>
            <li>So my dermatologist recommended this product as an intense moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is very light to the touch but extremely hydrating withou being oily.  </li>
            <li>Tried many other $$$ lotions, this was &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Secondly, with my skin already sensitive to begin with, then even more sensitive due to the Aczone treatment, this cream turned my face bright red and stung.  </li>
            <li>(think older woman, flowery perfume).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, I have very sensitive acne prone oily skin and since august 2013</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, it&#x27;s pretty heavily fragranced, so if you are sensitive to perfume additives, this might irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>A little bit seemed to last all day or most of the day.</li>
            <li>Too small package that easily can be lost.</li>
            <li>Small package and luckily they arrive as it scheduled.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Small package and luckily they arrive as it scheduled.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much if you aren&#x27;t using accutane, not sure why it works so well with.</li>
            <li> Cheap things end up expensive.</li>
            <li> Though I prefer the lighter lotion, now that the cold and dry weather is here, I really need this cream and have used it regularly for three weeks.</li>
            <li> I typically use the lotion</li>
            <li> The lotion is VERY sensitive to heat/cold, and when I received the bottles (I ordered 2), I found that both had been exposed to extreme heat or cold.</li>
            <li> have started using this a few years ago while I was using Accutane to get rid of my acne.</li>

            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> Not good for me.  </li>
            <li> The directions on the bottle specifically tell the user to keep it at a range of temperatures, so I&#x27;m very disappointed that I paid this much for the shippers to ignore the label and receive a less-than-perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could tell because the consistency was watery and thin, as opposed to the lotion that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find on-site/on-store/pharmacy and must order online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was unhappy with how the bottles shipped.</li>
            <li> You may know Accutane, it dries your skin so bad that your skin starts to peel and come off in pieces.</li>

            <li> I love Avene&#x27;s Clean Ac line and have used it for 2+ years.  I typically use the lotion but I think it&#x27;s out of production. This is my first time using any cream from this line.  Though I prefer the lighter lotion, now that the cold and dry weather is here, I really need this cream and have used it regularly for three weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this product,it was recommended by my dermatologist!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure what is in this cream but it is a miracle worker to heal damaged skin. No irritation, no scent, just a nice cream that absorbs quickly and is non-greasy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought 3, but I just received 2.</li>
            <li> Thus is the best cream ever. My dermatologist recommended it, and it is wonderful. Perfect for sensitive skin. It really moisturizers nicely without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it should.  No wonder my dermatologist recommended it.  Amazon wants a longer description... blah, blah.</li>

            <li> great when used with accutane. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much if you aren&#x27;t using accutane, not sure why it works so well with. not greasy at all. absorbs well. I used on the corners of my mouth area. A little bit seemed to last all day or most of the day. Very glad i had found this. Tried many other $$$ lotions, this was &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Awesome cream non greasy and very calming I got my first one by prescription in Dominican Republic and I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon, I have very sensitive acne prone oily skin and since august 2013 I&#x27;m using it without problems.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is very light to the touch but extremely hydrating withou being oily.  It has a nice light smell as well.</li>
            <li> Very soothing face cream.  My son uses it with acne medications which provide balance to the harshness of the meds used in acne treatment.</li>
            <li> Very good for people that are prone to acne.&lt;br /&gt;And it is oily free. Good product..&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> They charge me a big fee whe I went to pick it up. Cheap things end up expensive. Not good</li>
            <li> Truly amazing service! The best I&#x27;ve used in a long time. Top Marks!!</li>
            <li> Advised by my own dermatologist. Well absorb to the skin. Difficult to find on-site/on-store/pharmacy and must order online. Small package and luckily they arrive as it scheduled. Too small package that easily can be lost.</li>
            <li> I love it because my skin is so sensitive and acne prone and it works well with me - it is also wonderful to use after a peel without irritating my skin - only thing is it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I would like it to be so I have to put two applications sometimes. Definitely was cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and soothing when my skin is irritated from prescription creams. Though there are times when it leaves my face feeling really oily. Overall though, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer for temperamental skin that tends to flake or get dry easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Clean-AC cream to help combat the dryness I was experiencing while doing a short course of treatment for a rosacea flare up.  I like the texture of the cream, it&#x27;s very light, but not gel-like (something I often find, and dislike, in &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; related moisturizers). Right off the bat, it&#x27;s pretty heavily fragranced, so if you are sensitive to perfume additives, this might irritate your skin.  Secondly, with my skin already sensitive to begin with, then even more sensitive due to the Aczone treatment, this cream turned my face bright red and stung.  Not good for me.  I now use it as hand cream, but, honestly, it&#x27;s just not that moisturizing and I don&#x27;t like the fragrance (think older woman, flowery perfume).</li>
            <li> I thought this was a moisturizer from the picture. My friend had one that looked exactly like the picture. Turns out it is a face wash. Works Ok</li>
            <li> This really is a moisturizer, don&#x27;t get fooled by the name \\&quot;Clean AC\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I have started using this a few years ago while I was using Accutane to get rid of my acne. You may know Accutane, it dries your skin so bad that your skin starts to peel and come off in pieces. So my dermatologist recommended this product as an intense moisturizer. It worked out so well that I did not have any further dryness complaints throughout the 7 months acne treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Now it has been like 3 years and this is still my favorite moisturizer. I regularly buy it from Amazon and very happy with it...</li>
