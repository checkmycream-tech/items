            <li>love the product thx!</li>
            <li>These work better than the plastic ones for me!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The plastic ones work way better!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s glass and nice construction</li>
            <li>Perfect, no plastic, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Salty warm water every couple hours basically took care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice plastic eye cup.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who has a use for this kind of product.</li>
            <li>My daughter had something in her eye, so I put some warm water in the Eye Bath cup and had her put it up to her eye and look around in the water.  </li>
            <li>Great product for administering remedies or just to clean dust out of the eyes.</li>
            <li>This cup is perfect to let your eyes swim in, it&#x27;s very good since the curve is hold tight to your eye.  </li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t used this eye wash cup (fortunately), it appears to be a good quality</li>
            <li>At any rate, I need to go buy some more eye cups that will allow me to do an eye wash without spilling it all out.  </li>
            <li>I feel that these are better than plastic.</li>
            <li>But I feel the plastic eye cups can make better suction to hold in the eye wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>this is the one thing,that most people no nothing about.</li>
            <li>That is when having this handy eye cup available and</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchase this eye glass cup.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have this around.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about what&#x27;s in the plastic, I prefer glass :)</li>
            <li>The glass may be appealing, but even the plastic ones that come free with eye rinses are more comfortable and work more effectively.  </li>
            <li>So although the price and delivery was good, can&#x27;t give this a higher rating.</li>
            <li>good deal, not expensive, like the glass</li>
            <li>These are soo cute and comfortable to use for the eye wash.</li>
            <li>I am glad that a glass wash cup is available again.  </li>
            <li>More comfortable than plastic cup.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and keep clean...nice shape to the cup.  </li>
            <li>I guess it must fit some people, as many give it 5 stars, but without the curve that every plastic eye cup has, it&#x27;s got to fit fewer people.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick glass and fits perfect.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had to use it yet, but it seems as if it will work fine when I need it.</li>
            <li>The glass eye cup is a Close fit around the eyes which makes it easy to use my eyewash...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it appears to be fine.</li>
            <li>great glass eye cup, good quality, hard to find.</li>
            <li>Nothing like good old fashioned glass made eye wash cup.</li>
            <li>stays clean, easy to clean well because you want your eyewash to be pathogen free.  </li>
            <li>It could be a facial-fit issue, but I feel lucky the shape of the glass cup worked fine with mine.  </li>
            <li>A curved top would help create a better seal where as a flat top design creates waste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, sturdy and fits perfectly around my eye.  </li>
            <li>I purchased another eye wash cup several years ago from Amazon - it has a smaller opening, a perfect fit for my eyes, and sits on a pedestal, doesn&#x27;t leak when it&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li>I was alone, but lucky for me, I knew I had one of these in a medicine cabinet, and which shelf.</li>
            <li>Made of durable, strong, very clear glass.</li>
            <li>I prefer this easily to the old almond shape on a pedestal (like my dad used to have when I was a kid).</li>
            <li>The ones that look really old tend to also have rims that look perfect, at least in the photos.  </li>
            <li>The ones that look really old tend to also have rims that look perfect, at least in the photos.  </li>
            <li>I recently had an eye infection and wanted to be able to deal with it in a practical &amp;#34;on-contact&amp;#34; method vs. pills or anything that involved ingesting anything.  </li>
            <li>Surely this eye cup has been bought on a big note that it is glass and is easier to care for.  </li>
            <li>just what I wanted to add to my first aide kit</li>
            <li>(sterlization without steam requires higher temperatures).  </li>
            <li>(sterlization without steam requires higher temperatures).  </li>
            <li>Extra sturdy easy to wash worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>While I can not speak for everyone&#x27;s eye wash cup, the one I received is flat on top.</li>
            <li>Fits MY eye perfectly and leaks only a very small amount.</li>
            <li>Good quality but a bit small for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe large men could use it?  </li>
            <li>this one is great - thick and durable quality!</li>
            <li>It works, but it would be great if it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li>So far so good, but it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>LIke that it isn&#x27;t plastic, but it is too straight.  </li>
            <li>This cup is made of real glass and very substantial.</li>
            <li>Thanks, John Bassett</li>
            <li>I am very satified</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing even the $5 sloppily-made eye cups (the ones that don&#x27;t seem to stand completely straight) with a stem and curved edge would work almost as well.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Good thick glass.  </li>
            <li>It has facets on the cup like a lot of older eye cups do and a nice looking edge but still has some waviness to the edge that doesn&#x27;t seem to mess up the seal.  </li>

            <li>Of course, I may forgive this flaw because even most &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; eye cups on ebay have similar flaws, though I&#x27;m not sure how many are truly vintage.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, an old school glass eye cup for rinsing out your eyes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very difficult to get perfect.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very difficult to get perfect.  </li>
            <li>Using an older plastic one I had on hand and had no problems.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this glass eye wash cup to any who&#x27;s in need of one.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High Quality;</li>
            <li>My face is not thin, not heavy, so I don&#x27;t consider the shape of my face a factor.</li>
            <li>although I don&#x27;t know how the water stays on anyone&#x27;s eye long enough to be able to accomplish anything.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely more interested in one and two star reviews on future products because I have wasted too much money buying things based on the five stars reviews (which about everything seems to be these days).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t return these because I threw away the packaging which normally I don&#x27;t do</li>
            <li>It also had at least one bump of glass rising up 3mm higher than the glass around it, which makes for even more opportunity to leak on either side of the bump.  </li>
            <li>It gets one star because it is nice thick substantial glass.  </li>
            <li>An advantage to the Pro-Optic eye wash cup is that the shape is different from the eye wash cup I already had, so easy to remember which cup was used for which eye, avoiding any cross contamination.  </li>
            <li>not the manufacturer&#x27;s box like my other one, and the cost was trebled which I figured was inflation or to recoup the free shipping.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find one like this where I live, all were plastic.</li>
            <li>Nothing like distilled salted water to get rid of infections and clear the eyes!</li>
            <li>As the other more critical reviewers mentioned, the edge is a flat cup and too large around the eye</li>
            <li>Once I had filled the little cup I leaned over and sealed it against my eye and then stood up.</li>
            <li>My pap had a old fashion one tho</li>
            <li>I am 83 years old and have had need for my eye cup on many&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this up.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s as far as it goes.  </li>
            <li>But as far as eye rinses, they spill liquid and do not work well at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used eyecups for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li>had done nothing to help, so at least I know eye cups are worthwhile and I can go find</li>
            <li>that makes a soft pop when pulled off.  </li>

            <li>that makes a soft pop when pulled off.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;ve seen, most eye cups produced through the years have had the curved rim, so the fact this is missing it is a major negative even if it might still fit a minority of people without leaking.  </li>
            <li>eye cups on ebay have similar flaws, though I&#x27;m not sure how many are truly vintage.  </li>
            <li>The eye glass does not fit And leaks fluid out so easily.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t get that dipping your head in a sink, or splashing it in, squirting yourself with a hose, or most other typical responses.</li>
            <li>Getting the style with the stem (like a tiny glass) would also give you something much easier to grip while cleaning, so actually I will dock it a star for this stemless design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well on my dry eyes -- no dripping, either!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really docking it stars for being breakable because I really wanted a glass one that was easy to sterilize, but the difficulty of cleaning something tiny and slippery is something to consider even if you don&#x27;t usually break things.  </li>
            <li>the solution keeps running down my face on the left side for some reason and sometimes on the right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually clumsy and rarely break things, but I was washing this with soap and water as suggested in the 3-line &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; and somehow I pushed my finger too hard against it while scrubbing and since it was slick with soap, it popped out of my grasp and went flying to hit the toilet and shatter into dozens of pieces that required vacuuming every nook to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I returned this and found a more traditional decorative glass model (the kind that looks a little like a trophy, with a base).</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use this when my eyes feel dry too, since I am a med student and wear my (one) contact lens nearly all the time.</li>

            <li> Extra sturdy easy to wash worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> While I can not speak for everyone&#x27;s eye wash cup, the one I received is flat on top.</li>
            <li> Fits MY eye perfectly and leaks only a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Good quality but a bit small for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe large men could use it?  </li>
            <li> this one is great - thick and durable quality!</li>
            <li> It works, but it would be great if it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> So far so good, but it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> LIke that it isn&#x27;t plastic, but it is too straight.  </li>
            <li> This cup is made of real glass and very substantial.</li>
            <li> Thanks, John Bassett</li>
            <li> I am very satified</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing even the $5 sloppily-made eye cups (the ones that don&#x27;t seem to stand completely straight) with a stem and curved edge would work almost as well.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Good thick glass.  </li>
            <li> It has facets on the cup like a lot of older eye cups do and a nice looking edge but still has some waviness to the edge that doesn&#x27;t seem to mess up the seal.  </li>

            <li> Of course, I may forgive this flaw because even most &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; eye cups on ebay have similar flaws, though I&#x27;m not sure how many are truly vintage.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, an old school glass eye cup for rinsing out your eyes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very difficult to get perfect.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very difficult to get perfect.  </li>
            <li> Using an older plastic one I had on hand and had no problems.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this glass eye wash cup to any who&#x27;s in need of one.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High Quality;</li>
            <li> My face is not thin, not heavy, so I don&#x27;t consider the shape of my face a factor.</li>
            <li> although I don&#x27;t know how the water stays on anyone&#x27;s eye long enough to be able to accomplish anything.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely more interested in one and two star reviews on future products because I have wasted too much money buying things based on the five stars reviews (which about everything seems to be these days).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t return these because I threw away the packaging which normally I don&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> It also had at least one bump of glass rising up 3mm higher than the glass around it, which makes for even more opportunity to leak on either side of the bump.  </li>
            <li> It gets one star because it is nice thick substantial glass.  </li>
            <li> An advantage to the Pro-Optic eye wash cup is that the shape is different from the eye wash cup I already had, so easy to remember which cup was used for which eye, avoiding any cross contamination.  </li>
            <li> not the manufacturer&#x27;s box like my other one, and the cost was trebled which I figured was inflation or to recoup the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find one like this where I live, all were plastic.</li>
            <li> Nothing like distilled salted water to get rid of infections and clear the eyes!</li>
            <li> As the other more critical reviewers mentioned, the edge is a flat cup and too large around the eye</li>
            <li> Once I had filled the little cup I leaned over and sealed it against my eye and then stood up.</li>
            <li> My pap had a old fashion one tho</li>
            <li> I am 83 years old and have had need for my eye cup on many&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this up.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s as far as it goes.  </li>
            <li> But as far as eye rinses, they spill liquid and do not work well at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used eyecups for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li> had done nothing to help, so at least I know eye cups are worthwhile and I can go find</li>
            <li> that makes a soft pop when pulled off.  </li>
            <li> had done nothing to help, so at least I know eye cups are worthwhile and I can go find</li>
            <li> that makes a soft pop when pulled off.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;ve seen, most eye cups produced through the years have had the curved rim, so the fact this is missing it is a major negative even if it might still fit a minority of people without leaking.  </li>
            <li> eye cups on ebay have similar flaws, though I&#x27;m not sure how many are truly vintage.  </li>
            <li> The eye glass does not fit And leaks fluid out so easily.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t get that dipping your head in a sink, or splashing it in, squirting yourself with a hose, or most other typical responses.</li>
            <li> Getting the style with the stem (like a tiny glass) would also give you something much easier to grip while cleaning, so actually I will dock it a star for this stemless design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well on my dry eyes -- no dripping, either!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really docking it stars for being breakable because I really wanted a glass one that was easy to sterilize, but the difficulty of cleaning something tiny and slippery is something to consider even if you don&#x27;t usually break things.  </li>
            <li> the solution keeps running down my face on the left side for some reason and sometimes on the right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually clumsy and rarely break things, but I was washing this with soap and water as suggested in the 3-line &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; and somehow I pushed my finger too hard against it while scrubbing and since it was slick with soap, it popped out of my grasp and went flying to hit the toilet and shatter into dozens of pieces that required vacuuming every nook to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I returned this and found a more traditional decorative glass model (the kind that looks a little like a trophy, with a base).</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use this when my eyes feel dry too, since I am a med student and wear my (one) contact lens nearly all the time.</li>
            <li> It maybe be fine for you but a little small for me.</li>
            <li> It should be boiled regularly to sterilize, and ought to last a long time.</li>
            <li> This Eye wash cup will last me a long time (well made) since it was  made of glass</li>
            <li> Do you ever see swimming goggles with a flat edge?  </li>
            <li> Every face is different - I&#x27;m having trouble so far mastering the \\&quot;leakless\\</li>
            <li> Even dry it forms a vacuum seal with my eye</li>
            <li> Even dry it forms a vacuum seal with my eye</li>
            <li> gave it 2 stars due to the glass construction which helps with the maintenance such as boiling the cup before usage and preventing washing bacteria back into your eyes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not a perfect fit for my eyes</li>
            <li> They do not retain rinse well enough to do anything but wet your shirt.  </li>
            <li> If you check ebay you can still find glass eye cups with stems and a downward curve on the long edge of the rim for $5.  </li>
            <li> My girl suffers from &#x27;dry eye&#x27; and this glass eyewash vase is safe and easier to use than plastic, because of its weight and the wider lip surface.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a second cup for the home&#x27;s other medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product except that this is very thick glass that should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have solved my dry eye and irritated eye problem by using this product.</li>
            <li> Basic plastic cup, is heavy enough that I don&#x27;t feel like it will break.</li>
            <li> This issue on worsens if you have a smaller framed face; you get even less of a seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With water in it, it can leak a little, but only if you don&#x27;t keep even pressure on all edges.  </li>
            <li> With water in it, it can leak a little, but only if you don&#x27;t keep even pressure on all edges.  </li>
            <li> You can press harder to try to make a better seal, and it will rub the bone painfully (and when I did this it still leaked all over).  </li>
            <li> They came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> rim on mine actually did have a very slight curve to it.  </li>
            <li> No more than any other I&#x27;ve used in the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other customers reviews here; I dislike this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This eye wash cup is sturdy, but the opening is so wide that no matter how it&#x27;s positioned, the solution being used runs down my cheek, so I have to use it with something to catch the leakage.  </li>
            <li> is solid and &#x27;thick, not flimsy or fragile-feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate a 5, but the shape of it is just too elliptical and doesn&#x27;t seal as the one I had previously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was worried about the leakage from previous reviews, but I did not have an issue with it.  </li>
            <li> However, for me it&#x27;s hard to use without solution leaking, it may be configured too thick or contoured too flat in the center for the eye socket.</li>
            <li> poorly.&lt;br /&gt;The rim had a little hole caused by the glass blowing process.  </li>
            <li> heavy duty  </li>
            <li> This eye bup did not fit my eye -</li>
            <li> In my case the offender was a ridiculously small, but never the less debilitating indirect dose of capsaisin.  </li>
            <li> Works well for me since I can not fine glass eye cleaners any where.</li>
            <li> There will also be no easy chipping either.</li>
            <li> removed 3 stars due to the poor shape/design.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want plastic and glass eye wash cups are hard to find now days.  </li>
            <li> Notice how one side doesn&#x27;t touch your skin unless you press really hard?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can say the cup is thick and seems to be durable</li>
            <li> These cups are indeed thick glass.  </li>
            <li> The cup is well made of thick glass.</li>
            <li> This cup was not a good size for eye wash and my choice was to either let the water drip while washing the eye or to press it so hard that it hurt.</li>
            <li> This is just not a good design.  </li>
            <li> This cup seems very thick and should resist chipping.</li>
            <li> Try putting something flat and oval over your eye, like the base of a deodorant stick.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was doing it wrong because I remembered all these five star reviews (which once again, I was fooled by).  </li>
            <li> it is increasingly difficult to find glass eye cups!</li>
            <li> Eye wash cups are almost impossible to find and glass ones almost do not exist.</li>
            <li> the piece on the bottom brok and so stupid threw it alway!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nothing like distilled salted water to get rid of infections and clear the eyes!</li>
            <li> Great product for administering remedies or just to clean dust out of the eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time...</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used this eye wash cup (fortunately), it appears to be a good quality</li>
            <li> This is the best Glass, Eye Wash Cup I&#x27;ve come across, I don&#x27;t use plastic ones for fear of BPA&#x27;s in the plastic warnings about them containing  this.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s glass and nice construction although I don&#x27;t know how the water stays on anyone&#x27;s eye long enough to be able to accomplish anything.  I thought I was doing it wrong because I remembered all these five star reviews (which once again, I was fooled by).  I am definitely more interested in one and two star reviews on future products because I have wasted too much money buying things based on the five stars reviews (which about everything seems to be these days).  At any rate, I need to go buy some more eye cups that will allow me to do an eye wash without spilling it all out.  I can&#x27;t return these because I threw away the packaging which normally I don&#x27;t do but as luck would have it...  As the other more critical reviewers mentioned, the edge is a flat cup and too large around the eye and it makes no sense to me how it could work.  My only theory would be for taller, bigger, flatter faced individuals?  Or maybe large men could use it?  Not for me though.</li>
            <li> does the job.  stays clean, easy to clean well because you want your eyewash to be pathogen free.  will leak around the eye socket a lttle when in use but that&#x27;s going to happen.  works well.</li>
            <li> Basic plastic cup, is heavy enough that I don&#x27;t feel like it will break.</li>
            <li> heavy duty  This Eye wash cup will last me a long time (well made) since it was  made of glass</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and keep clean...nice shape to the cup.  I prefer this easily to the old almond shape on a pedestal (like my dad used to have when I was a kid).</li>
            <li> the glass is manufactured poorly.&lt;br /&gt;The rim had a little hole caused by the glass blowing process.  It made the edge that touches the skin around the eye to be scratchy.  I might contact Pro optics for a refund or an exchange,</li>
            <li> Perfect, no plastic, easy to clean.  Recommended</li>
            <li> Works good can also be substituted for a shot glass.</li>
            <li> Works well for me since I can not fine glass eye cleaners any where. My pap had a old fashion one tho the piece on the bottom brok and so stupid threw it alway! It look like a wine glass it was cool</li>
            <li> Nothing like good old fashioned glass made eye wash cup. I refused to use those plastic ones.</li>
            <li> Priced as low as I think possible. Made of durable, strong, very clear glass. Fits MY eye perfectly and leaks only a very small amount. No more than any other I&#x27;ve used in the last 20 years. It&#x27;s a good buy. It works I give it 5 starts for under $7.00!</li>
            <li> LIke that it isn&#x27;t plastic, but it is too straight.  Water doesn&#x27;t stay inside when pressed against my eyes.</li>
            <li> Extra sturdy easy to wash worth it for the price. I feel that these are better than plastic. But I feel the plastic eye cups can make better suction to hold in the eye wash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this glass eye wash cup to any who&#x27;s in need of one.  It&#x27;s thick, sturdy and fits perfectly around my eye.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.  This is the perfect tool.</li>
            <li> Sturdy glass cup and it was a good price. However, for me it&#x27;s hard to use without solution leaking, it may be configured too thick or contoured too flat in the center for the eye socket. Using an older plastic one I had on hand and had no problems. So although the price and delivery was good, can&#x27;t give this a higher rating.</li>
            <li> love the product thx!</li>
            <li> this is the one thing,that most people no nothing about. If you do any type of work you will be in contact with&lt;br /&gt;small type of debree that will possibly enter your eyes. That is when having this handy eye cup available and&lt;br /&gt;you will need this to eliminate the problem. I am 83 years old and have had need for my eye cup on many&lt;br /&gt;occasions. at the timeof need it is very necessary. At a minimum cost it is a bargain.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. Not a perfect fit for my eyes but it works well enough.</li>
            <li> This eye glass fits my eye perfectly.  Good thick glass.  Happy with it.</li>
            <li> The glass is just what I wanted and needed.  They came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had to use it yet, but it seems as if it will work fine when I need it.</li>
            <li> the solution keeps running down my face on the left side for some reason and sometimes on the right</li>
            <li> Works great! Am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> If you ever have something like even a whiff, a splash, etc. of something inappropriate for your eyes you need thorough rinsing and you can&#x27;t get that dipping your head in a sink, or splashing it in, squirting yourself with a hose, or most other typical responses. In my case the offender was a ridiculously small, but never the less debilitating indirect dose of capsaisin.  I was alone, but lucky for me, I knew I had one of these in a medicine cabinet, and which shelf. I fumbled for it and later for the milk in the refrigerator. Once I had filled the little cup I leaned over and sealed it against my eye and then stood up. You see, you need a submerged eye to get the benefit of any relief product. Your tendencies with a hose or slashing never achieve the coverage of one of these glasses, and besides the offender might (as capsaisin does) be moved about as opposed to washed off [it&#x27;s an oil]. This purchase was a second cup for the home&#x27;s other medicine cabinet. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this cup, this source, is it came in a plastic bag not the manufacturer&#x27;s box like my other one, and the cost was trebled which I figured was inflation or to recoup the free shipping. I sanitized the glass because of the way it was packaged is all I did about that.</li>
            <li> Nice thick glass and fits perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate a 5, but the shape of it is just too elliptical and doesn&#x27;t seal as the one I had previously.</li>
            <li> These work better than the plastic ones for me!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, an old school glass eye cup for rinsing out your eyes. Great to have around in case you get something inside your eye. Sometimes I use this when my eyes feel dry too, since I am a med student and wear my (one) contact lens nearly all the time.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. Every site I went to either had no picture or only came in plastic. Love it!</li>
            <li> works well with Eyebright formula wash</li>
            <li> These are soo cute and comfortable to use for the eye wash. I ordered two for my husband and two for myself. These are the best! Perfect for my Triphala eye wash!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Fits perfectly and I can use it easily!!</li>
            <li> Great glass eye wash cup!</li>
            <li> good deal, not expensive, like the glass</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I am treating allergic conjunctivitis and wanted a glass, not plastic, eye bath cup.  This way I can sterilize it and reuse it when ever.  I am always weary of plastic....couldn&#x27;t sterilize it so it has to be disposed of.</li>
            <li> I am glad that a glass wash cup is available again.  Some reviewer said it was discontinued.  More comfortable than plastic cup.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  Excellent product.  I would recommend this for anyone desiring an eye wash cup.  I hope it will be a helpful product to others.</li>
            <li> Eye wash cups are almost impossible to find and glass ones almost do not exist. This cup seems very thick and should resist chipping. It should be boiled regularly to sterilize, and ought to last a long time.</li>
            <li> So far so good, but it does take a little getting used to. Yes, I recommend this eye cup to anybody who&#x27;s looking for one.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other customers reviews here; I dislike this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can say the cup is thick and seems to be durable its the shape that is a deal breaker. While I can not speak for everyone&#x27;s eye wash cup, the one I received is flat on top. This creates a lot of leakage in the corners of your eyes, not to mention if you are using herbs or medications as an eye treatment you are wasting your product and money. This issue on worsens if you have a smaller framed face; you get even less of a seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars due to the glass construction which helps with the maintenance such as boiling the cup before usage and preventing washing bacteria back into your eyes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed 3 stars due to the poor shape/design. A curved top would help create a better seal where as a flat top design creates waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I have solved my dry eye and irritated eye problem by using this product. The glass eye cup ensures me that i can</li>
            <li> it is increasingly difficult to find glass eye cups! this one is great - thick and durable quality! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This eye bup did not fit my eye - the solution just poured out the sides.  Different shaped eyes may not have this problem.</li>
            <li> My girl suffers from &#x27;dry eye&#x27; and this glass eyewash vase is safe and easier to use than plastic, because of its weight and the wider lip surface. Ordering from Amazon is easier than trying to find one in pharmacy retail outlets, mostly because they don&#x27;t exist there anymore!!</li>
            <li> This cup is perfect to let your eyes swim in, it&#x27;s very good since the curve is hold tight to your eye.  I plan to buy another one for my Mom.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want plastic and glass eye wash cups are hard to find now days.  This fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This product arrived smashed</li>
            <li> This cup was not a good size for eye wash and my choice was to either let the water drip while washing the eye or to press it so hard that it hurt. I ended up tossing it out after two trials.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product except that this is very thick glass that should last a lifetime. There will also be no easy chipping either.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my dry eyes -- no dripping, either!</li>
            <li> Works great; perfect shape to fit around my eye.</li>
            <li> I recently had an eye infection and wanted to be able to deal with it in a practical &amp;#34;on-contact&amp;#34; method vs. pills or anything that involved ingesting anything.  This handy item did the trick beautifully.  Salty warm water every couple hours basically took care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about the leakage from previous reviews, but I did not have an issue with it.  It could be a facial-fit issue, but I feel lucky the shape of the glass cup worked fine with mine.  It&#x27;s inexpensive, solidly made, and has now earned a permanent spot in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This eye wash cup is sturdy, but the opening is so wide that no matter how it&#x27;s positioned, the solution being used runs down my cheek, so I have to use it with something to catch the leakage.  I purchased another eye wash cup several years ago from Amazon - it has a smaller opening, a perfect fit for my eyes, and sits on a pedestal, doesn&#x27;t leak when it&#x27;s used.  An advantage to the Pro-Optic eye wash cup is that the shape is different from the eye wash cup I already had, so easy to remember which cup was used for which eye, avoiding any cross contamination.  My face is not thin, not heavy, so I don&#x27;t consider the shape of my face a factor.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this up. This cup is made of real glass and very substantial. They suggest boiling it after  use.</li>
            <li> Looks great! Arrived timely...</li>
            <li> great glass eye cup, good quality, hard to find.</li>
            <li> The glass eye cup is a Close fit around the eyes which makes it easy to use my eyewash... I was very happy to find a glass cup instead of  plastic</li>
            <li> although they leak for me...too big for my eye sockets I guess</li>
            <li> These cups are indeed thick glass.  But that&#x27;s as far as it goes.  If you want to use these for tiny tea cups for your doll&#x27;s parties, they&#x27;ll work well.  But as far as eye rinses, they spill liquid and do not work well at all.  My three sons (ages 18-14) and I cannot use them no matter how we turn our heads or the cups.  They do not retain rinse well enough to do anything but wet your shirt.  The plastic ones work way better!</li>
            <li> It works, but it would be great if it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> High Quality; Inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Works great... You just have to keep the pressure on to avoid leaking... Glad they make cups in glass!!</li>
            <li> It gets one star because it is nice thick substantial glass.  When I was shopping I disregarded Mr. Gupta&#x27;s review, thinking he was just being picky, but I should not have been so dismissive.  This is basically a tiny oval glass.  The edges are level.  Without a raised edge at the corners of the eye, your fluid will just leak out and you&#x27;ll end up getting it in your ear.  You can press harder to try to make a better seal, and it will rub the bone painfully (and when I did this it still leaked all over).  This is just not a good design.  Pass on this one.  The glass may be appealing, but even the plastic ones that come free with eye rinses are more comfortable and work more effectively.  I returned this and found a more traditional decorative glass model (the kind that looks a little like a trophy, with a base).</li>
            <li> This is a nice plastic eye cup.  I wanted a plastic one to take with me when I travel.  It fits well and does the job!</li>
            <li> Surely this eye cup has been bought on a big note that it is glass and is easier to care for.  It is sturdy and will not break.  Good quality glass.  A big flaw is that our eye socket shape is not level.  The eye glass does not fit And leaks fluid out so easily.  Avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My Eye Bath is just what I wanted.  Thanks, John Bassett</li>
            <li> Looks great.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it appears to be fine.</li>
            <li> conforms to the eye...love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used eyecups for nearly 30 years. This is the best I&#x27;ve found! I recommend it to anyone who has a use for this kind of product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchase this eye glass cup.  My daughter had something in her eye, so I put some warm water in the Eye Bath cup and had her put it up to her eye and look around in the water.  Well what ever was in her eye came out.  Her eye pain went away in the discarded water.  So glad to have this around.  If I need another one this is where I will be getting it.  I am very satified</li>
            <li> The cup is well made of thick glass. Couldn&#x27;t find one like this where I live, all were plastic. This is just like my mom used to have. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about what&#x27;s in the plastic, I prefer glass :)</li>
            <li> just what I wanted to add to my first aide kit</li>
            <li> Good quality but a bit small for my eyes.  It maybe be fine for you but a little small for me.</li>
            <li> Every face is different - I&#x27;m having trouble so far mastering the \\&quot;leakless\\&quot; positioning I&#x27;d prefer.&lt;br /&gt;Item is solid and &#x27;thick, not flimsy or fragile-feeling.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Arrived undamaged ( a concern for a small glass item) and husband said it was exactly what he needed and wanted.</li>
            <li> Use it regularly. Great better than plastic cup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually clumsy and rarely break things, but I was washing this with soap and water as suggested in the 3-line &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; and somehow I pushed my finger too hard against it while scrubbing and since it was slick with soap, it popped out of my grasp and went flying to hit the toilet and shatter into dozens of pieces that required vacuuming every nook to clean up.  I&#x27;m not really docking it stars for being breakable because I really wanted a glass one that was easy to sterilize, but the difficulty of cleaning something tiny and slippery is something to consider even if you don&#x27;t usually break things.  Boiling it and skipping the soap might be safer.  Getting the style with the stem (like a tiny glass) would also give you something much easier to grip while cleaning, so actually I will dock it a star for this stemless design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly I dock it for not having a lip that fits your eye.  I guess it must fit some people, as many give it 5 stars, but without the curve that every plastic eye cup has, it&#x27;s got to fit fewer people.  If you check ebay you can still find glass eye cups with stems and a downward curve on the long edge of the rim for $5.  As far as I&#x27;ve seen, most eye cups produced through the years have had the curved rim, so the fact this is missing it is a major negative even if it might still fit a minority of people without leaking.  Don&#x27;t think this applies to you?  Try putting something flat and oval over your eye, like the base of a deodorant stick.  Notice how one side doesn&#x27;t touch your skin unless you press really hard?  Well, that&#x27;s why flat-edged eye cups leak.  Do you ever see swimming goggles with a flat edge?  There&#x27;s a reason for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rim on mine actually did have a very slight curve to it.  It also had at least one bump of glass rising up 3mm higher than the glass around it, which makes for even more opportunity to leak on either side of the bump.  Of course, I may forgive this flaw because even most &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; eye cups on ebay have similar flaws, though I&#x27;m not sure how many are truly vintage.  The ones that look really old tend to also have rims that look perfect, at least in the photos.  I&#x27;m guessing they heat the rims till they melt and manually shape them and it&#x27;s very difficult to get perfect.  So if this eye cup also has a melted rim, why couldn&#x27;t they have melted a curve into it?  Trying to save a bit of time in manufacturing I imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I did get to use this eye cup once before I broke it, and even though all the fluid leaked out immediately, it actually got my eye to stop hurting when dribbling lots of contact cleaner over my eye without the cup had done nothing to help, so at least I know eye cups are worthwhile and I can go find a curved one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I bought a &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; glass eye cup with stem and curved edge for $11 shipped.  Even dry it forms a vacuum seal with my eye that makes a soft pop when pulled off.  With water in it, it can leak a little, but only if you don&#x27;t keep even pressure on all edges.  It has facets on the cup like a lot of older eye cups do and a nice looking edge but still has some waviness to the edge that doesn&#x27;t seem to mess up the seal.  I&#x27;m guessing even the $5 sloppily-made eye cups (the ones that don&#x27;t seem to stand completely straight) with a stem and curved edge would work almost as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that autoclave sterilization is done with steam at 120C (212F) for 15-20 minutes (sterlization without steam requires higher temperatures).  Various site say you can sterilize jars for canning food by filling them halfway with water and microwaving till the water boils up the sides of the jar.  I did something similar with the eye cup sitting in water in a larger glass.  Note that I don&#x27;t think you want to pour pre-boiled water over glass as the rapid temperature change may cause it to crack.ntage&amp;#34; eye cups on ebay have similar flaws, though I&#x27;m not sure how many are truly vintage.
