            <li>Nice smelling too.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner I have used for my curly hair so far.</li>
            <li>It must be pure alcohol or something because while using this product I experienced mid-shaft breakage and loss of hair thickness.</li>

            <li>Used this all the time when my hair was permed, love it.</li>

            <li>I love this .</li>
            <li>It made my hair silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;ve ever used shea moistures conditioner for curly girls</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need more volume in my hair.</li>
            <li>Static cling, more frizzy than normal at the ends, we both absolutely loved  this.</li>
            <li>good smell and ship fast.  </li>
            <li>I have strong, kinky hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner smooth my hair without removing my coils, waves and curls.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped in a timely manner and was securely packaged.....</li>
            <li>Need something that is alcohol free</li>
            <li>However I ordered: &amp;#34;Giovanni Conditioner, Smooth as Silk for Damaged Hair, 8.5 fl oz Bottle&amp;#34; and I received &amp;#34;Giovanni Conditioner, Root 66Max Volume, 8.5 fl oz Bottle.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Does leave my hair silky and smooth-</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the products and they leave my hair smelling so clean and fresh that I&#x27;ve received compliments.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so maybe I didn&#x27;t give this product justice in my first review.</li>
            <li>I googled the best hair conditioners for dry hair and this was in the top ten!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product, makes my hair really moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am now a convert and am glad someone got it right after many years of searching for curly hair Holy Grail products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bouncy naturally soft 3B curls with no crunch or frizz for the first time in 30 years.</li>
            <li>Great i have think 3c/4b african american hair its light but</li>
            <li>I mostly use this as a co-wash on my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li>Worth the Hype!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very silky and ready for the amazing giovanni direct leave-in.</li>
            <li>I still use it because I really like it!</li>
            <li>it really does the things it says it does !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I finally tried it.....</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>my favorite conditioner out of the 6 different brands of affordable conditioners,</li>
            <li>I LOVE Giovanni conditioner and use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Alright first of all the name speak for itself.</li>
            <li>Made my hair really soft and gave me great curl definition and less frizz.</li>
            <li>I have very porous, prone to breakage curls and this conditioner is a joke.</li>
            <li>need to use longer to see if it&#x27;s really organic</li>
            <li>too much product use</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair seemed much drier and frizzier.  </li>
            <li>There are new alcohols listed in the ingredients, and they are the first ingredients listed.  </li>
            <li>but a little better, has a little more slip, and it&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
            <li>My first choice for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It has greaaaaat slip and a little goes a long way which for curly hair is a must and good find for conditioner.</li>
            <li>Oh, a not much fragrance, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased a new bottle in Dec. 2014.  </li>
            <li>Here are the new ingredients</li>
            <li>thing I noticed instantly was that my hair felt softer as soon as I applied it to my wet hair; it went through my hair so easily, and immediately untangled it.</li>
            <li>for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients help a lot to not aggravate my asthma.  </li>
            <li>(water), cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, butylene glycol, cetrimonium bromide, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural fragrance, hydrolyzed soy protein,</li>
            <li>I am a completely natural, African-American, with a mixture of 3 &amp; 4 kinky/curly texture.  </li>
            <li>Bye bye mixed chicks leave in and hello Giovanni Direct leave in!</li>
            <li>I mix it with my oils for a deep conditioning and it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It smooths color treated, mature hair and makes it feel like it did when I was 20 years younger!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for about 4 years and remember using this and deep conditioning with it over night.</li>
            <li>I compared a bit of the old on one side and new on the other.  </li>
            <li>Seriously this product made my hair fall off, my ponytail and braids are significantly thinner; it will take me months if not years to recover from using this product.</li>

            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be disappointed by this conditioner because of all the hype, but I was pleasantly surprised once I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I have  used this shampoo and conditioner for quite a long time</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have very long hair that always seems to take a beating in winter.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected - leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> heavy enough for me!</li>
            <li> Also, when I straighten my hair after using this conditioner there is no residue and my hair is still extremely moisturized.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> JUST like any other conditioner out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that they would change a formulation of such a popular</li>
            <li> Once my hair dried it was easier to brush through and shinier.</li>
            <li> After a few uses</li>
            <li> So frustrating that this company would mail me a completely different conditioner than is stated on the description.</li>
            <li> it has alcohol in it -- which is Not good for very very dry hair.</li>
            <li> and it has made a dramatic difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance and feel.</li>
            <li> The price is on the expensive side for this bottle</li>

            <li> One of the best conditioners for curly hair. Bought it on trip when I forgot my regular conditioner; I prefer this and now use it exclusively</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Made my hair really soft and gave me great curl definition and less frizz. Also made detangling a breeze</li>
            <li> I am in love with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a year to go along with my wash and go hair style.</li>
            <li> Used this all the time when my hair was permed, love it. I still use it because I really like it!</li>
            <li> I like it but when i was ordering it i thought it was leave in conditiner but its not it felt good in my hair</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner , I have been using it for months now . it has transformed my hair ! it really does the things it says it does !</li>
            <li> This conditioner smooth my hair without removing my coils, waves and curls.  Keeps my hair bouncy.  I mostly use this as a co-wash on my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li> I have  used this shampoo and conditioner for quite a long time and I like a lot.  It is great for my fine hair.  I was happy to find it on Amazon be ause they no longer sell it in any stores by me.</li>
            <li> Giovanni&#x27;s Smooth as Silk conditioner is easily the best conditioner I have ever used - and I&#x27;ve used many! - for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend this product for curly hair. I have very porous, prone to breakage curls and this conditioner is a joke. It must be pure alcohol or something because while using this product I experienced mid-shaft breakage and loss of hair thickness. Seriously this product made my hair fall off, my ponytail and braids are significantly thinner; it will take me months if not years to recover from using this product. DO NOT USE</li>
            <li> Worth the Hype!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be disappointed by this conditioner because of all the hype, but I was pleasantly surprised once I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed instantly was that my hair felt softer as soon as I applied it to my wet hair; it went through my hair so easily, and immediately untangled it. Normally I don&#x27;t notice the effects until after my hair has dried. Once my hair dried it was easier to brush through and shinier. I also liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely suggest giving it a try.</li>
            <li> This is some awesome stuff people!  I recently bought this, the conditioner and leave-in and it has made a dramatic difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance and feel. I have strong, kinky hair but these products give me spiral curlsI I kid you not!!  I love the texture of the products and they leave my hair smelling so clean and fresh that I&#x27;ve received compliments.  I wish the company who makes this adds oils to their line. Give these products a try, you&#x27;ll love what they do for your hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s freaking awesome.  It has greaaaaat slip and a little goes a long way which for curly hair is a must and good find for conditioner.</li>
            <li> good smell and ship fast.  need to use longer to see if it&#x27;s really organic</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product!..... I&#x27;m glad that I finally tried it..... It was shipped in a timely manner and was securely packaged..... Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. My first choice for my natural hair. I mix it with my oils for a deep conditioning and it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, makes my hair really moisturized. I have no complaints. Best conditioner I have used for my curly hair so far. Also, when I straighten my hair after using this conditioner there is no residue and my hair is still extremely moisturized.</li>
            <li> Okay, so maybe I didn&#x27;t give this product justice in my first review. I tried to use it as a deep conditioner after coloring my hair and it just didn&#x27;t work for me. My hair was going through some changes and too much product use I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it does work as a co-wash. It leaves my hair very silky and ready for the amazing giovanni direct leave-in. I am now a convert and am glad someone got it right after many years of searching for curly hair Holy Grail products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bouncy naturally soft 3B curls with no crunch or frizz for the first time in 30 years. Bye bye mixed chicks leave in and hello Giovanni Direct leave in!</li>
            <li> This product contains a toxic chemical</li>
            <li> This is a very nice conditioner without a lot of &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; ingredients. It smooths color treated, mature hair and makes it feel like it did when I was 20 years younger! Oh, a not much fragrance, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> my favorite conditioner out of the 6 different brands of affordable conditioners,</li>
            <li> it has alcohol in it -- which is Not good for very very dry hair. Need something that is alcohol free</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite conditioners!!! I&#x27;ve been natural for about 4 years and remember using this and deep conditioning with it over night. loveee it! I literally can see parts of my heat damaged ends repairing back. This is definitely one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. all natural ingredients. No sulfates &amp; No silicones or mineral oil! This is amazing (:</li>
            <li> This conditioner just did not agree with my hair at all. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s de tangling enough.</li>
            <li> I love this . Feels like silk going on your hair. My daughter and I both have very long hair that always seems to take a beating in winter. Static cling, more frizzy than normal at the ends, we both absolutely loved  this. Nice smelling too. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved this conditioner. It made my hair silky and healthy. The natural ingredients help a lot to not aggravate my asthma.  However, I purchased a new bottle in Dec. 2014.  The ingredients seem to have changed.  There are new alcohols listed in the ingredients, and they are the first ingredients listed.  After a few uses I noticed my hair seemed much drier and frizzier.  I compared a bit of the old on one side and new on the other.  There was a definite difference.  I&#x27;m very disappointed that they would change a formulation of such a popular product.&lt;br /&gt;I found this on another website. It seems to match what each of my bottles have listed:&lt;br /&gt; Here are the new ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (water), cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, butylene glycol, cetrimonium bromide, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural fragrance, hydrolyzed soy protein, *chamomilla recutita (matricaria) leaf extract, *citrus aurantium dulcis (valencia orange) extract, *citrus grandis (grapefruit) fruit extract, *cymbopogon schoenanthus (lemongrass) extract, *echinacea purpurea extract, *ginkgo biloba extract, *glycine soja (soybean) seed extract, *lavandula angustifolia (lavender) extract, *rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, *macrocystis pyrifera (sea kelp) extract, *mangifera indica (mango) extract, *salix alba (willow bark) extract.</li>
            <li> I googled the best hair conditioners for dry hair and this was in the top ten! The others were beyond pricy so I picked this one. Haven&#x27;t regretted this decision!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great for the hair.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Great i have think 3c/4b african american hair its light but heavy enough for me!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected - leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful!  I am a completely natural, African-American, with a mixture of 3 &amp; 4 kinky/curly texture.  I actually use this as a leave-in conditioner...a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;ve ever used shea moistures conditioner for curly girls it&#x27;s almost like that but a little better, has a little more slip, and it&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Giovanni conditioner and use it regularly. However I ordered: &amp;#34;Giovanni Conditioner, Smooth as Silk for Damaged Hair, 8.5 fl oz Bottle&amp;#34; and I received &amp;#34;Giovanni Conditioner, Root 66Max Volume, 8.5 fl oz Bottle.&amp;#34; So frustrating that this company would mail me a completely different conditioner than is stated on the description. I don&#x27;t need more volume in my hair.</li>
            <li> Alright first of all the name speak for itself. Does leave my hair silky and smooth- JUST like any other conditioner out there. The price is on the expensive side for this bottle</li>
