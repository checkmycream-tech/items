            <li>All in all, this wig is amazing</li>
            <li>It was a good quality wig, sure.</li>
            <li>It came packaged nicely, with cardboard around the bag to keep the curls, well, curly.</li>
            <li>i bought this wig for roxy lalonde and when i got it i was THRILLED.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wigs really well made and perfect for your Roxy Lalonde cosplay!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Material is nice</li>
            <li>Nice wig.</li>
            <li>i ordered this wig 15 days before i got it!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>You could probably even straighten it to use for Rose Lalonde, too.</li>
            <li>If there was twice the amount of hair, this would be a really nice wig.</li>
            <li>used this for my roxy and rose cosplay</li>
            <li>First time wig, the cap was ok, but the wig was awesome.</li>
            <li>My friend loved it too and it fit both of us fine, plus it looked great, too.</li>
            <li>its the right color and the fibers are great</li>
            <li>so shipping is pretty great for coming from China.</li>
            <li>It comes with a wig cap, which is great, because I lose so many of them it isn&#x27;t even funny.</li>
            <li>Easy to style and the layers are amazing.</li>
            <li>but all in all it&#x27;s my favorite wig.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig</li>
            <li>and i love how it spikes upwards at the end</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>for).&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a bobby pin to keep the bangs up, but I don&#x27;t mind :)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t require too much styling out of the bag and looked great for my daughter&#x27;s Roxy LaLonde cosplay.</li>
            <li>i love the ends that flip up a bit too...</li>
            <li>thank you :)</li>
            <li>for quallty I love it.</li>
            <li>i love the feel of this wig</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy this wig!</li>
            <li>Love this wig.  </li>
            <li>but I am used to that :)</li>
            <li>Just one side needs to be more curled.</li>
            <li>I really Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute with and without hats.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>I bought this product for Homestuck Roxy cosplay and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>Like most people, I got it for a Roxy Lalonde cosplay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love this wig and everything about it</li>
            <li>The wig its self shows up early witch is great and</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and great quality.</li>
            <li>Anyways daughter loved the wig sooooo much that she wore it to school without my knowledge</li>
            <li>It was just an overall good product!</li>
            <li>the fidder is silk and it easy for me to style</li>
            <li>It styles really easily to make her hair curl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, bouncy, and all-around good looking.</li>
            <li>Over all this is a great wig, for a great price at only $10.99, and I am so glad I found it because it takes my cosplay to the next level.</li>
            <li>that is how much she liked it.</li>
            <li>I loved it,  soft and affordable.</li>
            <li>great price, perfect length, color and texture... sheds a little bit but not much at all.</li>
            <li>It styles easily and sheds rarely.</li>
            <li>good quality, fit well, has low heat resistance, styled well, and came with a wig cap</li>
            <li>sometimes it can be easy to see the hair underneath if you dont style it right</li>
            <li>So yeah, overall pretty great, but if you can&#x27;t style a wig at all I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>The curls were nice and the hair was soft.</li>
            <li>Pleased so much that we ordered another one.</li>
            <li>I love this wig so much.</li>
            <li>The color is like a platinum blonde (which I loved), but the wig style looks NOTHING like the picture.</li>
            <li>I got this wig for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay and I was really nervous because I hadn&#x27;t bought wigs from this supplier before but not only did it come in great shape</li>
            <li>Super layered.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>Its great for roxy, and its actually a very light blonde instead of yellow.</li>
            <li>soft, clean, bouncy, realistic, and just amazing.</li>
            <li>Essentially, it was amazing</li>
            <li>such a good wig, really.</li>
            <li>but then again its fresh out of the package.</li>
            <li>Had so much fun with it.</li>
            <li>but the overall texture is nice.</li>
            <li>The only thing that wasn&#x27;t great about it was the way the sides flip up and they end, but that could easily be fixed with styling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>It flips out just right for the cannon Roxy hairstyle.</li>
            <li>The seller was wigle, and It came right on time.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using it for my Roxy Lalonde Cosplay for Homestuck.</li>
            <li>I have trouble finding wigs that fit me because I have so much hair, but this one is surprisingly roomy.</li>
            <li>One minor problem was the flips were not as flippy was the ones on the other side so with some styling and clips, it should come out perfect!</li>
            <li>I would sincerely suggest saving your money and buying a different wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more white in person, and sheds a bit.</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft and full.</li>
            <li>I think it would be fair enough to say this wig could also work for a female version of America from Hetalia.</li>
            <li>Though it was soft and did not tangle easily, it wasnt as full as the picture had shown and definitely was not as curly.</li>
            <li>It is however a little shorter than I thought, but it is amazing regardless.</li>
            <li>I am a little upset about that, but honestly i&#x27;d still buy it again.</li>
            <li>Very easy to style, mess it up and flip it in the back for Roxy and Mama Lalonde, and smooth it down for Rose.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t complain too much because it looks like it was meant to fit a smaller head.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly, recommend this wig!  </li>
            <li>My daughter thought it was real hair</li>
            <li>, very thin&lt;br /&gt;Far</li>
            <li>Pretty great wig, not to small for someone with a bigger head</li>
            <li>but it was very then the the point where I had to style the wig in order to keep the wig cap from showing</li>
            <li>I got this wig for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay and it is absolutely perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig is VERY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and soft and very realistic.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this wig to anyone who wants to do a decent roxy lalonde cosplay.</li>
            <li>The fibers stay in really well and are pretty soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty thick, especially the front, which you can easily pin out of your face to look really cute.</li>
            <li>The only thing that is different is the flippies on the side are a bit more curled then in the picture</li>
            <li>For all you future RoLa cosplayers, I SUPER suggest this wig.</li>
            <li>cute and cheap, just what you need for making a Roxy cosplay on a budget, very little styling needed, and wowie, it makes you an instant cutie!</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all of you sitting at home reading reviews debating whether to get it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>(My friend wore it and it did look a little better on her)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really soft and a sweet platinum blonde</li>
            <li>I have a normal sized head</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bangs are nice and thick and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and has nice body and layers.</li>
            <li>easy to manage and styled very well, i recieved quite a few compliments on it</li>
            <li>The colour didn&#x27;t exactly match the picture, as you can see in the picture, it is a little more yellow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light blonde color (not as light as the picture though), it&#x27;s not white, but it&#x27;s not yellow like a lot of blonde wigs, either</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really sad because the hair itself is attractive and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I can see the tracks, but they dont really seem very apparent when Im</li>
            <li>its a very soft wig!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Very soft...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
            <li>almost makes me want to go blonde for real!</li>
            <li>but it got here early too!</li>
            <li>(judging by other reviews not all the wigs are the same, some are better than others i guess?)</li>
            <li>omg really it a like light blonde not a yellow blonde and</li>
            <li>I wore it without any changes and it was fine, just a little droopy in my face.</li>
            <li>The wig is super soft, not very flippy</li>
            <li>Shipped and arrived SUPER fast and got here a few days before it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Like pretty much every other person, I bought this for a Roxy Lalonde cosplay.</li>
            <li>When putting it on, I accidentally straightened one of the curls, but it was easily fixed with my hands.</li>
            <li>sooo soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll take a bit of styling to get it to match the picture, the flips were completely inverted all the way around, and the bangs are going to need some work</li>
            <li>It was super long (like, slightly below my shoulders) and it was totally straight!</li>
            <li>and i would seriously recommend this wig, its nice and soft plus at a con a couple people thought it was my actual hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few wigs on amazon before and they were good but fairly small.</li>
            <li>The hair is full and fluffy, but the ends need quite a bit of styling to look like the picture.</li>
            <li>Huge complaint about the colour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, supple and fairly simple to style.</li>
            <li>I just received my wig yesterday (it came almost a week earlier than the first expected arrival date).</li>
            <li>Shorter than it looks in the photo, and not very styled, but besides that it is really soft and thick so if you can style I would recommend :)</li>
            <li>It is a bit thin up top and does shed</li>
            <li>Thin on top</li>
            <li>It could have had the potential in order to be a good wig, but it was very, very thin in the back</li>
            <li>really good roxy lalonde wig, maybe a little thin where the weft shows through the hair, but</li>
            <li>It is super thick, soft, and the same colour as in the picture.</li>
            <li>I got this for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay, thanks to the other reviews getting this wig for the same reason.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great, very thick and soft, though be wary of the short back (it ends more or less with the netting).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super soft and thick!</li>
            <li>little styling required if you plan on using this specifically for Roxy (just a little trim on the bangs and a little more curl to the ends, nothing major)&lt;br /&gt;Really soft!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> All in all, this wig is amazing</li>
            <li> It was a good quality wig, sure.</li>
            <li> It came packaged nicely, with cardboard around the bag to keep the curls, well, curly.</li>
            <li> i bought this wig for roxy lalonde and when i got it i was THRILLED.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wigs really well made and perfect for your Roxy Lalonde cosplay!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Material is nice</li>
            <li> Nice wig.</li>
            <li> i ordered this wig 15 days before i got it!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> You could probably even straighten it to use for Rose Lalonde, too.</li>
            <li> If there was twice the amount of hair, this would be a really nice wig.</li>
            <li> used this for my roxy and rose cosplay</li>
            <li> First time wig, the cap was ok, but the wig was awesome.</li>
            <li> My friend loved it too and it fit both of us fine, plus it looked great, too.</li>
            <li> its the right color and the fibers are great</li>
            <li> so shipping is pretty great for coming from China.</li>
            <li> It comes with a wig cap, which is great, because I lose so many of them it isn&#x27;t even funny.</li>
            <li> Easy to style and the layers are amazing.</li>
            <li> but all in all it&#x27;s my favorite wig.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig</li>
            <li> and i love how it spikes upwards at the end</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> for).&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a bobby pin to keep the bangs up, but I don&#x27;t mind :)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t require too much styling out of the bag and looked great for my daughter&#x27;s Roxy LaLonde cosplay.</li>
            <li> i love the ends that flip up a bit too...</li>
            <li> thank you :)</li>
            <li> for quallty I love it.</li>
            <li> i love the feel of this wig</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this wig!</li>
            <li> Love this wig.  </li>
            <li> but I am used to that :)</li>
            <li> Just one side needs to be more curled.</li>
            <li> I really Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute with and without hats.</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this product for Homestuck Roxy cosplay and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> Like most people, I got it for a Roxy Lalonde cosplay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love this wig and everything about it</li>
            <li> The wig its self shows up early witch is great and</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> Anyways daughter loved the wig sooooo much that she wore it to school without my knowledge</li>
            <li> It was just an overall good product!</li>
            <li> the fidder is silk and it easy for me to style</li>
            <li> It styles really easily to make her hair curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, bouncy, and all-around good looking.</li>
            <li> Over all this is a great wig, for a great price at only $10.99, and I am so glad I found it because it takes my cosplay to the next level.</li>
            <li> that is how much she liked it.</li>
            <li> I loved it,  soft and affordable.</li>
            <li> great price, perfect length, color and texture... sheds a little bit but not much at all.</li>
            <li> It styles easily and sheds rarely.</li>
            <li> good quality, fit well, has low heat resistance, styled well, and came with a wig cap</li>
            <li> sometimes it can be easy to see the hair underneath if you dont style it right</li>
            <li> So yeah, overall pretty great, but if you can&#x27;t style a wig at all I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The curls were nice and the hair was soft.</li>
            <li> Pleased so much that we ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I love this wig so much.</li>
            <li> The color is like a platinum blonde (which I loved), but the wig style looks NOTHING like the picture.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay and I was really nervous because I hadn&#x27;t bought wigs from this supplier before but not only did it come in great shape</li>
            <li> Super layered.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Its great for roxy, and its actually a very light blonde instead of yellow.</li>
            <li> soft, clean, bouncy, realistic, and just amazing.</li>
            <li> Essentially, it was amazing</li>
            <li> such a good wig, really.</li>
            <li> but then again its fresh out of the package.</li>
            <li> Had so much fun with it.</li>
            <li> but the overall texture is nice.</li>
            <li> The only thing that wasn&#x27;t great about it was the way the sides flip up and they end, but that could easily be fixed with styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> It flips out just right for the cannon Roxy hairstyle.</li>
            <li> The seller was wigle, and It came right on time.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using it for my Roxy Lalonde Cosplay for Homestuck.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding wigs that fit me because I have so much hair, but this one is surprisingly roomy.</li>
            <li> One minor problem was the flips were not as flippy was the ones on the other side so with some styling and clips, it should come out perfect!</li>
            <li> I would sincerely suggest saving your money and buying a different wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more white in person, and sheds a bit.</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and full.</li>
            <li> I think it would be fair enough to say this wig could also work for a female version of America from Hetalia.</li>
            <li> Though it was soft and did not tangle easily, it wasnt as full as the picture had shown and definitely was not as curly.</li>
            <li> It is however a little shorter than I thought, but it is amazing regardless.</li>
            <li> I am a little upset about that, but honestly i&#x27;d still buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to style, mess it up and flip it in the back for Roxy and Mama Lalonde, and smooth it down for Rose.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t complain too much because it looks like it was meant to fit a smaller head.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly, recommend this wig!  </li>
            <li> My daughter thought it was real hair</li>
            <li> , very thin&lt;br /&gt;Far</li>
            <li> Pretty great wig, not to small for someone with a bigger head</li>
            <li> but it was very then the the point where I had to style the wig in order to keep the wig cap from showing</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay and it is absolutely perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig is VERY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty and soft and very realistic.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this wig to anyone who wants to do a decent roxy lalonde cosplay.</li>
            <li> The fibers stay in really well and are pretty soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty thick, especially the front, which you can easily pin out of your face to look really cute.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is different is the flippies on the side are a bit more curled then in the picture</li>
            <li> For all you future RoLa cosplayers, I SUPER suggest this wig.</li>
            <li> cute and cheap, just what you need for making a Roxy cosplay on a budget, very little styling needed, and wowie, it makes you an instant cutie!</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all of you sitting at home reading reviews debating whether to get it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> (My friend wore it and it did look a little better on her)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really soft and a sweet platinum blonde</li>
            <li> I have a normal sized head</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bangs are nice and thick and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and has nice body and layers.</li>
            <li> easy to manage and styled very well, i recieved quite a few compliments on it</li>
            <li> The colour didn&#x27;t exactly match the picture, as you can see in the picture, it is a little more yellow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light blonde color (not as light as the picture though), it&#x27;s not white, but it&#x27;s not yellow like a lot of blonde wigs, either</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really sad because the hair itself is attractive and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I can see the tracks, but they dont really seem very apparent when Im</li>
            <li> its a very soft wig!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Very soft...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
            <li> almost makes me want to go blonde for real!</li>
            <li> but it got here early too!</li>
            <li> (judging by other reviews not all the wigs are the same, some are better than others i guess?)</li>
            <li> omg really it a like light blonde not a yellow blonde and</li>
            <li> I wore it without any changes and it was fine, just a little droopy in my face.</li>
            <li> The wig is super soft, not very flippy</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived SUPER fast and got here a few days before it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Like pretty much every other person, I bought this for a Roxy Lalonde cosplay.</li>
            <li> When putting it on, I accidentally straightened one of the curls, but it was easily fixed with my hands.</li>
            <li> sooo soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take a bit of styling to get it to match the picture, the flips were completely inverted all the way around, and the bangs are going to need some work</li>
            <li> It was super long (like, slightly below my shoulders) and it was totally straight!</li>
            <li> and i would seriously recommend this wig, its nice and soft plus at a con a couple people thought it was my actual hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few wigs on amazon before and they were good but fairly small.</li>
            <li> The hair is full and fluffy, but the ends need quite a bit of styling to look like the picture.</li>
            <li> Huge complaint about the colour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, supple and fairly simple to style.</li>
            <li> I just received my wig yesterday (it came almost a week earlier than the first expected arrival date).</li>
            <li> Shorter than it looks in the photo, and not very styled, but besides that it is really soft and thick so if you can style I would recommend :)</li>
            <li> It is a bit thin up top and does shed</li>
            <li> Thin on top</li>
            <li> It could have had the potential in order to be a good wig, but it was very, very thin in the back</li>
            <li> really good roxy lalonde wig, maybe a little thin where the weft shows through the hair, but</li>
            <li> It is super thick, soft, and the same colour as in the picture.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay, thanks to the other reviews getting this wig for the same reason.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great, very thick and soft, though be wary of the short back (it ends more or less with the netting).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super soft and thick!</li>
            <li> little styling required if you plan on using this specifically for Roxy (just a little trim on the bangs and a little more curl to the ends, nothing major)&lt;br /&gt;Really soft!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this for serious cosplay or daily life, but it is far above wigs you find at Halloween shops.</li>
            <li> The wig is pretty thick which was a bonus, and came in only a day after ordering it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it was slightly shorter than what is displayed in the picture, but overall it was worth the price paid!</li>
            <li> The bangs need a lot of trimming and the wig itself was a bit small and didnt cover my whole head.</li>
            <li> most of these reviews))&lt;br /&gt;Be warned: This wig is small, like I expected it to be small</li>
            <li> Mine also came with a couple curls, the rest of them being flat.</li>
            <li> There is so little hair on the wig that I can see the mesh structure clearly throughout the entire wig.</li>
            <li> It came in earlier than expected</li>
            <li> it needed minor styling</li>
            <li> As it is, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The hair was pretty high quality and incredibly thick, I had very few issues with static even though I&#x27;ve seen it through some bad wear.</li>
            <li> only problem with it is its a bit short only comeing about a inch past my hair line.</li>
            <li> Only the bangs need a little bit of styling to get her curl, but that&#x27;s kinda obvious.</li>
            <li> The wig came very flat and not very &amp;#34;flippy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Not super short but also not too long.</li>
            <li> is far too small</li>
            <li> Pin your hair with a bun and bobby pins, put a cap on(I got a nude nylon stocking cap type thing), flip it upside down and clip the back.</li>
            <li> thin, halloween store quality, no layers, EXTREMELY SHINY, hardly flips out at all, hair falls out easily.</li>
            <li> A lot shorter than expected, and a lot curlier.</li>
            <li> If I could put a minus star, I would.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little too big for me (even with adjustment)</li>
            <li> I have a relatively small head, so I had no problems with length, but for larger heads, it may be shorter.</li>
            <li> the color matches the photo although one side is straighter and the other is like marylin monroe.</li>
            <li> netting under the wig is visible (it may be due to shipping, I will try to update if it</li>
            <li> The wig also was longer on one side than the other, so I had to do a bit of trimming as well as some curling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with a big head, so it&#x27;s a bit too small on me.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it&#x27;s shorter than i expected.</li>
            <li> However, it is thick and it came a week earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Considerably shorter and a bit thin</li>
            <li> It is very soft and doesn&#x27;t lose a ton of hair when i brush it, but i was a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t curl at the ends as much as in the picture.</li>
            <li> but they got flattened down...</li>
            <li> The curls aren&#x27;t as extreme as in the picture, but it&#x27;s curly enough for me at least!</li>
            <li> (but it&#x27;s black...</li>
            <li> (but it ripped in less than five minutes)</li>
            <li> Plus it comes with a black wig cap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really high quality wig, soft, and really thick, making it impossible to see the netting beneath.</li>
            <li> I suggest you either clip up the bangs and flip out the ends or trim it a little.</li>
            <li> The bangs were a little longer that I thought, but that&#x27;s nothing a trim can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The back isn&#x27;t very thick and you can tell it&#x27;s wig.</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;t even be useful for playing dress-up on Halloween, it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> When I blow dried it, it stayed in place.</li>
            <li> and I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> - i hardly had to do any styling other than the bangs and the curl!</li>
            <li> It is already styled to have that flipped out look, and it&#x27;s not super thin, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about seeing your wig cap or anything through the wig.</li>
            <li> It seems to be heat resistant and while it&#x27;s a little tough to cut</li>
            <li> Only use wide tooth combs for this or the shedding will get bad!!</li>
            <li> Sorry for not leaving feedback.</li>
            <li> but it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the wig I received looks nothing like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> .. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything bad about this product.</li>
            <li> the worst wig ive ever bought, im extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> Its not an awful wig</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was a good quality wig, sure. The curls were nice and the hair was soft. Huge complaint about the colour. It was extremely yellow and shiny, not at all like the picture, ended up cutting the curls off and using it for my Rose cosplay, still trying to lighten it up a bit.. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> First time wig, the cap was ok, but the wig was awesome. If you wear it for Roxy Lalonde I suggest you either clip up the bangs and flip out the ends or trim it a little. I wore it without any changes and it was fine, just a little droopy in my face. The hair was pretty high quality and incredibly thick, I had very few issues with static even though I&#x27;ve seen it through some bad wear. Only use wide tooth combs for this or the shedding will get bad!! Pin your hair with a bun and bobby pins, put a cap on(I got a nude nylon stocking cap type thing), flip it upside down and clip the back. Ta da!! Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful! It came in earlier than expected and it&#x27;s super soft and thick! The curls aren&#x27;t as extreme as in the picture, but it&#x27;s curly enough for me at least! The colour didn&#x27;t exactly match the picture, as you can see in the picture, it is a little more yellow. I am a little upset about that, but honestly i&#x27;d still buy it again. It comes with a wig cap, which is great, because I lose so many of them it isn&#x27;t even funny. It came packaged nicely, with cardboard around the bag to keep the curls, well, curly. When putting it on, I accidentally straightened one of the curls, but it was easily fixed with my hands. I have a relatively small head, so I had no problems with length, but for larger heads, it may be shorter. The bangs can be styled on either side, which is great! I highly, highly, recommend this wig!  (follow me on tumblr at cottoncandycomamnder, if you want!))</li>
            <li> amazing quality ! sooo soft and it fits great. sometimes it can be easy to see the hair underneath if you dont style it right but all in all it&#x27;s my favorite wig. the color matches the photo although one side is straighter and the other is like marylin monroe. i used to for roxy lalonde and it is perfect â™¥</li>
            <li> Worked great for what I needed</li>
            <li> A lot shorter than expected, and a lot curlier. Otherwise, this wig rocks!! Its great for roxy, and its actually a very light blonde instead of yellow. I hope i can use heat on it XD but probably not so im not gonna take a risk. Very soft!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig and I can&#x27;t wait to use it for my Roxy costume</li>
            <li> Sorry for not leaving feedback. Anyways daughter loved the wig sooooo much that she wore it to school without my knowledge that is how much she liked it. Arrived way ahead of schedule. My daughter thought it was real hair ( ha ha ha ). Pleased so much that we ordered another one.</li>
            <li> i bought this wig for roxy lalonde and when i got it i was THRILLED. it&#x27;s so beautiful and i love how it spikes upwards at the end - i hardly had to do any styling other than the bangs and the curl! my only complaint is that it&#x27;s shorter than i expected. they put the measurement but i didn&#x27;t actually expect it to be that short (around my chin). still though, a GREAT wig and i would definitely recommend it to fellow roxy cosplayers.</li>
            <li> I love this wig so much. Like pretty much every other person, I bought this for a Roxy Lalonde cosplay. I love it. It flips out just right for the cannon Roxy hairstyle. The seller was wigle, and It came right on time. The wig did come with a wig cap, so that was helpful considering I&#x27;m constantly losing mine. Over all this is a great wig, for a great price at only $10.99, and I am so glad I found it because it takes my cosplay to the next level. I highly recommend it to all of you sitting at home reading reviews debating whether to get it. DO IT!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful wig, perfect for Roxy Lalonde cosplay. It styles easily and sheds rarely.</li>
            <li> This wig is great for a Roxy Lalonde cosplay it just needs to be cut alittle and some styling but the color and quility is amazing!</li>
            <li> really good roxy lalonde wig, maybe a little thin where the weft shows through the hair, but really soft and a sweet platinum blonde</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take a bit of styling to get it to match the picture, the flips were completely inverted all the way around, and the bangs are going to need some work but it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult. Other than that it&#x27;s great, very thick and soft, though be wary of the short back (it ends more or less with the netting). So yeah, overall pretty great, but if you can&#x27;t style a wig at all I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. (Using for Roxy Lalonde cosplay)</li>
            <li> Shorter than it looks in the photo, and not very styled, but besides that it is really soft and thick so if you can style I would recommend :)</li>
            <li> omg really it a like light blonde not a yellow blonde and it like the pic it would be a bit shorter when you wear because of you hair so  if you but it on a head stand it look just like the pic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont know you view how roxy hair is like but i like this color for roxy and the fidder is silk and it easy for me to style so i even bought a 2nd one for a mom cosplay</li>
            <li> It was supposed to come in on the 24th, but it came in about 3 weeks early!&lt;br /&gt;It came with a mysterious cross, wig, and wig cap with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;The wigs really well made and perfect for your Roxy Lalonde cosplay! (Which is what I bought it for).&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a bobby pin to keep the bangs up, but I don&#x27;t mind :)&lt;br /&gt;The quality is 100% perfect. Buy this if you need a wig for Roxy!</li>
            <li> Very nice wig for the price.  We were impressed with the quality and sassiness.  It didn&#x27;t require too much styling out of the bag and looked great for my daughter&#x27;s Roxy LaLonde cosplay.</li>
            <li> Awesome for Mama Lalonde, Roxy, and Rose! Very easy to style, mess it up and flip it in the back for Roxy and Mama Lalonde, and smooth it down for Rose. It will shed a bit.</li>
            <li> It shipped here like a month before it was made too. It is super thick, soft, and the same colour as in the picture. The only thing that is different is the flippies on the side are a bit more curled then in the picture but that is not a problem at all. I bought this to use for Roxy from Homestuck and it is PERFECT for her. would recommend</li>
            <li> this wig is absolutely wonderful! i purchased it for a roxy lalonde cosplay and it&#x27;s perfect. i didn&#x27;t need to style it at all. i would recommend this wig to anyone who wants to do a decent roxy lalonde cosplay.</li>
            <li> this wig is simply amazing! great price, perfect length, color and texture... sheds a little bit but not much at all. i am sooo happy i got this one. i love the ends that flip up a bit too... it&#x27;s perfect for my kisuke urahara cosplay :D this wig frames your face amazingly too! almost makes me want to go blonde for real! thank you :)</li>
            <li> this wig is absolutely beautiful and my favorite wig i own! great for Roxy Lalonde cosplay! easy to manage and styled very well, i recieved quite a few compliments on it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the wig I received looks nothing like the one in the picture. I won&#x27;t complain too much because it looks like it was meant to fit a smaller head. (My friend wore it and it did look a little better on her)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Color is perfect&lt;br /&gt;Material is nice&lt;br /&gt;Free wig cap (but it&#x27;s black...)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Very, very thin&lt;br /&gt;Far too short to work with&lt;br /&gt;Wig is far too small&lt;br /&gt;The netting under the wig is visible (it may be due to shipping, I will try to update if it helps)&lt;br /&gt;Pre-styling wasn&#x27;t very attractive</li>
            <li> The wig its self shows up early witch is great and if your looking to buy this wig for a con you could probaly gamble with the time of a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for quallty I love it. its the right color and the fibers are great i love the feel of this wig its so comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only problem with it is its a bit short only comeing about a inch past my hair line. I bought the wig for roxy and though i purfer her to have longer hair it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i reconmend this wig just beware its a bit short</li>
            <li> soft, clean, bouncy, realistic, and just amazing. such a good wig, really. i used it for my isabelle cosplay from animal crossing</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay and I was really nervous because I hadn&#x27;t bought wigs from this supplier before but not only did it come in great shape but it got here early too! It&#x27;s been a hit at cons and on facebook! I wore it to school once and quite a few people thought it was real. It&#x27;s super soft and easy to style. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The wig came before the delivery date. It fit great and did not move when I was running and jumping around.&lt;br /&gt;Great wig</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this wig! It reminds me of shaved lemon drinks U u U&lt;br /&gt;I got it for my Roxy and Mom Lalonde cosplays ((homestuck -- like most of these reviews))&lt;br /&gt;Be warned: This wig is small, like I expected it to be small but it was a lot smaller than I was expecting!&lt;br /&gt;When it is just being held/sittin on my wig head I can see the tracks, but they dont really seem very apparent when Im wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;It did shed a bit when I took it out to put it on, but Im not too bothered by that personally?&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are nice and thick and its a very soft wig!&lt;br /&gt;If the tracks showing bothers me in the future, I can just get some wefts from arda or something!</li>
            <li> Obviously I bought this wig for Roxy from Homestuck. I am extremely happy with the wig for it&#x27;s price and quality. The fibers stay in really well and are pretty soft. The wig is pretty thick which was a bonus, and came in only a day after ordering it. My only complaint was that it was slightly shorter than what is displayed in the picture, but overall it was worth the price paid!</li>
            <li> The hair is full and fluffy, but the ends need quite a bit of styling to look like the picture. I&#x27;m using this for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay, and it&#x27;s the perfect color and length.</li>
            <li> Pretty great wig, not to small for someone with a bigger head</li>
            <li> My daughter used this wig for a Roxy Lalonde cosplay, and she said it was perfect.</li>
            <li> It could have had the potential in order to be a good wig, but it was very, very thin in the back and it sheds like crazy. I would sincerely suggest saving your money and buying a different wig.</li>
            <li> Though it was soft and did not tangle easily, it wasnt as full as the picture had shown and definitely was not as curly. The bangs need a lot of trimming and the wig itself was a bit small and didnt cover my whole head. I have a normal sized head but i do have a lot of hair that might be part of the problem.  It is a bit thin up top and does shed but then again its fresh out of the package. Its not an awful wig but i regret getting it and it will need a lot of styling. (judging by other reviews not all the wigs are the same, some are better than others i guess?)</li>
            <li> thin, halloween store quality, no layers, EXTREMELY SHINY, hardly flips out at all, hair falls out easily. the worst wig ive ever bought, im extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> The wig is perfect for Roxy lalonde cosplayers! The wig looks incredibly accurate to the picture (the coloring may be off by just a tad) and the flips in the wig are really great! The bangs were a little longer that I thought, but that&#x27;s nothing a trim can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay! Shipped and arrived SUPER fast and got here a few days before it was supposed to. For all you future RoLa cosplayers, I SUPER suggest this wig. Only the bangs need a little bit of styling to get her curl, but that&#x27;s kinda obvious.</li>
            <li> good quality, fit well, has low heat resistance, styled well, and came with a wig cap</li>
            <li> The wig itself was good quality but it was very then the the point where I had to style the wig in order to keep the wig cap from showing</li>
            <li> Love this wig.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and looks great.  I use this wigs for cosplaying and it looks great in pictures as well.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous wig! It&#x27;s soft, supple and fairly simple to style. It seems to be heat resistant and while it&#x27;s a little tough to cut once it is cut/styled it holds the styling well. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little too big for me (even with adjustment) but I am used to that :)</li>
            <li> I loved it,  soft and affordable. Just one side needs to be more curled.</li>
            <li> Daughter Loves it, perfect color and length.</li>
            <li> Awesome wig for the money. Had so much fun with it. Hair is soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture. Considerably shorter and a bit thin but the overall texture is nice. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The wig came very flat and not very &amp;#34;flippy&amp;#34;. As you can see in my photo, the wig needs quite a bit of styling to look like the picture. However, it is thick and it came a week earlier than expected. I have trouble finding wigs that fit me because I have so much hair, but this one is surprisingly roomy. It also came with a wig cap! (but it ripped in less than five minutes) The wig also was longer on one side than the other, so I had to do a bit of trimming as well as some curling.</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay! It&#x27;s a really high quality wig, soft, and really thick, making it impossible to see the netting beneath. It also came styled as shown in the images! Essentially, it was amazing and I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an &#x27;alright&#x27; wig. It&#x27;s more white in person, and sheds a bit. The back isn&#x27;t very thick and you can tell it&#x27;s wig. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this for serious cosplay or daily life, but it is far above wigs you find at Halloween shops.</li>
            <li> This Wig is perfect for cosplay. Right now I&#x27;m using it for my Roxy Lalonde Cosplay for Homestuck. I really Love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for Roxy Lalonde. It&#x27;s very great in quality and color and it looks like it does on the picture. The only thing that wasn&#x27;t great about it was the way the sides flip up and they end, but that could easily be fixed with styling.</li>
            <li> it needed minor styling but i think it works well for Roxy Lalonde !</li>
            <li> It is very soft and doesn&#x27;t lose a ton of hair when i brush it, but i was a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t curl at the ends as much as in the picture.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:88043ebcdc266d00743c63cbf881c922]]This wig is amazing. It&#x27;s thick and has nice body and layers. It is however a little shorter than I thought, but it is amazing regardless. It&#x27;s cute with and without hats.</li>
            <li> If you want to cosplay Roxy Lalonde, this is the wig you need. It styles really easily to make her hair curl. It&#x27;s comfortable, bouncy, and all-around good looking.</li>
            <li> I ordered this around Christmas Eve and I got it January 2nd, even though they said the earliest it would arrive is like January 21st or something...so shipping is pretty great for coming from China. I got this for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay, thanks to the other reviews getting this wig for the same reason. I think it would be fair enough to say this wig could also work for a female version of America from Hetalia. It&#x27;s somewhat lighter than the picture provided and I&#x27;ll try to post a pic so you can see it. Very soft...I just need to figure out how on earth I&#x27;m gonna style it without melting the hair. Nice wig. Would recommend a purchase.</li>
            <li> i ordered this wig 15 days before i got it!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and it was perfect! One minor problem was the flips were not as flippy was the ones on the other side so with some styling and clips, it should come out perfect!</li>
            <li> I loved this wig!&lt;br /&gt;I straightened it though, because the flips aggravated me too much,&lt;br /&gt;so I&#x27;m going to re-curl myself. Using this for Roxy Lalonde.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my Roxy Lalonde cosplay and it is absolutely perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also got here only one week after I bought it!</li>
            <li> Super layered. got it for roxy and i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s Roxy Lalonde cosplay, and it worked out well. Definitely good for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for Homestuck Roxy cosplay and it was fantastic! A great price for a good wig. My friend loved it too and it fit both of us fine, plus it looked great, too. It was just an overall good product!</li>
            <li> cute and cheap, just what you need for making a Roxy cosplay on a budget, very little styling needed, and wowie, it makes you an instant cutie! added pictures because i look just amazing in this wig!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and full. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I used this for Tiny Tina from borderlands 2. Omg I love this wig! It fits well, extremely easy to style, and it worked great when I put paint on it for the cel shading. When I blow dried it, it stayed in place. It&#x27;s a great wig, and even for the price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just received my wig yesterday (it came almost a week earlier than the first expected arrival date). Like most people, I got it for a Roxy Lalonde cosplay. I absolutely LOVE it. It&#x27;s so pretty and soft and very realistic. It&#x27;s the perfect length for Roxy, too. Not super short but also not too long. It is already styled to have that flipped out look, and it&#x27;s not super thin, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about seeing your wig cap or anything through the wig. It&#x27;s actually pretty thick, especially the front, which you can easily pin out of your face to look really cute. It&#x27;s a light blonde color (not as light as the picture though), it&#x27;s not white, but it&#x27;s not yellow like a lot of blonde wigs, either, it&#x27;s very natural looking. It also fits perfectly. I&#x27;ve bought a few wigs on amazon before and they were good but fairly small. This one isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a perfect size. If you&#x27;re looking to cosplay Roxy/Mama Lalonde, this wig is PERFECT. You could probably even straighten it to use for Rose Lalonde, too. All in all, this wig is amazing and I would definitely recommend. Plus it comes with a black wig cap. I can&#x27;t think of anything bad about this product. Ordered from Cool2DayInc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I bought this wig again for a friend, this time from Kadiya, and it was great for Roxy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2: I bought this wig again from ProHome and I was super disappointed. The color is like a platinum blonde (which I loved), but the wig style looks NOTHING like the picture. It was super long (like, slightly below my shoulders) and it was totally straight! There was maybe one or two tiny curls but they got flattened down...I don&#x27;t even know what to do with the wig. I tried contacting the seller and they never responded to me. This is a very good wig, just DONT order it from ProHome. Order from Kadiya or Cool2Day or someone else.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing! I bought it for Roxy Lalonde, had some issues with shipping but customer service was absolutely brilliant! The wig is super soft, not very flippy but I was planning to style it myself anyway. Easy to style and the layers are amazing. Love this wig and everything about it</li>
            <li> Thin on top but I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great price for wonderful quality.&lt;br /&gt;My estimated shipping arrival was on the 26th of the month, and I received it on the 9th, which is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good wig to start with, I&#x27;m using it for a cosplay (Roxy Lalonde, Homestuck), and it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;A little styling required if you plan on using this specifically for Roxy (just a little trim on the bangs and a little more curl to the ends, nothing major)&lt;br /&gt;Really soft!</li>
            <li> If I could put a minus star, I would. There is so little hair on the wig that I can see the mesh structure clearly throughout the entire wig. That&#x27;s really sad because the hair itself is attractive and natural looking. If there was twice the amount of hair, this would be a really nice wig. As it is, it was a complete waste of money. It would&#x27;t even be useful for playing dress-up on Halloween, it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> used this for my roxy and rose cosplay and i would seriously recommend this wig, its nice and soft plus at a con a couple people thought it was my actual hair.</li>
            <li> The wig is VERY. Short. Mine also came with a couple curls, the rest of them being flat. Tried curling it myself, but none of the curls held. I&#x27;ve now just cut what remaining like 2 curls/flips were on it and used it for another character.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with a big head, so it&#x27;s a bit too small on me. But it looks amazing from the front! Great for Roxy Lalonde cosplay photoshoots!</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture!</li>
